7565,the concentration of atmospheric tracers in groundwater samples collected from springs and deep wells is in most cases the result of a mixture of waters with a wide range of residence times in the ground such is the case of an unconfined aquifer recharged over all its surface area concentrations greatly differ from the homogeneous residence time case data interpretation relies on knowledge of the groundwater flow pattern to study relatively large systems the conservative ion chloride and the decaying radiocarbon 14c are considered radiocarbon 14c activity in groundwater after correction to discount the non biogenic contribution is often taken as an indication of water age while chloride can be used to quantify recharge in both cases the observed tracer content in groundwater is an average value over a wide range which is related to water renewal time in the ground this is shown considering an unconfined aquifer recharged all over its area under arid conditions in which a period of greater recharge happened some millennia ago the mathematical solution is given as the solution cannot be made general to show and discuss the changes in water reserve and in chloride and radiocarbon concentration apparent ages two scenarios are worked out which are loosely related to current conditions in northern chile it is shown that tracer concentration and the estimated water age are not directly related to the time since recharge took place the existence of a previous wetter than present period has an important and lasting effect on current aquifer water reserves and chloride concentration although the effect on radiocarbon activity is less pronounced chloride concentrations are smaller than in current recharge and apparent 14c ages do not coincide with the timing duration and characteristics of the wet period except in the case in which recharge before and after the wet period is negligible and dead aquifer reserves are non significant the use of chloride concentration in springs as a proxy of chloride concentration in recharge to estimate recharge from atmospheric deposition leads to recharge value larger than the real one and it approaches the wet period recharge drawing inferences about radiocarbon data and recharge by the chloride balance method has rarely been taken into account before it is important to consider the variable aquifer groundwater reserve current recharge estimation can be improved by careful selection of groundwater samples supported by tritium and radiocarbon measurements keywords environmental tracer aquifer recharge radiocarbon chloride groundwater age arid zone 1 introduction aquifer recharge is a complex result of precipitation climate conditions and soil characteristics complexity increases in arid areas where diffuse recharge may be almost nil except after occasional intense rainfall storms of decadal to centennial frequency and due to mountain block transfer this recharge is able to sustain small perennial springs in large low permeability formations containing long renewal time groundwater reserves in aquifers and aquitards including slowly draining perched aquifers inside the generally thick unsaturated zone and the high relief areas at millennial scale recharge conditions have often changed following the sequence of arid and hyper arid dry and not so arid wet periods due to climate variability current springs and relatively high water tables may be a remnant of previous wetter than present periods which dwindle slowly herrera and custodio 2014a b this dwindling may be unnoticed during a human life span but not historically when old documents archeological data and chrono stratigraphic records of paleo wetland deposits data are available they allow to know how spring flow has changed over time the effect of previous wetter than present periods may be also reflected in chloride content in outflowing groundwater which is smaller than in current average recharge and also in modified radiocarbon content in total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic the use of atmospheric chloride deposition is a well known method to evaluate average long term recharge eriksson and khunakasen 1969 sukhija et al 1988 wood 1999 alcalá and custodio 2015 although corrections have to be applied when estimating recharge in sloping aquifers by using spring flow and water samples pumped from deep wells as a proxy of chloride content in recharge custodio and jódar 2016 however in arid areas with memory from past wet events observed groundwater chloride contents would yield too large current recharge rates the application of radiocarbon 14c to determine recharge is also a well known method clark and fritz 1997 cook and herczeg 2000 mazor 2004 mccallum et al 2017 especially in cases in which groundwater renewal time takes from centuries to millennia 14c half life is t 5430 years equivalent to a decay constant of λ ln2 t 1 21 10 4 yr 1 since only a part of total inorganic dissolved carbon tdic in groundwater may be of biogenic origin or from the atmosphere in bare soils corrections are needed to determine how much of the initial activity remains after some time fritz and fontes 1986 mook 2002 han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 the 14c activity of tdic in the moment of generation a o is calculated and this value is compared to the actual measured activity a to give an age t 1 λ ln a o a as the water sample is actually a mixture of waters with different transit times ages this is really an apparent age jones et al 2006 fiori and russo 2008 maxwell et al 2009 engdahl and maxwell 2015 in arid areas where current recharge is considered nil it is often assumed that the apparent water age is the time since a previous wet period this is a risky assumption that has to be carefully discussed according to the aquifer conceptual flow model taking into account that the sampled water is actually in most cases a mixture of a wide range of ages transit times similar considerations were presented for perennial stream networks by mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 and mcdonnell et al 2010 in relatively large mountain range areas under arid conditions and with very low permeability where groundwater flows through thick formations a wetter than present period producing a large recharge is revealed through a noticeable groundwater reserve augmentation in the case of exponential reserve depletion time of a few millennia the increased groundwater reserves may last millennia and feed springs during a long arid period after the wet one this paper is a contribution to the understanding of the effect on groundwater reserve and chloride and radiocarbon content that a wetter than present period with enhanced recharge has on data collected from springs in arid lands in the case of a water table unconfined aquifer this is inspired in a mountain range case under hyper arid conditions where aquifer recharge is very sensitive to variable climate conditions during the past millennia to quantify the results a very simplified and generalized setting is worked out in which recharge is homogeneously produced all over the aquifer surface and subjected to a millennial long wet period between two long dry periods this setting allows obtaining an equation that can be solved with readily available numerical methods real cases may differ from these simplifications but results allow addressing the problem of uncertainty of corrected radiocarbon and chloride data in a hydrogeologically realistic framework as results cannot be made independent of recharge and aquifer characteristics two general scenarios have been created which are loosely based on actual studies being carried out in the hyper arid desert of northern chile and on authors observations in the arid southern areas in the canary islands however this paper is not a case study but an abstraction and generalization inspired in real cases the objective is to get results that can be applied to a variety of circumstances the effect of variations in recharge rate along time on inferred water age has been investigated by massoudieh 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2015 and engdahl et al 2016 nevertheless the related chloride and radiocarbon content changes in recharge for aquifers located in arid areas have rarely been considered before this is the main subject of this work a first approach was presented in custodio and custodio ayala 2014 although the solutions in this paper were only qualitative as the closed form mathematical solution was not accurate enough all over the range values of interest 2 groundwater mixing in samples exponential flow aquifers the mathematical treatment of the inflow outflow of constant or time variable tracer concentration in an aquifer relies on simplified conceptual groundwater flow models using lumped parameters which apply diverse transfer functions to uniformly recharged aquifers zuber 1986 małoszewski and zuber 1982 1996 a recent synthesis of the mathematical treatment and updated references can be found in jódar et al 2014 the relationship between groundwater age and age dating has been considered by bethke and johnson 2008 the case of linearly varying recharge in unconfined sloping aquifers is developed in custodio and jódar 2016 under non dispersive and homogeneous conditions for a confined aquifer in which recharge is only produced in a localized area up flow or for in transit recharge percolation through the unsaturated zone the piston plug flow model with similar flow paths is a reasonable approach this model is tacitly assumed when corrected apparent radiocarbon age is equated to groundwater age the piston flow does not represent the real behavior of groundwater in many common circumstances of high dispersion or distributed recharge over a large area water samples from regional springs or from deeply penetrating long screened wells are often a mixture of waters from different flow lines over a wide range or transit times the apparent groundwater age t t may greatly differ from the average renewal time of water in the aquifer τ t defined as τ v r being v l the water depth in the system reserve and r lt 1 the recharge in a pure piston flow aquifer without geochemical effects on radiocarbon content with no mixing during sampling t will vary according to the sampling point by increasing its value down gradient from the recharge zone along the flow path both t and τ will always yield the actual residence time at a point in the aquifer when all flow lines have the same flow time then t is equal to τ at the aquifer s discharge point otherwise τ will only equal t for a flow line corresponding to the average residence time most discharge points would have either shorter or longer residence times than τ in a completely mixed aquifer the actual residence time would be equal to τ everywhere but t would be smaller than τ because mixing is linear and radioactive decay is nonlinear this is not a consequence of mixing in the aquifer or during sampling but rather a general characteristic of advective dispersive transport to find how t and τ are related the aquifer transfer function converting recharge into discharge has to be known which depends on the unsaturated and saturated zone characteristics in the real world the transfer function cannot be determined by means of experiments so hypotheses have to be formulated according to the conceptual model of aquifer flow and the observed hydrological system behavior turnadge and smerdon 2014 the selected models can be checked to some extent when repeated sampling is done at long enough time intervals to measure the variability of a number of different tracers nevertheless this possibility neither holds for radiocarbon due to the long half life nor for slowly variable input tracers in large aquifers in these cases the model cannot be directly checked for a homogeneous aquifer recharged over its whole area water taken from a main spring or pumped from a fully screened deep well is a mixture of various residence time waters the piston flow model is inappropriate for this situation alternative models such as exponential mixing the transfer function involves an exponential function or complete mixing represent end members of aquifer behavior that are useful to characterize residence times in this situation for constant groundwater reserve the exponential flow model coincides mathematically with the well mixed reservoir model a demonstration can be found in custodio and jódar 2016 actually the mixing is not produced inside the aquifer but during outflow or sample collection the exponential model is a simple idealized one which has been often used to interpret tritium content maloszewski et al 1983 zuber et al 2001 baudron et al 2013 åkesson et al 2015 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 among others but rarely applied in practice to radiocarbon data baudron et al 2013 hereinafter the unsaturated zone will be ignored to obtain workable solutions since a thin unsaturated zone is often an unrealistic condition in arid mountainous areas the following results are only an approach to show relevant facts under variable recharge conditions with time 3 mathematical treatment 3 1 starting hypothesis to develop a simplified mathematical treatment of the problem outlined above an unconfined aquifer is chosen which is recharged all over its surface in an arid climate affected by a wetter than present period intercalated some millennia ago and assuming homogeneous properties the system is represented by a well mixed reservoir fig 1 subjected to the following conditions 1 exponential emptying of a dynamic groundwater depth v d l above the outflow point altitude given by 1 q α v v where v l is the dead groundwater reserve below the outflow altitude v l is the total groundwater depth obtained as the sum of the aquifer dead v and dynamic v d depths and α t 1 is the recession depletion coefficient that depends on aquifer characteristics dead depth reserve refers to water below the outflow point elevation and dynamic depth reserve is that one above that point after rorabaugh 1963 α can be evaluated as 2 α π 2 t 4 l 2 s where t l2 t 1 is the transmissivity s the storage coefficient and l l is the distance from divide or no flow boundary to the river or the sea in an elongated aquifer this assumption corresponds to the linear model of maillet 1905 in theory it only holds when dead depth is much smaller than total depth but it will be kept to obtain simple analytical solutions the linear model is commonly used in many mathematical approaches coutagne 1948 tallaksen 1995 chapman 1999 or a combination of linear models pulido velázquez et al 2005 pulido velazquez et al 2007 although other relationships are also used wittemberg 1999 fenicia et al 2006 2 water sample representing the mixing of all flow lines in the moment of sampling this can be represented by the total mixing depth v which is larger than the dynamic one vd as it includes the dead depth in which groundwater also flows it is assumed that recharge is rapidly transferred from the land surface to the saturated zone so the transit time through the unsaturated zone can be ignored this may be a major restriction in some real cases fiori and russo 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2015 but it allows an easy mathematical treatment this restriction is significant for chloride which moves down through the unsaturated zone approaching the piston flow model but may be less significant for radiocarbon due to the easier downward diffusion of co2 in the soil gas phase weeks et al 1982 walvoord et al 2005 the objective is to calculate the sequence formed by a long dry period until steady state wet period dry period as in fig 2 where both the behavior of a stable non reactive environmental chemical tracer and of a radioactive environmental tracer are approximately depicted 3 2 general balance of groundwater and solute under the above assumptions the water and solute tracer mass balance equations are given by 3 v r α v v 4 c rc r v q v λ v v c where the point over the variable stands for the temporal derivative of such variable r lt 1 is recharge λ t 1 is the radioactive decay constant of the environmental tracer being λ 0 in the case of a stable tracer as chloride c ml 3 is tracer concentration in the groundwater sample coinciding with concentration in the equivalent well mixed reservoir and cr ml 3 is tracer concentration in recharge these variables refer to the whole aquifer so they are lumped values in terms of aquifer recharge the problem presents three different stages fig 2 1 for t ta steady state recharge r 0 with a tracer content of c r 0 corresponding to a very long previous dry period for convenience ta 0 2 for ta t tb wet period of constant recharge r1 with a corresponding tracer content c r 1 3 for tb t period drier than the previous one with r2 and c r 2 as recharge rate and recharge tracer content respectively present time is tc in the case of the first steady state period the solution to eqs 3 and 4 is given by 5 v 0 v v 0 v r 0 α 6 c 0 c c r 0 1 λ v 0 r 0 eq 3 can be analytically integrated taking into account the recharge conditions that apply to the above defined periods 7 v v 1 α r 2 r 0 r 1 e α t r 1 r 2 e α t t b eq 4 formally depends on eq 3 and cannot be analytically solved the approximate solution given in custodio and custodio ayala 2014 is only valid for small renewal time systems eq 4 can be numerically integrated by using the runge kutta method press et al 1992 brankin et al 1991 to obtain the solution c t for the whole simulation period from ta to tc see fig 2 in the supplementary material of the manuscript a fortran code is included to jointly solve eqs 3 and 4 for any number of recharge periods with their corresponding time length and tracer content in recharge 4 illustrative synthetic scenarios in an arid area 4 1 setting up the scenarios eq 7 depends on a series of dimensional parameters that are case dependent and cannot be reduced by using dimensionless parameters so different scenarios have to be prepared to show the relevant results trying to mimic actual cases of interest the objective variables are chloride content λ 0 derived from atmospheric deposition and radiocarbon activity λ 1 21 10 4 yr 1 the two selected scenarios are inspired in the coastal springs of the cordillera de la costa coastal range in the vicinity of antofagasta in the hyper arid region of the atacama desert in northern chile the very small regional recharge is currently due to sporadic events salas et al 2016 although in past wetter than current periods some diffuse recharge could also occur the aquifer is made of low permeability geological formations so a small average recharge rate is able to create a relatively high groundwater body sustaining low flow springs the area is described in herrera and custodio 2014a b the most salient hydrological conditions are given below as background information from which the parameters for the two scenarios that are later chosen the area consists of a 10 km wide coastal range from the discharge boundary to the groundwater divide made of rock with hydraulic conductivity k ranging from 10 3 to 10 4 m d in the upper few hundred meters saturated zone with transmissivities t ranging from 10 1 to 2 10 3 m2 d some strips affected by tectonics across the range may have k and t values ranging from 10 2 to 10 3 m d and from 0 1 to 1 m2 d respectively groundwater discharge flows to the coastal strip are about 0 06 hm3 yr along 200 km or about 0 3 m2 d m3 m d which can be up to 2 m2 d in parts affected by tectonics current long term average recharge is less than 0 1 mm yr produced by a long term average precipitation that does not exceed 10 mm y paleoclimate studies point to the existence of a less arid wet period between 5000 and 3000 yr ago as in most arid environments a small precipitation increase may greatly increase recharge the chosen scenarios have in common a wetter than present precipitation period between 7000 yr and 5000 yr ago see fig 2 assumed as a sharply defined period in the climate sequence this period is somewhat older than in the reference case to highlight the effect of past events two different cases are considered see table 1 hyper arid conditions where r0 0 1 mm yr r1 1 mm yr between 5000 and 7000 yr ago i e δt tb ta 2000 years and r2 0 1 mm yr arid conditions where r0 1 mm y r1 10 mm yr between 5000 and 7000 yr ago i e δt tb ta 2000 years and r2 1 mm yr in the figures only the time period between 7000 yr ago t ta 0 and today t tc 7000 yr is shown extended by a short previous time span with constant values steady state and equal to those existing before 7000 years ago table 1 shows the periods and the assumed 14c and cl values in each of them as explained in the corresponding subsections the range of α values agrees with the given hydraulic parameters and size of the area the dead groundwater reserve is 1 m for a porosity of 0 01 this is equivalent to a 100 m saturated thickness below the outflow boundary the aquifer width from the outflow boundary to the groundwater divide or inner boundary is really not needed as it is embedded in the value of the recession constant α which has also embedded the aquifer hydraulic properties when needed time is given in kyr thousands of years 4 2 groundwater reserve depth evolution fig 3 shows the variation in aquifer reserve depth vs time from t 0 until present t 7000 yr taking as parameter the exponential depletion time 1 α for a dead groundwater reserve of 1 m what exceeds this value is dynamic reserve depth at the end of the wet period the steady state is not yet attained in the hyper arid a case current dynamic reserve depth is small relative to the dead reserve for 1 α 500 yr but it is 1 m for 1 α 5000 yr in a low specific yield rock this implies a noticeable increase of the water table elevation above the altitude of discharge the dynamic depth reaches 20 m for 1 α 5000 yr for 1 α 1500 yr quite a large dynamic reserve remains at present time the close to linear evolution is the result of the accumulation of recharge in the wet period for high 1 α slow drainage rate recharge is mainly put into storage in the hyper arid case but part of it has been already discharged in the arid case conditions at t 0 and before show that the dynamic reserve may be quite important with respect to dead reserve thus sustaining small springs where the surface intersects the water table fig 4 shows the aquifer storage depth reserve vs 1 α there is a noticeable increase of reserves at the end of the wet period partly persisting until present for 1 α 2000 yr 4 3 consideration of radiocarbon it is assumed that the 14c activity in recharge does not depend on recharge rate but on the concentration in soil co2 whose average value is assumed constant in a given period of time thus 14c activity in recharge water assumed to reach soon the saturated zone does not change with climate conditions this is a restrictive condition but not far away from reality as 14c activity in biologically derived co2 is close to that in atmospheric co2 when presenting the values and results 14c activity is normalized to 1 100 pmc percent modern carbon fig 5 shows the evolution of 14c concentration with respect to recharge in case a hyper arid the starting state values vary from 0 45 to 0 35 apparent ages of 6600 and 8700 yr respectively for 1 α increasing from 500 to 5000 yr in case b arid the starting state values vary from 0 85 to 0 60 apparent ages of 1400 and 4200 yr respectively for 1 α increasing from 500 to 5000 yr during the wet period 14c increases water is apparently younger due to the larger proportion of recent water 14c content in groundwater attains the steady state under arid conditions but not under the hyper arid conditions at present time 14c is still younger than it was under the old hyper arid conditions about 0 1 higher about 2000 yr younger but it approaches the initial values under dry conditions fig 6 shows 14c concentration vs 1 α there is a noticeable increase of 14c concentration at the end of the wet period that still persists today groundwater appears to be younger than in the starting steady state conditions for any 1 α value to show the influence of the dead reserve v on the 14c content in groundwater its evolution is presented in fig 7 for an aquifer with 1 α 2000 yr the curve for v 1 m corresponds to the cases depicted in figs 3 6 small values of 1 α imply a noticeable 14c increase and consequently a younger apparent age for large 1 α values after a progressive 14c increase during the wet period the radiocarbon content decreases slowly afterwards fig 8 shows the 14c content vs the aquifer dead depth v for different times initial end of wet period and present period stage time for arid conditions the effect of v on 14c content is small but quite noticeable under hyper arid conditions with increased apparent ages 4 4 consideration of atmospheric chloride deposition it is assumed that the only source of cl is atmospheric deposition and that this deposition rate in a given place did not significantly change in the past although it is spatially variable wang et al 2014 this steady state assumption implies that most of the deposition is as dry deposition which is reasonable in arid areas herrera and custodio 2014a b and references therein it is also assumed that contributed cl is incorporated into recharge so there is no net salt accumulation in the soil and its concentration decreases as climate becomes wetter this is an important difference compared to 14c activity the equations are solved for λ 0 fig 9 shows the evolution of cl concentration in groundwater there is a clear reduction in cl concentration at the end of the wet period even down to one order of magnitude lower 1 10 than the initial steady state value which is the inverse of precipitation increase factor in the hyper arid case the ratio is about 1 3 still highly significant in the current situation there is still a clear decrease in cl content due to the wet period except for fast renewal time in the arid case for slow renewal aquifers under dry conditions total recovery may need millennia under hyper arid conditions 4 5 results from an ancient wet period the above presented synthetic results for 5000 yr after the wet event show that the steady state is not attained after the wet event but for small values of 1 α results are far from the steady state in the case of chloride to see when steady state is reached an extension to a 70 kyr dry period is presented fig 10 shows the evolution after 70 kyr from the start of the wet period the effect of a previous wet period in radiocarbon activity fig 10a and aquifer reserves fig 10b dwindles in about 10 millennia but for chloride it lasts longer fig 10c the radiocarbon activity in groundwater and the aquifer reserves can be expressed in terms of the apparent radiocarbon age tapp 1 λ ln a o a and the instantaneous residence time τ v r see section 2 which are time variable as the reserve v depends on time the evolution along 70 kyr is presented in fig 11 the behavior presents different stages during the wet part of the period tapp and τ decrease sharply due to the enhanced recharge which produces a large accumulation of recent groundwater reserves after ceasing the wet part of the period recharge r sharply decreases so tapp jumps up and τ increases progressively as water in the reserve becomes older the decrease of aquifer discharge and reserves reduces τ when the reserve contains a large proportion of the current small recent recharge finally the initial steady state values are reproduced in about two to three decades after present 7 kyr for the long recession time conditions the practical consequence is that the effect of a wetter than present period a few millennia ago persists at present time in the case of slowly draining aquifers in mountainous conditions comparing with the no wet period scenario the groundwater reserves and the corresponding water table elevations are higher and the apparent radiocarbon age is increased this last effect is paradoxical 5 discussion and conclusions when groundwater reserve variations are taken into account as it is done in section 3 more realistic and accurate concentration changes are obtained this is an improvement over other calculations found in the literature the radiocarbon content in tdic of spring water increases after the wet period relative to the long term steady value under arid conditions thus younger apparent ages are obtained this suggests the existence of the previous wet period when the steady state content is known or it can be calculated nevertheless this assumption may be difficult to check in the presented scenarios of a wet period between 7000 and 5000 years ago for a groundwater reserve depth recession parameter between 500 and 5000 years for hyper arid conditions when old and present recharge rate is almost negligible the apparent 14c ages vary between 6600 and 8700 years these values fall close to the wet period timing however under less arid conditions when old and present recharge rate is not negligible the apparent ages vary between 1400 and 4200 years quite younger than the wet period this means that only when old and present recharge rate is nil or non significant apparent 14c age approaches the timing of a past wet period the difference between apparent 14c age and the timing of a previous wet period increases as the dead reserve becomes larger in mountainous areas where groundwater flow is restricted to the upper weathered and fractured zone which is mostly above the outflow altitude the dead depth can be neglected so there is a close coincidence of ages but this is not the case in low relief areas where the flow system extends deeper than the outflow altitude this highlights the importance of a sound groundwater flow conceptual model for the correct interpretation of radiocarbon apparent ages in the cordillera de la costa near antofagasta in northern chile herrera and custodio 2014a herrera et al 2017 and in fuerteventura island central massif herrera and custodio 2014b there is probably a small dead reserve but certainly not in the arid south eastern phonolitic massif of amurga gran canaria island gasparini et al 1990 custodio ayala and custodio 2001 the water reserve in the saturated zone of an unconfined aquifer is the effective saturated thickness multiplied by rock porosity when as the result of a period with larger recharge the water table goes up it saturates part of the previous unsaturated zone and mixes with water hold by capillarity this water may be a large fraction of total porosity and may have a quite different renewal time age this situation has not been taken into account for the sake of simplicity cl concentration in recharge due to atmospheric chloride deposition may be quite high under arid conditions a wet period may produce less saline recharge this effect may last millennia so current spring water has a lower cl concentration than present recharge in the current hyper arid period nevertheless the expected steady state cl concentration is indeed unknown using present spring cl content as a proxy of long term recharge estimation by means of the atmospheric chloride mass balance might overestimate recharge as the cl concentration would be close to that in the past wet period instead of under the current hyper arid conditions as chloride is stable and conservative the transit time through the unsaturated zone delays the arrival to the saturated zone and magnifies the effect of past wetter periods in the case of very thick unsaturated zones the solute could be still moving down not yet reaching the saturated zone so the chloride content in spring water could be the result of a mixture of recharge from older events if they correspond to dry conditions the evaluated recharge is neither the current one nor that corresponding to the wet period the understanding of real circumstances needs the knowledge of the vertical distribution of chloride concentration in the unsaturated zone however results from borehole samples are rarely available a main conclusion is that radiocarbon apparent age only approaches the wet period age when dead reserves those below the groundwater outflow altitude are negligible and current recharge is at least one order of magnitude less than recharge during the past wet period a second main conclusion is that the use of groundwater chloride content to estimate recharge even if the slope effect is taken into account custodio and jódar 2016 may yield overestimations to try to avoid this groundwater samples have to be chosen to represent actual recharge according to a sound hydrogeological conceptual model supported by tritium and radiocarbon measurements circumstances of only local significance should be avoided such as places with persistent fog condensation due to special relief features or concentrated recharge during occasional intense rain events or snow melt often perched aquifers even non permanent ones may be good sampling places if they correspond to general circumstances acknowledgements this research was

7565,the concentration of atmospheric tracers in groundwater samples collected from springs and deep wells is in most cases the result of a mixture of waters with a wide range of residence times in the ground such is the case of an unconfined aquifer recharged over all its surface area concentrations greatly differ from the homogeneous residence time case data interpretation relies on knowledge of the groundwater flow pattern to study relatively large systems the conservative ion chloride and the decaying radiocarbon 14c are considered radiocarbon 14c activity in groundwater after correction to discount the non biogenic contribution is often taken as an indication of water age while chloride can be used to quantify recharge in both cases the observed tracer content in groundwater is an average value over a wide range which is related to water renewal time in the ground this is shown considering an unconfined aquifer recharged all over its area under arid conditions in which a period of greater recharge happened some millennia ago the mathematical solution is given as the solution cannot be made general to show and discuss the changes in water reserve and in chloride and radiocarbon concentration apparent ages two scenarios are worked out which are loosely related to current conditions in northern chile it is shown that tracer concentration and the estimated water age are not directly related to the time since recharge took place the existence of a previous wetter than present period has an important and lasting effect on current aquifer water reserves and chloride concentration although the effect on radiocarbon activity is less pronounced chloride concentrations are smaller than in current recharge and apparent 14c ages do not coincide with the timing duration and characteristics of the wet period except in the case in which recharge before and after the wet period is negligible and dead aquifer reserves are non significant the use of chloride concentration in springs as a proxy of chloride concentration in recharge to estimate recharge from atmospheric deposition leads to recharge value larger than the real one and it approaches the wet period recharge drawing inferences about radiocarbon data and recharge by the chloride balance method has rarely been taken into account before it is important to consider the variable aquifer groundwater reserve current recharge estimation can be improved by careful selection of groundwater samples supported by tritium and radiocarbon measurements keywords environmental tracer aquifer recharge radiocarbon chloride groundwater age arid zone 1 introduction aquifer recharge is a complex result of precipitation climate conditions and soil characteristics complexity increases in arid areas where diffuse recharge may be almost nil except after occasional intense rainfall storms of decadal to centennial frequency and due to mountain block transfer this recharge is able to sustain small perennial springs in large low permeability formations containing long renewal time groundwater reserves in aquifers and aquitards including slowly draining perched aquifers inside the generally thick unsaturated zone and the high relief areas at millennial scale recharge conditions have often changed following the sequence of arid and hyper arid dry and not so arid wet periods due to climate variability current springs and relatively high water tables may be a remnant of previous wetter than present periods which dwindle slowly herrera and custodio 2014a b this dwindling may be unnoticed during a human life span but not historically when old documents archeological data and chrono stratigraphic records of paleo wetland deposits data are available they allow to know how spring flow has changed over time the effect of previous wetter than present periods may be also reflected in chloride content in outflowing groundwater which is smaller than in current average recharge and also in modified radiocarbon content in total dissolved inorganic carbon tdic the use of atmospheric chloride deposition is a well known method to evaluate average long term recharge eriksson and khunakasen 1969 sukhija et al 1988 wood 1999 alcalá and custodio 2015 although corrections have to be applied when estimating recharge in sloping aquifers by using spring flow and water samples pumped from deep wells as a proxy of chloride content in recharge custodio and jódar 2016 however in arid areas with memory from past wet events observed groundwater chloride contents would yield too large current recharge rates the application of radiocarbon 14c to determine recharge is also a well known method clark and fritz 1997 cook and herczeg 2000 mazor 2004 mccallum et al 2017 especially in cases in which groundwater renewal time takes from centuries to millennia 14c half life is t 5430 years equivalent to a decay constant of λ ln2 t 1 21 10 4 yr 1 since only a part of total inorganic dissolved carbon tdic in groundwater may be of biogenic origin or from the atmosphere in bare soils corrections are needed to determine how much of the initial activity remains after some time fritz and fontes 1986 mook 2002 han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 the 14c activity of tdic in the moment of generation a o is calculated and this value is compared to the actual measured activity a to give an age t 1 λ ln a o a as the water sample is actually a mixture of waters with different transit times ages this is really an apparent age jones et al 2006 fiori and russo 2008 maxwell et al 2009 engdahl and maxwell 2015 in arid areas where current recharge is considered nil it is often assumed that the apparent water age is the time since a previous wet period this is a risky assumption that has to be carefully discussed according to the aquifer conceptual flow model taking into account that the sampled water is actually in most cases a mixture of a wide range of ages transit times similar considerations were presented for perennial stream networks by mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 and mcdonnell et al 2010 in relatively large mountain range areas under arid conditions and with very low permeability where groundwater flows through thick formations a wetter than present period producing a large recharge is revealed through a noticeable groundwater reserve augmentation in the case of exponential reserve depletion time of a few millennia the increased groundwater reserves may last millennia and feed springs during a long arid period after the wet one this paper is a contribution to the understanding of the effect on groundwater reserve and chloride and radiocarbon content that a wetter than present period with enhanced recharge has on data collected from springs in arid lands in the case of a water table unconfined aquifer this is inspired in a mountain range case under hyper arid conditions where aquifer recharge is very sensitive to variable climate conditions during the past millennia to quantify the results a very simplified and generalized setting is worked out in which recharge is homogeneously produced all over the aquifer surface and subjected to a millennial long wet period between two long dry periods this setting allows obtaining an equation that can be solved with readily available numerical methods real cases may differ from these simplifications but results allow addressing the problem of uncertainty of corrected radiocarbon and chloride data in a hydrogeologically realistic framework as results cannot be made independent of recharge and aquifer characteristics two general scenarios have been created which are loosely based on actual studies being carried out in the hyper arid desert of northern chile and on authors observations in the arid southern areas in the canary islands however this paper is not a case study but an abstraction and generalization inspired in real cases the objective is to get results that can be applied to a variety of circumstances the effect of variations in recharge rate along time on inferred water age has been investigated by massoudieh 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2015 and engdahl et al 2016 nevertheless the related chloride and radiocarbon content changes in recharge for aquifers located in arid areas have rarely been considered before this is the main subject of this work a first approach was presented in custodio and custodio ayala 2014 although the solutions in this paper were only qualitative as the closed form mathematical solution was not accurate enough all over the range values of interest 2 groundwater mixing in samples exponential flow aquifers the mathematical treatment of the inflow outflow of constant or time variable tracer concentration in an aquifer relies on simplified conceptual groundwater flow models using lumped parameters which apply diverse transfer functions to uniformly recharged aquifers zuber 1986 małoszewski and zuber 1982 1996 a recent synthesis of the mathematical treatment and updated references can be found in jódar et al 2014 the relationship between groundwater age and age dating has been considered by bethke and johnson 2008 the case of linearly varying recharge in unconfined sloping aquifers is developed in custodio and jódar 2016 under non dispersive and homogeneous conditions for a confined aquifer in which recharge is only produced in a localized area up flow or for in transit recharge percolation through the unsaturated zone the piston plug flow model with similar flow paths is a reasonable approach this model is tacitly assumed when corrected apparent radiocarbon age is equated to groundwater age the piston flow does not represent the real behavior of groundwater in many common circumstances of high dispersion or distributed recharge over a large area water samples from regional springs or from deeply penetrating long screened wells are often a mixture of waters from different flow lines over a wide range or transit times the apparent groundwater age t t may greatly differ from the average renewal time of water in the aquifer τ t defined as τ v r being v l the water depth in the system reserve and r lt 1 the recharge in a pure piston flow aquifer without geochemical effects on radiocarbon content with no mixing during sampling t will vary according to the sampling point by increasing its value down gradient from the recharge zone along the flow path both t and τ will always yield the actual residence time at a point in the aquifer when all flow lines have the same flow time then t is equal to τ at the aquifer s discharge point otherwise τ will only equal t for a flow line corresponding to the average residence time most discharge points would have either shorter or longer residence times than τ in a completely mixed aquifer the actual residence time would be equal to τ everywhere but t would be smaller than τ because mixing is linear and radioactive decay is nonlinear this is not a consequence of mixing in the aquifer or during sampling but rather a general characteristic of advective dispersive transport to find how t and τ are related the aquifer transfer function converting recharge into discharge has to be known which depends on the unsaturated and saturated zone characteristics in the real world the transfer function cannot be determined by means of experiments so hypotheses have to be formulated according to the conceptual model of aquifer flow and the observed hydrological system behavior turnadge and smerdon 2014 the selected models can be checked to some extent when repeated sampling is done at long enough time intervals to measure the variability of a number of different tracers nevertheless this possibility neither holds for radiocarbon due to the long half life nor for slowly variable input tracers in large aquifers in these cases the model cannot be directly checked for a homogeneous aquifer recharged over its whole area water taken from a main spring or pumped from a fully screened deep well is a mixture of various residence time waters the piston flow model is inappropriate for this situation alternative models such as exponential mixing the transfer function involves an exponential function or complete mixing represent end members of aquifer behavior that are useful to characterize residence times in this situation for constant groundwater reserve the exponential flow model coincides mathematically with the well mixed reservoir model a demonstration can be found in custodio and jódar 2016 actually the mixing is not produced inside the aquifer but during outflow or sample collection the exponential model is a simple idealized one which has been often used to interpret tritium content maloszewski et al 1983 zuber et al 2001 baudron et al 2013 åkesson et al 2015 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 among others but rarely applied in practice to radiocarbon data baudron et al 2013 hereinafter the unsaturated zone will be ignored to obtain workable solutions since a thin unsaturated zone is often an unrealistic condition in arid mountainous areas the following results are only an approach to show relevant facts under variable recharge conditions with time 3 mathematical treatment 3 1 starting hypothesis to develop a simplified mathematical treatment of the problem outlined above an unconfined aquifer is chosen which is recharged all over its surface in an arid climate affected by a wetter than present period intercalated some millennia ago and assuming homogeneous properties the system is represented by a well mixed reservoir fig 1 subjected to the following conditions 1 exponential emptying of a dynamic groundwater depth v d l above the outflow point altitude given by 1 q α v v where v l is the dead groundwater reserve below the outflow altitude v l is the total groundwater depth obtained as the sum of the aquifer dead v and dynamic v d depths and α t 1 is the recession depletion coefficient that depends on aquifer characteristics dead depth reserve refers to water below the outflow point elevation and dynamic depth reserve is that one above that point after rorabaugh 1963 α can be evaluated as 2 α π 2 t 4 l 2 s where t l2 t 1 is the transmissivity s the storage coefficient and l l is the distance from divide or no flow boundary to the river or the sea in an elongated aquifer this assumption corresponds to the linear model of maillet 1905 in theory it only holds when dead depth is much smaller than total depth but it will be kept to obtain simple analytical solutions the linear model is commonly used in many mathematical approaches coutagne 1948 tallaksen 1995 chapman 1999 or a combination of linear models pulido velázquez et al 2005 pulido velazquez et al 2007 although other relationships are also used wittemberg 1999 fenicia et al 2006 2 water sample representing the mixing of all flow lines in the moment of sampling this can be represented by the total mixing depth v which is larger than the dynamic one vd as it includes the dead depth in which groundwater also flows it is assumed that recharge is rapidly transferred from the land surface to the saturated zone so the transit time through the unsaturated zone can be ignored this may be a major restriction in some real cases fiori and russo 2013 engdahl and maxwell 2015 but it allows an easy mathematical treatment this restriction is significant for chloride which moves down through the unsaturated zone approaching the piston flow model but may be less significant for radiocarbon due to the easier downward diffusion of co2 in the soil gas phase weeks et al 1982 walvoord et al 2005 the objective is to calculate the sequence formed by a long dry period until steady state wet period dry period as in fig 2 where both the behavior of a stable non reactive environmental chemical tracer and of a radioactive environmental tracer are approximately depicted 3 2 general balance of groundwater and solute under the above assumptions the water and solute tracer mass balance equations are given by 3 v r α v v 4 c rc r v q v λ v v c where the point over the variable stands for the temporal derivative of such variable r lt 1 is recharge λ t 1 is the radioactive decay constant of the environmental tracer being λ 0 in the case of a stable tracer as chloride c ml 3 is tracer concentration in the groundwater sample coinciding with concentration in the equivalent well mixed reservoir and cr ml 3 is tracer concentration in recharge these variables refer to the whole aquifer so they are lumped values in terms of aquifer recharge the problem presents three different stages fig 2 1 for t ta steady state recharge r 0 with a tracer content of c r 0 corresponding to a very long previous dry period for convenience ta 0 2 for ta t tb wet period of constant recharge r1 with a corresponding tracer content c r 1 3 for tb t period drier than the previous one with r2 and c r 2 as recharge rate and recharge tracer content respectively present time is tc in the case of the first steady state period the solution to eqs 3 and 4 is given by 5 v 0 v v 0 v r 0 α 6 c 0 c c r 0 1 λ v 0 r 0 eq 3 can be analytically integrated taking into account the recharge conditions that apply to the above defined periods 7 v v 1 α r 2 r 0 r 1 e α t r 1 r 2 e α t t b eq 4 formally depends on eq 3 and cannot be analytically solved the approximate solution given in custodio and custodio ayala 2014 is only valid for small renewal time systems eq 4 can be numerically integrated by using the runge kutta method press et al 1992 brankin et al 1991 to obtain the solution c t for the whole simulation period from ta to tc see fig 2 in the supplementary material of the manuscript a fortran code is included to jointly solve eqs 3 and 4 for any number of recharge periods with their corresponding time length and tracer content in recharge 4 illustrative synthetic scenarios in an arid area 4 1 setting up the scenarios eq 7 depends on a series of dimensional parameters that are case dependent and cannot be reduced by using dimensionless parameters so different scenarios have to be prepared to show the relevant results trying to mimic actual cases of interest the objective variables are chloride content λ 0 derived from atmospheric deposition and radiocarbon activity λ 1 21 10 4 yr 1 the two selected scenarios are inspired in the coastal springs of the cordillera de la costa coastal range in the vicinity of antofagasta in the hyper arid region of the atacama desert in northern chile the very small regional recharge is currently due to sporadic events salas et al 2016 although in past wetter than current periods some diffuse recharge could also occur the aquifer is made of low permeability geological formations so a small average recharge rate is able to create a relatively high groundwater body sustaining low flow springs the area is described in herrera and custodio 2014a b the most salient hydrological conditions are given below as background information from which the parameters for the two scenarios that are later chosen the area consists of a 10 km wide coastal range from the discharge boundary to the groundwater divide made of rock with hydraulic conductivity k ranging from 10 3 to 10 4 m d in the upper few hundred meters saturated zone with transmissivities t ranging from 10 1 to 2 10 3 m2 d some strips affected by tectonics across the range may have k and t values ranging from 10 2 to 10 3 m d and from 0 1 to 1 m2 d respectively groundwater discharge flows to the coastal strip are about 0 06 hm3 yr along 200 km or about 0 3 m2 d m3 m d which can be up to 2 m2 d in parts affected by tectonics current long term average recharge is less than 0 1 mm yr produced by a long term average precipitation that does not exceed 10 mm y paleoclimate studies point to the existence of a less arid wet period between 5000 and 3000 yr ago as in most arid environments a small precipitation increase may greatly increase recharge the chosen scenarios have in common a wetter than present precipitation period between 7000 yr and 5000 yr ago see fig 2 assumed as a sharply defined period in the climate sequence this period is somewhat older than in the reference case to highlight the effect of past events two different cases are considered see table 1 hyper arid conditions where r0 0 1 mm yr r1 1 mm yr between 5000 and 7000 yr ago i e δt tb ta 2000 years and r2 0 1 mm yr arid conditions where r0 1 mm y r1 10 mm yr between 5000 and 7000 yr ago i e δt tb ta 2000 years and r2 1 mm yr in the figures only the time period between 7000 yr ago t ta 0 and today t tc 7000 yr is shown extended by a short previous time span with constant values steady state and equal to those existing before 7000 years ago table 1 shows the periods and the assumed 14c and cl values in each of them as explained in the corresponding subsections the range of α values agrees with the given hydraulic parameters and size of the area the dead groundwater reserve is 1 m for a porosity of 0 01 this is equivalent to a 100 m saturated thickness below the outflow boundary the aquifer width from the outflow boundary to the groundwater divide or inner boundary is really not needed as it is embedded in the value of the recession constant α which has also embedded the aquifer hydraulic properties when needed time is given in kyr thousands of years 4 2 groundwater reserve depth evolution fig 3 shows the variation in aquifer reserve depth vs time from t 0 until present t 7000 yr taking as parameter the exponential depletion time 1 α for a dead groundwater reserve of 1 m what exceeds this value is dynamic reserve depth at the end of the wet period the steady state is not yet attained in the hyper arid a case current dynamic reserve depth is small relative to the dead reserve for 1 α 500 yr but it is 1 m for 1 α 5000 yr in a low specific yield rock this implies a noticeable increase of the water table elevation above the altitude of discharge the dynamic depth reaches 20 m for 1 α 5000 yr for 1 α 1500 yr quite a large dynamic reserve remains at present time the close to linear evolution is the result of the accumulation of recharge in the wet period for high 1 α slow drainage rate recharge is mainly put into storage in the hyper arid case but part of it has been already discharged in the arid case conditions at t 0 and before show that the dynamic reserve may be quite important with respect to dead reserve thus sustaining small springs where the surface intersects the water table fig 4 shows the aquifer storage depth reserve vs 1 α there is a noticeable increase of reserves at the end of the wet period partly persisting until present for 1 α 2000 yr 4 3 consideration of radiocarbon it is assumed that the 14c activity in recharge does not depend on recharge rate but on the concentration in soil co2 whose average value is assumed constant in a given period of time thus 14c activity in recharge water assumed to reach soon the saturated zone does not change with climate conditions this is a restrictive condition but not far away from reality as 14c activity in biologically derived co2 is close to that in atmospheric co2 when presenting the values and results 14c activity is normalized to 1 100 pmc percent modern carbon fig 5 shows the evolution of 14c concentration with respect to recharge in case a hyper arid the starting state values vary from 0 45 to 0 35 apparent ages of 6600 and 8700 yr respectively for 1 α increasing from 500 to 5000 yr in case b arid the starting state values vary from 0 85 to 0 60 apparent ages of 1400 and 4200 yr respectively for 1 α increasing from 500 to 5000 yr during the wet period 14c increases water is apparently younger due to the larger proportion of recent water 14c content in groundwater attains the steady state under arid conditions but not under the hyper arid conditions at present time 14c is still younger than it was under the old hyper arid conditions about 0 1 higher about 2000 yr younger but it approaches the initial values under dry conditions fig 6 shows 14c concentration vs 1 α there is a noticeable increase of 14c concentration at the end of the wet period that still persists today groundwater appears to be younger than in the starting steady state conditions for any 1 α value to show the influence of the dead reserve v on the 14c content in groundwater its evolution is presented in fig 7 for an aquifer with 1 α 2000 yr the curve for v 1 m corresponds to the cases depicted in figs 3 6 small values of 1 α imply a noticeable 14c increase and consequently a younger apparent age for large 1 α values after a progressive 14c increase during the wet period the radiocarbon content decreases slowly afterwards fig 8 shows the 14c content vs the aquifer dead depth v for different times initial end of wet period and present period stage time for arid conditions the effect of v on 14c content is small but quite noticeable under hyper arid conditions with increased apparent ages 4 4 consideration of atmospheric chloride deposition it is assumed that the only source of cl is atmospheric deposition and that this deposition rate in a given place did not significantly change in the past although it is spatially variable wang et al 2014 this steady state assumption implies that most of the deposition is as dry deposition which is reasonable in arid areas herrera and custodio 2014a b and references therein it is also assumed that contributed cl is incorporated into recharge so there is no net salt accumulation in the soil and its concentration decreases as climate becomes wetter this is an important difference compared to 14c activity the equations are solved for λ 0 fig 9 shows the evolution of cl concentration in groundwater there is a clear reduction in cl concentration at the end of the wet period even down to one order of magnitude lower 1 10 than the initial steady state value which is the inverse of precipitation increase factor in the hyper arid case the ratio is about 1 3 still highly significant in the current situation there is still a clear decrease in cl content due to the wet period except for fast renewal time in the arid case for slow renewal aquifers under dry conditions total recovery may need millennia under hyper arid conditions 4 5 results from an ancient wet period the above presented synthetic results for 5000 yr after the wet event show that the steady state is not attained after the wet event but for small values of 1 α results are far from the steady state in the case of chloride to see when steady state is reached an extension to a 70 kyr dry period is presented fig 10 shows the evolution after 70 kyr from the start of the wet period the effect of a previous wet period in radiocarbon activity fig 10a and aquifer reserves fig 10b dwindles in about 10 millennia but for chloride it lasts longer fig 10c the radiocarbon activity in groundwater and the aquifer reserves can be expressed in terms of the apparent radiocarbon age tapp 1 λ ln a o a and the instantaneous residence time τ v r see section 2 which are time variable as the reserve v depends on time the evolution along 70 kyr is presented in fig 11 the behavior presents different stages during the wet part of the period tapp and τ decrease sharply due to the enhanced recharge which produces a large accumulation of recent groundwater reserves after ceasing the wet part of the period recharge r sharply decreases so tapp jumps up and τ increases progressively as water in the reserve becomes older the decrease of aquifer discharge and reserves reduces τ when the reserve contains a large proportion of the current small recent recharge finally the initial steady state values are reproduced in about two to three decades after present 7 kyr for the long recession time conditions the practical consequence is that the effect of a wetter than present period a few millennia ago persists at present time in the case of slowly draining aquifers in mountainous conditions comparing with the no wet period scenario the groundwater reserves and the corresponding water table elevations are higher and the apparent radiocarbon age is increased this last effect is paradoxical 5 discussion and conclusions when groundwater reserve variations are taken into account as it is done in section 3 more realistic and accurate concentration changes are obtained this is an improvement over other calculations found in the literature the radiocarbon content in tdic of spring water increases after the wet period relative to the long term steady value under arid conditions thus younger apparent ages are obtained this suggests the existence of the previous wet period when the steady state content is known or it can be calculated nevertheless this assumption may be difficult to check in the presented scenarios of a wet period between 7000 and 5000 years ago for a groundwater reserve depth recession parameter between 500 and 5000 years for hyper arid conditions when old and present recharge rate is almost negligible the apparent 14c ages vary between 6600 and 8700 years these values fall close to the wet period timing however under less arid conditions when old and present recharge rate is not negligible the apparent ages vary between 1400 and 4200 years quite younger than the wet period this means that only when old and present recharge rate is nil or non significant apparent 14c age approaches the timing of a past wet period the difference between apparent 14c age and the timing of a previous wet period increases as the dead reserve becomes larger in mountainous areas where groundwater flow is restricted to the upper weathered and fractured zone which is mostly above the outflow altitude the dead depth can be neglected so there is a close coincidence of ages but this is not the case in low relief areas where the flow system extends deeper than the outflow altitude this highlights the importance of a sound groundwater flow conceptual model for the correct interpretation of radiocarbon apparent ages in the cordillera de la costa near antofagasta in northern chile herrera and custodio 2014a herrera et al 2017 and in fuerteventura island central massif herrera and custodio 2014b there is probably a small dead reserve but certainly not in the arid south eastern phonolitic massif of amurga gran canaria island gasparini et al 1990 custodio ayala and custodio 2001 the water reserve in the saturated zone of an unconfined aquifer is the effective saturated thickness multiplied by rock porosity when as the result of a period with larger recharge the water table goes up it saturates part of the previous unsaturated zone and mixes with water hold by capillarity this water may be a large fraction of total porosity and may have a quite different renewal time age this situation has not been taken into account for the sake of simplicity cl concentration in recharge due to atmospheric chloride deposition may be quite high under arid conditions a wet period may produce less saline recharge this effect may last millennia so current spring water has a lower cl concentration than present recharge in the current hyper arid period nevertheless the expected steady state cl concentration is indeed unknown using present spring cl content as a proxy of long term recharge estimation by means of the atmospheric chloride mass balance might overestimate recharge as the cl concentration would be close to that in the past wet period instead of under the current hyper arid conditions as chloride is stable and conservative the transit time through the unsaturated zone delays the arrival to the saturated zone and magnifies the effect of past wetter periods in the case of very thick unsaturated zones the solute could be still moving down not yet reaching the saturated zone so the chloride content in spring water could be the result of a mixture of recharge from older events if they correspond to dry conditions the evaluated recharge is neither the current one nor that corresponding to the wet period the understanding of real circumstances needs the knowledge of the vertical distribution of chloride concentration in the unsaturated zone however results from borehole samples are rarely available a main conclusion is that radiocarbon apparent age only approaches the wet period age when dead reserves those below the groundwater outflow altitude are negligible and current recharge is at least one order of magnitude less than recharge during the past wet period a second main conclusion is that the use of groundwater chloride content to estimate recharge even if the slope effect is taken into account custodio and jódar 2016 may yield overestimations to try to avoid this groundwater samples have to be chosen to represent actual recharge according to a sound hydrogeological conceptual model supported by tritium and radiocarbon measurements circumstances of only local significance should be avoided such as places with persistent fog condensation due to special relief features or concentrated recharge during occasional intense rain events or snow melt often perched aquifers even non permanent ones may be good sampling places if they correspond to general circumstances acknowledgements this research was

7566,the impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil erosion are pronounced in mid high latitude areas which lead to seasonal variations in soil erosion determining the critical erosion periods and the reasons behind the increased erosion loads are essential for soil management decisions hence integrated approaches combining experiments and modelling based on field investigations were applied to investigate watershed soil erosion characteristics and the dynamics of water movement through soils long term and continuous data for surface runoff and soil erosion variation characteristics of uplands in a watershed were observed via five simulations by the soil and water assessment tool swat in addition laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the actual soil infiltrabilities in snowmelt seasons thawed treatment and rainy seasons non frozen treatment the results showed that over the course of a year average surface runoff and soil erosion reached peak values of 31 38 mm and 1 46 t ha 1 a 1 respectively in the month of april they also ranked high in july and august falling in the ranges of 23 73 mm to 24 91 mm and 0 55 t ha 1 a 1 to 0 59 t ha 1 a 1 respectively with the infiltration time extended thawed soils showed lower infiltrabilities than non frozen soils and the differences in soil infiltration amounts between these two were considerable these results highlighted that soil erosion was very closely and positively correlated with surface runoff soil loss was higher in snowmelt periods than in rainy periods due to the higher surface runoff in early spring and the decreased soil infiltrability in snowmelt periods contributed much to this higher surface runoff these findings are helpful for identification of critical soil erosion periods when making soil management before critical months especially those before snowmelt periods keywords soil erosion modelling surface runoff infiltration laboratory experiments diffuse pollution 1 introduction soil erosion a hazardous form of land degradation that threatens soil quality and field productivity is caused mainly by water detachment and transport alexandridis et al 2015 mao et al 2010 soil erosion is clearly affected by precipitation amounts and intensities li and fang 2016 particularly in mid high latitude and cold areas such as the northern parts of north america and europe and northeast china soil erosion depends greatly on the climatic state edwards et al 1998 and is characterized by seasonal variations due to the increasing surface runoff led by snowmelt in early spring and intense rainfall in summer ouyang et al 2017 seasonal variations in air and soil temperatures coupled not only with rainfall but also snow and glacier melting influence soil erosion considerably kurylyk et al 2014 a previous study has shown that melt induced soil losses can reach 15 8 t ha 1 in southern west siberia tanasienko et al 2011 hence it is essential to identify seasonal soil erosion features especially the critical erosion periods in such areas because erosion rates in the melt period may be even higher than those in the rainy period edwards et al 1998 ollesch et al 2005 surface runoff is always accompanied by soil erosion and sediment yield abrol et al 2016 with the flow carrying soil materials away in addition to surface flow velocity surface runoff affects soil erosion mainly in the variations of runoff volume in rainy seasons with high precipitation intensity increasing runoff discharge was the dominant factor influencing soil erosion in a study reported by vaezi et al 2017 while in early spring runoff led by snowmelt will also aggravate the erosion of surface soils zuzel et al 1982 as mentioned above although surface runoff exhibits a growing trend in both rainy and snowmelt periods due to concentrated rainfall and snowmelt water the annual runoff feature has not always been the same as the seasonal runoff feature luo et al 2017 for this reason detection of runoff variations on the seasonal scale in response to precipitation and temperature variations is necessary soil infiltration is an indicator of soil erosion and plays a significant role in the transformation between precipitation surface runoff and soil water with higher infiltrability the surface runoff and soil loss will be low moreover as a dynamic process wang et al 2014 soil erodibility will decrease when the soil final infiltration rate increases wang et al 2015 in most cases soil loss often occurs due to runoff detachment when infiltrability is less than rainfall intensity in rainy seasons but in snowmelt periods in cold areas the varying soil infiltrability plays an important role and great quantities of melt water will cause erosion stähli et al 1999 cerda 2001 showed that soil erosion rates became 39 times higher when the steady infiltration rate decreased from 44 5 mm h 1 to 27 5 mm h 1 soil infiltrability was affected by soil type bulk density and soil moisture previous studies have shown that for frozen or unfrozen soils infiltrability decreased as soil moisture grew but the influence of moisture on the infiltration rate declined with time bodman and colman 1944 zheng and fan 2000 overall enhancing infiltrability is an effective strategy to control soil loss garcía ruiz et al 2017 and thereby studying soil infiltration characteristics under the influence of seasonal precipitation and temperature remains a critical issue in soil erosion research the mollisol region of northeast china in the mid high latitude region has contributed significantly to grain production liu et al 2011 but is facing severe soil erosion issues due to long term agricultural exploitation zhang et al 2007 and special climatic conditions large areas of natural cover lands have been cultivated into croplands and paddy field areas have expanded with the development of pond water irrigation in recent years ouyang et al 2014 the terrain of this area is marked by gentle and long slopes that lead to extensive topsoil erosion xin et al 2016 and excess infiltration runoff takes the dominant place in runoff generation zhang et al 2006 therefore surface runoff and soil infiltrability are closely related to soil erosion in this region fan et al 2011 reported that melt runoff was the primary factor governing soil loss and the erosion amount when runoff is under 300 mm h 1 is markedly higher than the erosion that occurs when runoff varies from 60 to 240 mm h 1 in addition freeze thaw cycles affect soil erosion by altering soil structures and the shape of rills gatto 2000 due to the impacts of freeze thaw cycles snowmelt and rainfall the cyclic process of soil erosion exists in the mollisol region hu et al 2009 soil infiltrability surface runoff and soil erosion of the watershed thereby exhibit seasonal characteristics many field investigations laboratory experiments and modelling analyses have been conducted in studies of runoff and soil erosion processes anache et al 2017 rodrigo comino et al 2016 wu et al 2017 field and laboratory experiments are traditional methods which aim to investigate soil erosion mechanisms at small scales but they can hardly be used to describe results for watershed scale hydrological processes in recent decades runoff and soil erosion estimations in watersheds with the aid of hydrology models has developed rapidly the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is one of the most widely used models for watershed hydrological processes and soil erosion assessment which has been applied successfully in both rainfall based kumar and mishra 2015 serpa et al 2015 and snowmelt based processes kang and lee 2014 wang and melesse 2005 modelling is helpful for analyses which cover long term soil erosion data nonetheless such methods barely utilize detailed soil erosion processes therefore a method that integrates experiments and modelling is vital for understanding watershed soil erosion characteristic and the detailed processes that are involved deeper insight into seasonal variations in watershed scale soil erosion processes and the reason behind the growing erosion loads in critical periods in mid high latitude areas are needed to help with soil management and soil erosion control specifically this study integrates approaches of experiments and modelling which aims to i assess seasonal surface runoff and soil erosion features of the upland under the influence of precipitation and temperature variations in the watershed ii investigate the differences in soil infiltration capacity in rainy and snowmelt periods and iii clarify the water driven forces behind the rises in surface runoff and soil erosion in critical soil loss periods 2

meadow albic soil glossoboralf in soil taxonomy the upland dry farmland where soybeans have been grown was first cultivated in the 1950s and the area of upland continuously expanded in the following decades in the 1990s the upland area started to shrink and was gradually largely replaced by paddy fields fig 1 2 2 upland surface runoff and soil erosion modelling to evaluate seasonal surface runoff and soil erosion loads over the whole basin the physically based and distributed soil water assessment tool model swat was adopted in this study swat within arcgis 10 2 2 can quantify variations in the watershed hydrological cycle sediments and nutrients in response to climate and watershed management activities on a daily time scale rossi et al 2012 while taking snow cover effects into consideration therefore this model is an effective tool to assess and predict surface runoff and soil erosion of the upland in the abujiao river basin in the model the watershed is divided into hydrologic response units hrus with a single soil type land use type and slope type in each unit surface runoff and soil erosion were extracted from the hrus of the uplands the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975a b was used to calculate soil erosion according to climatic soil topographic and cover characteristics and management and support practices in the study area 2 3

data in years 1979 1992 1999 2009 and 2014 were employed to represent the cultivation of farmlands under the influence of agricultural development as interpreted from landsat images http glovis usgs gov after field investigation following the principles of the national land cover database scheme seven land use types were classified upland paddy field forest grassland urban wetland and water daily meteorological data from 1970 to 2014 were obtained from the bawujiu farm meteorological station and the raohe county meteorological station in the local area the soil data 1 1 000 000 came from the china soil scientific database cropping operation dates and methods were based on the regulations in effect in the local area hydrological monitoring data and the validated parameters are reported in previous studies that had been widely and successfully used to simulate watershed hydrology and non point source pollution ouyang et al 2017 after sensitivity analysis sixteen parameters were identified that greatly influenced model simulation the swat model was calibrated and validated using the method of sufi 2 in swat cup 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 zuo et al 2016 the calibration and validation results present a generally adequate simulation with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0 698 and 0 731 flow and sand concentration and the coefficients of determination of 0 797 and 0 854 flow and sand concentration the simulation also agreed well with field monitoring data for soil moisture and groundwater chen et al 2013 ouyang et al 2015 considering the upland variations and to obtain soil erosion load variabilities with the cultivation years the model was executed five times based on land use variations in the years 1979 1992 1999 2009 and 2014 these five years were the years signifying cropping and cultivation management for this reason five periods according to five simulation times were designed as period 1 1974 1985 period 2 1986 1995 period 3 1996 2003 period 4 2004 2011 and period 5 2012 2014 with land use data from 1979 1992 1999 2009 and 2014 respectively surface runoff and soil erosion from 1974 to 2014 were estimated accordingly 2 4 laboratory tests design low soil infiltrability is one of the major reasons for losses of topsoils led by surface runoff and erosion yu et al 2003 combined methods of experiments and modelling contribute to a comprehensive understanding of soil erosion characteristics at the watershed scale as well as the detailed water movement through soils topsoils were layers with humified organic matter and influenced by cultivation to clarify how water flows from soil surface to soil profile and quantify the actual soil infiltrability at length topsoils meadow albic soil of the cultivated layer 0 20 cm in the uplands were sampled for field and laboratory investigation soil physical properties are given in table 1 soil infiltrability investigations were performed with a mariotte s bottle and a soil column fig 2 according to field observations of the topsoil in the upland the initial moisture of the soil samples was designated at two levels which reflects the actual field conditions naturally air dried 2 5 0 25 by weight and wet 10 by weight the samples were air dried removed of roots and then sieved 2 mm to achieve the designated moisture level 10 parts of the soil were first tested for the initial moisture and then a sprinkler was used to uniformly add the appropriate amount of water to the soil to reach the intended moisture level 10 the soil was then covered and kept still for 48 h to obtain a homogeneous state for the infiltration test then the soil was packed uniformly into the soil column in case of the structural and hydrodynamic changes in soil layers hsu et al 2017 with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 which were close to the natural bulk density conditions in the upland infiltration experiments in rainy and snowmelt seasons were performed as follows parts of the soil columns were kept under room temperature 15 c to 25 c for infiltration simulation experiments in the rainy seasons other parts of the soil columns were placed into the freezer at temperatures of 20 c to 10 c which were close to the field temperature in winter for more than 24 h to keep the soil frozen then the columns were taken out of the freezer for thawing and the test started after the soil was thawed a marriotte s bottle was connected to the soil column and served as a reservoir that controlled the water in flow rate pellichero et al 2012 mao et al 2016 for the simulation in the rainy season water at room temperature was supplied to the column for the simulation in melt season water mixed with ice cubes was supplied and the soil column was placed at a temperature moderately above 0 c controlled by ice water packs the cumulative infiltration amount and wetting front movement with time were recorded during the infiltration process when the experiment was finished the water supply was cut off and the rubber seals were pulled out to obtain the saturated soil along the column sampled as soon as possible these soil samples were put into aluminum cases for soil moisture tests a total of 24 infiltration experiments were performed for treatments with two soil bulk densities of 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 two initial soil moisture levels of 2 5 0 25 air dried and 10 by weight wet and two simulated treatments for rainy and melt seasons non frozen and thawed soils triplicate experiments were conducted for each treatment 2 5 soil infiltrability determination to determine the soil infiltrability of the soil in the upland the modified green ampt infiltration model was applied to calculate the soil infiltration rate as described by green and ampt 1911 mao et al 2009 1 i θ o θ s 2 θ i dx dt where i is the soil infiltration rate mm h 1 θo is the critical soil moisture cm3 cm 3 θs is the saturated soil moisture cm3 cm 3 θi is the initial soil moisture cm3 cm 3 x is the advancing distance of the wetting front along the soil column cm t is the infiltration time h to facilitate the calculation of infiltration rate eq 1 is written as follows 2 i θ o θ s 2 θ i δ x δ t where δx is the advancing distance of the wetting front along the soil column in δt cm and δt is the infiltration time between two recorded points during the infiltration process h the relationship between soil moisture by volume and by weight is expressed as follows 3 θ v θ w ρ b where θv is the soil moisture by volume cm3 cm 3 θw is the soil moisture by weight and ρb is the bulk density g cm 3 the variations of infiltration rates were obtained with time recorded at each point and were then fitted with smith s 1972 infiltration equation which was used to develop an empirical method for predicting infiltrability and estimating infiltration amounts smith s equation was based on the soil water dynamics and numerical simulation and calculation from abundant rainfall infiltration experiments smith 1972 4 i r t t p i a t t o a i tt p where r is the rainfall intensity mm h 1 tp is the time when ponding started i is the steady infiltration rate mm h 1 to is the time when i tends to be and a is an empirical parameter these parameters a to a and i are related to soil texture initial moisture and rainfall rate infiltration amounts under ponding conditions were determined as follows 5 i t 1 t 2 i t dt where i is the accumulated infiltration amount from t1 to t2 during the infiltration process the accumulated infiltration amounts were also obtained from the reading variations in the marriotte s bottle to evaluate the infiltration amounts to ensure the results were within reasonable limits the fitting with statistical analysis was conducted using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 precipitation and temperature characteristics the precipitation and temperature had distinctive characteristics in different seasons fig 3 the precipitation in july and august had the greatest variability with standard deviations sd of 53 69 and 65 99 respectively which ranked as the top two precipitation amounts in these two months were the highest the precipitation peaked in august up to 270 37 mm and was mainly concentrated in june july august and september the period which was recognized as the rainy season in this period surface runoff grew due to the increasing amounts of precipitation concentrated and large amounts of rainfall water were the driving force of soil loss although the total precipitation including snow water equivalent decreases during winter the mean snowpack depth is equal to around 30 cm leading to a significant snowmelt during the spring time the temperature was the highest in august with the mean value of 21 68 c and the lowest in january with the mean value of 19 90 c the temperature started to rise above 0 c in march and april the months which were recognized as the melt season the precipitation was abundant till october with a maximum of 122 49 mm when the temperature fell below 0 c in the freezing period the amplitude of the freeze thaw cycles in this area is approximately 15 c the accumulated snow through the winter led to the intense melting runoff in the early spring in the next year and this snowmelt water consequently contributed to the loss of thawed soils 3 2 surface runoff and soil erosion variations in the watershed the average monthly surface runoff over the decades was calculated in each hydrological response unit hru of the upland based on five simulations by modelling fig 4 the surface runoff variations showed seasonal characteristics throughout the whole year surface runoff was higher in march and april due to the increasing snowmelt water in early spring and in july and august due to the concentrated precipitation in summer the average runoff reached the peak value of 31 38 mm in april with high values of 23 73 mm and 24 91 mm in july and august respectively the surface runoff variations also indicated that at the earlier stage of cultivation and development of the upland the runoff volumes in april were lower compared with the runoff volumes in periods 4 and 5 in recent years in rainy seasons the runoff volumes in periods 4 and 5 were not the highest surface runoff in april in periods 4 and 5 were 64 35 mm and 35 23 mm on average respectively the highest throughout the whole year it can easily be seen that this watershed experienced growing surface runoff in april july and august snowmelt induced runoff has grown substantially in recent years soil erosion loads from the upland area over the decades were also obtained on the hru scale based on five simulations by modelling fig 5 the average yearly soil erosion load over the decades reached the maximum of 1 46 t ha 1 a 1 in april under the influence of thawing and melting erosion loads were higher in march and april when surface runoff increased due to snowmelt water and in july and august because of concentrated precipitation in months during the melt seasons such as april soils were more likely to be eroded in later years of the study period with high average erosion rates of 2 82 t ha 1 a 1 and 2 10 t ha 1 a 1 for period 4 and period 5 respectively in rainy seasons erosion rates over the decades did not differ much and a distinct erosion peak did not exist except in 1985 and 2001 although the cultivation area gradually decreased soil erosion amounts in april in melt seasons on average generally increased in periods 3 4 and 5 compared with periods 1 and 2 in contrast soil erosion amounts in rainy seasons june july august and september of different periods showed the opposite tendency the amounts decreased from 7275 45 t a 1 and 8718 27 t a 1 in periods 1 and 2 respectively to 4587 79 t a 1 and 5497 72 t a 1 in periods 4 and 5 respectively 3 3 implication for increased soil erosion in rainy and melt seasons concentrated rainfall and melting snow supplied sufficient water for soil some of which penetrated into the soil as percolation water and some of which flowed as surface water above the soil three years of comparisons from 2012 to 2014 between percolation and surface runoff in rainy and melt seasons were analysed after modelling percolation and surface runoff volumes exhibited significant differences in rainy and melt seasons fig 6 in snowmelt periods percolation volume was on average 1 40 times lower than surface runoff volume however percolation increased substantially and was on average 4 10 times higher than surface runoff in rainy seasons the surface runoff volume in snowmelt seasons was 2 97 times higher than in rainy seasons on average the snowmelt runoff in spring was much higher than the rainfall induced runoff in summer this was especially true in 2014 when percolated water accounted for only 24 2 of the total value of the melting percolation and runoff water in the same year approximately 90 0 of the total water flowed into the soil during the rainfall process less percolation was responsible for the increasing surface runoff and the excess surface water easily carried away soil materials which led to severe soil erosion further analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between surface runoff and soil erosion in the rainy season the melt season and the whole year fig 7 the linear fit results of soil erosion loads and surface runoff on a monthly scale suggested that very strong relationships existed between them p 05 the relationship was the most significant n 91 r2 0 903 in melt seasons and weakest n 227 r2 0 793 in rainy seasons which indicated that surface runoff played the key role contributing to soil loss in rainy seasons the monthly runoff volume could reach up to 114 08 mm but for most months the volume was under 40 mm and the 95 predictive intervals generally covered the area when runoff was less than 20 mm fig 7 the scatter plots showed that one runoff volume had an almost identical predicted erosion load at the 95 level in melt seasons as for the whole year the r2 of the linear fit results was 0 799 which suggested that the soil erosion loads were generally determined by surface runoff volumes 3 4 difference in soil infiltrability in rainy and melt seasons infiltration controls the amounts of percolated water and surface runoff soil infiltrability of two bulk densities 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 under four treatments ar air dried and rainy am air dried and melt wr wet and rainy wm wet and melt showed significant differences between rainy seasons and melt seasons at the beginning of the infiltration process soil infiltration rates under different conditions did not differ much from the infiltration rates higher than 100 mm h 1 fig 8 for soil with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 infiltrability under the ar treatment in the initial 25 min was significantly higher than under the am treatment then the differences between them gradually narrowed and the final infiltration rate difference which occurred around the 90 min mark of the infiltration process was 2 03 mm h 1 infiltrability under wr was significantly greater than infiltrability under wm in the initial 40 min and the final infiltration rate difference which occurred around the 90 min mark of the infiltration process was 2 33 mm h 1 for soil with a bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 infiltrability decreased faster and remained at lower infiltration rates during the whole process the difference in the initial 30 min between wr and wm varied within the range of 10 mm h 1 to 20 mm h 1 which was greater than the difference between ar and am the final infiltration rates occurring around the 90 min mark remained at approximately 9 06 mm h 1 to 11 6 mm h 1 the above results indicated that infiltrability had decreased in the melt period after the freeze thaw process for every treatment to study the difference in the soil infiltration amounts with increasing time in the melt and rainy seasons while considering the high infiltration rates and amounts at the initial stage of the infiltration process the accumulated infiltration amounts starting from the tenth minute during the experiment were calculated from eqs 4 and 5 the nonlinear fit results using eq 4 are shown in table 2 the predicted infiltration amounts further showed that infiltrability was lower in the melt period compared with that in the rainy period fig 9 for soil with a bulk density of 1 30 cm 3 melt water infiltrated the least into wet soils compared with other treatments the infiltration amount differences after 300 min between melt and rainy treatment were 50 67 mm and 255 24 mm for air dried and wet soil respectively for soil with a bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 the difference in infiltration amounts for air dried soils was obvious since the initial infiltration period and had increased from 5 64 mm at the beginning to 109 00 mm at the 300 min mark infiltration amounts under wm were slightly higher in the first 55 min but after that became lower compared with wr for wet soils the difference in the final infiltration amount between wm and wr at the 300 min mark was 66 35 mm the weak infiltrability of thawed soils was responsible for the increasing surface runoff and soil loss in march and april bulk density 1 30 g cm 3 for b1 and 1 40 g cm 3 for b2 ar air dried and rainy am air dried and melt wr wet and rainy wm wet and melt 4 discussion 4 1 watershed surface runoff and soil erosion variations the precipitation and temperature in the study area exhibited seasonal variations accompanied by freeze thaw cycles snowmelt and abundant rainfall which led to obvious peak surface flow and in turn soil loss in early spring and summer for snowmelt periods soil moisture increased in a short time when the temperature rose above 0 c and the formation of macro porosity in soils due to thawing may result in the deterioration of soil shear stress and erosion resistance li et al 2013 besides it was observed from this study that the seriously growing runoff amounts owing to warming and melting contributed to the spring erosion peak for rainy periods as the intense precipitation came in summer dense vegetation covers play an important role in soil protection in agricultural areas taguas et al 2017 as reported by sachs and pariente 2017 a high difference in temperature between the rain and the soil surface led to an increase in runoff and erosion the runoff and erosion loads may be lower due to the higher temperature in the air and in the soil in summer hence surface runoff and soil erosion also rose to a higher level due to the concentrated precipitation but the erosion loads in the rainy period were lower than the erosion loads in the snowmelt period surface runoff and soil erosion in the beginning years of cultivation of the upland area were generally lower than those in the later years of the study period although soil loss risks dropped when applying reduced tillage svoray et al 2015 the degradation of soil properties due to long term agricultural exploitation aggravated soil erosion ouyang et al 2018 the increasing trend of soil erosion loads in the melt period was remarkable especially in the recent decades since 2000 which implied that conservation of soils in the early spring in the upland farming area is of great importance especially in areas influenced by melted snow heavily eroded soils experienced a significant decrease in soil and plant productivities yakutina et al 2015 accordingly targeted soil and water conservation measures should be made based on the seasonal variation characteristics of soil erosion 4 2 comparison of infiltrability between rainy and melt season soil erosion loads increased with the increase in surface runoff and there appeared to be a very strong linear relationship between these two in our study it was also shown in a previous study that soil erosion sediment yield and erosion landform had positive correlations with surface flow amounts and energy wang et al 2003 this relationship was the most significant in melt seasons and less obvious in rainy seasons in this study area which was characterized by gentle and long slopes one runoff volume had an almost identical predicted erosion load at a 95 level in melt seasons as indicated in the experiments conducted by ban et al 2017 on thawed soils sediment yields tended to have positive relationships to surface flow volume per unit time even under different slope gradients of 5 and 10 the outcome of our research further highlighted the important role of surface runoff and the significance of reducing runoff in controlling snowmelt induced erosion the results of our downward infiltration experiments on thawed and unfrozen soils indicated that soil infiltrability exhibited significant differences in rainy seasons and melt seasons soil infiltrability under laboratory conditions could be obtained accurately with more time saved mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 for drier soils higher infiltrability was observed which coincided with the study of kane and jean 1983 on seasonally frozen soils although these differences were not striking in the initial phase of the infiltration process infiltration rates of thawed soils decreased more substantially than infiltration rates of unfrozen soils with the infiltration time extended as infiltration rates reached a relatively steady level the rates of thawed soils were also lower than those of unfrozen soils in winter the freeze thaw cycles can reduce soil infiltrability which is especially pronounced when the frequency of these cycles increases due to the changes in the dimension of soil pores fouli et al 2013 these different infiltrabilities between thawed and unfrozen soils will lead to different amounts of percolation water in melt and rainy seasons 4 3 implication for soil erosion peaking in critical periods surface runoff and soil erosion experienced two obvious peaks in early spring and in rainy summer within a given year apparently rainfall is one of the most important drivers of soil erosion panagos et al 2015 and the soil loss peaks are usually considered to have occurred in rainy seasons due to high rainfall amounts and intensities however our results showed that most soils were eroded in the snowmelt periods this is consistent with former findings that thawed soils tended to be more susceptible to being eroded bajracharya et al 1998 snowmelt runoff can lead to severe erosion on farmland and even contribute to regional flooding wade and kirkbride 1998 high infiltration rates generally result in less surface flow and more percolation which is a reflection of the moderate response to the impact of precipitation serrano muela et al 2008 many research studies have been performed to study the relationships between infiltration runoff and soil erosion mamedov et al 2016 this study provided comprehensive information on the dynamics of water movement through soils and the relationship between runoff and soil loss on a watershed scale soil loss is subjected to geomorphic external and internal variabilities kim et al 2016 and soil infiltrability is an important internal factor controlling runoff generation and soil erosion unlike rainy seasons the process of melt water entering into soils always lasts during the entire melt period therefore the thawed soil with decreased infiltrability is at high risk to be eroded in melt periods in mid high latitude areas the land management to protect soils in snowmelt periods is very important and necessary mulching is an effective method to reduce soil erosion in rainy seasons in agricultural lands prosdocimi et al 2016 while for snowmelt periods altering the spatial distributions in runoff generation and infiltration places may contribute to a reduction in soil erosion at watershed scales cerda et al 2017 enhanced infiltration and decreased surface runoff are crucial for soil erosion control in the mid high latitude areas 5 conclusions the combination of experiments and modelling methods in our study afforded a better understanding of watershed soil erosion characteristics and detailed dynamics of water movement through soils in a mid high latitude upland watershed seasonal precipitation and temperature variations led to large snowmelt runoff in spring and rainfall runoff in summer average soil erosion loads reached the maximum of 1 46 t ha 1 a 1 in april and were also high in july and august which followed the same variation trend as runoff the results indicated that soil erosion was highly and positively correlated with surface runoff the decrease in soil infiltrability was responsible for the reduced percolation and in turn the increased surface runoff which led to the excess surface water easily carrying away soil materials soil infiltrability exhibited significant differences between rainy seasons and melt seasons results revealed that with the infiltration time extended thawed soils in melt seasons showed lower infiltrabilities than non frozen soils in rainy seasons particularly soil loss was higher in snowmelt periods than in rainy periods due to the higher surface runoff in early spring decreased soil infiltrability in snowmelt periods also contributed much to this higher surface runoff these findings will help identify critical soil erosion periods in order to make more effective soil management decisions rational measures should be taken to control surface runoff and soil erosion before critical months especially before snowmelt periods further investigation that includes an evaluation of strategies to reduce soil erosion in critical periods may be necessary

7566,the impacts of precipitation and temperature on soil erosion are pronounced in mid high latitude areas which lead to seasonal variations in soil erosion determining the critical erosion periods and the reasons behind the increased erosion loads are essential for soil management decisions hence integrated approaches combining experiments and modelling based on field investigations were applied to investigate watershed soil erosion characteristics and the dynamics of water movement through soils long term and continuous data for surface runoff and soil erosion variation characteristics of uplands in a watershed were observed via five simulations by the soil and water assessment tool swat in addition laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the actual soil infiltrabilities in snowmelt seasons thawed treatment and rainy seasons non frozen treatment the results showed that over the course of a year average surface runoff and soil erosion reached peak values of 31 38 mm and 1 46 t ha 1 a 1 respectively in the month of april they also ranked high in july and august falling in the ranges of 23 73 mm to 24 91 mm and 0 55 t ha 1 a 1 to 0 59 t ha 1 a 1 respectively with the infiltration time extended thawed soils showed lower infiltrabilities than non frozen soils and the differences in soil infiltration amounts between these two were considerable these results highlighted that soil erosion was very closely and positively correlated with surface runoff soil loss was higher in snowmelt periods than in rainy periods due to the higher surface runoff in early spring and the decreased soil infiltrability in snowmelt periods contributed much to this higher surface runoff these findings are helpful for identification of critical soil erosion periods when making soil management before critical months especially those before snowmelt periods keywords soil erosion modelling surface runoff infiltration laboratory experiments diffuse pollution 1 introduction soil erosion a hazardous form of land degradation that threatens soil quality and field productivity is caused mainly by water detachment and transport alexandridis et al 2015 mao et al 2010 soil erosion is clearly affected by precipitation amounts and intensities li and fang 2016 particularly in mid high latitude and cold areas such as the northern parts of north america and europe and northeast china soil erosion depends greatly on the climatic state edwards et al 1998 and is characterized by seasonal variations due to the increasing surface runoff led by snowmelt in early spring and intense rainfall in summer ouyang et al 2017 seasonal variations in air and soil temperatures coupled not only with rainfall but also snow and glacier melting influence soil erosion considerably kurylyk et al 2014 a previous study has shown that melt induced soil losses can reach 15 8 t ha 1 in southern west siberia tanasienko et al 2011 hence it is essential to identify seasonal soil erosion features especially the critical erosion periods in such areas because erosion rates in the melt period may be even higher than those in the rainy period edwards et al 1998 ollesch et al 2005 surface runoff is always accompanied by soil erosion and sediment yield abrol et al 2016 with the flow carrying soil materials away in addition to surface flow velocity surface runoff affects soil erosion mainly in the variations of runoff volume in rainy seasons with high precipitation intensity increasing runoff discharge was the dominant factor influencing soil erosion in a study reported by vaezi et al 2017 while in early spring runoff led by snowmelt will also aggravate the erosion of surface soils zuzel et al 1982 as mentioned above although surface runoff exhibits a growing trend in both rainy and snowmelt periods due to concentrated rainfall and snowmelt water the annual runoff feature has not always been the same as the seasonal runoff feature luo et al 2017 for this reason detection of runoff variations on the seasonal scale in response to precipitation and temperature variations is necessary soil infiltration is an indicator of soil erosion and plays a significant role in the transformation between precipitation surface runoff and soil water with higher infiltrability the surface runoff and soil loss will be low moreover as a dynamic process wang et al 2014 soil erodibility will decrease when the soil final infiltration rate increases wang et al 2015 in most cases soil loss often occurs due to runoff detachment when infiltrability is less than rainfall intensity in rainy seasons but in snowmelt periods in cold areas the varying soil infiltrability plays an important role and great quantities of melt water will cause erosion stähli et al 1999 cerda 2001 showed that soil erosion rates became 39 times higher when the steady infiltration rate decreased from 44 5 mm h 1 to 27 5 mm h 1 soil infiltrability was affected by soil type bulk density and soil moisture previous studies have shown that for frozen or unfrozen soils infiltrability decreased as soil moisture grew but the influence of moisture on the infiltration rate declined with time bodman and colman 1944 zheng and fan 2000 overall enhancing infiltrability is an effective strategy to control soil loss garcía ruiz et al 2017 and thereby studying soil infiltration characteristics under the influence of seasonal precipitation and temperature remains a critical issue in soil erosion research the mollisol region of northeast china in the mid high latitude region has contributed significantly to grain production liu et al 2011 but is facing severe soil erosion issues due to long term agricultural exploitation zhang et al 2007 and special climatic conditions large areas of natural cover lands have been cultivated into croplands and paddy field areas have expanded with the development of pond water irrigation in recent years ouyang et al 2014 the terrain of this area is marked by gentle and long slopes that lead to extensive topsoil erosion xin et al 2016 and excess infiltration runoff takes the dominant place in runoff generation zhang et al 2006 therefore surface runoff and soil infiltrability are closely related to soil erosion in this region fan et al 2011 reported that melt runoff was the primary factor governing soil loss and the erosion amount when runoff is under 300 mm h 1 is markedly higher than the erosion that occurs when runoff varies from 60 to 240 mm h 1 in addition freeze thaw cycles affect soil erosion by altering soil structures and the shape of rills gatto 2000 due to the impacts of freeze thaw cycles snowmelt and rainfall the cyclic process of soil erosion exists in the mollisol region hu et al 2009 soil infiltrability surface runoff and soil erosion of the watershed thereby exhibit seasonal characteristics many field investigations laboratory experiments and modelling analyses have been conducted in studies of runoff and soil erosion processes anache et al 2017 rodrigo comino et al 2016 wu et al 2017 field and laboratory experiments are traditional methods which aim to investigate soil erosion mechanisms at small scales but they can hardly be used to describe results for watershed scale hydrological processes in recent decades runoff and soil erosion estimations in watersheds with the aid of hydrology models has developed rapidly the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is one of the most widely used models for watershed hydrological processes and soil erosion assessment which has been applied successfully in both rainfall based kumar and mishra 2015 serpa et al 2015 and snowmelt based processes kang and lee 2014 wang and melesse 2005 modelling is helpful for analyses which cover long term soil erosion data nonetheless such methods barely utilize detailed soil erosion processes therefore a method that integrates experiments and modelling is vital for understanding watershed soil erosion characteristic and the detailed processes that are involved deeper insight into seasonal variations in watershed scale soil erosion processes and the reason behind the growing erosion loads in critical periods in mid high latitude areas are needed to help with soil management and soil erosion control specifically this study integrates approaches of experiments and modelling which aims to i assess seasonal surface runoff and soil erosion features of the upland under the influence of precipitation and temperature variations in the watershed ii investigate the differences in soil infiltration capacity in rainy and snowmelt periods and iii clarify the water driven forces behind the rises in surface runoff and soil erosion in critical soil loss periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area abujiao river basin which plays an important role in grain production in china yin et al 2016 is located on the bawujiu farm in the sanjiang plain in the northeast of china fig 1 abujiao river is a seasonal river with a basin area of 142 9 km2 which is characterized by a typical cold temperate monsoon continental climate with a mean annual temperature of 2 94 c the rainy season with concentrated rainfall events extends from july to august and the freeze thaw season with abundant snowfall is from november to march or april in the next year the mean annual

approximately 141 cm in winter this basin has gentle gradients and six types of soil with high soil organic content 4 48 were observed there ouyang et al 2016 the soil in the upland area is mainly meadow albic soil glossoboralf in soil taxonomy the upland dry farmland where soybeans have been grown was first cultivated in the 1950s and the area of upland continuously expanded in the following decades in the 1990s the upland area started to shrink and was gradually largely replaced by paddy fields fig 1 2 2 upland surface runoff and soil erosion modelling to evaluate seasonal surface runoff and soil erosion loads over the whole basin the physically based and distributed soil water assessment tool model swat was adopted in this study swat within arcgis 10 2 2 can quantify variations in the watershed hydrological cycle sediments and nutrients in response to climate and watershed management activities on a daily time scale rossi et al 2012 while taking snow cover effects into consideration therefore this model is an effective tool to assess and predict surface runoff and soil erosion of the upland in the abujiao river basin in the model the watershed is divided into hydrologic response units hrus with a single soil type land use type and slope type in each unit surface runoff and soil erosion were extracted from the hrus of the uplands the modified universal soil

meteorological data from 1970 to 2014 were obtained from the bawujiu farm meteorological station and the raohe county meteorological station in the local area the soil data 1 1 000 000 came from the china soil scientific database cropping operation dates and methods were based on the regulations in effect in the local area hydrological monitoring data and the validated parameters are reported in previous studies that had been widely and successfully used to simulate watershed hydrology and non point source pollution ouyang et al 2017 after sensitivity analysis sixteen parameters were identified that greatly influenced model simulation the swat model was calibrated and validated using the method of sufi 2 in swat cup 2012 abbaspour et al 2007 zuo et al 2016 the calibration and validation results present a generally adequate simulation with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of 0 698 and 0 731 flow and sand concentration and the coefficients of determination of 0 797 and 0 854 flow and sand concentration the simulation also agreed well with field monitoring data for soil moisture and groundwater chen et al 2013 ouyang et al 2015 considering the upland variations and to obtain soil erosion load variabilities with the cultivation years the model was executed five times based on land use variations in the years 1979 1992 1999 2009 and 2014 these five years were the years signifying cropping and cultivation management for this reason five periods according to five simulation times were designed as period 1 1974 1985 period 2 1986 1995 period 3 1996 2003 period 4 2004 2011 and period 5 2012 2014 with land use data from 1979 1992 1999 2009 and 2014 respectively surface runoff and soil erosion from 1974 to 2014 were estimated accordingly 2 4 laboratory tests design low soil infiltrability is one of the major reasons for losses of topsoils led by surface runoff and erosion yu et al 2003 combined methods of experiments and modelling contribute to a comprehensive understanding of soil erosion characteristics at the watershed scale as well as the detailed water movement through soils topsoils were layers with humified organic matter and influenced by cultivation to clarify how water flows from soil surface to soil profile and quantify the actual soil infiltrability at length topsoils meadow albic soil of the cultivated layer 0 20 cm in the uplands were sampled for field and laboratory investigation soil physical properties are given in table 1 soil infiltrability investigations were performed with a mariotte s bottle and a soil column fig 2 according to field observations of the topsoil in the upland the initial moisture of the soil samples was designated at two levels which reflects the actual field conditions naturally air dried 2 5 0 25 by weight and wet 10 by weight the samples were air dried removed of roots and then sieved 2 mm to achieve the designated moisture level 10 parts of the soil were first tested for the initial moisture and then a sprinkler was used to uniformly add the appropriate amount of water to the soil to reach the intended moisture level 10 the soil was then covered and kept still for 48 h to obtain a homogeneous state for the infiltration test then the soil was packed uniformly into the soil column in case of the structural and hydrodynamic changes in soil layers hsu et al 2017 with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 which were close to the natural bulk density conditions in the upland infiltration experiments in rainy and snowmelt seasons were performed as follows parts of the soil columns were kept under room temperature 15 c to 25 c for infiltration simulation experiments in the rainy seasons other parts of the soil columns were placed into the freezer at temperatures of 20 c to 10 c which were close to the field temperature in winter for more than 24 h to keep the soil frozen then the columns were taken out of the freezer for thawing and the test started after the soil was thawed a marriotte s bottle was connected to the soil column and served as a reservoir that controlled the water in flow rate pellichero et al 2012 mao et al 2016 for the simulation in the rainy season water at room temperature was supplied to the column for the simulation in melt season water mixed with ice cubes was supplied and the soil column was placed at a temperature moderately above 0 c controlled by ice water packs the cumulative infiltration amount and wetting front movement with time were recorded during the infiltration process when the experiment was finished the water supply was cut off and the rubber seals were pulled out to obtain the saturated soil along the column sampled as soon as possible these soil samples were put into aluminum cases for soil moisture tests a total of 24 infiltration experiments were performed for treatments with two soil bulk densities of 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 two initial soil moisture levels of 2 5 0 25 air dried and 10 by weight wet and two simulated treatments for rainy and melt seasons non frozen and thawed soils triplicate experiments were conducted for each treatment 2 5 soil infiltrability determination to determine the soil infiltrability of the soil in the upland the modified green ampt infiltration model was applied to calculate the soil infiltration rate as described by green and ampt 1911 mao et al 2009 1 i θ o θ s 2 θ i dx dt where i is the soil infiltration rate mm h 1 θo is the critical soil moisture cm3 cm 3 θs is the saturated soil moisture cm3 cm 3 θi is the initial soil moisture cm3 cm 3 x is the advancing distance of the wetting front along the soil column cm t is the infiltration time h to facilitate the calculation of infiltration rate eq 1 is written as follows 2 i θ o θ s 2 θ i δ x δ t where δx is the advancing distance of the wetting front along the soil column in δt cm and δt is the infiltration time between two recorded points during the infiltration process h the relationship between soil moisture by volume and by weight is expressed as follows 3 θ v θ w ρ b where θv is the soil moisture by volume cm3 cm 3 θw is the soil moisture by weight and ρb is the bulk density g cm 3 the variations of infiltration rates were obtained with time recorded at each point and were then fitted with smith s 1972 infiltration equation which was used to develop an empirical method for predicting infiltrability and estimating infiltration amounts smith s equation was based on the soil water dynamics and numerical simulation and calculation from abundant rainfall infiltration experiments smith 1972 4 i r t t p i a t t o a i tt p where r is the rainfall intensity mm h 1 tp is the time when ponding started i is the steady infiltration rate mm h 1 to is the time when i tends to be and a is an empirical parameter these parameters a to a and i are related to soil texture initial moisture and rainfall rate infiltration amounts under ponding conditions were determined as follows 5 i t 1 t 2 i t dt where i is the accumulated infiltration amount from t1 to t2 during the infiltration process the accumulated infiltration amounts were also obtained from the reading variations in the marriotte s bottle to evaluate the infiltration amounts to ensure the results were within reasonable limits the fitting with statistical analysis was conducted using origin 9 0 3 results 3 1 precipitation and temperature characteristics the precipitation and temperature had distinctive characteristics in different seasons fig 3 the precipitation in july and august had the greatest variability with standard deviations sd of 53 69 and 65 99 respectively which ranked as the top two precipitation amounts in these two months were the highest the precipitation peaked in august up to 270 37 mm and was mainly concentrated in june july august and september the period which was recognized as the rainy season in this period surface runoff grew due to the increasing amounts of precipitation concentrated and large amounts of rainfall water were the driving force of soil loss although the total precipitation including snow water equivalent decreases during winter the mean snowpack depth is equal to around 30 cm leading to a significant snowmelt during the spring time the temperature was the highest in august with the mean value of 21 68 c and the lowest in january with the mean value of 19 90 c the temperature started to rise above 0 c in march and april the months which were recognized as the melt season the precipitation was abundant till october with a maximum of 122 49 mm when the temperature fell below 0 c in the freezing period the amplitude of the freeze thaw cycles in this area is approximately 15 c the accumulated snow through the winter led to the intense melting runoff in the early spring in the next year and this snowmelt water consequently contributed to the loss of thawed soils 3 2 surface runoff and soil erosion variations in the watershed the average monthly surface runoff over the decades was calculated in each hydrological response unit hru of the upland based on five simulations by modelling fig 4 the surface runoff variations showed seasonal characteristics throughout the whole year surface runoff was higher in march and april due to the increasing snowmelt water in early spring and in july and august due to the concentrated precipitation in summer the average runoff reached the peak value of 31 38 mm in april with high values of 23 73 mm and 24 91 mm in july and august respectively the surface runoff variations also indicated that at the earlier stage of cultivation and development of the upland the runoff volumes in april were lower compared with the runoff volumes in periods 4 and 5 in recent years in rainy seasons the runoff volumes in periods 4 and 5 were not the highest surface runoff in april in periods 4 and 5 were 64 35 mm and 35 23 mm on average respectively the highest throughout the whole year it can easily be seen that this watershed experienced growing surface runoff in april july and august snowmelt induced runoff has grown substantially in recent years soil erosion loads from the upland area over the decades were also obtained on the hru scale based on five simulations by modelling fig 5 the average yearly soil erosion load over the decades reached the maximum of 1 46 t ha 1 a 1 in april under the influence of thawing and melting erosion loads were higher in march and april when surface runoff increased due to snowmelt water and in july and august because of concentrated precipitation in months during the melt seasons such as april soils were more likely to be eroded in later years of the study period with high average erosion rates of 2 82 t ha 1 a 1 and 2 10 t ha 1 a 1 for period 4 and period 5 respectively in rainy seasons erosion rates over the decades did not differ much and a distinct erosion peak did not exist except in 1985 and 2001 although the cultivation area gradually decreased soil erosion amounts in april in melt seasons on average generally increased in periods 3 4 and 5 compared with periods 1 and 2 in contrast soil erosion amounts in rainy seasons june july august and september of different periods showed the opposite tendency the amounts decreased from 7275 45 t a 1 and 8718 27 t a 1 in periods 1 and 2 respectively to 4587 79 t a 1 and 5497 72 t a 1 in periods 4 and 5 respectively 3 3 implication for increased soil erosion in rainy and melt seasons concentrated rainfall and melting snow supplied sufficient water for soil some of which penetrated into the soil as percolation water and some of which flowed as surface water above the soil three years of comparisons from 2012 to 2014 between percolation and surface runoff in rainy and melt seasons were analysed after modelling percolation and surface runoff volumes exhibited significant differences in rainy and melt seasons fig 6 in snowmelt periods percolation volume was on average 1 40 times lower than surface runoff volume however percolation increased substantially and was on average 4 10 times higher than surface runoff in rainy seasons the surface runoff volume in snowmelt seasons was 2 97 times higher than in rainy seasons on average the snowmelt runoff in spring was much higher than the rainfall induced runoff in summer this was especially true in 2014 when percolated water accounted for only 24 2 of the total value of the melting percolation and runoff water in the same year approximately 90 0 of the total water flowed into the soil during the rainfall process less percolation was responsible for the increasing surface runoff and the excess surface water easily carried away soil materials which led to severe soil erosion further analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between surface runoff and soil erosion in the rainy season the melt season and the whole year fig 7 the linear fit results of soil erosion loads and surface runoff on a monthly scale suggested that very strong relationships existed between them p 05 the relationship was the most significant n 91 r2 0 903 in melt seasons and weakest n 227 r2 0 793 in rainy seasons which indicated that surface runoff played the key role contributing to soil loss in rainy seasons the monthly runoff volume could reach up to 114 08 mm but for most months the volume was under 40 mm and the 95 predictive intervals generally covered the area when runoff was less than 20 mm fig 7 the scatter plots showed that one runoff volume had an almost identical predicted erosion load at the 95 level in melt seasons as for the whole year the r2 of the linear fit results was 0 799 which suggested that the soil erosion loads were generally determined by surface runoff volumes 3 4 difference in soil infiltrability in rainy and melt seasons infiltration controls the amounts of percolated water and surface runoff soil infiltrability of two bulk densities 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 40 g cm 3 under four treatments ar air dried and rainy am air dried and melt wr wet and rainy wm wet and melt showed significant differences between rainy seasons and melt seasons at the beginning of the infiltration process soil infiltration rates under different conditions did not differ much from the infiltration rates higher than 100 mm h 1 fig 8 for soil with a bulk density of 1 30 g cm 3 infiltrability under the ar treatment in the initial 25 min was significantly higher than under the am treatment then the differences between them gradually narrowed and the final infiltration rate difference which occurred around the 90 min mark of the infiltration process was 2 03 mm h 1 infiltrability under wr was significantly greater than infiltrability under wm in the initial 40 min and the final infiltration rate difference which occurred around the 90 min mark of the infiltration process was 2 33 mm h 1 for soil with a bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 infiltrability decreased faster and remained at lower infiltration rates during the whole process the difference in the initial 30 min between wr and wm varied within the range of 10 mm h 1 to 20 mm h 1 which was greater than the difference between ar and am the final infiltration rates occurring around the 90 min mark remained at approximately 9 06 mm h 1 to 11 6 mm h 1 the above results indicated that infiltrability had decreased in the melt period after the freeze thaw process for every treatment to study the difference in the soil infiltration amounts with increasing time in the melt and rainy seasons while considering the high infiltration rates and amounts at the initial stage of the infiltration process the accumulated infiltration amounts starting from the tenth minute during the experiment were calculated from eqs 4 and 5 the nonlinear fit results using eq 4 are shown in table 2 the predicted infiltration amounts further showed that infiltrability was lower in the melt period compared with that in the rainy period fig 9 for soil with a bulk density of 1 30 cm 3 melt water infiltrated the least into wet soils compared with other treatments the infiltration amount differences after 300 min between melt and rainy treatment were 50 67 mm and 255 24 mm for air dried and wet soil respectively for soil with a bulk density of 1 40 g cm 3 the difference in infiltration amounts for air dried soils was obvious since the initial infiltration period and had increased from 5 64 mm at the beginning to 109 00 mm at the 300 min mark infiltration amounts under wm were slightly higher in the first 55 min but after that became lower compared with wr for wet soils the difference in the final infiltration amount between wm and wr at the 300 min mark was 66 35 mm the weak infiltrability of thawed soils was responsible for the increasing surface runoff and soil loss in march and april bulk density 1 30 g cm 3 for b1 and 1 40 g cm 3 for b2 ar air dried and rainy am air dried and melt wr wet and rainy wm wet and melt 4 discussion 4 1 watershed surface runoff and soil erosion variations the precipitation and temperature in the study area exhibited seasonal variations accompanied by freeze thaw cycles snowmelt and abundant rainfall which led to obvious peak surface flow and in turn soil loss in early spring and summer for snowmelt periods soil moisture increased in a short time when the temperature rose above 0 c and the formation of macro porosity in soils due to thawing may result in the deterioration of soil shear stress and erosion resistance li et al 2013 besides it was observed from this study that the seriously growing runoff amounts owing to warming and melting contributed to the spring erosion peak for rainy periods as the intense precipitation came in summer dense vegetation covers play an important role in soil protection in agricultural areas taguas et al 2017 as reported by sachs and pariente 2017 a high difference in temperature between the rain and the soil surface led to an increase in runoff and erosion the runoff and erosion loads may be lower due to the higher temperature in the air and in the soil in summer hence surface runoff and soil erosion also rose to a higher level due to the concentrated precipitation but the erosion loads in the rainy period were lower than the erosion loads in the snowmelt period surface runoff and soil erosion in the beginning years of cultivation of the upland area were generally lower than those in the later years of the study period although soil loss risks dropped when applying reduced tillage svoray et al 2015 the degradation of soil properties due to long term agricultural exploitation aggravated soil erosion ouyang et al 2018 the increasing trend of soil erosion loads in the melt period was remarkable especially in the recent decades since 2000 which implied that conservation of soils in the early spring in the upland farming area is of great importance especially in areas influenced by melted snow heavily eroded soils experienced a significant decrease in soil and plant productivities yakutina et al 2015 accordingly targeted soil and water conservation measures should be made based on the seasonal variation characteristics of soil erosion 4 2 comparison of infiltrability between rainy and melt season soil erosion loads increased with the increase in surface runoff and there appeared to be a very strong linear relationship between these two in our study it was also shown in a previous study that soil erosion sediment yield and erosion landform had positive correlations with surface flow amounts and energy wang et al 2003 this relationship was the most significant in melt seasons and less obvious in rainy seasons in this study area which was characterized by gentle and long slopes one runoff volume had an almost identical predicted erosion load at a 95 level in melt seasons as indicated in the experiments conducted by ban et al 2017 on thawed soils sediment yields tended to have positive relationships to surface flow volume per unit time even under different slope gradients of 5 and 10 the outcome of our research further highlighted the important role of surface runoff and the significance of reducing runoff in controlling snowmelt induced erosion the results of our downward infiltration experiments on thawed and unfrozen soils indicated that soil infiltrability exhibited significant differences in rainy seasons and melt seasons soil infiltrability under laboratory conditions could be obtained accurately with more time saved mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 for drier soils higher infiltrability was observed which coincided with the study of kane and jean 1983 on seasonally frozen soils although these differences were not striking in the initial phase of the infiltration process infiltration rates of thawed soils decreased more substantially than infiltration rates of unfrozen soils with the infiltration time extended as infiltration rates reached a relatively steady level the rates of thawed soils were also lower than those of unfrozen soils in winter the freeze thaw cycles can reduce soil infiltrability which is especially pronounced when the frequency of these cycles increases due to the changes in the dimension of soil pores fouli et al 2013 these different infiltrabilities between thawed and unfrozen soils will lead to different amounts of percolation water in melt and rainy seasons 4 3 implication for soil erosion peaking in critical periods surface runoff and soil erosion experienced two obvious peaks in early spring and in rainy summer within a given year apparently rainfall is one of the most important drivers of soil erosion panagos et al 2015 and the soil loss peaks are usually considered to have occurred in rainy seasons due to high rainfall amounts and intensities however our results showed that most soils were eroded in the snowmelt periods this is consistent with former findings that thawed soils tended to be more susceptible to being eroded bajracharya et al 1998 snowmelt runoff can lead to severe erosion on farmland and even contribute to regional flooding wade and kirkbride 1998 high infiltration rates generally result in less surface flow and more percolation which is a reflection of the moderate response to the impact of precipitation serrano muela et al 2008 many research studies have been performed to study the relationships between infiltration runoff and soil erosion mamedov et al 2016 this study provided comprehensive information on the dynamics of water movement through soils and the relationship between runoff and soil loss on a watershed scale soil loss is subjected to geomorphic external and internal variabilities kim et al 2016 and soil infiltrability is an important internal factor controlling runoff generation and soil erosion unlike rainy seasons the process of melt water entering into soils always lasts during the entire melt period therefore the thawed soil with decreased infiltrability is at high risk to be eroded in melt periods in mid high latitude areas the land management to protect soils in snowmelt periods is very important and necessary mulching is an effective method to reduce soil erosion in rainy seasons in agricultural lands prosdocimi et al 2016 while for snowmelt periods altering the spatial distributions in runoff generation and infiltration places may contribute to a reduction in soil erosion at watershed scales cerda et al 2017 enhanced infiltration and decreased surface runoff are crucial for soil erosion control in the mid high latitude areas 5 conclusions the combination of experiments and modelling methods in our study afforded a better understanding of watershed soil erosion characteristics and detailed dynamics of water movement through soils in a mid high latitude upland watershed seasonal precipitation and temperature variations led to large snowmelt runoff in spring and rainfall runoff in summer average soil erosion loads reached the maximum of 1 46 t ha 1 a 1 in april and were also high in july and august which followed the same variation trend as runoff the results indicated that soil erosion was highly and positively correlated with surface runoff the decrease in soil infiltrability was responsible for the reduced percolation and in turn the increased surface runoff which led to the excess surface water easily carrying away soil materials soil infiltrability exhibited significant differences between rainy seasons and melt seasons results revealed that with the infiltration time extended thawed soils in melt seasons showed lower infiltrabilities than non frozen soils in rainy seasons particularly soil loss was higher in snowmelt periods than in rainy periods due to the higher surface runoff in early spring decreased soil infiltrability in snowmelt periods also contributed much to this higher surface runoff these findings will help identify critical soil erosion periods in order to make more effective soil management decisions rational measures should be taken to control surface runoff and soil erosion before critical months especially before snowmelt periods further investigation that includes an evaluation of strategies to reduce soil erosion in critical periods may be necessary

7567,the flow dimension parameter n derived from the generalized radial flow model is a valuable tool to investigate the actual flow regimes that really occur during a pumping test rather than suppose them to be radial as postulated by the theis derived models a numerical approach has shown that when the flow dimension is not radial using the derivative analysis rather than the conventional theis and cooper jacob methods helps to estimate much more accurately the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer although n has been analysed in numerous studies including field based studies there is a striking lack of knowledge about its occurrence in nature and how it may be related to the hydrogeological setting this study provides an overview of the occurrence of n in natural aquifers located in various geological contexts including crystalline rock carbonate rock and granular aquifers a comprehensive database is compiled from governmental and industrial sources based on 69 constant rate pumping tests by means of a sequential analysis approach we systematically performed a flow dimension analysis in which straight segments on drawdown log derivative time series are interpreted as successive specific and independent flow regimes to reduce the uncertainties inherent in the identification of n sequences we used the proprietary siren code to execute a dual simultaneous fit on both the drawdown and the drawdown log derivative signals using the stated database we investigate the frequency with which the radial and non radial flow regimes occur in fractured rock and granular aquifers and also provide outcomes that indicate the lack of applicability of theis derived models in representing nature the results also emphasize the complexity of hydraulic signatures observed in nature by pointing out n sequential signals and non integer n values that are frequently observed in the database keywords diagnostic plot drawdown log derivative signal flow dimension theis derived models complex aquifers field data 1 introduction the discrepancy between the complexity of real flow behavior and the simplicity of analytical flow models makes the interpretation of transient well tests an ambiguous and imprecise task hydrogeology practitioners routinely interpret constant rate pumping tests by matching theoretical type curves obtained from theis derived models thus ignoring the real flow regime that occurs during the test and neglecting the idealized theis assumptions that suppose a totally penetrating well the homogeneity of the aquifer and the infinite acting radial flow this matching procedure or fit requires the practitioner to make the implicit postulate that the flow regime is cylindrical radial the term flow regime refers here to the pressure behavior and does not relate to any laminar or turbulent flow regimes as defined by the reynold number while cylindrical radial flow is a common pumping test response the careful examination of well test results from a variety of geologic environments reveals that other non cylindrical radial flows are also common and that they may change over the course of a well test theis derived models are only valid for cylindrical radial flow their application to systems with non cylindrical radial behaviors may lead to a significant degree of error leading to a poor understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer and requiring a substantial degree of approximation when estimating the aquifer s hydraulic properties as stated by le borgne et al 2004 the estimation of the transmissivity t and the storage coefficient s depend directly on the flow dimension value as t b 3 n k and s b 3 n s s this paper uses an extensive database of both fractured and non fractured environments to show that non cylindrical radial flow regimes are widespread and must be considered in the analysis of well test data one of the fundamental issues in hydrogeology is the capability of estimating aquifer s hydraulic parameters in a more representative and accurate manner for instance hydraulic conductivity k is an essential parameter used to characterize groundwater flow fields predict contaminant transport carrera 1993 rozemeijer et al 2010 barlow and coupe 2012 and delineate wellhead protection areas whpa bear and jacobs 1965 wyssling 1979 todd 1980 grubb 1993 it is essential to reduce the degree of uncertainty of k because this value controls the size shape and location of wellhead capture zones bhatt 1993 forster et al 1997 fadlelmawla and dawoud 2006 paradis et al 2007 barry et al 2009 in 1989 in the petroleum literature bourdet et al proposed that in addition to plotting the pressure data p practitioners and modellers should also plot the pressure derivative signal dp dlogt this is easily implemented in hydrogeology in the form of the drawdown log derivative signal ds dlogt renard et al 2009 rather than using a simple drawdown signal s the derivative approach makes the signal much more sensitive to small variations of drawdown the diagnostic plots representing the combined plots of both s and ds dlogt versus time are thus used in particular to improve the interpretation of constant rate pumping tests two different methods can be employed to interpret this derivative signal matching type curves over the entire signal or decomposing the signal into straight lines in the first method an analytical flow model is selected and its theoretical curve is matched to the derivative data the match is generally performed using automatic best fitting codes leveinen et al 1998 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 verbovšek 2009 to select the analytical model that most suitably represents the real flow regime ds dlogt is considered the second method is a straight line analysis that consists in decomposing the hydraulic signal into straight lines that are interpreted separately from each other in terms of their hydrodynamic behavior usually plotted on a log log scale the diagnostic plots make it possible to better take into consideration the heterogeneity of aquifers using this sequential approach of flow regimes the hydraulic properties of the aquifer can be estimated according to the tds tiab s direct synthesis philosophy tiab 1994 1995 this approach chiefly used in the petroleum literature establishes equations based on the intersections points and slopes of the ds dlogt straight lines to estimate the parameters of the well and of the aquifer that control the flow regime petroleum researchers developed equations for specific conceptual models established in view of determining parameters such as permeability skin factor wellbore storage coefficient hydraulic conductivity of fractures half fracture length and drainage area tiab 2005 escobar et al 2007 escobar et al 2010 escobar et al 2012 the flow dimension is a parameter proposed by barker in 1988 it expresses the evolution of the shape of the pressure front pulse as it diffuses through the aquifer during the transient stage of pumping the flow dimension identifies by a value n 2 the occurrence of a cylindrical radial flow regime during the pumping test associated with a zero slope of ds dlogt when plotted on the log log axis the non cylindrical radial flow dimensions are easily recognised when ds dlogt displays a rising straight line positive slope for n 2 and a declining straight line negative slope for n 2 the interpretation of pumping tests supposing cylindrical radial flow is thus performed more accurately and swiftly by easily detecting when the theis derived assumptions are suitable this better compliance with assumed and real flow geometries may reduce uncertainties in the determination of hydraulic properties as stated by black 1994 if the flow dimension is assumed to be 2 while in fact it is closer to 1 the hydraulic diffusivity will be underestimated furthermore for the specific case of n 2 k is directly estimated from the y axis intercept of ds dlogt on log log scales barker 1988 for cases where a vertical fault produces a bilinear flow regime n 1 5 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 developed an equation that makes it possible to estimate k graphically without type curve matching the most significant advantage of the flow dimension lies in the fact that it provides a relationship between the drawdown log derivative signal and the flow regime occurring during the pumping test for any hydrodynamic circumstance cylindrical radial and non cylindrical radial flow regimes the ds dlogt approach significantly improves the transient test interpretation method because makes it possible to investigate the flow regimes detected by the transient test instead of assuming them despite its diagnostic potential for interpreting transient well tests the n parameter is still seldom used due to the difficulty of relating the flow dimension values to conceptual aquifer conditions such as flow patterns and geological settings so far only a few values of n have been assigned a physical interpretation and thus its diagnostic potential remains only partially exploited advances in the conceptual understanding of n have been achieved though several numerical modelling studies these studies concentrate on the influence exerted by various configurations or mechanisms on the ds dlogt signal we may mention research works that have focused on the geometry of the boundaries beauheim and roberts 1998 walker and roberts 2003 escobar et al 2005 2007 the wellbore effects jourde et al 2002b escobar et al 2012 the properties of fractured rock jourde et al 2002a cello et al 2009 and the properties of faults gringarten et al 1974 cinco ley et al 1978 abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 these studies contributed to the evolution of the physical conceptualization of flow regimes they proposed specific conceptual models to interpret the flow geometry the configuration of the hydraulic properties and the boundary conditions of a specific flow regime sequence in the literature the flow dimension parameter is sporadically used to characterize the hydraulic properties of aquifers leveinen et al 1998 liang et al 2012 only a few studies have described the frequency of occurrence of n in nature one in dolomite verbovšek 2009 2011 one in fractured limestone audouin and bodin 2008 one in fractured crystalline rock kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 and one in weathered crystalline rock maréchal et al 2004 other studies have provided specific case study analyses one in granitic and carbonate rocks bangoy et al 1992 one in poorly weathered crystalline rock leveinen 2000 sixteen in evaporite deposits beauheim and roberts 2002 and five in fractured rock aquifers lods and gouze 2004 these studies showed that the majority of n values lie within a range of 1 3 and that the radial flow dimension is seldom observed table 4 the authors kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 audouin and bodin 2008 verbovšek 2009 each analyzed only one geological family they limited themselves to correlating the distribution of n with the geology but did not propose a hypothesis regarding the conceptual model or the geological facies that provide the water supply and control the flow regimes furthermore the majority of the wells analyzed in these studies belong to the same aquifer the observations and conclusions of these studies should be examined by comparing aquifers in various locations this article proposes to open novel perspectives as it examines the distribution of n in various geological environments in nature we examine constant rate pumping tests lasting 3 1 days on average performed in various aquifers composed of fluvio glacial deposits crystalline and carbonate rocks this study has two main objectives i to survey the suitability of theis and theis derived model assumptions for reproducing flow dimensional behaviors in natural aquifers ii to provide objective and comprehensive records of occurrences of natural flow dimension with insights on the relationships between n and the features of various different aquifers over the last three decades flow dimensions have been subjectively reported in the literature in the context of introductions of published articles describing specific interpretative models the real distribution of flow dimension values in various types of natural media have remained undocumented even though flow dimension undoubtedly constitutes a key and reliable indicator of the physical attributes of an aquifer comparing flow dimension distribution patterns against their associated geological frameworks will provide insights about their possible conceptual interpretation this study is the first to attempt to perform a statistical analysis of the flow dimensions observed in nature based on a sequential derivative analysis and to provide an initial portrait of the flow dimension distribution in both fractured rock aquifers and fluvio glacial deposits in an n sequential analysis the log log plot of the drawdown log derivative signal is considered a diagnostic tool it is used to help interpret the flow geometry the aquifer geometry and the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties all there of which are detected as the pressure font pulse expands through the aquifer we will firstly review the basic concepts of the grf model and then propose a reinterpretation of transient pumping tests conducted in wells to this end we will use a database derived from 69 constant rate pumping tests lasting 3 1 days on average conducted in the framework of consulting projects for municipal groundwater supplies in the province of quebec canada in france and in tunisia a flow dimension sequence diagnostic approach is adopted for this reinterpretation of pumping tests meaning that each slope of the drawdown log derivative signal is interpreted as a specific and independent flow regime such analysis may be efficiently performed using the proprietary siren code specifically designed to routinely interpret flow dimension sequences by simultaneously fitting drawdown and drawdown log derivative data respectively on semi log and log log plots this approach combines the advantages of both plots the former is weakly influenced by pumping rate changes but grossly insensitive to flow regime the latter is highly sensitive to flow regime changes but subject to strong noise effects due for instance to pumping rate instabilities this study aims at contributing to our understanding of the physical interpretation of n through a statistical analysis of its natural occurrences in various geological media and by comparing the hydrodynamic interpretation of n against the conceptual models of the geology surrounding the wells finally some ideas will be discussed regarding current practices in hydrogeology and the diagnostic potential of an approach which combines conventional plots drawdown log derivative plots and flow dimension analysis while an extensive review of interpretative models using log derivative analysis is beyond the scope of this paper existing flow regime sequences will be investigated in detail and compared to the theoretical and geological conceptual models 2 theory and practice 2 1 conventional analysis the theis model 1935 describes a transient cylindrical radial flow induced by a constant rate pumping test within a confined homogeneous isotropic horizontal slab totally screened and laterally infinite aquifer in such conditions also called infinite acting radial flow iarf conditions the pressure front diffuses radially in the form of concentric circles fig 1 the pressure front pulse generates an equipotential cross flow surface a r which grows radially in the shape of a cylinder fig 1 producing the ideal cylindrical radial flow conditions referred to as theis aquifers a distinction must be made between the theis model and the concept of radial flow regime which strictly describes the proportional relationship between the cross flow surface a and the travelled distance r from the pumping well regardless of the shape of this surface most analytical solutions published during the three last decades in the petroleum literature and classically used in the diagnostic plot approach bourdet et al 1983 renard et al 2009 account for some variations on the cylindrical radial flow theme including either its combination with some external sources unconfined aquifers leaky aquifers as described by hantush 1956 1960 some specific overlaying of several theis aquifers dual porosity models leaky aquifers as described by neuman and witherspoon 1969 these models actually describe various types of radial flow regimes which in itself does not signify that the flow geometry they are modelling remains ideally cylindrical radial in this study these models will hereafter be referred to as theis derived models in a system characterized by a diffuse short scale field of heterogeneities t and s may be averaged over the cross flow area a r making it possible to estimate the properties of the aquifer as being continuous and homogeneous when the pressure front pulse reaches a large scale heterogeneity within the aquifer its shape may be deformed leading to modifications in the equipotential surface growth pattern the cylindrical radial flow regime assumption can no longer be applied rendering any theis derived model irrelevant numerical modelling by meier et al 1998 and sánchez vila et al 1999 showed that for late time drawdown and under cylindrical radial flow conditions the cooper jacob approximation allows a good approximation of transmissivity but an erroneous estimation of storage coefficient in systems with a diffuse heterogeneity field and a radially convergent flow meier et al 1998 pechstein et al 2016 these studies validated the applicability of the cooper jacob model in specific heterogeneous domains with diffuse transmissivity fields and a concentric heterogeneous storage conditions that allow the establishment of a cylindrical radial flow regime meier et al 1998 concluded their study by explaining that further numerical studies with three dimensional flow conditions are needed to analyze flow behavior in aquifers with variable thicknesses cases of an increasing aquifer thickness dal soglio 2012 rafini et al 2014 or a partially screened or a partially penetrated aquifer moncada et al 2005 escobar et al 2012 ferroud et al 2015 have been numerically documented to produce spherical flow regimes in these non cylindrical radial conditions theis derived approaches are undoubtedly unsuitable 2 2 the generalized radial flow model 2 2 1 basic concepts the generalized radial flow grf model was proposed by barker in 1988 in response to the inability of conventional models to reproduce the flow within the fractured aquifer of stripa mine barker 1988 the concept of the grf model is based on a proportional relationship between a l2 the cross flow area and rn 1 the radial distance from the borehole of the pressure front pulse to the power of the flow dimension minus one eq 1 1 a r r n 1 the parameter n is a value that must be determined empirically and which may not have an integer value barker 2007 n reflects the rate by which the cross flow area changes as a function of the distance from the well as the pressure front pulse extends outwards and reaches heterogeneities within the aquifer it may be deformed in such a manner that eq 3 is modified inducing changes in the flow dimension the sequences of n thus reflect flow regime changes induced by some variations in the physical or hydraulic features in the aquifer short pumping tests because they induce only a limited cross flow area expansion in the aquifer mainly reflect wellbore effects and a small proportion of the aquifer in the vicinity of the well it is the long term pumping tests that may more accurately reflect the aquifer signal sensu stricto and the influence of boundary conditions the term flow regime thus refers to the behavior of the pressure front pulse as it moves through the aquifer it is worth noting that the sequential analysis we employ in this study is an extension of the grf model since barker 1988 defined media with constant n values assuming homogeneous conditions by verifying the validity of barker s equation eq 1 in a non uniform faulted aquifer rafini and larocque 2009 2012 proved that n is a valuable tool for interpreting the successive flow regimes that occur during a medium or long term pumping test even if the aquifer does not have grf like properties in accordance with barker s postulates each value of n independently observed at different times during the pumping test represents the dominant flow regime felt at that time by the pressure front pulse as it diffuses throughout the aquifer around the well at a distance r t using the grf concept barker 1988 introduced the flow dimension n in the diffusivity equation the generalized diffusivity equation is written as eq 2 2 k r n 1 r r n 1 h r s s h t where k lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity r l is the radial distance from the borehole at time t t n is the flow dimension ss l 1 is the specific storage and h l is the hydraulic head based on eq 2 using the laplace transform tables and supposing constant head boundaries a zero initial head and a long time t or a short distance r barker predicts the hydraulic head distribution as eq 3 3 h r t q 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v 4 kt s s v γ 1 v r 2 v v 0 4 v 1 n 2 with b the extent of the flow zone l and γ the gamma function note that eq 3 is the asymptotic form of grf s general solution valid for u small enough with u ssr 2 4kt which is an incomplete gamma function eq 3 can be rewritten with a time dependent term ct v and time independent term c as 5 h t ct v c with 6 c q 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v 4 k s s v and 7 c q 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v γ 1 v r 2 v deriving eq 5 with respect to time shows that the drawdown log derivative ds dlogt time series eq 8 displayed on a log log plot forms a straight line with slope ν providing a mean of a straightforward graphic determination of the flow dimension using eq 4 8 ds dlogt t 2 3 ds dt c 2 3 vt v from a practical standpoint when interpreting drawdown time series at the pumping well the asymptotic condition is reached very early and can be considered valid during the whole aquifer related response beyond the early influence of the wellbore effects note that in the petroleum literature this asymptotic flow behavior is also named infinite acting behavior according to eqs 4 and 8 the derivative signal depends on q k ss b and n thus any modification of these parameters will be felt by the derivative signal note that only changes of k and ss will temporarily invalidate the asymptotic assumption of the derivative signal eq 3 is valid when u is small enough yet straight derivative segments represent a sufficient proof of the validation of the asymptotic assumption before the pressure front pulse reaches the hydraulic boundaries each straight line segment is associated with a n value and represents a flow period during which q k ss and b are constant and or uniform as stated by beauheim et al 2004 and rafini et al 2017 we suggest that the flow dimension should be estimated from a constant straight line of ds dlogt that lasts at least one log cycle we favor this graphic approach eq 8 without type curve matching because it allows us to decompose the signal in a sequence of successive flow regimes associated to specific geological facies and flow behaviors because n is directly determined from the ds dlogt straight line slopes which implies that it can assume any integer and non integer value it is a valuable parameter for statistically analysing the flow regimes of natural aquifers 2 2 2 conceptual interpretation of n the main known flow dimensions interpreted using eq 1 are briefly summarized in this section for further details the reader is invited to refer to the original papers n 0 ν 1 observed early in the pumping test this unit slope line of the drawdown log derivative refers to wellbore effects skin and wellbore storage tiab 1993 mattar 1997 observed late in the pumping test this flow regime may express the attainment of a stagnant state pseudo steady state flow as described by mattar 1997 achieved when all the outer boundaries are no flow boundaries i e when the reservoir depressurizes without spatial diffusion of drawdown n 1 ν 0 5 the linear flow implies that the cross flow area remains constant as the pressure wave travels through the aquifer such conditions are observed in long and narrow systems which may be found i in granular channelized aquifers fluvial and deep sea fans escobar et al 2004a escobar and montealegre m 2007 escobar et al 2010 corbett et al 2012 ii in fractured media containing an infinite conductivity vertical fault gringarten and witherspoon 1972 gringarten et al 1974 iii in fractured rocks with a finite conductivity one dimensional conduit formed by the intersection of fractures and iv in karst systems maréchal et al 2008 a linear flow can also be observed in a planar fracture with channeling or preferred flow paths tsang and neretnieks 1998 n 2 ν 0 the radial flow regime is observed when the cross flow area grows proportionally to the radial distance r such a condition can be produced by a cylindrical radial flow regime this flow regime is generally associated with a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer of uniform thickness but other conceptual models may produce a radial flow dimension heterogeneous media may also produce a radial flow regime such as a well located close to a vertical fault when the matrix supply masks the signature of the fault cinco ley et al 1978 rafini and larocque 2009 or an orthogonal discontinuity network jourde et al 1998 n 3 ν 0 5 the spherical flow regime is observed when the cross flow area expands proportionally to r 2 according to eq 4 a spherical flow dimension is represented by a 0 5 negative slope of ds dlogt which reflects a drawdown rate deceleration that may be observed early in the pumping test when the screen is very short relative to the aquifer for instance a spherical flow regime can be induced by a point source between packers by a partially penetrating well by a partially completed well or by a restricted producing interval culham 1974 moncada et al 2005 escobar et al 2012 ferroud et al 2015 n non integer the fractional non integer flow regimes which are frequently exhibited by field data diagnostic plots have long been interpreted as being related to the geometry of the source barker 1988 or to the fractal properties of the fractured media barker 1988 polek et al 1989 chang and yortsos 1990 bangoy et al 1992 acuna and yortsos 1995 by analysing fractured systems that are generated from a fractal model using a discrete fracture network other authors geier et al 1996 winberg 2000 cello et al 2009 showed that there exists a relationship between the flow dimension parameter and the connectivity of fractures other authors like jourde et al 1998 interpreted the fractional flow dimension to be related to the connectivity of fractures in an orthogonal fracture network in tabular stratified aquifers in 1991 the interpretation of fractional flow dimensions was widened to involve new considerations in fact doe 1991 opened the fractional flow dimension definition to non fractal geometries which are not space filling in other words euclidian configurations with heterogeneity either in conductivity or geometry or a combination of both can produce non integer values of n bowman et al 2012 simulated the flow through high transmissivity conduits characterized by non radial and simple geometries by means of the flow dimension concepts developed by doe 1991 bowman et al 2012 showed that the variability of conduit shape can generate non integer flow dimensions such as 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 in addition the bilinear flow regime n 1 5 has been reported to reflect the signal of a finite conductive fault supplied by the matrix such a configuration has been demonstrated analytically by abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 and then corroborated numerically by rafini and larocque 2009 the karst systems are also known to generate fractional flow dimension values that generally range between 0 and 1 maréchal et al 2008 giese et al 2017 finally walker and roberts 2003 suggested that the flow dimension depends on the form of the nonstationary transmissivity for instance an aquifer presenting an exponential variation of thickness 3 data and method 3 1 compilation of a pumping well test database a database mainly composed of 69 pumping well tests with a mean duration of 3 1 days ranging from 0 2 to 14 7 days and of local geological information has been established table 1 most of the compiled data come from pumping well tests conducted in the framework of municipal groundwater supply investigations in the province of quebec canada regions of charlevoix haute côte nord chcn saguenay lac saint jean slsj chesnaux et al 2011 and abitibi temiscamingue abte nadeau et al 2015 additional data were obtained from i south eastern quebec mirabel nastev et al 2004 ii various locations in france regions of the alps midi pyrenées nord pas de calais and loire iii the database banque de données du sous sol compiled by the bureau de recherches géologiques et minières brgm and iv in northern tunisia 3 2 data pre processing log derivative data are typically very noisy this may be due to datalogger or operator complications pumping rate variations random diffuse heterogeneity fields and tidal or recharge effects we therefore smooth the data using the algorithm of bourdet et al 1989 which has proven to be one of the most efficient in filtering noise without deteriorating the hydraulic signature escobar et al 2004b the differentiation equation is 9 ds i dx i δ s 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ s 2 δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 with δ s 1 s i s 1 δ s 2 s i s 2 δ x 1 x i x 1 δ x 2 x i x 2 and x log t eq 9 uses 3 points the next and previous points 1 and 2 of point i which are the first to be separated by a minimum length of l the length can thus be adjusted until the noise is attenuated and the signal is no longer distorted the drawing of straight lines is performed manually by considering the differentiation curves for various l values eq 9 furthermore the simultaneous dual fits performed with siren are such that when derivative data are too noisy or disrupted the drawdown fit makes it possible to attenuate the uncertainties inherent in the assessment of derivative linear regressions in order to quantify the quality of each manual fit the coefficient of determination r2 is calculated between the differentiated points and the regression line defined manually fig 2 a displays the effects of pumping rate adjustments at 55 243 and 3390 min on the s and ds dlogt responses on the upper plot s shows a slight translation of the signal for each of the three changes of pumping rate q the rate values are unfortunately not mentioned in the consultant s report but the increase of the drawdown signature suggests an increase of q for each adjustment on the lower plot the ds dlogt signal shows a small number of extreme and noisy data when the pumping rate is increased but afterwards the initial flow regime is rapidly recovered the flow dimension value is thus not influenced by variations in the constant pumping rate fig 2 b shows the effects of an interruption in pump operation between 3 and 4 min on the s and ds dlogt responses on the upper plot s displays a reduction of drawdown associated with an increase of hydraulic head in the well until the pump is restarted approximately 10 min derivative data show a pseudo spherical flow regime n 2 6 which is totally disrupted by the pump interruption indeed between 3 and 10 min fig 2 b the pumping stops and induces a recovery of the signal yielding negative data of the derivative which are not visible on a log log plot when the pump restarts the general trend is rapidly recovered with no evidence of pump disturbance straight line in fig 2 in both case studies fig 2 a and b the derivative signal quickly returns to normal due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial deposit which is estimated in the order of 3 5 10 5 m s note that this value is estimated from a conventional cylindrical radial flow dimension model and therefore it is properly estimated in the case of an aquifer that instead induces a spherical flow dimension numerical simulations were conducted in order to confirm these field observations and to clarify the flow regime behavior when the hydraulic test is affected by pumping rate changes or by a pump shut down the four columns of fig 3 show the drawdown and drawdown log derivative signals of four different conceptual models which are generated in confined conditions using the hydrogeosphere code therrien et al 2010 each of the four conceptual models generates distinct flow dimension sequences from left to right of fig 3 the n sequences are cylindrical radial to linear n 2 1 bilinear to cylindrical radial n 1 5 2 simply cylindrical radial n 2 and spherical to cylindrical radial n 3 2 the cylindrical radial linear n sequence is obtained by generating a flow within a conduit the bilinear to cylindrical radial n sequence is obtained by a well connected to a finite conductive vertical fault supplied by the matrix the cylindrical radial flow regime is modeled with a conventional theis aquifer the spherical radial n sequence is induced by a well that partially penetrates the aquifer from top to bottom fig 3 shows the semi log plot of the drawdown cp1 cp2 cp3 and cp4 the drawdown log derivative signal without pump disturbance a1 a2 a3 and a4 the derivative signal when pumping rate increases occur b1 b2 b3 and b4 and the signal that is disturbed by a pump shut down c1 c2 c3 and c4 for both the change in pumping rate and the pump shut down similarly to the field observations in fig 2 the general trend of the derivative signal is rapidly recovered after the disturbance has stopped in other words the flow dimension value is temporarily disrupted by the pumping rate disturbances but is not dependent on the pumping rate even when the test is altered during a short time period when a pumping rate change occurs the general trend of the flow regime is not impacted furthermore the step rate adjustments are generally observable during the test induced peak noise and have been considered in the interpretation of flow regimes as described by eqs 6 and 8 besides the hydraulic properties k and ss of the aquifer and the extent of the flow zone b the pumping rate q is also a parameter that influences the derivative signal we conducted several numerical tests to observe the impacts of the drift of the pumping rate on the flow dimension value fig 4 a shows numerical results of three situations of the drawdown log derivative signatures of a cylindrical radial flow model obtained in three different pumping rate conditions in one case the pumping rate is constant and in the two other cases we model a gradual drift of the pumping rate in fact the pump performance depends on the well head level fig 4 a shows that the power law variation of the pumping rate influences the value of the flow dimension the linear variation of the pumping rate induces an apparent flow dimension value which can be very different from the flow dimension of the equivalent constant rate model the slopes of the derivative signal and the pumping rate are practically identical fig 4 a according to the grf model barker 1988 the derivative signal is given by eqs 6 and 8 because c is proportional to q when the pumping rate varies according to a power law i e q q0 ta eq 8 can be written as eq 10 10 ds dlogt c v t v q 0 t a 2 3 c v q 0 t v a 2 3 with c written as eq 11 11 c 1 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v 4 k s s v with a the slope of the power law pumping rate drift q t q0 t a thus the slope p of the derivative response plot on a log log graph is eq 12 12 p a v 1 a n 2 consequently the apparent flow dimension napp induced by a power law pumping rate drift can be written as eq 13 13 n app n 2 a for instance in fig 4 a the slope of the increasing power law pumping rate a is equal to 0 38 and the related slope of the derivative signal is equal to 0 44 inducing an apparent flow dimension of napp 1 12 calculated from eq 8 instead of n 2 which is the flow dimension of the constant rate model the apparent flow dimension calculated from eq 14 with the power exponent a of the variable flow rate is equal to napp 1 24 we observe a slight difference between the observed apparent flow dimension equal to 1 12 and the calculated apparent flow dimension equal to 1 24 these numerical tests are only a preliminary study which aims at issuing a warning to practitioners when interpreting the flow dimension because pumping rate drifts can influence the flow dimension value obviously further work is needed to suitably address the issue of pumping rate drift in particular other pumping rate drift behaviors should be analyzed unfortunately the possible distortion of the flow dimension in the database due to pumping rate changes cannot be verified because pumping rate changes during the pumping test were not sufficiently monitored 3 3 geological contexts a distribution of lithological types in each investigated area is provided in table 1 49 of the database originates from pumping test data compiled by rafini 2008 and 51 from data collected within the framework of the paces project programme d acquisition de connaissances sur les eaux souterraines a groundwater knowledge acquisition program funded by the ministry of environment of quebec and in part directed by the université du québec à chicoutimi the quebec bedrock is mainly composed of precambrian crystalline rocks essentially orthogneisses paragneisses granitic intrusions anorthosite and charnockites rondot 1989 the crystalline rocks are disconformably overlaid by non deformed sedimentary deposits composed from depth to surface of limestone to limy limestone sandstone and shale lemieux et al 2003 the limestones generally display a tabular lamination and may include clay interbeds the carbonate rocks are today found only in the valleys or topographic depressions where they have been protected from the intense erosion that occurred during the late quaternary glaciation the crystalline bedrock is interspersed by a complex fault system generated by various successive geological events dating from the precambrian thick sand and gravel horizons overlaying the bedrock are found throughout the province of quebec as the result of the late quaternary glaciation various glacial and fluvio glacial structures such as tills terminal and lateral moraines eskers kame fluvio glacial deltas kettles drumlins and floodplains compose the alluvial landscape of the region the glacial retreat generated numerous eskers particularly widespread in the abitibi temiscamingue region quebec these deposits established by intra glacial meltwater streams in ice tunnels generally present a channelized structure and a stream rate stratification levasseur 1995 marine transgression and regression events led to the deposition of fluvio marine horizons that are represented by a confining clay layer above the fluvio glacial sediments levasseur 1995 in northern tunisia pumping tests were performed exclusively in carbonate rock aquifers composed of limestones from the eocene period that region is characterised by thick stratified strata and finely laminated carbonate rocks rafini 2004 the media is affected by faults formed during the upper jurassic and the cretaceous and reactivated during the pyrenean and alpine compressions the fractured media manifests a negligible karstification and a low matrix porosity the carbonate rocks studied in france are located in alpine and pyrenean forelands composed of dolomite limestone and marls the crystalline media located in the regions of lozère and loire france are characterised by a deeply weathered surficial horizon composed of granitic sand and clay rich materials whose general hydrodynamic behavior have been explained in detail by lachassagne 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 and dewandel et al 2011 some wellbore loggings have reached a horizon composed of fissured rocks or compact rocks underlying the pumped granitic sand aquifer brgm database 3 4 comparison of hydraulic property values estimated from various models in this section the conventional theis and cooper jacob methods and a derivative analysis based on the cylindrical radial flow regime are applied in various conceptual models some models display a long term radial flow regime whereas others show a sequence of radial and non radial flow regimes this analysis composed of numerical and field data aims at comparing the estimated hydraulic properties and to appreciate their degree of uncertainty when using the analytical models derived from the cylindrical radial flow regime assumption four conceptual models are modeled with a constant rate pumping test these conceptual models generate the following n sequences radial linear bilinear radial single stage radial and spherical radial flow regimes that are described in section 2 2 the parameter estimation is performed using a manual type curve matching the theis method theis 1935 and two graphical analyses the cooper jacob semi log method cooper and jacob 1946 and the radial derivative analysis the theis and the cooper jacob solutions are described in kruseman and ridder 1994 the cylindrical radial derivative analysis estimates the hydraulic conductivity for a cylindrical radial flow regime using the following equation eq 14 which is derived from eq 2 14 k 2 3 q m 4 π b with m l the y intercept of the radial flow dimension on a log log plot of ds dlogt and b l the thickness of the cylindrical radial cross flow area for each conceptual model the log log plot of the drawdown derivative signal is analyzed in order to identify the radial portion of the signal and to determine m the values of the hydraulic conductivity k are shown in table 2 the grey lines in table 2 represent the relative errors between the above k value and the modeled k value the simplified diagrams of the table 2 represent from left to right the semi log plot of s versus t of the linear the bilinear the cylindrical radial and the spherical flow dimension when the conceptual model induces a single stage cylindrical radial flow regime the three methods give a good approximation of k the relative error ranges between 0 and 6 table 2 for the radial linear bilinear radial and spherical radial flow regimes the type curve matching and the graphical analysis of conventional methods are difficult to apply because the cylindrical radial flow regime represents only a small portion of the entire signal the cooper jacob plot of the linear flow fig 3 cp1 emphasizes two slopes the first slope slightly underestimates k 13 whereas the second slope strongly underestimates k 99 or can be inadequately interpreted as a no flow boundary the derivative signal shows a short cylindrical radial flow regime at early times before the long term linear flow regime this early times cylindrical radial flow reflecting the cylindrical diffusion of the cross flow area before reaching the impermeable wall of the conduits makes it possible to accurately estimate k with a relative error of 1 table 2 similarly the semi log plot of the spherical flow regime shows two slopes for the same flow regime both strongly underestimate k probably because in addition to not complying with the cylindrical radial flow regime the thickness that is investigated by the cross flow area is different from the real thickness of the aquifer the derivative signal fig 3 a4 shows a short radial flow regime at late times unnoticeable in the semi log plot of s the radial flow regime representing the reach of both the bottom and the top of the aquifer makes it possible to estimate a good approximation of k with a relative error of 11 table 2 overestimating the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix km using the theis and cooper jacob models for the bilinear conceptual model is not surprising because these models assume a homogeneous aquifer and do not take into account the hydraulic conductivity of the fault kf the radial flow regime that is observed after the bilinear flow regime fig 3 a4 represents the matrix related radial flow regime rafini and larocque 2012 this radial stage gives a good approximation of km using eq 14 the cinco ley et al 1978 solution developed for the vertical fault has the advantage of producing a value for kf to conclude the k values estimated from the radial derivative analysis are close to the modeled k value the relative errors are respectively 0 1 4 and 25 for the radial radial linear the bilinear radial and the spherical radial conceptual models the derivative signal has the advantage of clearly highlighting the radial flow regime by a flat horizontal slope of ds dlogt we also analyzed two sets of field data obtained from the sainte anne and the saint eustache wells in order to compare the k values estimated from the four methods that were used in the previous section table 3 the wells are installed in fractured carbonate rocks field observations such as packer tests have highlighted the presence of conductive structures lemieux et al 2006 the two derivative signatures fig 5 show a multi staged signal composed of the characteristic n sequence 4 1 5 2 reflecting a non connected vertical fault media rafini and larocque 2012 the k values estimated for the two pumping tests are close regardless of the method used this similarity in the results is probably related to the fact that the hydraulic conductivities of the matrix and of the fault are close to each other or the transmissivity of the fault is negligible compared to the transmissivity of the matrix 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow dimension versus theis analysis case studies this section describes two different situations that illustrate the benefits of using flow dimension analysis in addition to drawdown only conventional interpretations to better characterize the flow regimes induced by a pumping test 4 1 1 case study 1 fig 6 represents the semi log plot of the drawdown signal upper plots and the bi logarithmic plot of the drawdown log derivative signal lower plots of a 3 day constant rate pumping test conducted in the glacio fluvial deposits of the senneterre esker mirabel quebec canada despite the noise of the drawdown log derivative signal between 100 min and 4230 min the siren code makes it possible to assuredly fit a sub radial 1 n 2 flow dimension by fitting at the same time both the semi log plot of the drawdown which is much less noisy and the lower plot of the drawdown log derivative signal using the traditional cooper and jacob method the drawdown signal is interpreted by drawing two straight lines fig 6 a a first line from 0 3 to 230 min and the second line from 230 to 4320 min the second straight line whose slope is roughly double that of the first line might be interpreted as a second media with a lesser transmissivity or as the attainment of impermeable boundary conditions in a first approximation these two successive straight lines appear as an acceptable linear regression but when visualizing the effect of the fit of these two supposed radial flow regimes upper plot of fig 6 a on a log log plot of ds dlogt lower plot of fig 6 a we see two distinct horizontal straight lines which are obviously an inappropriate representation of the existing data points as shown in fig 6b fitting a 0 35 straight line slope n 1 3 eq 4 onto the ds dlogt signal resulting in a convex curve on the semi log plot of s represents the real data much more accurately the pumping test is performed in an esker a fluvio glacial sedimentary feature that typically contains channels escobar et al 2004a corbett et al 2012 such channels impede the cross flow area to laterally expand during drawdown diffusion remaining constant in these alluvial conduits the flow dimension of eskers is expected to be linear however each of the seven derivative signals of eskers that have been analyzed in this database showed a sub radial flow dimension n 1 3 we interpret this sub radial flow dimension to be related to leakage coming from the surrounding deposits and that supplies the highly transmissive esker conduit this assumption is further explained in the general discussion section using the cooper and jacob model in this case would lead the practitioner to interpret the data as representing a theis aquifer bounded by an impermeable boundary ferris 1949 but cooper jacob is not a valid model to interpret this pumping test rather the flow dimension analysis which fits the data and the conceptual model much more closely is able to detect the presence of a sub radial flow regime this case study illustrates how the identification of flow regime sequences rather than the trivial postulate of a radial flow regime may substantially improve the diagnosis of the aquifer s hydraulic properties a diagnosis which exerts numerous practical implications on resource management e g a wellhead protection area whpa delineation 4 1 2 case study 2 fig 7 represents 3 different examples of pumping test interpretations of a 6 5 day constant rate pumping test performed in a carbonate rock aquifer in the sainte anne des plaines site mirabel quebec canada the same methodology as the one that is used in case study 1 is adopted the reliability of the fitting of the s data upper plots of fig 7 a b c is checked by analysing the match with the ds dlogt signal lower plots of fig 7 a b c as shown in fig 7 a and b neither a long radial flow regime from 1 8 to 400 min fig 7 a neither two successive radial flow regimes one from 1 5 to 30 min and another from 30 to 400 min fig 7 b can adequately reproduce the trend of both the s and ds dlogt signatures even if the match of 1 or 2 radial flow regimes seems to be a rather good approximation on the semi log plot of s the linear regression is visibly inconsistent on a ds dlogt log log plot a much more suitable fit of s and ds dlogt is presented in fig 7 c where the signal is divided in a sequence of flow regimes with various n values on a semi log plot of s values of n 2 n 2 and n 2 show respectively a convex a concave and a straight curve reflecting a rising a declining or a static drawdown rate conceptually these flow regimes can be related to transmissivity patterns bowman et al 2012 showed numerically that n 2 and n 2 may be generated by conduit geometry in which the cross sectional area respectively decreases and increases as a power function of distance finally for n 2 the derivative horizontally straightens and the drawdown signal displays a straight line indicating no change in the drawdown rate which agrees with the cooper jacob model the ds dlogt signal displays a sequence of integer and non integer flow regimes fig 7 c a fractional flow regime n 1 5 from 1 8 to 40min followed by a radial flow regime n 2 from 40 to 500 min this n sequence composed of n 1 5 and n 2 has been numerically shown by rafini and larocque 2012 to be generated by the presence of a vertical finite conductivity fault embedded into an aquifer and not directly connected to the pumping well the n 1 5 segment represents a bilinear flow regime indicating that the pressure front pulse expands through a media composed by a finite conductive fault and the fractured rock continuous like matrix abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 rafini and larocque 2009 in other words during the constant rate pumping test the fault that is supplying the well is at the same time supplied by the matrix inducing a diffusion deceleration that is responsible for the fractional flow regime occurrence rafini and larocque 2009 the radial flow is observed following the bilinear flow regime and indicates that the pressure front pulse diffusion through the matrix is dominant over the pressure front pulse diffusion through the fault the influence of the fault is thus totally masked by the matrix s hydraulic response which predominates over the aquifer s response so far the leaky vertical fault is the only flow model that has been documented to interpret n 1 5 if the area of the cross flow undergoes a change which is proportional to r0 5 this will produce a value of n equal to 1 5 this case study provides another example showing that interpreting pumping test data using the traditional drawdown analysis on semi log plots leads the practitioner to miss most of the information and to perform an invalid or low quality hydrodynamic diagnosis such inappropriate interpretation of flow will induce inaccuracies in the estimation of the aquifer s hydraulic properties for instance assuming a radial flow n 2 in a homogeneous media while the aquifer is in fact composed of a vertical fault that generates a bilinear flow n 1 5 would lead the practitioner to overestimate the matrix s transmissivity to ignore the presence of a water bearing fault or to underestimate the fault s transmissivity 4 2 the occurrences of flow dimension in natural aquifers the scope of this section is to provide an overview of the occurrence of flow dimension in nature and to compare the values of n against their geological settings in order to obtain insights into the physical meaning of flow dimension in terms of what it can tell us about the hydrogeological settings and features note that only derivative slopes which rigorously correspond to a flow dimension are retained slopes more likely relating to transitions and boundary effects no flow or constant head were not included in the database in fact as defined by barker 1988 the flow dimension must reflect the properties of a volume of aquifer investigated by the cross flow area this definition of the flow dimension will be covered in the discussion section 4 2 1 analysis of the entire database 4 2 1 1 flow dimension values the database contains data from 69 well tests conducted in three different geological environments in roughly the same proportions crystalline rocks 19 pumping tests carbonate rocks 28 pumping tests and alluvial deposits 22 pumping tests the pumping tests were performed on average during 2 5 days 63 of the tests ranged from 2 to 4 days the four shortest well tests lasted 4 h 5 5 h 12 h and 15 h whereas the four longest well tests lasted 7 1 days 8 days 9 1 days and 14 7 days analysis of the data from these 69 pumping tests provided flow dimension distribution values ranging between 0 2 and 3 5 with a mean value of 1 7 and a standard deviation of 0 4 other studies have also analyzed the frequency of occurrence of the flow dimension from field data table 4 the frequencies of occurrence of n posited by the studies of bangoy et al 1992 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 audouin and bodin 2008 and verbovšek 2009 2011 bring valuable insight as to how n occurs in fractured rock aquifers each of these 4 studies however is restricted to only one or two fractured rock settings and used n as a tool for refining the characterization of fractured media or to help in selecting the analytical model only one verbovšek 2009 2011 presented a statistical study aiming to analyse the influence of several parameters on n such as the lithological properties of dolomites their age the topographical settings the degree of penetration of the wells etc his study analyzes the statistical occurrence of n in a single geological setting the dolomites our study compared n to various environments such as crystalline and carbonate fractured rocks weathered crystalline rocks and fluvio glacial deposits in order to better understand the relationship between n and the local geological features because statistical studies examine and manipulate direct field information they contribute information in parallel to numerical studies and make it possible to enrich our physical interpretation of n because the data used for the studies of table 4 were obtained by means of various different methodologies to conduct pumping tests packer test slug test pumping test and a wide diversity of procedures to determine flow dimensions manual and automated type curve matching of s or ds dlogt sequential analysis of ds dlogt the studies should be compared with caution indeed the pumping test duration scale is different for all studies implying that the portion of each aquifer investigated by the pressure front pulse is no doubt variable we should remember that short term pumping test studies are only capable of expressing wellbore effects and the behavior of the aquifer in the area closest to the well fig 8 shows the occurrence of frequency of n in the entire database not considering the duration of observation of n the figure shows that there is a wide diversity of n values in particular the large clear bars of fig 8 show that the linear radial and spherical dimensions represent respectively 20 31 and 8 of the 121 flow dimensions analyzed non integer n values are also significantly represented the fractional n values in ranges 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 represent respectively 3 24 11 and 1 of all n values which together amount to a total of 38 of fractional flow dimension values radial flow regimes are observed in 55 of the 69 pumping tests and represent 31 of the 121 flow regimes that were interpreted overall large bars in fig 8 these radial flow regime occurrences are observed systematically in a sequence of several flow regimes with non radial flow dimensions as a result i the unique radial flow conditions as stipulated by theis are rarely observed in this database ii radial flow is observed only 31 of the overall reported flow regimes while it is assumed in an overwhelming majority of existing interpretative models in fact most analytical models published in the petroleum literature since the 80 s are variations on the radial theme the fact that we are now able to observe predominantly non radial flow dimensions emphasizes the need to develop interpretative models that represent the real dimension of flow more accurately than theis and theis derived models which remain commonly used it is interesting to note that the n values smaller than 2 equal to 2 and greater than 2 are associated with different flow behaviors 0 n 2 is related to an increase of the drawdown rate thus the head decline accelerates while n 2 expresses a decline of the drawdown rate thus the head decline decelerates a summary of the hydrodynamics of each class is given in table 5 based on the barker relation eq 1 the n values ranging between 0 and 1 are interpreted as a decrease of the cross flow area as it expands radially this can suggest a reduction of the transmissivity as the pressure front pulse expands or for n 0 a depletion of the aquifer the n values equal to 1 are associated with a cross flow area that is constant eq 1 suggesting that the pressure wave is diffusing through a channelized environment as explained above all the values of n 1 express an increase of a r table 3 that is induced by various geometries of boundaries transmissivity configurations fault matrix relations etc cf section 2 2 2 4 2 1 2 flow regime duration the duration of flow regimes is a critical point of the flow dimension analysis this issue was addressed by computing the mean of the logarithmic duration of n calculated as follows the number of observation of n of a pumping test of the logarithmic duration of n of a pumping test of the logarithmic durations of n of the entire database the thin dark bars of fig 8 represent the mean of the logarithmic duration of n right axis and the large bars of fig 8 show the frequency of occurrence of n left axis presenting these two types of information in combination shows that the most frequently observed flow dimensions are not necessarily the longer lasting ones in fact the thin dark bars show that the most stable long term flow dimensions are n 2 4 n 1 3 and n 1 6 which are observed during respective averages of 2 36 2 28 and 2 17 log cycles the sub radial flow dimension n 1 3 which is almost exclusively observed in alluvial deposits is observed during a long lasting duration 2 3 log cycles in average the bilinear flow dimension n 1 5 mostly observed in fractured rocks is observed during 1 9 log cycle on average on the contrary the radial flow dimension n 2 is one of the most frequent flow dimensions of the database 31 of the 121 flow dimensions but it is also one of the shortest lasting flow dimensions on average n 2 is observed during less than one log cycle 0 97 log cycle in average in fact in all the various geological settings n 2 has generally been observed at the beginning of the pumping tests and during a short time period the linear flow dimension n 1 is also related to a long lasting signal 1 7 log cycles in average and is observed in equal proportions between the alluvial deposits 7 the carbonates 8 and the crystalline rocks 5 insights on the conceptual interpretation of the observed flow dimensions are given in the following section by combining the values and the duration of n and the geological settings this figure also shows some relationships between the n values and the geological environments for instance n 1 3 is exclusively observed in alluvial deposits while n 1 5 and n 2 5 are almost exclusively observed in fractured rocks the affinity of n to certain environments suggests that the geological facies influences the geometry of the pressure wave and so the flow dimension it may be thus a valuable tool to explore the properties of the aquifer that control the flow regimes 4 2 1 3 flow dimension sequences the flow dimension values included the database are only those that are assumed to be representative of the properties of a volume of aquifer however the flow dimension sequence takes into account every slope of a signal thus for certain signals the wellbore effects transitions and or hydraulic boundaries are considered into the sequence most signals exhibit several successive flow regimes marked by different n values 88 of the pumping tests analyzed for this study were multi stage with 38 44 and 6 presenting respectively 2 3 and 4 sequences of flow dimensions fig 9 the n sequences express various geological facies that control the pressure wave and which are successively reached by this pressure wave fractured media produce a major proportion of n sequential signals they represent respectively 85 100 and 96 of the pumping tests performed in faulted crystalline rocks altered crystalline rocks and carbonate rocks this suggests that fractured media are complex heterogeneous systems involving various flow regimes fig 9 at early times a change of derivative slope may signal the evolution from wellbore and skin effects to the aquifer response at middle times and late times as the pressure front pulse expands through the aquifer variable slope sequences of ds dlogt can express changes in the hydraulic and or geometrical conditions of the aquifer transitions and or eventually the attainment of hydraulic boundaries note that the derivative signatures that are related to skin effects wellbore storage effects or hydraulic boundaries have not been included in the flow dimension database sequences of flow regimes have often been reported in various field and numerical studies conducted in fractured rock aquifers ehlig economides 1988 mattar 1997 escobar et al 2005 renard et al 2009 rafini and larocque 2012 this study based on an n sequential analysis further shows that contrary to current opinion alluvial deposits can also exhibit complex flow behaviors with discontinuous flow regimes and fractional n values primarily ranging from 1 to 2 a wide array of n values was observed in the database in different sequences of various durations and with varying frequencies of occurrence the following section describes the results obtained when comparing the flow regimes to the geological environments of wells in order to obtain insights on the physical interpretation of n 4 2 2 analysis of the distribution of n in different geological environments 4 2 2 1 crystalline rock aquifers based on 19 pumping tests the frequency histogram of n in crystalline rock aquifers displays scattered and highly variable values the faulted crystalline rocks fcr studied are located in canada while the altered crystalline rocks acr studied are located in france because the sequences and values of n are different between the 2 groups they were analyzed separately the fcr group of pumping tests which produced 24 distinct flow regimes with 13 pumping tests showed various n values characteristic of long lasting flow regimes the most significant n values are 1 2 5 2 1 5 representing respectively 38 21 17 and 8 of the fcr n and lasting respectively 1 6 1 5 0 9 and 2 7 log cycles fig 10 a the occurrence of linear n 1 and bilinear flow regimes n 1 5 in these environments corroborate their common conceptual interpretation as expressing the presence of conductive fractures n 1 has been attributed by gringarten et al 1974 1975 to an infinite conductivity fracture and by cinco ley et al 1978 and cinco ley and samaniego 1981 to a finite conductive fracture early pumping time the first conceptual model assumes a matrix linear flow originating from the uniformly depressurized fault which consequently acts as a planar source while the second model stipulates a linear flow occurring into the fault before the embedding matrix is depressurized the embedding environment is assumed to behave like a continuous porous media which means that the fracture network is dense with a sufficiently high degree of connectivity obviously any flow model that produces a diffusion of the cross flow area that does not change with distance will produce a linear flow regime linear flow regimes may also be produced in hard rock aquifers from one dimensional flow conduits formed at the intersection of two fractures or faults eq 1 in channels along the fault plane figueiredo et al 2016 or when a fracture set controls the flow in one direction the value n 1 5 has been associated with an aquifer composed of a vertical finite conductive fault supplied by a continuous theissian matrix with a hydraulic conductivity lower than the fault cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981 rafini and larocque 2012 the fractional values of n which range between 1 and 2 e g n 1 2 or n 1 7 have not to this date been assigned a conceptual description with the exception of n 1 5 some assumptions on the physical interpretation of sub radial flow dimensions can however be made regarding the properties of faulted fractured networks the distribution of transmissivity around the well and the geometry of faults or boundaries the only limitation is that the diffusion of the pressure disturbance must satisfy eq 1 for instance as stated by bowman et al 2012 n is influenced either by the geometry of flow conduits or by leakage effects into the conduits according to raghavan 2004 a decreasing permeability with distance from the wellbore leads to an increase of the ds dlogt signal 0 n 2 several authors have associated fractional flow dimensions to the scale invariant properties of fracture networks chang and yortsos 1990 bangoy et al 1992 acuna and yortsos 1995 de dreuzy et al 2000 doughty and karasaki 2002 walker et al 2006 following this principle it has been shown that fractional flow responses represent to a diffusion slow down into fractal networks and n is a function of the fractal dimension and the anomalous diffusion coefficient which likely indicates the presence of connectivity more recently figueiredo et al 2016 interpreted the sub radial flow dimension values to be related to the density of channel intersections or when a fracture is intersected by more than one inflow and one outflow fractures and local heterogeneities as a function of distance from the pumping well the sub spherical flow regime n 2 5 also occurs predominantly in our study by analysing both the lithostratigraphy of wellbore loggings and n we observe that this flow regime is statistically correlated with fractured rocks that are supplied by an overlying granular horizon obviously further field data and consistent numerical results are needed to establish any link between this flow dimension and possible leakage effects however one author doe 2002 stated that for a planar conductor a horizontal and tabular aquifer generating a radial flow regime leakage over the conductor surface may lead to a dimension somewhat greater than 2 no proof was presented this phenomenon will be investigated in future works note that 23 of cases in the fcr group show negative unit slopes of the ds dlogt signal which suggests that there are transitions to higher values of hydraulic properties rafini et al 2017 or transitions to another flow dimension value rafini and larocque 2012 or transitions to constant head boundary conditions walker and roberts 2003 transitions in fcr aquifers reflect heterogeneity of the fractured media when constant head boundary effects are observed in the fcr aquifers this reflects the existence of hydraulic relationships between the fractured media and lakes or rivers on the surface or may reflect a significant increase of the hydraulic conductivity or of the storage coefficient for instance a system of minor faults intersecting a major fault the acr group composed of 6 pumping tests and 10 n values is represented by flow dimension values ranging from 0 6 to 3 5 fig 10 b the spherical and the radial flow dimensions are frequently observed and each represents 18 but the radial flow is only observed during a short period of time the radial flow dimension is observed at early times or at late times depending on the derivative signatures the acr group is composed of sub linear n 0 8 linear n 1 sub radial n 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 radial n 2 sub spherical n 2 7 spherical n 3 and hyper spherical spherical n 3 5 flow dimensions comparatively to the fcr group the acr group demonstrates a lesser proportion of linear flow values and a greater proportion of n values higher than 2 7 the spherical flow dimension is observed in the acr group whereas it is not observed in the fcr group these features may be expressions of the effects of chemical alterations on fcr aquifers indeed chemical alteration increases the fracture density and the connectivity between fractures leading to a thicker flow media in which the pressure front pulse can expand more easily the altered rock aquifers are characterised by granitic sand overlaying a fractured weathered layer requiring the use of a screened borehole chemical alteration processes tend to increase the connectivity of existing fractures leading to an enhancement of the permeability of hard rock aquifers lachassagne 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 worthington et al 2016 according to these authors chemical processes such as the swelling of certain minerals can widen fractures as may be expected such expansion of the volume and hydraulic activity of fractures is revealed by a statistical increase of the flow dimension as observed here as well as a higher occurrence of the spherical flow regime in this context the spherical flow regime likely reflects conditions of a partially penetrating well in other words a situation in which a full volume aquifer which has a thickness much greater than the screened or open borehole window escobar et al 2012 ferroud et al 2015 this supposes that the density and connectivity of the fracture network are sufficiently high presumably as a consequence of weathering for the network to behave like a three dimensional continuum conceptually the well is associated with a point source involving a cross flow area expansion in the form of concentric spheres the value of n greater than 3 n 3 5 which is a long term and low noise signal fig 11 is enigmatic and requires more field and numerical investigations in order to be better understood however we provide some possible explanations in the general discussion section 4 2 2 2 carbonate aquifers the histogram of carbonate rock aquifers was established based on 29 pumping tests located in the regions of mirabel chcn slsj quebec nord pas de calais midi pyrénées france and kef tunisia the most observed n values are n 2 1 3 1 2 1 5 2 5 representing respectively 42 13 10 6 6 and 6 of the carbonate group lasting respectively 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 1 6 1 8 log cycles fig 10 c in terms of the ratio between the frequency of occurrence of n and its average log duration the radial flow regime is the most significant rafini and larocque 2012 demonstrated that a radial flow regime can be generated by horizontal faults jourde et al 2002 stipulated that a radial flow regime can be observed in an orthogonal discontinuity network when the fractures are well connected in general when the pressure front pulse is large enough smaller occasional heterogeneities will exert only a negligible impact on the large scale flow behavior in such a case the aquifer would be associated with an equivalent continuous media where a radial flow regime is feasible furthermore in fractured carbonate rocks the flow is supposed to be mainly governed by horizontal plane fractures that are cross connected by vertical fractures novakowski and lapcevic 1988 zanini et al 2000 such a conceptual model is well supported by the large proportion of n 2 values reported in these environments the early time radial flow observed in our database may indicate that the bedding plane fractures are well connected and contribute to the flow whereas the late time radial flow may be associated with the continuous like fracture network contribution at large scale when the cross flow area is large enough the fractured dolomite which generally presents a well developed fracture network that is cross connected to a less developed bedding plane fracture network is also favorable to the development of a radial flow dimension finally conceptual models with horizontal planes that exhibit only plane beddings such as those composed of pure non fractured limestones are also favorable to the establishment of a radial flow dimension rafini and larocque 2012 fig 10 c shows the presence of n 1 implying the influence of a vertical fault or an intersection of faults the size of the discontinuity may be understood based on the time period during which the flow regime occurs an early time linear regime may be due to a submeter scale vertical fracture while a late time linear regime may reveal the presence of large scale vertical faults on the contrary the value of n 1 5 expresses the presence of a leaky vertical fault supplied by a conductive matrix embedded in the fracture network which is sufficiently transmissive and connected in order to significantly feed the fault the fractional values of flow dimension non integer n values are commonly interpreted to be associated with the fractal properties of fractured rock systems crystalline or carbonate aquifers the fractal flow models assume that the fractured rock is composed of scale invariant fracture geometries when during a same pumping test a sequence of integer and non integer values of n are observed this compromises the fractal theory which is based on assumptions regarding the homogeneity and density of fractures the mismatch between the fractal dimension and n has been reported verbovšek 2009 rafini and larocque 2012 indeed verbovšek 2009 using a statistical approach shows that the fractal dimension parameter obtained by the classic box counting method and n obtained by an automated type curve matching of the drawdown log derivative signal are not correlated he interprets the fractional n values as being related to the degree of connectivity between the fractures carbonate rocks are the context with the most variable flow dimension values the values range between 0 2 and 3 with fractional sub radial flow dimensions of n 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 6 1 8 and sub spherical flow dimensions of n 2 3 2 4 2 5 this variability in flow dimension reflects an important variability of fracture and fault configurations as shown by the thin dark bars of fig 10 c these flow dimensions are generally stable and long term this variability in the n values reflects environments with a variability of fractures and or fault configurations some pumping tests performed in carbonate rock aquifers exhibit late times unit slopes in the petroleum literature such a flow regime is commonly associated with a reservoir that is depleted with no spatial diffusion of drawdown among others mattar 1997 ehlig economides and vera 2013 in other words the no flow boundaries have been attained this assumption is consistent with carbonate systems where sealing faults are frequent due to self forming calcite or clay seals this late time unit slope may express the attainment of sealing faults or impermeable boundaries in every direction observing this signal in cfr aquifers suggests either that the productive zones are limited to specific fracture zones in the vicinity of the pumping well or that sealed faults are frequently reached by the pressure wave negative unit slopes are also observed between some flow dimensions and may reflect a transition period between two flow dimensions or may be related to a significant change in hydraulic conductivity for instance the dual porosity model warren and root 1963 assumes a transitional flow period between two radial flow regimes which represents firstly the water supply from the fracture network and secondly the water supply from the matrix rafini and larocque 2012 show that when a finite conductive vertical fault is not connected to the well a transitional flow period is observed between the radial flow through the matrix and the bilinear flow through the leaky fault the frequent occurrence of negative unit slopes thus expresses heterogeneous media with participation of several flow regimes 4 2 2 3 fluvial glacial deposit aquifers the fluvio glacial deposit fgd histogram generated in this study comprises 22 pumping tests conducted in the regions of chcn and slsj quebec and the eskers of the abitibi region quebec the most prominent flow dimensions in terms of frequency of occurrence and duration are represented by n 1 3 and 1 representing respectively 20 and 17 of the fgd group composed of 46 n values lasting respectively 2 2 2 3 log cycles fig 10 d all the pumping tests performed in the eskers of the abitibi region showed a long term and single stage pseudo linear flow regime n 1 3 the linear flow regime in fluvioglacial deposits has until now seldom been investigated two studies interpreted the linear flow in granular aquifers to be related to two different contexts i a long and narrow system which channels the flow between two parallel impermeable hydraulic boundaries or low permeability levees escobar et al 2004a escobar and montealegre m 2007 such systems may be observed in channelized deposits such as glacial hollows filled by sediments or eskers ii micro cross flow within non communicating layers indeed by modelling pumping tests in fluvial deposits corbett et al 2012 observed that the deposit systems formed by the transport and deposition of sediments exhibit characteristics of hydraulic conductivity distribution anisotropy and geometry which strongly influence the hydraulic behavior of these systems they showed that a decrease of lateral transmissivity and a poor lateral connectivity of facies favor the development of an increasing slope of the derivative signal which implies a linear pseudo linear n which they named the ramp effect as stated by corbett et al 2012 the internal properties of fluvial sediments are valuable assumptions which greatly contribute to the interpretation of such linear flow regimes being long and narrow systems eskers are fluvioglacial deposits whose geometry favors the establishment of linear flow regimes however the pseudo linear flow regimes observed in the database are more enigmatic more field and numerical studies are needed to determine the geological facies involved in such flow regimes a significant number 8 of spherical flow regimes are reported in this study notably in thick deposit aquifers these systems characterized by a screen thickness significantly smaller than the aquifer thickness favor the establishment of n 3 in some cases the variable thickness aquifer is a more valuable conceptual model to explain this value of n for instance one of the pumping tests showing a spherical flow was performed in a topographic depression that had been carved and then filled by glaciers the geometrical increase of the aquifer thickness associated with the depression favors the establishment of a spherical flow regime dal soglio 2012 rafini et al 2014 the fgd group displays early unit negative slopes of the ds dlogt signal which may indicate a transition period between the wellbore effects and the aquifer s signal tiab 1995 it is not surprising to observe wellbore effects more frequently in deposit aquifers than in fractured aquifers because granular boreholes require a screen which may induce skin effects while the borehole dug into fractured rock is a simple open hole without a screen as explained above fractional n values are widely interpreted to reflect the fractal properties of the fractured rock media an interpretation that is challenged by the observation of frequent non integer values of n in granular aquifers mostly in the range of 1 2 it should be noted that no relationship between n and the confinement conditions of the aquifer confined unconfined has been observed the typical type curve provided by neuman s solution has not been observed either 5 discussion this study has collected and summarized the flow dimension values of several pumping tests and reviewed the current published assumptions used to interpret these flow dimension values any flow model where the transient flow area changes by a certain value of the power of the distance to the well corresponds to a specific flow dimension this is the reason why the assumptions presented in the result and discussion section are non unique it is possible for different hydraulic and geometrical configurations to yield a same value of flow dimension when conducting the n sequential analysis it is important to keep in mind that the propagation of the pressure front pulse is a diffusive process and that the drawdown behavior is governed by averaged conditions rather than by local heterogeneities horne 1995 furthermore the flow dimension is not an integrative value that would represent a combination of all the flow regimes rather it is an apparent value that reflects the dominant flow regime which influences the cross flow area diffusion felt by the pressure front pulse for instance as modeled by rafini and larocque 2012 a vertical leaky fault located in a homogeneous matrix generates the n sequence 1 5 2 reflecting firstly the influence of the fault and secondly the influence of the matrix under no circumstance will the second n express a mean value between the two flow regimes rather it should be underlined that the second flow regime is a value that expresses the flow regime related to the most influential flow of the hydrogeological facies the sequences of n can thus be interpreted independently and successively because each flow regime observed during a single pumping test exists independent from any other it is conceivable to interpret an n sequential signal by successively matching various analytical solutions as done by hammond and field 2014 the drawdown log derivative signal and barker s law help in better interpreting the flow regime occurring during a constant rate pumping test in order to use the flow dimension value as a diagnostic tool it is important however to keep in mind that the cross flow area is growing as the pressure wave is diffused through the aquifer due to the expansion of the cross flow area a variation in the observational scale must be considered hence the sensitivity of the transient well test signal to small heterogeneities diminishes as the radius of investigation increases beauheim et al 2004 highlighted the importance of considering the scale when analysing the flow dimensions of pumping tests in a heterogeneous aquifer they stated that for a single pumping well different estimated flow dimensions can be obtained depending on the pumping test method used indeed some of these pumping tests may not have the same radius of investigation such as for instance slug test compared to pumping test it is worth noting that the extent and the diffusion rate of the radius of investigation is independent of the pumping rate because it is an intrinsic value only associated with the diffusive properties of the aquifer transmissivity and storage the interpretation of flow regimes employs successive linear regressions on derivative data into several time windows the recognition of these time windows and the confidence this provides for the interpretation of flow dimension remains a sensitive aspect of the approach that may in some cases leave uncertainties a manual interpretation is recommended rather than any automated process which optimizes regression coefficient sequences indeed the quality of regressions is not the only component of a proper interpretation of flow regimes a manual analysis of derivative data makes it possible to identify pumping rate stops or changes to award a lesser degree of significance to certain noisy sections that have a more obvious and greater degree of data instability either instrumental due to a temporary high diffuse heterogeneity field or for other reasons furthermore the practitioner conducting a manual interpretation may benefit from derivative differentiation without being misled by it in other words to stick to raw data we finally submit that a simultaneous fit on both s and ds dlogt significantly contributes to reducing subjectivity issues regarding the interpretation of flow regimes a major issue of any derivative analysis remains the quality of the data even though derivative data are advantageously highly sensitive to hydrodynamic changes in the aquifer they are also strongly impacted by noise sources either natural or instrumental it is not rare that noise impedes any confident and unique interpretation of derivative curves as stated by anderson et al 2006 interpreting a pumping test without taking data quality into account can lead to the erroneous understanding of aquifer features various differentiation methods are proposed in the literature to improve the signal noise ratio the deconvolution techniques initially proposed by birsoy and summers 1980 in hydrogeology and by von schroeter et al 2001 and azi et al 2008 in the petroleum industry make it possible to assess the equivalent constant rate drawdown of a variable rate test the practice is extremely popular in petroleum studies to process the transient tests before their interpretation azi et al 2008 gringarten 2010 onur and kuchuk 2012 obeahon et al 2014 these approaches require knowledge of the drawdown s the time t and the pumping rate q it may be advantageous to adopt this data processing practice in hydrogeology studies in order to improve the accuracy of interpretations the deconvolution tools could not have been integrated in this study due to the lack of detailed pumping rate survey data even though variations in pumping rate steps do not influence the estimation of the flow dimension because single variations do not change the general trend of the derivative signal and may thus be disregarded in the analysis each pumping rate adjustment strongly affects the derivative signal by generating significant noise thus analysing the recovery data appears to be a favorable option practitioners must however be aware that drawdown and recovery signals are not necessarily similar as stated by mattar 1997 1999 the differences between the drawdown and the buildup data appear when the test is affected by aquifer heterogeneities or boundaries because the analytical type curves are mostly configured for drawdown the drawdown data are needed to estimate the hydraulic properties the buildup signal should be interpreted qualitatively in addition to the drawdown data because it is not subject to disturbances caused by changes in pumping rate the buildup signal should indeed be analyzed in order to help with the diagnostics rather than for quantitative analysis when using the derivative signal in order to estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifer it is important to keep in mind that i the flow dimension value can reflect the geometry of the aquifer and or the geometry of the well and or the geometry of the flow and or the geometry and connectivity of fractures in fractured media and ii certain mechanisms can disrupt the signal of the aquifer in early times the signal of the aquifer can be masked or disrupted by wellbore effects at middle times the aquifer s signal can be influenced by rain infiltration or leakage at late times the signal of the aquifer can be masked by boundary conditions when interpreting flow regimes it is therefore important to have good knowledge of the environment surrounding the well and the conditions of the pumping tests further numerical simulations are needed to i distinguish such effects from the aquifer s signal and ii develop analytical equations for non radial flow regimes the spherical flow dimensions of the entire database were analyzed in order to correlate the well conditions of a partial penetrating completed screened pumping well with the frequency of occurrence of the spherical flow dimension the spherical flow dimension is observable in 10 pumping tests four of which were performed in alluvial deposits two in weathered crystalline rock aquifers three in carbonate rocks and one with a screen intercepting both a carbonate rock and a moraine table 6 according to escobar et al 2012 the early times flow dimension is significantly influenced by the penetration ratio of the pumping well moncada et al 2005 explained that the typical 0 5 slope of the ds dlogt signal which is characteristic of the spherical flow dimension is absent for penetration ratios greater than 40 based on this knowledge we interpret three pumping tests to be related to partial penetration effects because the penetration ratios are lower than 29 table 6 the pumping well of la narce shows a long term and weakly noisy signal with n 3 5 fig 11 we suggest that this hyper spherical flow dimension may reflect a partial penetrating well effect combined with leakage effects we will discuss this assumption in the next paragraph unfortunately three pumping tests with n 3 are not interpretable due to a lack of data or poor conditions the static level is 0 77 m above the top of the screen and the dynamic level is below the top of the screen finally three of the signatures show a spherical flow dimension but cannot be interpreted with the partially penetrating well effects suggesting that other conditions may produce such a spherical flow dimension the non unicity of the derivative signal has already been reported in the literature and will be discussed in the next sections more field and numerical analyses are thus needed to interpret these pumping tests this paragraph aims at providing some thoughts about barker s model and widening the concepts of the flow dimension parameter that may be related to leakage effects since the initial development of the grf model by barker 1988 the interpretation of the flow dimension has been extended as previously explained in section 2 2 2 the fractal interpretation of fractional values has been open to non space filling doe 1991 non fractal fractured media settings jourde et al 1998 maréchal et al 2008 giese et al 2017 and non homogeneous systems rafini and larocque 2009 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 explained that a vertical fault which is expected to induce a linear flow dimension n 1 actually produces a bilinear flow dimension n 1 5 because the flow from the matrix supplies the fault furthermore we observed a statistical correlation between the sub spherical flow dimension n 2 5 and the fractured rocks that are supplied by an overlying granular horizon in addition doe 2002 explained that a media inducing a radial flow dimension which is supplied by leakage may lead to a dimension somewhat greater than 2 these observations lead us to suppose that the sub radial flow dimensions 2 n 3 may reflect a system that induces a radial flow dimension which is supplied by leakage also we observed a sub radial flow dimension n 1 3 in eskers that are highly transmissive flow conduits supplied by surrounding alluvial deposits in the same line of thought the esker flow system is expected to induce a linear flow dimension but leakage around eskers results in increasing linear flow dimension to reach sub radial flow dimension thus a system supplied by leakage seems to induce a flow dimension somewhat greater than expected based on this observation a point source system or a partially penetrating well that produces n 3 which is supplied by leakage may induce a hyper spherical flow dimension indeed we observe a hyper spherical flow dimension n 3 5 in the la nacre weathered crystalline rock fourth line of table 6 and fig 11 we assume that this value reflects the signal of a partially penetrating well expected to induce n 3 that is supplied by leakage this assumption is in line with the conceptual models of weathered crystalline rock aquifers lachassagne 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 worthington et al 2016 6 conclusion based on 69 constant rate pumping tests this study presents an overview of the occurrence in nature of the flow dimension parameter in fractured altered crystalline rock aquifers carbonate aquifers and fluvio glacial deposit aquifers the database is provided in table 7 the real flow dimension statistics obtained in this study emphasize the generally major prevalence of non radial flow regimes in nature expressed by a wide diversity of n values indeed the flow dimension values obtained in this study range between 0 and 3 5 with 69 of the 121 interpreted flow dimensions producing a value for n that is different from 2 a key element of information obtained in this study is that the flow dimension analysis delivers results that are significantly different from one geological setting to another in terms of n values variability of the duration of n and n sequences more particularly the most statistically significant flow dimensions in terms of duration and frequency of occurrence display a higher degree of correlation with the geological conditions around the well this shows that the hydrodynamic interpretation of these flow dimensions has a physical expression that may relates to the geological framework this confirms the positive association between conceptual models and flow dimension analysis for instance faulted hard rock aquifers exhibit a high proportion of linear flow regimes which may express drawdown diffusion through vertical faults embedded into no flow boundaries or one dimensional flow conduits formed by an intersection of faults pumping tests performed in altered crystalline rocks and thick alluvial aquifers preferentially produce spherical and pseudo spherical flow regimes these can be related to partial completion penetration of wells or partial screening effects which produce point sources generating spherical equipotential surfaces or any aquifer s configurations that may lead to a proportional relation of the cross flow area a r and r2 fluvio glacial aquifers exhibit a high frequency of single stage linear or pseudo linear responses these were related to channelized shapes typical of fluvio glacial environments such as eskers or micro cross flows which result from internal heterogeneities within the granular layers it is interesting to note that contrary to common opinion the radial flow assumption is in many cases not suitable to model granular aquifers of the database finally carbonate rock aquifers exhibit a high proportion of radial flow regimes interpreted either as the influence of conductive horizontal strata or of large scale equivalent continuous media the use of derivative data allows for a much greater degree of uniqueness of the interpretative type curves as compared to drawdown only observing similar flow dimensions in different geological facies raises the issue of non uniqueness of the log derivative signal for instance linear flow regimes have been observed in both fractured rock and fluvio glacial deposit aquifers as stated by mattar 1997 several conceptual models predict identical ds dlogt type curves but the estimated aquifer parameters geometry hydraulic properties will be very different from one model to the other massonnat and bandiziol 1991 and liang et al 2012 point out the critical insights regarding the geological context to take into account when choosing the adequate analytical model an interesting continuity of this paper would be to review all the sequences of n that are observed in nature and analytically modeled in order to assess the potential advantages of using the n sequential approach to improve the uniqueness of ds dlogt interpretations finally our compilation revealed that in natural aquifers radial flow regimes occur quite infrequently representing overall 31 of the flow regimes that were interpreted for this study most of the radial flow dimensions were generally observed at early times and were mostly related to a short and noisy signal in view of these results it is remarkable that most interpretative models available in the literature describe various types of combined or modified but still radial behaviors within the radial interpretative framework this demonstrates that current and common interpretations using either theis or theis derived models are in fact hydraulic approximations as they do not account for the real dimension of flow in aquifers this calls in question the reliability of any interpretative model that does not integrate a flow dimension analysis new knowledge about occurrences of n in nature may provide impetus to the development of new non radial flow conceptual models more representative of observed real situations and more globally to further research on the flow dimension parameter the analysis and interpretation of aquifers based on the results of pumping tests might in fact be in its infancy a common yet non consensual conceptual interpretation of fractional flow dimension consists in relating it to a gain or a loss of connections in fractures networks with increasing investigation scale e g leveinen 2000 however our compilation of n values occurrences in various geological contexts indicate that such fractional flow dimensions do not occur more likely in hard rock than in granular settings fig 10 this leads to consider other avenues than fractured networks for the conceptual interpretation of fractional flow regimes furthermore the database highlighted correlations between some fractional n values and leakage in fact some sub radial e g n 1 3 sub spherical e g n 2 5 and hyper spherical e g n 3 5 flow dimensions seem to be related to conceptual models which are influenced by leakage and which were expected to produce respectively a linear a radial and a spherical flow dimension it has already been established that a vertical fault expected to induce a linear flow dimension which is supplied by the matrix produces a bilinear flow dimension n 1 5 rafini and larocque 2009 we planned to numerically investigate the issue of leakage in order to confirm our assumptions based on field observations from a more practical viewpoint we now know with more certainty that automatically assuming that a flow regime is radial may lead practitioners to over or under estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifers they are studying non radial flow regimes will typically generate investigation areas whose shape is different from that of a regular circle produced by a cylindrical radial flow consequently in most real life cases whpa delineation may be significantly biased because of erroneous postulates regarding flow dimension regimes when a radial flow is observable on a log log plot of ds dlogt the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is accurately estimated when using the radial derivative analysis eq 14 aquifer evaluation may be improved by analysing the duration and sequences of the flow dimension as it directly relates to the geometrical diffusion of the pressure front pulse further research work is needed in order to develop equations that estimate the hydraulic properties of a non radial flow regime aquifer and to better understand the physical meaning of fractional flow dimensions finally we recommend improving hydrogeological pumping test practices through the inclusion of the flow dimension analysis in the pumping test interpretation in particular both the head and the pumping rate should be accurately measured using a logarithmic time step it should be remembered that the derivative signal is very sensitive to small variations of the drawdown and the pumping rate pumping rate adjustments will generate noise in the derivative signal and pumping rate drifts can induce an apparent flow dimension which is different from the equivalent constant rate flow dimension

7567,the flow dimension parameter n derived from the generalized radial flow model is a valuable tool to investigate the actual flow regimes that really occur during a pumping test rather than suppose them to be radial as postulated by the theis derived models a numerical approach has shown that when the flow dimension is not radial using the derivative analysis rather than the conventional theis and cooper jacob methods helps to estimate much more accurately the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer although n has been analysed in numerous studies including field based studies there is a striking lack of knowledge about its occurrence in nature and how it may be related to the hydrogeological setting this study provides an overview of the occurrence of n in natural aquifers located in various geological contexts including crystalline rock carbonate rock and granular aquifers a comprehensive database is compiled from governmental and industrial sources based on 69 constant rate pumping tests by means of a sequential analysis approach we systematically performed a flow dimension analysis in which straight segments on drawdown log derivative time series are interpreted as successive specific and independent flow regimes to reduce the uncertainties inherent in the identification of n sequences we used the proprietary siren code to execute a dual simultaneous fit on both the drawdown and the drawdown log derivative signals using the stated database we investigate the frequency with which the radial and non radial flow regimes occur in fractured rock and granular aquifers and also provide outcomes that indicate the lack of applicability of theis derived models in representing nature the results also emphasize the complexity of hydraulic signatures observed in nature by pointing out n sequential signals and non integer n values that are frequently observed in the database keywords diagnostic plot drawdown log derivative signal flow dimension theis derived models complex aquifers field data 1 introduction the discrepancy between the complexity of real flow behavior and the simplicity of analytical flow models makes the interpretation of transient well tests an ambiguous and imprecise task hydrogeology practitioners routinely interpret constant rate pumping tests by matching theoretical type curves obtained from theis derived models thus ignoring the real flow regime that occurs during the test and neglecting the idealized theis assumptions that suppose a totally penetrating well the homogeneity of the aquifer and the infinite acting radial flow this matching procedure or fit requires the practitioner to make the implicit postulate that the flow regime is cylindrical radial the term flow regime refers here to the pressure behavior and does not relate to any laminar or turbulent flow regimes as defined by the reynold number while cylindrical radial flow is a common pumping test response the careful examination of well test results from a variety of geologic environments reveals that other non cylindrical radial flows are also common and that they may change over the course of a well test theis derived models are only valid for cylindrical radial flow their application to systems with non cylindrical radial behaviors may lead to a significant degree of error leading to a poor understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior of the aquifer and requiring a substantial degree of approximation when estimating the aquifer s hydraulic properties as stated by le borgne et al 2004 the estimation of the transmissivity t and the storage coefficient s depend directly on the flow dimension value as t b 3 n k and s b 3 n s s this paper uses an extensive database of both fractured and non fractured environments to show that non cylindrical radial flow regimes are widespread and must be considered in the analysis of well test data one of the fundamental issues in hydrogeology is the capability of estimating aquifer s hydraulic parameters in a more representative and accurate manner for instance hydraulic conductivity k is an essential parameter used to characterize groundwater flow fields predict contaminant transport carrera 1993 rozemeijer et al 2010 barlow and coupe 2012 and delineate wellhead protection areas whpa bear and jacobs 1965 wyssling 1979 todd 1980 grubb 1993 it is essential to reduce the degree of uncertainty of k because this value controls the size shape and location of wellhead capture zones bhatt 1993 forster et al 1997 fadlelmawla and dawoud 2006 paradis et al 2007 barry et al 2009 in 1989 in the petroleum literature bourdet et al proposed that in addition to plotting the pressure data p practitioners and modellers should also plot the pressure derivative signal dp dlogt this is easily implemented in hydrogeology in the form of the drawdown log derivative signal ds dlogt renard et al 2009 rather than using a simple drawdown signal s the derivative approach makes the signal much more sensitive to small variations of drawdown the diagnostic plots representing the combined plots of both s and ds dlogt versus time are thus used in particular to improve the interpretation of constant rate pumping tests two different methods can be employed to interpret this derivative signal matching type curves over the entire signal or decomposing the signal into straight lines in the first method an analytical flow model is selected and its theoretical curve is matched to the derivative data the match is generally performed using automatic best fitting codes leveinen et al 1998 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 verbovšek 2009 to select the analytical model that most suitably represents the real flow regime ds dlogt is considered the second method is a straight line analysis that consists in decomposing the hydraulic signal into straight lines that are interpreted separately from each other in terms of their hydrodynamic behavior usually plotted on a log log scale the diagnostic plots make it possible to better take into consideration the heterogeneity of aquifers using this sequential approach of flow regimes the hydraulic properties of the aquifer can be estimated according to the tds tiab s direct synthesis philosophy tiab 1994 1995 this approach chiefly used in the petroleum literature establishes equations based on the intersections points and slopes of the ds dlogt straight lines to estimate the parameters of the well and of the aquifer that control the flow regime petroleum researchers developed equations for specific conceptual models established in view of determining parameters such as permeability skin factor wellbore storage coefficient hydraulic conductivity of fractures half fracture length and drainage area tiab 2005 escobar et al 2007 escobar et al 2010 escobar et al 2012 the flow dimension is a parameter proposed by barker in 1988 it expresses the evolution of the shape of the pressure front pulse as it diffuses through the aquifer during the transient stage of pumping the flow dimension identifies by a value n 2 the occurrence of a cylindrical radial flow regime during the pumping test associated with a zero slope of ds dlogt when plotted on the log log axis the non cylindrical radial flow dimensions are easily recognised when ds dlogt displays a rising straight line positive slope for n 2 and a declining straight line negative slope for n 2 the interpretation of pumping tests supposing cylindrical radial flow is thus performed more accurately and swiftly by easily detecting when the theis derived assumptions are suitable this better compliance with assumed and real flow geometries may reduce uncertainties in the determination of hydraulic properties as stated by black 1994 if the flow dimension is assumed to be 2 while in fact it is closer to 1 the hydraulic diffusivity will be underestimated furthermore for the specific case of n 2 k is directly estimated from the y axis intercept of ds dlogt on log log scales barker 1988 for cases where a vertical fault produces a bilinear flow regime n 1 5 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 developed an equation that makes it possible to estimate k graphically without type curve matching the most significant advantage of the flow dimension lies in the fact that it provides a relationship between the drawdown log derivative signal and the flow regime occurring during the pumping test for any hydrodynamic circumstance cylindrical radial and non cylindrical radial flow regimes the ds dlogt approach significantly improves the transient test interpretation method because makes it possible to investigate the flow regimes detected by the transient test instead of assuming them despite its diagnostic potential for interpreting transient well tests the n parameter is still seldom used due to the difficulty of relating the flow dimension values to conceptual aquifer conditions such as flow patterns and geological settings so far only a few values of n have been assigned a physical interpretation and thus its diagnostic potential remains only partially exploited advances in the conceptual understanding of n have been achieved though several numerical modelling studies these studies concentrate on the influence exerted by various configurations or mechanisms on the ds dlogt signal we may mention research works that have focused on the geometry of the boundaries beauheim and roberts 1998 walker and roberts 2003 escobar et al 2005 2007 the wellbore effects jourde et al 2002b escobar et al 2012 the properties of fractured rock jourde et al 2002a cello et al 2009 and the properties of faults gringarten et al 1974 cinco ley et al 1978 abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 these studies contributed to the evolution of the physical conceptualization of flow regimes they proposed specific conceptual models to interpret the flow geometry the configuration of the hydraulic properties and the boundary conditions of a specific flow regime sequence in the literature the flow dimension parameter is sporadically used to characterize the hydraulic properties of aquifers leveinen et al 1998 liang et al 2012 only a few studies have described the frequency of occurrence of n in nature one in dolomite verbovšek 2009 2011 one in fractured limestone audouin and bodin 2008 one in fractured crystalline rock kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 and one in weathered crystalline rock maréchal et al 2004 other studies have provided specific case study analyses one in granitic and carbonate rocks bangoy et al 1992 one in poorly weathered crystalline rock leveinen 2000 sixteen in evaporite deposits beauheim and roberts 2002 and five in fractured rock aquifers lods and gouze 2004 these studies showed that the majority of n values lie within a range of 1 3 and that the radial flow dimension is seldom observed table 4 the authors kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 audouin and bodin 2008 verbovšek 2009 each analyzed only one geological family they limited themselves to correlating the distribution of n with the geology but did not propose a hypothesis regarding the conceptual model or the geological facies that provide the water supply and control the flow regimes furthermore the majority of the wells analyzed in these studies belong to the same aquifer the observations and conclusions of these studies should be examined by comparing aquifers in various locations this article proposes to open novel perspectives as it examines the distribution of n in various geological environments in nature we examine constant rate pumping tests lasting 3 1 days on average performed in various aquifers composed of fluvio glacial deposits crystalline and carbonate rocks this study has two main objectives i to survey the suitability of theis and theis derived model assumptions for reproducing flow dimensional behaviors in natural aquifers ii to provide objective and comprehensive records of occurrences of natural flow dimension with insights on the relationships between n and the features of various different aquifers over the last three decades flow dimensions have been subjectively reported in the literature in the context of introductions of published articles describing specific interpretative models the real distribution of flow dimension values in various types of natural media have remained undocumented even though flow dimension undoubtedly constitutes a key and reliable indicator of the physical attributes of an aquifer comparing flow dimension distribution patterns against their associated geological frameworks will provide insights about their possible conceptual interpretation this study is the first to attempt to perform a statistical analysis of the flow dimensions observed in nature based on a sequential derivative analysis and to provide an initial portrait of the flow dimension distribution in both fractured rock aquifers and fluvio glacial deposits in an n sequential analysis the log log plot of the drawdown log derivative signal is considered a diagnostic tool it is used to help interpret the flow geometry the aquifer geometry and the heterogeneity of hydraulic properties all there of which are detected as the pressure font pulse expands through the aquifer we will firstly review the basic concepts of the grf model and then propose a reinterpretation of transient pumping tests conducted in wells to this end we will use a database derived from 69 constant rate pumping tests lasting 3 1 days on average conducted in the framework of consulting projects for municipal groundwater supplies in the province of quebec canada in france and in tunisia a flow dimension sequence diagnostic approach is adopted for this reinterpretation of pumping tests meaning that each slope of the drawdown log derivative signal is interpreted as a specific and independent flow regime such analysis may be efficiently performed using the proprietary siren code specifically designed to routinely interpret flow dimension sequences by simultaneously fitting drawdown and drawdown log derivative data respectively on semi log and log log plots this approach combines the advantages of both plots the former is weakly influenced by pumping rate changes but grossly insensitive to flow regime the latter is highly sensitive to flow regime changes but subject to strong noise effects due for instance to pumping rate instabilities this study aims at contributing to our understanding of the physical interpretation of n through a statistical analysis of its natural occurrences in various geological media and by comparing the hydrodynamic interpretation of n against the conceptual models of the geology surrounding the wells finally some ideas will be discussed regarding current practices in hydrogeology and the diagnostic potential of an approach which combines conventional plots drawdown log derivative plots and flow dimension analysis while an extensive review of interpretative models using log derivative analysis is beyond the scope of this paper existing flow regime sequences will be investigated in detail and compared to the theoretical and geological conceptual models 2 theory and practice 2 1 conventional analysis the theis model 1935 describes a transient cylindrical radial flow induced by a constant rate pumping test within a confined homogeneous isotropic horizontal slab totally screened and laterally infinite aquifer in such conditions also called infinite acting radial flow iarf conditions the pressure front diffuses radially in the form of concentric circles fig 1 the pressure front pulse generates an equipotential cross flow surface a r which grows radially in the shape of a cylinder fig 1 producing the ideal cylindrical radial flow conditions referred to as theis aquifers a distinction must be made between the theis model and the concept of radial flow regime which strictly describes the proportional relationship between the cross flow surface a and the travelled distance r from the pumping well regardless of the shape of this surface most analytical solutions published during the three last decades in the petroleum literature and classically used in the diagnostic plot approach bourdet et al 1983 renard et al 2009 account for some variations on the cylindrical radial flow theme including either its combination with some external sources unconfined aquifers leaky aquifers as described by hantush 1956 1960 some specific overlaying of several theis aquifers dual porosity models leaky aquifers as described by neuman and witherspoon 1969 these models actually describe various types of radial flow regimes which in itself does not signify that the flow geometry they are modelling remains ideally cylindrical radial in this study these models will hereafter be referred to as theis derived models in a system characterized by a diffuse short scale field of heterogeneities t and s may be averaged over the cross flow area a r making it possible to estimate the properties of the aquifer as being continuous and homogeneous when the pressure front pulse reaches a large scale heterogeneity within the aquifer its shape may be deformed leading to modifications in the equipotential surface growth pattern the cylindrical radial flow regime assumption can no longer be applied rendering any theis derived model irrelevant numerical modelling by meier et al 1998 and sánchez vila et al 1999 showed that for late time drawdown and under cylindrical radial flow conditions the cooper jacob approximation allows a good approximation of transmissivity but an erroneous estimation of storage coefficient in systems with a diffuse heterogeneity field and a radially convergent flow meier et al 1998 pechstein et al 2016 these studies validated the applicability of the cooper jacob model in specific heterogeneous domains with diffuse transmissivity fields and a concentric heterogeneous storage conditions that allow the establishment of a cylindrical radial flow regime meier et al 1998 concluded their study by explaining that further numerical studies with three dimensional flow conditions are needed to analyze flow behavior in aquifers with variable thicknesses cases of an increasing aquifer thickness dal soglio 2012 rafini et al 2014 or a partially screened or a partially penetrated aquifer moncada et al 2005 escobar et al 2012 ferroud et al 2015 have been numerically documented to produce spherical flow regimes in these non cylindrical radial conditions theis derived approaches are undoubtedly unsuitable 2 2 the generalized radial flow model 2 2 1 basic concepts the generalized radial flow grf model was proposed by barker in 1988 in response to the inability of conventional models to reproduce the flow within the fractured aquifer of stripa mine barker 1988 the concept of the grf model is based on a proportional relationship between a l2 the cross flow area and rn 1 the radial distance from the borehole of the pressure front pulse to the power of the flow dimension minus one eq 1 1 a r r n 1 the parameter n is a value that must be determined empirically and which may not have an integer value barker 2007 n reflects the rate by which the cross flow area changes as a function of the distance from the well as the pressure front pulse extends outwards and reaches heterogeneities within the aquifer it may be deformed in such a manner that eq 3 is modified inducing changes in the flow dimension the sequences of n thus reflect flow regime changes induced by some variations in the physical or hydraulic features in the aquifer short pumping tests because they induce only a limited cross flow area expansion in the aquifer mainly reflect wellbore effects and a small proportion of the aquifer in the vicinity of the well it is the long term pumping tests that may more accurately reflect the aquifer signal sensu stricto and the influence of boundary conditions the term flow regime thus refers to the behavior of the pressure front pulse as it moves through the aquifer it is worth noting that the sequential analysis we employ in this study is an extension of the grf model since barker 1988 defined media with constant n values assuming homogeneous conditions by verifying the validity of barker s equation eq 1 in a non uniform faulted aquifer rafini and larocque 2009 2012 proved that n is a valuable tool for interpreting the successive flow regimes that occur during a medium or long term pumping test even if the aquifer does not have grf like properties in accordance with barker s postulates each value of n independently observed at different times during the pumping test represents the dominant flow regime felt at that time by the pressure front pulse as it diffuses throughout the aquifer around the well at a distance r t using the grf concept barker 1988 introduced the flow dimension n in the diffusivity equation the generalized diffusivity equation is written as eq 2 2 k r n 1 r r n 1 h r s s h t where k lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity r l is the radial distance from the borehole at time t t n is the flow dimension ss l 1 is the specific storage and h l is the hydraulic head based on eq 2 using the laplace transform tables and supposing constant head boundaries a zero initial head and a long time t or a short distance r barker predicts the hydraulic head distribution as eq 3 3 h r t q 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v 4 kt s s v γ 1 v r 2 v v 0 4 v 1 n 2 with b the extent of the flow zone l and γ the gamma function note that eq 3 is the asymptotic form of grf s general solution valid for u small enough with u ssr 2 4kt which is an incomplete gamma function eq 3 can be rewritten with a time dependent term ct v and time independent term c as 5 h t ct v c with 6 c q 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v 4 k s s v and 7 c q 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v γ 1 v r 2 v deriving eq 5 with respect to time shows that the drawdown log derivative ds dlogt time series eq 8 displayed on a log log plot forms a straight line with slope ν providing a mean of a straightforward graphic determination of the flow dimension using eq 4 8 ds dlogt t 2 3 ds dt c 2 3 vt v from a practical standpoint when interpreting drawdown time series at the pumping well the asymptotic condition is reached very early and can be considered valid during the whole aquifer related response beyond the early influence of the wellbore effects note that in the petroleum literature this asymptotic flow behavior is also named infinite acting behavior according to eqs 4 and 8 the derivative signal depends on q k ss b and n thus any modification of these parameters will be felt by the derivative signal note that only changes of k and ss will temporarily invalidate the asymptotic assumption of the derivative signal eq 3 is valid when u is small enough yet straight derivative segments represent a sufficient proof of the validation of the asymptotic assumption before the pressure front pulse reaches the hydraulic boundaries each straight line segment is associated with a n value and represents a flow period during which q k ss and b are constant and or uniform as stated by beauheim et al 2004 and rafini et al 2017 we suggest that the flow dimension should be estimated from a constant straight line of ds dlogt that lasts at least one log cycle we favor this graphic approach eq 8 without type curve matching because it allows us to decompose the signal in a sequence of successive flow regimes associated to specific geological facies and flow behaviors because n is directly determined from the ds dlogt straight line slopes which implies that it can assume any integer and non integer value it is a valuable parameter for statistically analysing the flow regimes of natural aquifers 2 2 2 conceptual interpretation of n the main known flow dimensions interpreted using eq 1 are briefly summarized in this section for further details the reader is invited to refer to the original papers n 0 ν 1 observed early in the pumping test this unit slope line of the drawdown log derivative refers to wellbore effects skin and wellbore storage tiab 1993 mattar 1997 observed late in the pumping test this flow regime may express the attainment of a stagnant state pseudo steady state flow as described by mattar 1997 achieved when all the outer boundaries are no flow boundaries i e when the reservoir depressurizes without spatial diffusion of drawdown n 1 ν 0 5 the linear flow implies that the cross flow area remains constant as the pressure wave travels through the aquifer such conditions are observed in long and narrow systems which may be found i in granular channelized aquifers fluvial and deep sea fans escobar et al 2004a escobar and montealegre m 2007 escobar et al 2010 corbett et al 2012 ii in fractured media containing an infinite conductivity vertical fault gringarten and witherspoon 1972 gringarten et al 1974 iii in fractured rocks with a finite conductivity one dimensional conduit formed by the intersection of fractures and iv in karst systems maréchal et al 2008 a linear flow can also be observed in a planar fracture with channeling or preferred flow paths tsang and neretnieks 1998 n 2 ν 0 the radial flow regime is observed when the cross flow area grows proportionally to the radial distance r such a condition can be produced by a cylindrical radial flow regime this flow regime is generally associated with a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer of uniform thickness but other conceptual models may produce a radial flow dimension heterogeneous media may also produce a radial flow regime such as a well located close to a vertical fault when the matrix supply masks the signature of the fault cinco ley et al 1978 rafini and larocque 2009 or an orthogonal discontinuity network jourde et al 1998 n 3 ν 0 5 the spherical flow regime is observed when the cross flow area expands proportionally to r 2 according to eq 4 a spherical flow dimension is represented by a 0 5 negative slope of ds dlogt which reflects a drawdown rate deceleration that may be observed early in the pumping test when the screen is very short relative to the aquifer for instance a spherical flow regime can be induced by a point source between packers by a partially penetrating well by a partially completed well or by a restricted producing interval culham 1974 moncada et al 2005 escobar et al 2012 ferroud et al 2015 n non integer the fractional non integer flow regimes which are frequently exhibited by field data diagnostic plots have long been interpreted as being related to the geometry of the source barker 1988 or to the fractal properties of the fractured media barker 1988 polek et al 1989 chang and yortsos 1990 bangoy et al 1992 acuna and yortsos 1995 by analysing fractured systems that are generated from a fractal model using a discrete fracture network other authors geier et al 1996 winberg 2000 cello et al 2009 showed that there exists a relationship between the flow dimension parameter and the connectivity of fractures other authors like jourde et al 1998 interpreted the fractional flow dimension to be related to the connectivity of fractures in an orthogonal fracture network in tabular stratified aquifers in 1991 the interpretation of fractional flow dimensions was widened to involve new considerations in fact doe 1991 opened the fractional flow dimension definition to non fractal geometries which are not space filling in other words euclidian configurations with heterogeneity either in conductivity or geometry or a combination of both can produce non integer values of n bowman et al 2012 simulated the flow through high transmissivity conduits characterized by non radial and simple geometries by means of the flow dimension concepts developed by doe 1991 bowman et al 2012 showed that the variability of conduit shape can generate non integer flow dimensions such as 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 in addition the bilinear flow regime n 1 5 has been reported to reflect the signal of a finite conductive fault supplied by the matrix such a configuration has been demonstrated analytically by abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 and then corroborated numerically by rafini and larocque 2009 the karst systems are also known to generate fractional flow dimension values that generally range between 0 and 1 maréchal et al 2008 giese et al 2017 finally walker and roberts 2003 suggested that the flow dimension depends on the form of the nonstationary transmissivity for instance an aquifer presenting an exponential variation of thickness 3 data and method 3 1 compilation of a pumping well test database a database mainly composed of 69 pumping well tests with a mean duration of 3 1 days ranging from 0 2 to 14 7 days and of local geological information has been established table 1 most of the compiled data come from pumping well tests conducted in the framework of municipal groundwater supply investigations in the province of quebec canada regions of charlevoix haute côte nord chcn saguenay lac saint jean slsj chesnaux et al 2011 and abitibi temiscamingue abte nadeau et al 2015 additional data were obtained from i south eastern quebec mirabel nastev et al 2004 ii various locations in france regions of the alps midi pyrenées nord pas de calais and loire iii the database banque de données du sous sol compiled by the bureau de recherches géologiques et minières brgm and iv in northern tunisia 3 2 data pre processing log derivative data are typically very noisy this may be due to datalogger or operator complications pumping rate variations random diffuse heterogeneity fields and tidal or recharge effects we therefore smooth the data using the algorithm of bourdet et al 1989 which has proven to be one of the most efficient in filtering noise without deteriorating the hydraulic signature escobar et al 2004b the differentiation equation is 9 ds i dx i δ s 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 δ s 2 δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 with δ s 1 s i s 1 δ s 2 s i s 2 δ x 1 x i x 1 δ x 2 x i x 2 and x log t eq 9 uses 3 points the next and previous points 1 and 2 of point i which are the first to be separated by a minimum length of l the length can thus be adjusted until the noise is attenuated and the signal is no longer distorted the drawing of straight lines is performed manually by considering the differentiation curves for various l values eq 9 furthermore the simultaneous dual fits performed with siren are such that when derivative data are too noisy or disrupted the drawdown fit makes it possible to attenuate the uncertainties inherent in the assessment of derivative linear regressions in order to quantify the quality of each manual fit the coefficient of determination r2 is calculated between the differentiated points and the regression line defined manually fig 2 a displays the effects of pumping rate adjustments at 55 243 and 3390 min on the s and ds dlogt responses on the upper plot s shows a slight translation of the signal for each of the three changes of pumping rate q the rate values are unfortunately not mentioned in the consultant s report but the increase of the drawdown signature suggests an increase of q for each adjustment on the lower plot the ds dlogt signal shows a small number of extreme and noisy data when the pumping rate is increased but afterwards the initial flow regime is rapidly recovered the flow dimension value is thus not influenced by variations in the constant pumping rate fig 2 b shows the effects of an interruption in pump operation between 3 and 4 min on the s and ds dlogt responses on the upper plot s displays a reduction of drawdown associated with an increase of hydraulic head in the well until the pump is restarted approximately 10 min derivative data show a pseudo spherical flow regime n 2 6 which is totally disrupted by the pump interruption indeed between 3 and 10 min fig 2 b the pumping stops and induces a recovery of the signal yielding negative data of the derivative which are not visible on a log log plot when the pump restarts the general trend is rapidly recovered with no evidence of pump disturbance straight line in fig 2 in both case studies fig 2 a and b the derivative signal quickly returns to normal due to the high hydraulic conductivity of the alluvial deposit which is estimated in the order of 3 5 10 5 m s note that this value is estimated from a conventional cylindrical radial flow dimension model and therefore it is properly estimated in the case of an aquifer that instead induces a spherical flow dimension numerical simulations were conducted in order to confirm these field observations and to clarify the flow regime behavior when the hydraulic test is affected by pumping rate changes or by a pump shut down the four columns of fig 3 show the drawdown and drawdown log derivative signals of four different conceptual models which are generated in confined conditions using the hydrogeosphere code therrien et al 2010 each of the four conceptual models generates distinct flow dimension sequences from left to right of fig 3 the n sequences are cylindrical radial to linear n 2 1 bilinear to cylindrical radial n 1 5 2 simply cylindrical radial n 2 and spherical to cylindrical radial n 3 2 the cylindrical radial linear n sequence is obtained by generating a flow within a conduit the bilinear to cylindrical radial n sequence is obtained by a well connected to a finite conductive vertical fault supplied by the matrix the cylindrical radial flow regime is modeled with a conventional theis aquifer the spherical radial n sequence is induced by a well that partially penetrates the aquifer from top to bottom fig 3 shows the semi log plot of the drawdown cp1 cp2 cp3 and cp4 the drawdown log derivative signal without pump disturbance a1 a2 a3 and a4 the derivative signal when pumping rate increases occur b1 b2 b3 and b4 and the signal that is disturbed by a pump shut down c1 c2 c3 and c4 for both the change in pumping rate and the pump shut down similarly to the field observations in fig 2 the general trend of the derivative signal is rapidly recovered after the disturbance has stopped in other words the flow dimension value is temporarily disrupted by the pumping rate disturbances but is not dependent on the pumping rate even when the test is altered during a short time period when a pumping rate change occurs the general trend of the flow regime is not impacted furthermore the step rate adjustments are generally observable during the test induced peak noise and have been considered in the interpretation of flow regimes as described by eqs 6 and 8 besides the hydraulic properties k and ss of the aquifer and the extent of the flow zone b the pumping rate q is also a parameter that influences the derivative signal we conducted several numerical tests to observe the impacts of the drift of the pumping rate on the flow dimension value fig 4 a shows numerical results of three situations of the drawdown log derivative signatures of a cylindrical radial flow model obtained in three different pumping rate conditions in one case the pumping rate is constant and in the two other cases we model a gradual drift of the pumping rate in fact the pump performance depends on the well head level fig 4 a shows that the power law variation of the pumping rate influences the value of the flow dimension the linear variation of the pumping rate induces an apparent flow dimension value which can be very different from the flow dimension of the equivalent constant rate model the slopes of the derivative signal and the pumping rate are practically identical fig 4 a according to the grf model barker 1988 the derivative signal is given by eqs 6 and 8 because c is proportional to q when the pumping rate varies according to a power law i e q q0 ta eq 8 can be written as eq 10 10 ds dlogt c v t v q 0 t a 2 3 c v q 0 t v a 2 3 with c written as eq 11 11 c 1 4 π 1 v kb 3 n v 4 k s s v with a the slope of the power law pumping rate drift q t q0 t a thus the slope p of the derivative response plot on a log log graph is eq 12 12 p a v 1 a n 2 consequently the apparent flow dimension napp induced by a power law pumping rate drift can be written as eq 13 13 n app n 2 a for instance in fig 4 a the slope of the increasing power law pumping rate a is equal to 0 38 and the related slope of the derivative signal is equal to 0 44 inducing an apparent flow dimension of napp 1 12 calculated from eq 8 instead of n 2 which is the flow dimension of the constant rate model the apparent flow dimension calculated from eq 14 with the power exponent a of the variable flow rate is equal to napp 1 24 we observe a slight difference between the observed apparent flow dimension equal to 1 12 and the calculated apparent flow dimension equal to 1 24 these numerical tests are only a preliminary study which aims at issuing a warning to practitioners when interpreting the flow dimension because pumping rate drifts can influence the flow dimension value obviously further work is needed to suitably address the issue of pumping rate drift in particular other pumping rate drift behaviors should be analyzed unfortunately the possible distortion of the flow dimension in the database due to pumping rate changes cannot be verified because pumping rate changes during the pumping test were not sufficiently monitored 3 3 geological contexts a distribution of lithological types in each investigated area is provided in table 1 49 of the database originates from pumping test data compiled by rafini 2008 and 51 from data collected within the framework of the paces project programme d acquisition de connaissances sur les eaux souterraines a groundwater knowledge acquisition program funded by the ministry of environment of quebec and in part directed by the université du québec à chicoutimi the quebec bedrock is mainly composed of precambrian crystalline rocks essentially orthogneisses paragneisses granitic intrusions anorthosite and charnockites rondot 1989 the crystalline rocks are disconformably overlaid by non deformed sedimentary deposits composed from depth to surface of limestone to limy limestone sandstone and shale lemieux et al 2003 the limestones generally display a tabular lamination and may include clay interbeds the carbonate rocks are today found only in the valleys or topographic depressions where they have been protected from the intense erosion that occurred during the late quaternary glaciation the crystalline bedrock is interspersed by a complex fault system generated by various successive geological events dating from the precambrian thick sand and gravel horizons overlaying the bedrock are found throughout the province of quebec as the result of the late quaternary glaciation various glacial and fluvio glacial structures such as tills terminal and lateral moraines eskers kame fluvio glacial deltas kettles drumlins and floodplains compose the alluvial landscape of the region the glacial retreat generated numerous eskers particularly widespread in the abitibi temiscamingue region quebec these deposits established by intra glacial meltwater streams in ice tunnels generally present a channelized structure and a stream rate stratification levasseur 1995 marine transgression and regression events led to the deposition of fluvio marine horizons that are represented by a confining clay layer above the fluvio glacial sediments levasseur 1995 in northern tunisia pumping tests were performed exclusively in carbonate rock aquifers composed of limestones from the eocene period that region is characterised by thick stratified strata and finely laminated carbonate rocks rafini 2004 the media is affected by faults formed during the upper jurassic and the cretaceous and reactivated during the pyrenean and alpine compressions the fractured media manifests a negligible karstification and a low matrix porosity the carbonate rocks studied in france are located in alpine and pyrenean forelands composed of dolomite limestone and marls the crystalline media located in the regions of lozère and loire france are characterised by a deeply weathered surficial horizon composed of granitic sand and clay rich materials whose general hydrodynamic behavior have been explained in detail by lachassagne 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 and dewandel et al 2011 some wellbore loggings have reached a horizon composed of fissured rocks or compact rocks underlying the pumped granitic sand aquifer brgm database 3 4 comparison of hydraulic property values estimated from various models in this section the conventional theis and cooper jacob methods and a derivative analysis based on the cylindrical radial flow regime are applied in various conceptual models some models display a long term radial flow regime whereas others show a sequence of radial and non radial flow regimes this analysis composed of numerical and field data aims at comparing the estimated hydraulic properties and to appreciate their degree of uncertainty when using the analytical models derived from the cylindrical radial flow regime assumption four conceptual models are modeled with a constant rate pumping test these conceptual models generate the following n sequences radial linear bilinear radial single stage radial and spherical radial flow regimes that are described in section 2 2 the parameter estimation is performed using a manual type curve matching the theis method theis 1935 and two graphical analyses the cooper jacob semi log method cooper and jacob 1946 and the radial derivative analysis the theis and the cooper jacob solutions are described in kruseman and ridder 1994 the cylindrical radial derivative analysis estimates the hydraulic conductivity for a cylindrical radial flow regime using the following equation eq 14 which is derived from eq 2 14 k 2 3 q m 4 π b with m l the y intercept of the radial flow dimension on a log log plot of ds dlogt and b l the thickness of the cylindrical radial cross flow area for each conceptual model the log log plot of the drawdown derivative signal is analyzed in order to identify the radial portion of the signal and to determine m the values of the hydraulic conductivity k are shown in table 2 the grey lines in table 2 represent the relative errors between the above k value and the modeled k value the simplified diagrams of the table 2 represent from left to right the semi log plot of s versus t of the linear the bilinear the cylindrical radial and the spherical flow dimension when the conceptual model induces a single stage cylindrical radial flow regime the three methods give a good approximation of k the relative error ranges between 0 and 6 table 2 for the radial linear bilinear radial and spherical radial flow regimes the type curve matching and the graphical analysis of conventional methods are difficult to apply because the cylindrical radial flow regime represents only a small portion of the entire signal the cooper jacob plot of the linear flow fig 3 cp1 emphasizes two slopes the first slope slightly underestimates k 13 whereas the second slope strongly underestimates k 99 or can be inadequately interpreted as a no flow boundary the derivative signal shows a short cylindrical radial flow regime at early times before the long term linear flow regime this early times cylindrical radial flow reflecting the cylindrical diffusion of the cross flow area before reaching the impermeable wall of the conduits makes it possible to accurately estimate k with a relative error of 1 table 2 similarly the semi log plot of the spherical flow regime shows two slopes for the same flow regime both strongly underestimate k probably because in addition to not complying with the cylindrical radial flow regime the thickness that is investigated by the cross flow area is different from the real thickness of the aquifer the derivative signal fig 3 a4 shows a short radial flow regime at late times unnoticeable in the semi log plot of s the radial flow regime representing the reach of both the bottom and the top of the aquifer makes it possible to estimate a good approximation of k with a relative error of 11 table 2 overestimating the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix km using the theis and cooper jacob models for the bilinear conceptual model is not surprising because these models assume a homogeneous aquifer and do not take into account the hydraulic conductivity of the fault kf the radial flow regime that is observed after the bilinear flow regime fig 3 a4 represents the matrix related radial flow regime rafini and larocque 2012 this radial stage gives a good approximation of km using eq 14 the cinco ley et al 1978 solution developed for the vertical fault has the advantage of producing a value for kf to conclude the k values estimated from the radial derivative analysis are close to the modeled k value the relative errors are respectively 0 1 4 and 25 for the radial radial linear the bilinear radial and the spherical radial conceptual models the derivative signal has the advantage of clearly highlighting the radial flow regime by a flat horizontal slope of ds dlogt we also analyzed two sets of field data obtained from the sainte anne and the saint eustache wells in order to compare the k values estimated from the four methods that were used in the previous section table 3 the wells are installed in fractured carbonate rocks field observations such as packer tests have highlighted the presence of conductive structures lemieux et al 2006 the two derivative signatures fig 5 show a multi staged signal composed of the characteristic n sequence 4 1 5 2 reflecting a non connected vertical fault media rafini and larocque 2012 the k values estimated for the two pumping tests are close regardless of the method used this similarity in the results is probably related to the fact that the hydraulic conductivities of the matrix and of the fault are close to each other or the transmissivity of the fault is negligible compared to the transmissivity of the matrix 4 results and discussion 4 1 flow dimension versus theis analysis case studies this section describes two different situations that illustrate the benefits of using flow dimension analysis in addition to drawdown only conventional interpretations to better characterize the flow regimes induced by a pumping test 4 1 1 case study 1 fig 6 represents the semi log plot of the drawdown signal upper plots and the bi logarithmic plot of the drawdown log derivative signal lower plots of a 3 day constant rate pumping test conducted in the glacio fluvial deposits of the senneterre esker mirabel quebec canada despite the noise of the drawdown log derivative signal between 100 min and 4230 min the siren code makes it possible to assuredly fit a sub radial 1 n 2 flow dimension by fitting at the same time both the semi log plot of the drawdown which is much less noisy and the lower plot of the drawdown log derivative signal using the traditional cooper and jacob method the drawdown signal is interpreted by drawing two straight lines fig 6 a a first line from 0 3 to 230 min and the second line from 230 to 4320 min the second straight line whose slope is roughly double that of the first line might be interpreted as a second media with a lesser transmissivity or as the attainment of impermeable boundary conditions in a first approximation these two successive straight lines appear as an acceptable linear regression but when visualizing the effect of the fit of these two supposed radial flow regimes upper plot of fig 6 a on a log log plot of ds dlogt lower plot of fig 6 a we see two distinct horizontal straight lines which are obviously an inappropriate representation of the existing data points as shown in fig 6b fitting a 0 35 straight line slope n 1 3 eq 4 onto the ds dlogt signal resulting in a convex curve on the semi log plot of s represents the real data much more accurately the pumping test is performed in an esker a fluvio glacial sedimentary feature that typically contains channels escobar et al 2004a corbett et al 2012 such channels impede the cross flow area to laterally expand during drawdown diffusion remaining constant in these alluvial conduits the flow dimension of eskers is expected to be linear however each of the seven derivative signals of eskers that have been analyzed in this database showed a sub radial flow dimension n 1 3 we interpret this sub radial flow dimension to be related to leakage coming from the surrounding deposits and that supplies the highly transmissive esker conduit this assumption is further explained in the general discussion section using the cooper and jacob model in this case would lead the practitioner to interpret the data as representing a theis aquifer bounded by an impermeable boundary ferris 1949 but cooper jacob is not a valid model to interpret this pumping test rather the flow dimension analysis which fits the data and the conceptual model much more closely is able to detect the presence of a sub radial flow regime this case study illustrates how the identification of flow regime sequences rather than the trivial postulate of a radial flow regime may substantially improve the diagnosis of the aquifer s hydraulic properties a diagnosis which exerts numerous practical implications on resource management e g a wellhead protection area whpa delineation 4 1 2 case study 2 fig 7 represents 3 different examples of pumping test interpretations of a 6 5 day constant rate pumping test performed in a carbonate rock aquifer in the sainte anne des plaines site mirabel quebec canada the same methodology as the one that is used in case study 1 is adopted the reliability of the fitting of the s data upper plots of fig 7 a b c is checked by analysing the match with the ds dlogt signal lower plots of fig 7 a b c as shown in fig 7 a and b neither a long radial flow regime from 1 8 to 400 min fig 7 a neither two successive radial flow regimes one from 1 5 to 30 min and another from 30 to 400 min fig 7 b can adequately reproduce the trend of both the s and ds dlogt signatures even if the match of 1 or 2 radial flow regimes seems to be a rather good approximation on the semi log plot of s the linear regression is visibly inconsistent on a ds dlogt log log plot a much more suitable fit of s and ds dlogt is presented in fig 7 c where the signal is divided in a sequence of flow regimes with various n values on a semi log plot of s values of n 2 n 2 and n 2 show respectively a convex a concave and a straight curve reflecting a rising a declining or a static drawdown rate conceptually these flow regimes can be related to transmissivity patterns bowman et al 2012 showed numerically that n 2 and n 2 may be generated by conduit geometry in which the cross sectional area respectively decreases and increases as a power function of distance finally for n 2 the derivative horizontally straightens and the drawdown signal displays a straight line indicating no change in the drawdown rate which agrees with the cooper jacob model the ds dlogt signal displays a sequence of integer and non integer flow regimes fig 7 c a fractional flow regime n 1 5 from 1 8 to 40min followed by a radial flow regime n 2 from 40 to 500 min this n sequence composed of n 1 5 and n 2 has been numerically shown by rafini and larocque 2012 to be generated by the presence of a vertical finite conductivity fault embedded into an aquifer and not directly connected to the pumping well the n 1 5 segment represents a bilinear flow regime indicating that the pressure front pulse expands through a media composed by a finite conductive fault and the fractured rock continuous like matrix abbaszadeh and cinco ley 1995 rafini and larocque 2009 in other words during the constant rate pumping test the fault that is supplying the well is at the same time supplied by the matrix inducing a diffusion deceleration that is responsible for the fractional flow regime occurrence rafini and larocque 2009 the radial flow is observed following the bilinear flow regime and indicates that the pressure front pulse diffusion through the matrix is dominant over the pressure front pulse diffusion through the fault the influence of the fault is thus totally masked by the matrix s hydraulic response which predominates over the aquifer s response so far the leaky vertical fault is the only flow model that has been documented to interpret n 1 5 if the area of the cross flow undergoes a change which is proportional to r0 5 this will produce a value of n equal to 1 5 this case study provides another example showing that interpreting pumping test data using the traditional drawdown analysis on semi log plots leads the practitioner to miss most of the information and to perform an invalid or low quality hydrodynamic diagnosis such inappropriate interpretation of flow will induce inaccuracies in the estimation of the aquifer s hydraulic properties for instance assuming a radial flow n 2 in a homogeneous media while the aquifer is in fact composed of a vertical fault that generates a bilinear flow n 1 5 would lead the practitioner to overestimate the matrix s transmissivity to ignore the presence of a water bearing fault or to underestimate the fault s transmissivity 4 2 the occurrences of flow dimension in natural aquifers the scope of this section is to provide an overview of the occurrence of flow dimension in nature and to compare the values of n against their geological settings in order to obtain insights into the physical meaning of flow dimension in terms of what it can tell us about the hydrogeological settings and features note that only derivative slopes which rigorously correspond to a flow dimension are retained slopes more likely relating to transitions and boundary effects no flow or constant head were not included in the database in fact as defined by barker 1988 the flow dimension must reflect the properties of a volume of aquifer investigated by the cross flow area this definition of the flow dimension will be covered in the discussion section 4 2 1 analysis of the entire database 4 2 1 1 flow dimension values the database contains data from 69 well tests conducted in three different geological environments in roughly the same proportions crystalline rocks 19 pumping tests carbonate rocks 28 pumping tests and alluvial deposits 22 pumping tests the pumping tests were performed on average during 2 5 days 63 of the tests ranged from 2 to 4 days the four shortest well tests lasted 4 h 5 5 h 12 h and 15 h whereas the four longest well tests lasted 7 1 days 8 days 9 1 days and 14 7 days analysis of the data from these 69 pumping tests provided flow dimension distribution values ranging between 0 2 and 3 5 with a mean value of 1 7 and a standard deviation of 0 4 other studies have also analyzed the frequency of occurrence of the flow dimension from field data table 4 the frequencies of occurrence of n posited by the studies of bangoy et al 1992 kuusela lahtinen et al 2003 audouin and bodin 2008 and verbovšek 2009 2011 bring valuable insight as to how n occurs in fractured rock aquifers each of these 4 studies however is restricted to only one or two fractured rock settings and used n as a tool for refining the characterization of fractured media or to help in selecting the analytical model only one verbovšek 2009 2011 presented a statistical study aiming to analyse the influence of several parameters on n such as the lithological properties of dolomites their age the topographical settings the degree of penetration of the wells etc his study analyzes the statistical occurrence of n in a single geological setting the dolomites our study compared n to various environments such as crystalline and carbonate fractured rocks weathered crystalline rocks and fluvio glacial deposits in order to better understand the relationship between n and the local geological features because statistical studies examine and manipulate direct field information they contribute information in parallel to numerical studies and make it possible to enrich our physical interpretation of n because the data used for the studies of table 4 were obtained by means of various different methodologies to conduct pumping tests packer test slug test pumping test and a wide diversity of procedures to determine flow dimensions manual and automated type curve matching of s or ds dlogt sequential analysis of ds dlogt the studies should be compared with caution indeed the pumping test duration scale is different for all studies implying that the portion of each aquifer investigated by the pressure front pulse is no doubt variable we should remember that short term pumping test studies are only capable of expressing wellbore effects and the behavior of the aquifer in the area closest to the well fig 8 shows the occurrence of frequency of n in the entire database not considering the duration of observation of n the figure shows that there is a wide diversity of n values in particular the large clear bars of fig 8 show that the linear radial and spherical dimensions represent respectively 20 31 and 8 of the 121 flow dimensions analyzed non integer n values are also significantly represented the fractional n values in ranges 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 represent respectively 3 24 11 and 1 of all n values which together amount to a total of 38 of fractional flow dimension values radial flow regimes are observed in 55 of the 69 pumping tests and represent 31 of the 121 flow regimes that were interpreted overall large bars in fig 8 these radial flow regime occurrences are observed systematically in a sequence of several flow regimes with non radial flow dimensions as a result i the unique radial flow conditions as stipulated by theis are rarely observed in this database ii radial flow is observed only 31 of the overall reported flow regimes while it is assumed in an overwhelming majority of existing interpretative models in fact most analytical models published in the petroleum literature since the 80 s are variations on the radial theme the fact that we are now able to observe predominantly non radial flow dimensions emphasizes the need to develop interpretative models that represent the real dimension of flow more accurately than theis and theis derived models which remain commonly used it is interesting to note that the n values smaller than 2 equal to 2 and greater than 2 are associated with different flow behaviors 0 n 2 is related to an increase of the drawdown rate thus the head decline accelerates while n 2 expresses a decline of the drawdown rate thus the head decline decelerates a summary of the hydrodynamics of each class is given in table 5 based on the barker relation eq 1 the n values ranging between 0 and 1 are interpreted as a decrease of the cross flow area as it expands radially this can suggest a reduction of the transmissivity as the pressure front pulse expands or for n 0 a depletion of the aquifer the n values equal to 1 are associated with a cross flow area that is constant eq 1 suggesting that the pressure wave is diffusing through a channelized environment as explained above all the values of n 1 express an increase of a r table 3 that is induced by various geometries of boundaries transmissivity configurations fault matrix relations etc cf section 2 2 2 4 2 1 2 flow regime duration the duration of flow regimes is a critical point of the flow dimension analysis this issue was addressed by computing the mean of the logarithmic duration of n calculated as follows the number of observation of n of a pumping test of the logarithmic duration of n of a pumping test of the logarithmic durations of n of the entire database the thin dark bars of fig 8 represent the mean of the logarithmic duration of n right axis and the large bars of fig 8 show the frequency of occurrence of n left axis presenting these two types of information in combination shows that the most frequently observed flow dimensions are not necessarily the longer lasting ones in fact the thin dark bars show that the most stable long term flow dimensions are n 2 4 n 1 3 and n 1 6 which are observed during respective averages of 2 36 2 28 and 2 17 log cycles the sub radial flow dimension n 1 3 which is almost exclusively observed in alluvial deposits is observed during a long lasting duration 2 3 log cycles in average the bilinear flow dimension n 1 5 mostly observed in fractured rocks is observed during 1 9 log cycle on average on the contrary the radial flow dimension n 2 is one of the most frequent flow dimensions of the database 31 of the 121 flow dimensions but it is also one of the shortest lasting flow dimensions on average n 2 is observed during less than one log cycle 0 97 log cycle in average in fact in all the various geological settings n 2 has generally been observed at the beginning of the pumping tests and during a short time period the linear flow dimension n 1 is also related to a long lasting signal 1 7 log cycles in average and is observed in equal proportions between the alluvial deposits 7 the carbonates 8 and the crystalline rocks 5 insights on the conceptual interpretation of the observed flow dimensions are given in the following section by combining the values and the duration of n and the geological settings this figure also shows some relationships between the n values and the geological environments for instance n 1 3 is exclusively observed in alluvial deposits while n 1 5 and n 2 5 are almost exclusively observed in fractured rocks the affinity of n to certain environments suggests that the geological facies influences the geometry of the pressure wave and so the flow dimension it may be thus a valuable tool to explore the properties of the aquifer that control the flow regimes 4 2 1 3 flow dimension sequences the flow dimension values included the database are only those that are assumed to be representative of the properties of a volume of aquifer however the flow dimension sequence takes into account every slope of a signal thus for certain signals the wellbore effects transitions and or hydraulic boundaries are considered into the sequence most signals exhibit several successive flow regimes marked by different n values 88 of the pumping tests analyzed for this study were multi stage with 38 44 and 6 presenting respectively 2 3 and 4 sequences of flow dimensions fig 9 the n sequences express various geological facies that control the pressure wave and which are successively reached by this pressure wave fractured media produce a major proportion of n sequential signals they represent respectively 85 100 and 96 of the pumping tests performed in faulted crystalline rocks altered crystalline rocks and carbonate rocks this suggests that fractured media are complex heterogeneous systems involving various flow regimes fig 9 at early times a change of derivative slope may signal the evolution from wellbore and skin effects to the aquifer response at middle times and late times as the pressure front pulse expands through the aquifer variable slope sequences of ds dlogt can express changes in the hydraulic and or geometrical conditions of the aquifer transitions and or eventually the attainment of hydraulic boundaries note that the derivative signatures that are related to skin effects wellbore storage effects or hydraulic boundaries have not been included in the flow dimension database sequences of flow regimes have often been reported in various field and numerical studies conducted in fractured rock aquifers ehlig economides 1988 mattar 1997 escobar et al 2005 renard et al 2009 rafini and larocque 2012 this study based on an n sequential analysis further shows that contrary to current opinion alluvial deposits can also exhibit complex flow behaviors with discontinuous flow regimes and fractional n values primarily ranging from 1 to 2 a wide array of n values was observed in the database in different sequences of various durations and with varying frequencies of occurrence the following section describes the results obtained when comparing the flow regimes to the geological environments of wells in order to obtain insights on the physical interpretation of n 4 2 2 analysis of the distribution of n in different geological environments 4 2 2 1 crystalline rock aquifers based on 19 pumping tests the frequency histogram of n in crystalline rock aquifers displays scattered and highly variable values the faulted crystalline rocks fcr studied are located in canada while the altered crystalline rocks acr studied are located in france because the sequences and values of n are different between the 2 groups they were analyzed separately the fcr group of pumping tests which produced 24 distinct flow regimes with 13 pumping tests showed various n values characteristic of long lasting flow regimes the most significant n values are 1 2 5 2 1 5 representing respectively 38 21 17 and 8 of the fcr n and lasting respectively 1 6 1 5 0 9 and 2 7 log cycles fig 10 a the occurrence of linear n 1 and bilinear flow regimes n 1 5 in these environments corroborate their common conceptual interpretation as expressing the presence of conductive fractures n 1 has been attributed by gringarten et al 1974 1975 to an infinite conductivity fracture and by cinco ley et al 1978 and cinco ley and samaniego 1981 to a finite conductive fracture early pumping time the first conceptual model assumes a matrix linear flow originating from the uniformly depressurized fault which consequently acts as a planar source while the second model stipulates a linear flow occurring into the fault before the embedding matrix is depressurized the embedding environment is assumed to behave like a continuous porous media which means that the fracture network is dense with a sufficiently high degree of connectivity obviously any flow model that produces a diffusion of the cross flow area that does not change with distance will produce a linear flow regime linear flow regimes may also be produced in hard rock aquifers from one dimensional flow conduits formed at the intersection of two fractures or faults eq 1 in channels along the fault plane figueiredo et al 2016 or when a fracture set controls the flow in one direction the value n 1 5 has been associated with an aquifer composed of a vertical finite conductive fault supplied by a continuous theissian matrix with a hydraulic conductivity lower than the fault cinco ley et al 1978 cinco ley and samaniego v 1981 rafini and larocque 2012 the fractional values of n which range between 1 and 2 e g n 1 2 or n 1 7 have not to this date been assigned a conceptual description with the exception of n 1 5 some assumptions on the physical interpretation of sub radial flow dimensions can however be made regarding the properties of faulted fractured networks the distribution of transmissivity around the well and the geometry of faults or boundaries the only limitation is that the diffusion of the pressure disturbance must satisfy eq 1 for instance as stated by bowman et al 2012 n is influenced either by the geometry of flow conduits or by leakage effects into the conduits according to raghavan 2004 a decreasing permeability with distance from the wellbore leads to an increase of the ds dlogt signal 0 n 2 several authors have associated fractional flow dimensions to the scale invariant properties of fracture networks chang and yortsos 1990 bangoy et al 1992 acuna and yortsos 1995 de dreuzy et al 2000 doughty and karasaki 2002 walker et al 2006 following this principle it has been shown that fractional flow responses represent to a diffusion slow down into fractal networks and n is a function of the fractal dimension and the anomalous diffusion coefficient which likely indicates the presence of connectivity more recently figueiredo et al 2016 interpreted the sub radial flow dimension values to be related to the density of channel intersections or when a fracture is intersected by more than one inflow and one outflow fractures and local heterogeneities as a function of distance from the pumping well the sub spherical flow regime n 2 5 also occurs predominantly in our study by analysing both the lithostratigraphy of wellbore loggings and n we observe that this flow regime is statistically correlated with fractured rocks that are supplied by an overlying granular horizon obviously further field data and consistent numerical results are needed to establish any link between this flow dimension and possible leakage effects however one author doe 2002 stated that for a planar conductor a horizontal and tabular aquifer generating a radial flow regime leakage over the conductor surface may lead to a dimension somewhat greater than 2 no proof was presented this phenomenon will be investigated in future works note that 23 of cases in the fcr group show negative unit slopes of the ds dlogt signal which suggests that there are transitions to higher values of hydraulic properties rafini et al 2017 or transitions to another flow dimension value rafini and larocque 2012 or transitions to constant head boundary conditions walker and roberts 2003 transitions in fcr aquifers reflect heterogeneity of the fractured media when constant head boundary effects are observed in the fcr aquifers this reflects the existence of hydraulic relationships between the fractured media and lakes or rivers on the surface or may reflect a significant increase of the hydraulic conductivity or of the storage coefficient for instance a system of minor faults intersecting a major fault the acr group composed of 6 pumping tests and 10 n values is represented by flow dimension values ranging from 0 6 to 3 5 fig 10 b the spherical and the radial flow dimensions are frequently observed and each represents 18 but the radial flow is only observed during a short period of time the radial flow dimension is observed at early times or at late times depending on the derivative signatures the acr group is composed of sub linear n 0 8 linear n 1 sub radial n 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 radial n 2 sub spherical n 2 7 spherical n 3 and hyper spherical spherical n 3 5 flow dimensions comparatively to the fcr group the acr group demonstrates a lesser proportion of linear flow values and a greater proportion of n values higher than 2 7 the spherical flow dimension is observed in the acr group whereas it is not observed in the fcr group these features may be expressions of the effects of chemical alterations on fcr aquifers indeed chemical alteration increases the fracture density and the connectivity between fractures leading to a thicker flow media in which the pressure front pulse can expand more easily the altered rock aquifers are characterised by granitic sand overlaying a fractured weathered layer requiring the use of a screened borehole chemical alteration processes tend to increase the connectivity of existing fractures leading to an enhancement of the permeability of hard rock aquifers lachassagne 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 worthington et al 2016 according to these authors chemical processes such as the swelling of certain minerals can widen fractures as may be expected such expansion of the volume and hydraulic activity of fractures is revealed by a statistical increase of the flow dimension as observed here as well as a higher occurrence of the spherical flow regime in this context the spherical flow regime likely reflects conditions of a partially penetrating well in other words a situation in which a full volume aquifer which has a thickness much greater than the screened or open borehole window escobar et al 2012 ferroud et al 2015 this supposes that the density and connectivity of the fracture network are sufficiently high presumably as a consequence of weathering for the network to behave like a three dimensional continuum conceptually the well is associated with a point source involving a cross flow area expansion in the form of concentric spheres the value of n greater than 3 n 3 5 which is a long term and low noise signal fig 11 is enigmatic and requires more field and numerical investigations in order to be better understood however we provide some possible explanations in the general discussion section 4 2 2 2 carbonate aquifers the histogram of carbonate rock aquifers was established based on 29 pumping tests located in the regions of mirabel chcn slsj quebec nord pas de calais midi pyrénées france and kef tunisia the most observed n values are n 2 1 3 1 2 1 5 2 5 representing respectively 42 13 10 6 6 and 6 of the carbonate group lasting respectively 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 1 6 1 8 log cycles fig 10 c in terms of the ratio between the frequency of occurrence of n and its average log duration the radial flow regime is the most significant rafini and larocque 2012 demonstrated that a radial flow regime can be generated by horizontal faults jourde et al 2002 stipulated that a radial flow regime can be observed in an orthogonal discontinuity network when the fractures are well connected in general when the pressure front pulse is large enough smaller occasional heterogeneities will exert only a negligible impact on the large scale flow behavior in such a case the aquifer would be associated with an equivalent continuous media where a radial flow regime is feasible furthermore in fractured carbonate rocks the flow is supposed to be mainly governed by horizontal plane fractures that are cross connected by vertical fractures novakowski and lapcevic 1988 zanini et al 2000 such a conceptual model is well supported by the large proportion of n 2 values reported in these environments the early time radial flow observed in our database may indicate that the bedding plane fractures are well connected and contribute to the flow whereas the late time radial flow may be associated with the continuous like fracture network contribution at large scale when the cross flow area is large enough the fractured dolomite which generally presents a well developed fracture network that is cross connected to a less developed bedding plane fracture network is also favorable to the development of a radial flow dimension finally conceptual models with horizontal planes that exhibit only plane beddings such as those composed of pure non fractured limestones are also favorable to the establishment of a radial flow dimension rafini and larocque 2012 fig 10 c shows the presence of n 1 implying the influence of a vertical fault or an intersection of faults the size of the discontinuity may be understood based on the time period during which the flow regime occurs an early time linear regime may be due to a submeter scale vertical fracture while a late time linear regime may reveal the presence of large scale vertical faults on the contrary the value of n 1 5 expresses the presence of a leaky vertical fault supplied by a conductive matrix embedded in the fracture network which is sufficiently transmissive and connected in order to significantly feed the fault the fractional values of flow dimension non integer n values are commonly interpreted to be associated with the fractal properties of fractured rock systems crystalline or carbonate aquifers the fractal flow models assume that the fractured rock is composed of scale invariant fracture geometries when during a same pumping test a sequence of integer and non integer values of n are observed this compromises the fractal theory which is based on assumptions regarding the homogeneity and density of fractures the mismatch between the fractal dimension and n has been reported verbovšek 2009 rafini and larocque 2012 indeed verbovšek 2009 using a statistical approach shows that the fractal dimension parameter obtained by the classic box counting method and n obtained by an automated type curve matching of the drawdown log derivative signal are not correlated he interprets the fractional n values as being related to the degree of connectivity between the fractures carbonate rocks are the context with the most variable flow dimension values the values range between 0 2 and 3 with fractional sub radial flow dimensions of n 1 2 1 3 1 5 1 6 1 8 and sub spherical flow dimensions of n 2 3 2 4 2 5 this variability in flow dimension reflects an important variability of fracture and fault configurations as shown by the thin dark bars of fig 10 c these flow dimensions are generally stable and long term this variability in the n values reflects environments with a variability of fractures and or fault configurations some pumping tests performed in carbonate rock aquifers exhibit late times unit slopes in the petroleum literature such a flow regime is commonly associated with a reservoir that is depleted with no spatial diffusion of drawdown among others mattar 1997 ehlig economides and vera 2013 in other words the no flow boundaries have been attained this assumption is consistent with carbonate systems where sealing faults are frequent due to self forming calcite or clay seals this late time unit slope may express the attainment of sealing faults or impermeable boundaries in every direction observing this signal in cfr aquifers suggests either that the productive zones are limited to specific fracture zones in the vicinity of the pumping well or that sealed faults are frequently reached by the pressure wave negative unit slopes are also observed between some flow dimensions and may reflect a transition period between two flow dimensions or may be related to a significant change in hydraulic conductivity for instance the dual porosity model warren and root 1963 assumes a transitional flow period between two radial flow regimes which represents firstly the water supply from the fracture network and secondly the water supply from the matrix rafini and larocque 2012 show that when a finite conductive vertical fault is not connected to the well a transitional flow period is observed between the radial flow through the matrix and the bilinear flow through the leaky fault the frequent occurrence of negative unit slopes thus expresses heterogeneous media with participation of several flow regimes 4 2 2 3 fluvial glacial deposit aquifers the fluvio glacial deposit fgd histogram generated in this study comprises 22 pumping tests conducted in the regions of chcn and slsj quebec and the eskers of the abitibi region quebec the most prominent flow dimensions in terms of frequency of occurrence and duration are represented by n 1 3 and 1 representing respectively 20 and 17 of the fgd group composed of 46 n values lasting respectively 2 2 2 3 log cycles fig 10 d all the pumping tests performed in the eskers of the abitibi region showed a long term and single stage pseudo linear flow regime n 1 3 the linear flow regime in fluvioglacial deposits has until now seldom been investigated two studies interpreted the linear flow in granular aquifers to be related to two different contexts i a long and narrow system which channels the flow between two parallel impermeable hydraulic boundaries or low permeability levees escobar et al 2004a escobar and montealegre m 2007 such systems may be observed in channelized deposits such as glacial hollows filled by sediments or eskers ii micro cross flow within non communicating layers indeed by modelling pumping tests in fluvial deposits corbett et al 2012 observed that the deposit systems formed by the transport and deposition of sediments exhibit characteristics of hydraulic conductivity distribution anisotropy and geometry which strongly influence the hydraulic behavior of these systems they showed that a decrease of lateral transmissivity and a poor lateral connectivity of facies favor the development of an increasing slope of the derivative signal which implies a linear pseudo linear n which they named the ramp effect as stated by corbett et al 2012 the internal properties of fluvial sediments are valuable assumptions which greatly contribute to the interpretation of such linear flow regimes being long and narrow systems eskers are fluvioglacial deposits whose geometry favors the establishment of linear flow regimes however the pseudo linear flow regimes observed in the database are more enigmatic more field and numerical studies are needed to determine the geological facies involved in such flow regimes a significant number 8 of spherical flow regimes are reported in this study notably in thick deposit aquifers these systems characterized by a screen thickness significantly smaller than the aquifer thickness favor the establishment of n 3 in some cases the variable thickness aquifer is a more valuable conceptual model to explain this value of n for instance one of the pumping tests showing a spherical flow was performed in a topographic depression that had been carved and then filled by glaciers the geometrical increase of the aquifer thickness associated with the depression favors the establishment of a spherical flow regime dal soglio 2012 rafini et al 2014 the fgd group displays early unit negative slopes of the ds dlogt signal which may indicate a transition period between the wellbore effects and the aquifer s signal tiab 1995 it is not surprising to observe wellbore effects more frequently in deposit aquifers than in fractured aquifers because granular boreholes require a screen which may induce skin effects while the borehole dug into fractured rock is a simple open hole without a screen as explained above fractional n values are widely interpreted to reflect the fractal properties of the fractured rock media an interpretation that is challenged by the observation of frequent non integer values of n in granular aquifers mostly in the range of 1 2 it should be noted that no relationship between n and the confinement conditions of the aquifer confined unconfined has been observed the typical type curve provided by neuman s solution has not been observed either 5 discussion this study has collected and summarized the flow dimension values of several pumping tests and reviewed the current published assumptions used to interpret these flow dimension values any flow model where the transient flow area changes by a certain value of the power of the distance to the well corresponds to a specific flow dimension this is the reason why the assumptions presented in the result and discussion section are non unique it is possible for different hydraulic and geometrical configurations to yield a same value of flow dimension when conducting the n sequential analysis it is important to keep in mind that the propagation of the pressure front pulse is a diffusive process and that the drawdown behavior is governed by averaged conditions rather than by local heterogeneities horne 1995 furthermore the flow dimension is not an integrative value that would represent a combination of all the flow regimes rather it is an apparent value that reflects the dominant flow regime which influences the cross flow area diffusion felt by the pressure front pulse for instance as modeled by rafini and larocque 2012 a vertical leaky fault located in a homogeneous matrix generates the n sequence 1 5 2 reflecting firstly the influence of the fault and secondly the influence of the matrix under no circumstance will the second n express a mean value between the two flow regimes rather it should be underlined that the second flow regime is a value that expresses the flow regime related to the most influential flow of the hydrogeological facies the sequences of n can thus be interpreted independently and successively because each flow regime observed during a single pumping test exists independent from any other it is conceivable to interpret an n sequential signal by successively matching various analytical solutions as done by hammond and field 2014 the drawdown log derivative signal and barker s law help in better interpreting the flow regime occurring during a constant rate pumping test in order to use the flow dimension value as a diagnostic tool it is important however to keep in mind that the cross flow area is growing as the pressure wave is diffused through the aquifer due to the expansion of the cross flow area a variation in the observational scale must be considered hence the sensitivity of the transient well test signal to small heterogeneities diminishes as the radius of investigation increases beauheim et al 2004 highlighted the importance of considering the scale when analysing the flow dimensions of pumping tests in a heterogeneous aquifer they stated that for a single pumping well different estimated flow dimensions can be obtained depending on the pumping test method used indeed some of these pumping tests may not have the same radius of investigation such as for instance slug test compared to pumping test it is worth noting that the extent and the diffusion rate of the radius of investigation is independent of the pumping rate because it is an intrinsic value only associated with the diffusive properties of the aquifer transmissivity and storage the interpretation of flow regimes employs successive linear regressions on derivative data into several time windows the recognition of these time windows and the confidence this provides for the interpretation of flow dimension remains a sensitive aspect of the approach that may in some cases leave uncertainties a manual interpretation is recommended rather than any automated process which optimizes regression coefficient sequences indeed the quality of regressions is not the only component of a proper interpretation of flow regimes a manual analysis of derivative data makes it possible to identify pumping rate stops or changes to award a lesser degree of significance to certain noisy sections that have a more obvious and greater degree of data instability either instrumental due to a temporary high diffuse heterogeneity field or for other reasons furthermore the practitioner conducting a manual interpretation may benefit from derivative differentiation without being misled by it in other words to stick to raw data we finally submit that a simultaneous fit on both s and ds dlogt significantly contributes to reducing subjectivity issues regarding the interpretation of flow regimes a major issue of any derivative analysis remains the quality of the data even though derivative data are advantageously highly sensitive to hydrodynamic changes in the aquifer they are also strongly impacted by noise sources either natural or instrumental it is not rare that noise impedes any confident and unique interpretation of derivative curves as stated by anderson et al 2006 interpreting a pumping test without taking data quality into account can lead to the erroneous understanding of aquifer features various differentiation methods are proposed in the literature to improve the signal noise ratio the deconvolution techniques initially proposed by birsoy and summers 1980 in hydrogeology and by von schroeter et al 2001 and azi et al 2008 in the petroleum industry make it possible to assess the equivalent constant rate drawdown of a variable rate test the practice is extremely popular in petroleum studies to process the transient tests before their interpretation azi et al 2008 gringarten 2010 onur and kuchuk 2012 obeahon et al 2014 these approaches require knowledge of the drawdown s the time t and the pumping rate q it may be advantageous to adopt this data processing practice in hydrogeology studies in order to improve the accuracy of interpretations the deconvolution tools could not have been integrated in this study due to the lack of detailed pumping rate survey data even though variations in pumping rate steps do not influence the estimation of the flow dimension because single variations do not change the general trend of the derivative signal and may thus be disregarded in the analysis each pumping rate adjustment strongly affects the derivative signal by generating significant noise thus analysing the recovery data appears to be a favorable option practitioners must however be aware that drawdown and recovery signals are not necessarily similar as stated by mattar 1997 1999 the differences between the drawdown and the buildup data appear when the test is affected by aquifer heterogeneities or boundaries because the analytical type curves are mostly configured for drawdown the drawdown data are needed to estimate the hydraulic properties the buildup signal should be interpreted qualitatively in addition to the drawdown data because it is not subject to disturbances caused by changes in pumping rate the buildup signal should indeed be analyzed in order to help with the diagnostics rather than for quantitative analysis when using the derivative signal in order to estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifer it is important to keep in mind that i the flow dimension value can reflect the geometry of the aquifer and or the geometry of the well and or the geometry of the flow and or the geometry and connectivity of fractures in fractured media and ii certain mechanisms can disrupt the signal of the aquifer in early times the signal of the aquifer can be masked or disrupted by wellbore effects at middle times the aquifer s signal can be influenced by rain infiltration or leakage at late times the signal of the aquifer can be masked by boundary conditions when interpreting flow regimes it is therefore important to have good knowledge of the environment surrounding the well and the conditions of the pumping tests further numerical simulations are needed to i distinguish such effects from the aquifer s signal and ii develop analytical equations for non radial flow regimes the spherical flow dimensions of the entire database were analyzed in order to correlate the well conditions of a partial penetrating completed screened pumping well with the frequency of occurrence of the spherical flow dimension the spherical flow dimension is observable in 10 pumping tests four of which were performed in alluvial deposits two in weathered crystalline rock aquifers three in carbonate rocks and one with a screen intercepting both a carbonate rock and a moraine table 6 according to escobar et al 2012 the early times flow dimension is significantly influenced by the penetration ratio of the pumping well moncada et al 2005 explained that the typical 0 5 slope of the ds dlogt signal which is characteristic of the spherical flow dimension is absent for penetration ratios greater than 40 based on this knowledge we interpret three pumping tests to be related to partial penetration effects because the penetration ratios are lower than 29 table 6 the pumping well of la narce shows a long term and weakly noisy signal with n 3 5 fig 11 we suggest that this hyper spherical flow dimension may reflect a partial penetrating well effect combined with leakage effects we will discuss this assumption in the next paragraph unfortunately three pumping tests with n 3 are not interpretable due to a lack of data or poor conditions the static level is 0 77 m above the top of the screen and the dynamic level is below the top of the screen finally three of the signatures show a spherical flow dimension but cannot be interpreted with the partially penetrating well effects suggesting that other conditions may produce such a spherical flow dimension the non unicity of the derivative signal has already been reported in the literature and will be discussed in the next sections more field and numerical analyses are thus needed to interpret these pumping tests this paragraph aims at providing some thoughts about barker s model and widening the concepts of the flow dimension parameter that may be related to leakage effects since the initial development of the grf model by barker 1988 the interpretation of the flow dimension has been extended as previously explained in section 2 2 2 the fractal interpretation of fractional values has been open to non space filling doe 1991 non fractal fractured media settings jourde et al 1998 maréchal et al 2008 giese et al 2017 and non homogeneous systems rafini and larocque 2009 rafini and larocque 2009 2012 explained that a vertical fault which is expected to induce a linear flow dimension n 1 actually produces a bilinear flow dimension n 1 5 because the flow from the matrix supplies the fault furthermore we observed a statistical correlation between the sub spherical flow dimension n 2 5 and the fractured rocks that are supplied by an overlying granular horizon in addition doe 2002 explained that a media inducing a radial flow dimension which is supplied by leakage may lead to a dimension somewhat greater than 2 these observations lead us to suppose that the sub radial flow dimensions 2 n 3 may reflect a system that induces a radial flow dimension which is supplied by leakage also we observed a sub radial flow dimension n 1 3 in eskers that are highly transmissive flow conduits supplied by surrounding alluvial deposits in the same line of thought the esker flow system is expected to induce a linear flow dimension but leakage around eskers results in increasing linear flow dimension to reach sub radial flow dimension thus a system supplied by leakage seems to induce a flow dimension somewhat greater than expected based on this observation a point source system or a partially penetrating well that produces n 3 which is supplied by leakage may induce a hyper spherical flow dimension indeed we observe a hyper spherical flow dimension n 3 5 in the la nacre weathered crystalline rock fourth line of table 6 and fig 11 we assume that this value reflects the signal of a partially penetrating well expected to induce n 3 that is supplied by leakage this assumption is in line with the conceptual models of weathered crystalline rock aquifers lachassagne 2008 lachassagne et al 2011 worthington et al 2016 6 conclusion based on 69 constant rate pumping tests this study presents an overview of the occurrence in nature of the flow dimension parameter in fractured altered crystalline rock aquifers carbonate aquifers and fluvio glacial deposit aquifers the database is provided in table 7 the real flow dimension statistics obtained in this study emphasize the generally major prevalence of non radial flow regimes in nature expressed by a wide diversity of n values indeed the flow dimension values obtained in this study range between 0 and 3 5 with 69 of the 121 interpreted flow dimensions producing a value for n that is different from 2 a key element of information obtained in this study is that the flow dimension analysis delivers results that are significantly different from one geological setting to another in terms of n values variability of the duration of n and n sequences more particularly the most statistically significant flow dimensions in terms of duration and frequency of occurrence display a higher degree of correlation with the geological conditions around the well this shows that the hydrodynamic interpretation of these flow dimensions has a physical expression that may relates to the geological framework this confirms the positive association between conceptual models and flow dimension analysis for instance faulted hard rock aquifers exhibit a high proportion of linear flow regimes which may express drawdown diffusion through vertical faults embedded into no flow boundaries or one dimensional flow conduits formed by an intersection of faults pumping tests performed in altered crystalline rocks and thick alluvial aquifers preferentially produce spherical and pseudo spherical flow regimes these can be related to partial completion penetration of wells or partial screening effects which produce point sources generating spherical equipotential surfaces or any aquifer s configurations that may lead to a proportional relation of the cross flow area a r and r2 fluvio glacial aquifers exhibit a high frequency of single stage linear or pseudo linear responses these were related to channelized shapes typical of fluvio glacial environments such as eskers or micro cross flows which result from internal heterogeneities within the granular layers it is interesting to note that contrary to common opinion the radial flow assumption is in many cases not suitable to model granular aquifers of the database finally carbonate rock aquifers exhibit a high proportion of radial flow regimes interpreted either as the influence of conductive horizontal strata or of large scale equivalent continuous media the use of derivative data allows for a much greater degree of uniqueness of the interpretative type curves as compared to drawdown only observing similar flow dimensions in different geological facies raises the issue of non uniqueness of the log derivative signal for instance linear flow regimes have been observed in both fractured rock and fluvio glacial deposit aquifers as stated by mattar 1997 several conceptual models predict identical ds dlogt type curves but the estimated aquifer parameters geometry hydraulic properties will be very different from one model to the other massonnat and bandiziol 1991 and liang et al 2012 point out the critical insights regarding the geological context to take into account when choosing the adequate analytical model an interesting continuity of this paper would be to review all the sequences of n that are observed in nature and analytically modeled in order to assess the potential advantages of using the n sequential approach to improve the uniqueness of ds dlogt interpretations finally our compilation revealed that in natural aquifers radial flow regimes occur quite infrequently representing overall 31 of the flow regimes that were interpreted for this study most of the radial flow dimensions were generally observed at early times and were mostly related to a short and noisy signal in view of these results it is remarkable that most interpretative models available in the literature describe various types of combined or modified but still radial behaviors within the radial interpretative framework this demonstrates that current and common interpretations using either theis or theis derived models are in fact hydraulic approximations as they do not account for the real dimension of flow in aquifers this calls in question the reliability of any interpretative model that does not integrate a flow dimension analysis new knowledge about occurrences of n in nature may provide impetus to the development of new non radial flow conceptual models more representative of observed real situations and more globally to further research on the flow dimension parameter the analysis and interpretation of aquifers based on the results of pumping tests might in fact be in its infancy a common yet non consensual conceptual interpretation of fractional flow dimension consists in relating it to a gain or a loss of connections in fractures networks with increasing investigation scale e g leveinen 2000 however our compilation of n values occurrences in various geological contexts indicate that such fractional flow dimensions do not occur more likely in hard rock than in granular settings fig 10 this leads to consider other avenues than fractured networks for the conceptual interpretation of fractional flow regimes furthermore the database highlighted correlations between some fractional n values and leakage in fact some sub radial e g n 1 3 sub spherical e g n 2 5 and hyper spherical e g n 3 5 flow dimensions seem to be related to conceptual models which are influenced by leakage and which were expected to produce respectively a linear a radial and a spherical flow dimension it has already been established that a vertical fault expected to induce a linear flow dimension which is supplied by the matrix produces a bilinear flow dimension n 1 5 rafini and larocque 2009 we planned to numerically investigate the issue of leakage in order to confirm our assumptions based on field observations from a more practical viewpoint we now know with more certainty that automatically assuming that a flow regime is radial may lead practitioners to over or under estimate the hydraulic properties of the aquifers they are studying non radial flow regimes will typically generate investigation areas whose shape is different from that of a regular circle produced by a cylindrical radial flow consequently in most real life cases whpa delineation may be significantly biased because of erroneous postulates regarding flow dimension regimes when a radial flow is observable on a log log plot of ds dlogt the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is accurately estimated when using the radial derivative analysis eq 14 aquifer evaluation may be improved by analysing the duration and sequences of the flow dimension as it directly relates to the geometrical diffusion of the pressure front pulse further research work is needed in order to develop equations that estimate the hydraulic properties of a non radial flow regime aquifer and to better understand the physical meaning of fractional flow dimensions finally we recommend improving hydrogeological pumping test practices through the inclusion of the flow dimension analysis in the pumping test interpretation in particular both the head and the pumping rate should be accurately measured using a logarithmic time step it should be remembered that the derivative signal is very sensitive to small variations of the drawdown and the pumping rate pumping rate adjustments will generate noise in the derivative signal and pumping rate drifts can induce an apparent flow dimension which is different from the equivalent constant rate flow dimension

7568,acid rain has the potential to significantly impact the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter dom leached from soil to groundwater yet to date the effects of acid rain have not been investigated in karstic systems which are expected to strongly buffer the ph of atmospheric rainfall this study presents a nine year dom fluorescence dataset from a karst unsaturated zone collected from two drip sites hs4 hs6 in heshang cave southern china between 2005 and 2014 cross correlograms show that fluorescence intensity of both dripwaters lagged behind rainfall by 1 year 11 months lag for hs4 and 13 months for hs6 whereas drip rates responded quite quickly to rainfall 0 months lag for hs4 and 3 months for hs6 based on optimal correlation coefficients the rapid response of drip rates to rainfall is related to the change of reservoir head pressure in summer associated with higher rainfall in winter low rainfall has a limited effect on head pressure and drip rates gradually slow to a constant value associated with base flow from the overlying reservoir this effect being most evident on inter annual timescales r2 0 80 for hs4 and r2 0 86 for hs6 n 9 p 0 01 we ascribed the 1 year lag of fluorescence intensity to the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the karst process on delaying water and solute transport after eliminating the one year lag the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and rainfall observed suggests that the seasonality of fluorescence intensity was mainly controlled by the monsoonal rains which can govern the output of dom from the soil as well as the residence time of water in the unsaturated zone on inter annual timescales a robust linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and annual effective precipitation amount r2 0 86 for hs4 and r2 0 77 for hs6 n 9 p 0 01 was identified implying that annual effective precipitation is the main determinant of dom concentration in the aquifer conversely the insensitivity of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence wavelength maxima to variations in the ph of local rainfall suggests that acid rain over the study period ph 5 6 to 4 5 had no discernable effect on the quantity and quality of dom in karst soil and soil solution likely being strongly buffered by soil carbonates therefore despite large increases in anthropogenic acid rain in recent chinese history hydrologic forcing is the predominant factor driving variations in dom in karst aquifers keywords karst groundwater unsaturated zone dissolved organic matter fluorescence climate change acid rain 1 introduction groundwater is a major water resource for human societies and is of increasing importance because of overuse and serious contamination of surface fresh water in some countries shen et al 2015 mccormack et al 2016 this situation is much worse in the karst aquifers of southern china which are characterized by a high vulnerability to contamination ford and williams 2007 jiang et al 2009 protecting the quality of karst groundwater is therefore a key challenge for this region natural organic matter nom in groundwater mainly derives from the soil zone and is a potential contaminant in groundwater because of the ability of nom to transport contaminants ritson et al 2014 schiperski et al 2015 graham et al 2015 hartmann et al 2016 nom can also transform into carcinogenic disinfection by products during ozonation and chlorination in drinking water treatment processes and this becomes relevant when considering groundwater for use as a potable water resource papageorgiou et al 2016 moreover the composition of nom also influences groundwater quality nom can be operationally divided into particle organic matter pom around 0 45 μm and dissolved organic matter dom around 0 45 μm based on typical filtration protocols e g hartland et al 2011 andrade eiroa et al 2013 dom can be further classified into colloidal diameter defined between 1 nm and 1 μm

fractions characterized by low aromaticity and molecular weight e g containing more carboxylic groups thurman 1985 senesi et al 1991 tipping and woof 1991 ekström et al 2011 due to the specific surface chemistry and high stability of dom it can directly facilitate the solubility and transport of contaminants such as toxic metals between surface environments and aquifers ultimately deteriorating groundwater quality hartland et al 2012 2014 2015 yang et al 2012 rutlidge et al 2014 klučáková and kalina 2015 it is well understood that dom accounts for a large fraction of nom in groundwater up to 90 and can be considered synonymous with nom e g thurman 1985 andrade eiroa et al 2013 acid rain ph 5 6 has been proposed to strongly influence the quantity and quality of dom in soil solution through changes in the ionization of constituent organic molecules evans et al 2005 sanclements et al 2012 widespread studies of dom increases in natural waters from across europe and north america have been reported over the last two decades these have been largely ascribed to the long term rebound in rainwater ph which has been recorded across many of these areas and which is the result of reductions in the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides de wit et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 clark et al 2010 sanclements et al 2012 these widely observed increases in dom in surface waters are also supported by data from laboratory experiments substantiating the positive relationship between dom solubility and the ph of soil or soil solution through two processes 1 increased solubility of al and fe ions which strongly complex with dom bohan et al 1997 lofts et al 2001 qiu et al 2015 and 2 the addition of acidity which can reduce the solubility of organic matter by increases in intermolecular and intramolecular bonding tipping and woof 1991 lumsdon et al 2005 in conjunction with large changes in dom concentration induced by acidification changes in dom quality are expected hydrophobic dom requires a greater net charge to become soluble relative to hydrophilic dom thurman 1985 senesi et al 1991 tipping and woof 1991 ekström et al 2011 decreasing ph therefore lowers the solubility of phenol rich hydrophobic acids leading to soil water dominated by hydrophilic compounds david et al 1989 ekström et al 2011 the current debate around the effects of acidification on dom implicitly assumes that ph increases have the opposite effect the effect of acid rain on dom in different terrains remains controversial due to the heterogeneities in pedology and hydrology kennedy et al 1996 bohan et al 1997 evans et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 and the intervention of climate factors e g air temperature precipitation evans et al 2005 clark et al 2010 ritson et al 2014 for example many temperate soils rich in clay minerals and organic matter have substantial acid neutralising capacities likens et al 1996 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 which show relatively little ph change when they exposed to acid rain whereas strongly acid soils from the humid tropics have little capacity to buffer additional acidity and therefore may respond more quickly to acid deposition in karstic systems overlying soils generally contain broken up carbonate bedrock fairchild and baker 2012 and should have considerable capacity to buffer the acidity of the soil solution previous cave studies of dom have mainly focused on the relationship between the variation of dom and climate changes on seasonal timescales dom concentration in karst dripwaters have been thought to be driven by the flushing of soil dom which is dependent on production of mobile soil dom and rainfall exceeding field capacity e g toth 1998 baker and genty 1999 van beynen et al 2000 2002 ban et al 2008 tissier et al 2013 on inter annual timescales cruz et al 2005 identified that increased dom concentration and fluorescence intensity in cave dripwaters could be related to increased air temperature in the prior winter which potentially promoted greater humification in the soil zone and an increased supply of dom in the following wet season furthermore ban et al 2008 have shown that the structure of the dom peak in dripwaters from shihua cave northern china varies from year to year influenced by the intensity and frequency of rainfall however the effect of acid rain as a driver of dom dynamics in karst systems remains largely untested when soil dom is mobilized into the karst aquifer the transport process in the unsaturated zone consisting of soil epikarst and transmission zone ford and williams 2007 pronk et al 2009 also exerts an influence on the concentration of dom many studies of dom discharge from karst springs have shown higher dom concentration in the wet season and lower concentration in the dry season the lower dry season concentration potentially being caused by increased mineralization and degradation of dom during transit emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2014 dom was therefore often considered a useful tracer relative to certain traditional geochemical tracers to characterize the hydrological process infiltration residence time emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 most of the previous studies on this topic focused on the soil epikarst where infiltrating water was sensitive to the infiltration event e g pronk et al 2009 mudarra and andreo 2011 tissier et al 2013 mudarra et al 2014 however studies focusing on the transfer of dom in the unsaturated zone transmission zone are clearly needed to better understand dom dynamics within the entire karst system southern china following europe and north america became the third region to suffer from acid rain in the beginning of the 1990s fig 1 a larssen et al 1999 tang et al 2010 at the same time the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river have exhibited frequent episodes of droughts and floods over the past ten years this sensitive region which is now exposed to climate change and acid rain offers an opportunity to evaluate the effect of acid rain as well as climate change on the variation of dom in karst groundwater heshang cave 30 27 n 110 25 e 294 m altitude fig 1a is situated in the middle reaches of the yangtze river southern china hu et al 2008 previous studies have confirmed that perennial dripwaters in heshang cave are fed by the large overlying aquifer reservoir duan et al 2016 owen et al 2016 heshang cave is therefore eligible as a sentinel of changes in local karst groundwater quality in this study samples of groundwater collected from two drip sites in heshang cave between 2005 and 2014 were analyzed using fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize both the quantity and quality of dom baker et al 2007 fellman et al 2010 bridgeman et al 2011 stedmon et al 2011 ritson et al 2014 the long term dom record from heshang cave also can offer an opportunity to investigate the dom transfer process and evaluate the residence time of dom in the unsaturated zone of the karst aquifer 2 method 2 1 study site the east asian monsoon dominates the climate of the study region with a warm and moist summer but a relatively cold and dry winter fig 1a annual rainfall recorded at yichang about 90 km away from the study site is 1162 234 mm 1s n 59 from 1950 to 2008 fig 1b approximately 70 of the annual rainfall occurs between may and september and the annual mean evapotranspiration of the yichang region from 1985 to 2005 was 734 mm zhang and li 2006 heshang cave extends sub horizontally from its mouth on the bank of the qingjiang river for a distance of 250 m the cave is developed on the hinge zone of a large ns anticline within cambrian dolomite fig 1c hu et al 2008 the dolomite host rock is permeable due to fracturing and karstification and thus forms a carbonate aquifer the cave is currently located in the unsaturated zone of the aquifer and the entrance of the cave is about 30 m above the present day level of the qingjiang river fig 1c the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the cave is highly variable from about 50 300 m due to a steep terrain hu et al 2008 the dolomite rock is covered by a discontinuous and thin 30 cm soil layer derived from wind blown carbonate bedrock and silicate dust human activity was rare due to the precipitous path leading to the cave rainwater infiltrates through fissures and fractures within the unsaturated zone to drip through the cave roof the cave is wet throughout the year with active drips standing pools of water and some flowing water close to the back of the cave during flood events hu et al 2008 long et al 2015 drip sites hs4 hs6 are located 150 m further into the cave and the distance between the two sites is about 4 m fig 1c two coeval columnar stalagmites fed by two drip points hu et al 2008 suggests that more than one steady reservoir exists above cave roof to recharge the two drip sites the drip rates of two sites can be considered to be fed by fissure flow according to the classification of smart and friedrich 1987 the lack of a geochemical response at two drippoints to the transition from drought to wet conditions e g δ44 42ca δ18o suggests that the perennial dripwaters are well mixed and hence geochemical signals become attenuated between event water and water stored in overlying aquifer reservoirs consistent with 1 year of residence time duan et al 2016 owen et al 2016 2 2 data and water sample collection precipitation and air temperature outside the cave since 2003 were measured automatically every 2 h using a hobo data logging rain gauge rg3 m and hobo pro v2 logger u23 001 both installed at a 1 5 meter high wood shelf on a flat roof of a dwelling in the local village which is 2 km away from heshang cave at a similar elevation the logger records are identical to those of the meteorological station at changyang 30 28 n 111 11 e 144 2 m fig 1b on both seasonal and shorter timescales hu et al 2008 the dataset of daily rainwater ph was collected from four acid rain monitoring stations including yichang zigui jianshi and wufeng around the study site fig 1b the basic coordinates and distances to heshang cave are summarized in table s1 the span of the dataset was from 2005 to 2015 data quality was examined by the conductivity of precipitation k ph inequality method proposed by tang et al 2008 analysis of ph values greater than 9 0 or less than 2 0 was not considered reliable and was discarded the monthly and annual january to december ph of rainwater was calculated by volume weighted mean method of concentration of h and rainfall amount water samples from two drip sites were collected at 30 40 day intervals between 2005 and 2014 the samples were collected in 50 ml sealed glass bottles and refrigerated immediately upon return from the field li et al 2014 drip rates were recorded by manual counting for two minute timespans during each sampling trip and then converted to ml min by assuming a constant volume of 0 15 ml per drip baker and barnes 1998 the annual mean drip rate is calculated as the arithmetic mean unless otherwise stated also the other parameters discussed herein monthly cumulative rainwater samples were collected in a 5 l hdpe bottle with a funnel which is placed at the wood shelf on the flat roof between 2011 and 2015 the external body of hdpe bottle was covered with foil paper and the bottom of the hdpe bottle was coated with 0 5 cm thick mineral oil to prevent evaporation prior to use for next month the bottle was cleaned and dried the sub samples of the homogenized precipitation were collected into pre cleaned 8 ml glass sealed bottles for measurement of sulfate concentration 2 3 sample analysis analysis of dom was completed on 0 22 μm filtered dripwater samples using a ls 55 perkin elmer luminescence spectrophotometer at china university of geosciences wuhan china fluorescence emission spectra at an optimal excitation wavelength of 320 nm were recorded across wavelengths scanning from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm steps with slits set to 5 nm for excitation and 20 nm for emission analyses were performed at room temperature and blank water deionized water scans were run every 10 15 analyses the fluorescence intensity for each sample was corrected against the intensity of blank water to eliminate the rayleigh and tyndall scatter and partly the raman scatter fig 2 the reproducibility of the emission spectrum of blank water was relatively high for which the emission intensity at 360 nm averaged out at 210 10 1s n 12 arbitrary units a u during the measurement sulfate concentration in rainwater was analysed using a dionex ics 900 system equipped with chromeleon 7 0 software at changsha uranium geology research institute the ion chromatograph was calibrated using an external standard sulfate solution gsb 07 1268 2000 to ensure accuracy and stability with a detection limit of 0 1 mg l sulfur emissions can be directly linked to the higher acidity of rainfall in this region therefore the ph of rainwater could be calculated by the sulfate concentration in rainwater due to a natural background s value exists in rainwater we assume that the minimum sulfate concentration in rainwater was as the natural background s value which exists in all local rainwaters and the ph of natural rainwater with minimum sulfate concentration is defined as 5 6 in addition we also need to assume that sulfuric acid could ionize completely that is one mole of s concentration can contribute 2 mol of h thus the equation was as follows 1 ph r log 10 2 c r c min m 10 5 6 where c r is the sulfate concentration in rainwater c min is the minimum sulfate concentration in rainwater from 2011 to 2015 m is mass number of sulfate ph r is the predicted ph of rainwater 3 results 3 1 climate variation the daily precipitation amount between january 2004 and february 2014 ranged from 0 to 98 mm and the seasonal rhythm of precipitation was characterized by higher rainfall in summer june august and lower rainfall in winter december february fig 3 a and cyan bars as the east asian monsoon varies in strength from year to year the annual precipitation amount varied distinctly and ranged from 763 mm to 1354 mm averaging 984 mm during the monitoring period table 1 mean monthly air temperature between january 2004 and february 2014 ranged from 2 9 to 29 6 c with the lowest air temperatures recorded in january february and the highest in july august fig 3i annual mean air temperature varied from 16 4 to 18 4 c with an average of 17 4 c table 1 the ph dataset of daily rainwater from four acid rain monitoring stations around heshang cave all presented increasing trends during 2005 2015 fig s1 the monthly volume weighted ph series from four stations each exhibited statistically significant increasing trends table s1 the monthly ph value from four stations ranged from 3 49 to 6 17 with higher ph values in summer and lower ph values in winter generally reflecting the relative intensity of the sulfate emission locally with lower rainwater sulfate concentration in summer and higher sulfate concentration in winter fig 4 the annual volume weighted ph value of rainwater from all stations ranged from 4 18 to 5 22 and showed increasing trends across the study period table s1 and fig s1 the sulfate concentration in monthly cumulative rainwater varied across a wide range from 1 89 to 30 1 mg l during the period 2011 2015 with a higher content in winter and lower content in summer fig 4 according to the eq 1 the predicted ph of local rainwater ranged from 3 53 to 5 60 with higher values in summer and lower values in winter fig 4 the annual volume weighted predicted ph value ranged from 4 17 to 4 57 with a statistically significant increasing trend fig 5 in spite of the bias between predicted ph value of rainwater in the study site and monitoring ph values of rainwater in yichang station the temporal variation of predicted ph in local rainwater is concordant with the temporal ph distribution of yichang station which suggested that deposition of acids of two places were synchronous fig 5 as for the bias it may be related to the incomplete ionization of sulfuric acid considering that the ph of rainwater in the study site was mainly responsive to the ph record of yichang station the ph dataset of yichang acid rain station is therefore adopted in the following discussion 3 2 dripwater discharge rates drip rates ranged from 1 28 to 5 25 ml min with a mean value of 2 51 ml min at drip site hs4 and 0 75 2 25 ml min at site hs6 with a mean value of 1 28 ml min fig 3b and e table 1 the seasonal variation in drip rates was more sensitive to seasonal rainfall than daily rain events with higher drip rates in summer and slower drip rates in winter generally 2 ml min for hs4 1 ml min for hs6 fig 3b and e blue horizontal dash lines compared with the drip rate of hs6 hs4 had a shorter lag time and was more sensitive in its response to seasonal rainfall variations fig 3b and e this difference arising due to differences in the hydrologic network feeding these drips on annual timescales the annual mean value of each drip rate varied from 1 83 to 3 40 ml min for hs4 and from 0 95 to 1 72 ml min for hs6 both were consistent with annual precipitation with faster drip rates in wetter years and slower drip rates in dryer years table 1 3 3 fluorescence the emission spectra at an excitation wavelength 320 nm shows three distinct peaks fig 2a after subtracting the intensity of blank water only a single peak remained with a fluorescence wavelength maxima varying between 399 nm and 410 5 nm and with a mean value of 405 3 nm for hs4 and varying between 397 5 nm and 414 5 nm with a mean value was 405 1 nm for hs6 fig 3c and f the fluorophore within this spectral range corresponds to humic like materials that have been identified in surface water baker et al 2008 and karst cave water hartland et al 2010 supporting the use of fluorescence as an analogue for dom in this study the fluorescence wavelength maxima time series of two dripwaters had no perceptible intra annual or inter annual variations fig 3c and f which would be expected if significant compositional changes in dom had occurred over the study period tipping and woof 1991 the fluorescence intensity of hs4 varied between 151 7 and 428 4 a u with a mean value of 229 6 a u fig 3d and table 1 and the fluorescence intensity for hs6 varied between 155 0 and 733 3 a u with a mean value of 253 9 a u fig 3 g and table 1 fluorescence intensity time series of the two dripwaters showed similar variations on seasonal timescales fluorescence intensity generally showed higher values in summer fig 3 cyan bars and lower values in winter 180 a u of hs4 210 a u for hs6 fig 3d and g blue horizontal dash lines although several significant peaks occurred in dry seasons outside of the cyan bars on inter annual timescales the annual mean fluorescence intensity varied between 174 2 and 313 8 a u for hs4 and between 217 7 and 316 8 a u for hs6 table 1 compared with the fluorescence intensity of hs6 hs4 had longer and frequent high values rather than transient single peaks fig 3d and g moreover the occurrence of high fluorescence values in hs4 dripwater seem to have generally occurred earlier than in hs6 dripwater to a first approximation the mean annual fluorescence intensity value of each dripwater appears to respond to the annual rainfall amount with a one year lag for example the low annual fluorescence intensity in 2007 corresponded to the low annual rainfall in 2006 and high annual fluorescence intensity in 2009 corresponded to the high annual rainfall in 2008 table 1 4 discussion 4 1 hydraulic response and dom transport delayed hydraulic responses and dom transport times after aquifer recharge events have been observed in karstic systems before and are generally attributed to the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the hydrologic decoupling of soil aquifer systems in delaying water and solute transport e g emblanch et al 1998 genty and deflandre 1998 batiot et al 2003 pronk et al 2009 charlier et al 2010 2012 tissier et al 2013 continuous monitoring provides the opportunity to quantify this lag time between rainfall drip discharge and dom breakthrough tissier et al 2013 riechelmann et al 2016 cross correlations with a 3 point running average over the monitoring period were computed the cross correlation between rainfall calculated as average daily precipitation and fluorescence intensity showed an optimal correlation coefficient r hs4 0 51 r hs6 0 40 p 0 01 with some 11 months of lag for hs4 and 13 months for hs6 and the rainfall drip rate cross correlation showed an optimal correlation coefficient r hs4 0 80 r hs6 0 58 p 0 01 with 0 months lag for hs4 and 3 months lag for hs6 fig 6 it is noteworthy that the rainfall fluorescence intensity cross correlation for hs6 also exhibits a significant correlation coefficient r hs6 0 39 p 0 01 with 0 months lag fig 6 considering that drip rate is more sensitive to rainfall than dom fluorescence we assert that the lag time of 13 months is more credible than 0 months for the fluorescence intensity of hs6 the disparate lag time for drip rate and fluorescence intensity can be reconciled by the different mechanisms driving the response of dom and drip rate to rainfall compared with fluorescence intensity variation the sensitive response of drip rates to rainfall can be explained by the change of head pressure affecting dripwaters in summer higher rainfall will increase the head pressure and then promote faster drip rates in winter low rainfall had a limited effect on head pressure so drip rates remained fairly constant being recharged by base flow from the overlying reservoir fig 3b and e in this case the seasonal lag in summer is expected to produce a negligible bias on inter annual timescales thus we could calculate the relationship between annual precipitation amount and annual mean drip rate without any lag fig 7 2 dr hs 4 0 0025 apa 0 16 r 2 0 80 n 9 p 0 01 3 dr hs 6 0 0010 apa 0 32 r 2 0 86 n 9 p 0 01 in eqs 2 and 3 dr and apa are initialisms of drip rate and annual precipitation amount respectively the slopes reflect the sensitivity of the two drip sites to local annual precipitation amount however we cannot interpret the significance of the intercepts which should correspond to the constant value of base flow recharged by the overlying reservoir fig 3b and e blue horizontal dash lines some case studies had deduced that drip rates in karstic caves respond to water excess rather than rainfall amount genty and deflandre 1998 riechelmann et al 2016 considering the annual mean evapotranspiration of yichang region was 734 mm from 1985 to 2005 zhang and li 2006 thus we also introduced the constant 734 and transfer the eqs 2 and 3 as follow 4 dr hs 4 0 0025 apa 734 2 00 r 2 0 80 n 9 p 0 01 5 dr hs 6 0 0010 apa 734 1 06 r 2 0 86 n 9 p 0 01 in eqs 4 and 5 the values between parentheses give the local annual effective rainfall amount as expected the values of the intercepts in these equations were close to the constant value of the base flow of two dripwaters respectively the results suggest that the drip rates were dominated by local effective rainfall amount which could modulate head pressure overlying the two drip sites on inter annual timescales in terms of fluorescence intensity the 1 year lag can be comprehended as the product of two sets of processes 1 soil humification process lofts et al 2001 michalzik et al 2003 blyth et al 2008 and 2 aquifer processes emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 pronk et al 2009 charlier et al 2010 2012 tissier et al 2013 previous studies have suggested that the decomposition rate of soil organic matter som varies considerably and that som can be divided into different pools with contrasting decay times which can be broadly seen to range between an old fraction that decays slowly 102 103 year and a young fraction that decays very quickly 1 year the 14c evidence from hs4 stalagmite fed by hs4 dripwater showed that the organic matter in hs4 is long lived noronha et al 2015 so we can disregard the possible role of young organic matter furthermore the geochemical evidence from the hs4 drip site especially the invariant calcium isotope ratio δ44 42ca value points to a long 1 year groundwater residence time owen et al 2016 weighing the contribution of the two processes the lag is most sensibly ascribed to an efficient transport process from soil to drip point the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the karst process on delaying water and solute transport instead of a rapid soil humification process considering of the effect of sampling frequency a 3 point running average was used in the evaluation of lag time of fluorescence intensity the average lag time of the two drip sites 1 year was used to define the lag time between the climate signal and the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters fig 8 notably several significant peaks remained outside the cyan bars after eliminating a one year lag we inferred that these peaks were related to the seasonal rainfall distribution which varies somewhat from year to year on inter annual timescales the robust linear relationship between annual precipitation amount and annual mean fluorescence intensity with a one year lag is statistically stronger than the relationship without any lag fig 9 6 fi hs 4 0 207 apa 734 177 5 r 2 0 86 n 9 p 0 01 7 fi hs 6 0 176 apa 734 209 5 r 2 0 77 n 9 p 0 01 where fi is the initialisms of fluorescence intensity similar to eqs 4 and 5 only considering apa and annual mean evapotranspiration as a whole the significance of intercepts in eqs 6 and 7 can be interpreted as the dom concentration of base flow from the overlying reservoir eqs 6 and 7 suggested that the annual mean fluorescence intensity was actually governed by local effective annual rainfall amount on inter annual timescales although only separated by some 4 meters in the cave the two drip points diverged significantly in their hydrologic characteristics compared with hs4 the drip rate of hs6 was slower and more hysteretic to rainfall we inferred that one larger reservoir recharged the hs6 drip site one with a higher capability to buffer the infiltrating water thus the lower sensitivity of hs6 to rainfall smaller slope was readily understood in this case longer residence times would cause the peak of hs6 drip rate and fluorescence intensity to occur later than for hs4 4 2 rainfall rainfall air temperature and ph of rainwater are three important factors capable of affecting the seasonal input of soil dom to the karst aquifer and the subsequent dom concentration in dripwater in our study site the seasonal variations of dom with high values in summer and constant low values in winter is consistent with the seasonal nature of rainfall air temperature and rainfall ph however the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and precipitation fig 8 as opposed to the sharp seasonal rhythms of air temperature fig 3i and increasing seasonal ph value of rainfall fig 5 suggests that summer rainfall is the more prominent factor controlling the flushing of som in the asian monsoon region ban et al 2008 in the winter the low ph of rainwater low air temperature and precipitation amounts are conducive to the retention and preservation of organic matter in karst kalbitz et al 2000 evans et al 2005 conant et al 2011 ekström et al 2011 the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters during the winter season therefore mainly reflects the characteristics of the base flow component from the overlying reservoir fig 3d and g blue horizontal dash lines when the coming spring approaches som decomposition and depolymerization are likely enhanced as temperatures rise kalbitz et al 2000 conant et al 2011 and with the approach of the monsoon in may generally soil dom is mobilized and transported by strong rainfall ban et al 2008 when soil leachate enters the unsaturated zone of the karst aquifer mineralization and degradation of dom during the transfer process affects the dom concentration compared with baseflow in winter generally the infiltrating water in summer has a shorter time to mineralize and degrade and promote higher dom in dripwaters in summer thurman 1985 emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2014 the annual effective precipitation amount can affect the concentration of dom in dripwaters through three different processes on inter annual timescales 1 more humid soil environments are favorable to the humification rate of som in the study site christ and david 1996 tipping et al 1999 mcgarry and baker 2000 which acts to increase the production of transportable dom in the soil 2 the greater annual precipitation amount tends to occur with more strong rainfall events contributing to the flushing and transportation of soil dom toth 1998 baker and genty 1999 van beynen et al 2000 2002 tissier et al 2013 3 the greater annual precipitation amount will increase the head pressure and decrease the residence time of infiltrating water lessening the influence of mineralization and degradation on dom which will thereby promote higher annual dom concentration in summer discharges thurman 1985 emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2014 these three processes likely act in unison to magnify the precipitation signal imprinted in the fluorescence intensity of dripwater in heshang cave 4 3 air temperature air temperature can control the humification rate and mineralization of organic matter in soil and solution oades 1988 davidson and janssens 2006 schipper et al 2014 cruz et al 2005 investigated the relationship between the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters from santana cave located in southeastern brazil and local climate in two hydrological years and found that the annual mean value of fluorescence intensity was sensitive to an increase of 5 5 c in mean winter temperature in the previous year however the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters in heshang cave appeared to be insensitive to local air temperature on either intra annual or inter annual timescales figs 3 and 10 we calculate the inter seasonal and inter annual air temperature variation during 2004 2014 which the heshang cave region experienced to be much smaller than that observed in brazil by cruz et al 2005 over the nine years during which monitoring was conducted air temperatures in summer ranged between 25 3 to 28 4 c δ 3 1 c and 5 8 to 8 7 c δ 3 2 c during the winter the annual average air temperatures ranged between 16 4 and 18 4 c a variation of 2 0 c relative to 5 5 c observed at santana cave the large variation in rainfall in the locality of heshang cave between 763 mm yr and 1354 mm yr from 2005 to 2013 is therefore likely to obscure the intrinsic air temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition schipper et al 2014 causing a lower observed apparent air temperature sensitivity as inferred from the fluorescence intensity measurements davidson and janssens 2006 4 4 ph of rainfall a little bias may exist in using rainfall ph of yichang acid rain station to represent the ph of rainfall in the vicinity of heshang cave in our analysis we focused on the linear ph regression over the eleven year rainfall dataset from 2005 to 2015 fig 5 which provides as a measure of the average change in rain ph over the study period laboratory experiments and field investigations have substantiated that ph varies positively with the quantity and quality of dom in soil water evans et al 2005 clark et al 2010 ekström et al 2011 qiu et al 2015 the monthly and annual volume weighted ph value of rainwater in this study showed a significant ascending trend ranging from 3 49 to 5 85 and from 4 19 to 5 13 respectively around the cave during 2005 to 2015 figs 5 and 11 if soil dom showed a response to these ph variations it is reasonable to expect that the fluorescence intensity time series should also show a similar ascending trend corresponding to a dom increase in response to the ph recovery monteith et al 2007 however the monitoring results showed that fluorescence intensity followed a descending trend on monthly and annual timescales figs 3 and 11 although not statistically significant consistent with the variation of precipitation amount figs 3 and 11 and contrary to the ph trend figs 5 and 11 this suggests that the aquifer dom concentration was insensitive to acid rain at heshang cave the quality of dom can be reflected by the variation of the fluorescence wavelength maxima which is also susceptible to the variation of ph increasing ph can raise the solubility of the hydrophobic acids leading to a soil water more dominated by hydrophobic compounds characterized by high aromaticity molecular weight and longer peak fluorescence wavelength and vice versa david et al 1989 ekström et al 2011 however no trends were observed in the variation in fluorescence wavelength maxima fig 3c and f suggesting that the quality of dom was also indifferent to variations in the ph of rainwater this phenomenon has been viewed in laboratory leaching experiments qiu et al 2015 conducted a laboratory leaching column experiment with an intact acid forest soil column from southern china and found that soil and soil solution chemistry including dom al and fe are not affected by an influent solution with a ph 4 5 furthermore evans et al 2012 found that further ph increases towards alkaline values generated only a slight additional increases in doc concentration at the migneint podzol site with a soil pretreatment ph of 4 4 the similar results from laboratory leaching experiments and our monitoring data indicate that current acid rain ph 5 6 to 4 5 will have a limited effect on the dissolution of dom in karst soil pore waters although some reasons for this lack of sensitivity have been proposed evans et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 we infer that it was likely to be linked to the buffering capacity of karst soil in the heshang region consisting of carbonate debris noronha et al 2015 yun et al 2016 which can buffer the ph values of rainwater rapidly on contact with infiltration bowman et al 2008 5 conclusions a monthly resolution nine year monitoring study of duplicate fluorescence intensity measurements of two dripwaters in heshang cave southern china provides insights into the hydrological characteristics and the drivers of dom mobilization on different timescales and allows us to reach the following conclusions 1 the cross correlation analysis is an efficient method to investigate the lag time between different variables of dripwaters and external environmental variables in heshang cave discharge of drip sites can respond to rainfall quickly with relatively short lag times due to the modulation of head pressure on intra annual and inter annual timescales compared with drip rates the fluorescence intensity in dripwaters displayed longer lag times 1 year from soil to drip sites reflecting the physical transport of dom through the aquifer system in addition compared with some traditional geochemical tracers dom can be an efficient tracer to investigate the transfer pathway of dom and evaluate the ability to trace residence time in the unsaturated zone of the karst aquifer 2 after eliminating the one year lag in our data the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and rainfall suggested that in heshang cave seasonal dom variations were mainly a response to seasonal precipitation distribution which can determine the output of dom from the soil layer and the mineralization and degradation of dom during transport this result is comparable to monitoring results in other regions on inter annual timescales a robust linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and annual effective precipitation amount implies that precipitation is the most important determinant for dom concentration in karst aquifers through three processes 1 humification rate of som 2 flushing and transport following strong rainfall 3 mineralization and degradation of dom within transfer processes 3 combined with previous results from laboratory leaching experiments the insensitivity of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence wavelength maxima of unsaturated zone flow to the local ph of acid rain on intra annual and inter annual time scales implies that current acid rain ph 5 6 to 4 5 has a limited effect on the dissolution of dom in karst soil and soil solution 4 the results presented permit an improved understanding of the influence of climate and acid rain on dom mobilization into karst aquifers on intra inter annual scales however heshang cave is only a case study it would be necessary in future studies to assess whether and how geographic differences between karstic systems

7568,acid rain has the potential to significantly impact the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter dom leached from soil to groundwater yet to date the effects of acid rain have not been investigated in karstic systems which are expected to strongly buffer the ph of atmospheric rainfall this study presents a nine year dom fluorescence dataset from a karst unsaturated zone collected from two drip sites hs4 hs6 in heshang cave southern china between 2005 and 2014 cross correlograms show that fluorescence intensity of both dripwaters lagged behind rainfall by 1 year 11 months lag for hs4 and 13 months for hs6 whereas drip rates responded quite quickly to rainfall 0 months lag for hs4 and 3 months for hs6 based on optimal correlation coefficients the rapid response of drip rates to rainfall is related to the change of reservoir head pressure in summer associated with higher rainfall in winter low rainfall has a limited effect on head pressure and drip rates gradually slow to a constant value associated with base flow from the overlying reservoir this effect being most evident on inter annual timescales r2 0 80 for hs4 and r2 0 86 for hs6 n 9 p 0 01 we ascribed the 1 year lag of fluorescence intensity to the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the karst process on delaying water and solute transport after eliminating the one year lag the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and rainfall observed suggests that the seasonality of fluorescence intensity was mainly controlled by the monsoonal rains which can govern the output of dom from the soil as well as the residence time of water in the unsaturated zone on inter annual timescales a robust linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and annual effective precipitation amount r2 0 86 for hs4 and r2 0 77 for hs6 n 9 p 0 01 was identified implying that annual effective precipitation is the main determinant of dom concentration in the aquifer conversely the insensitivity of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence wavelength maxima to variations in the ph of local rainfall suggests that acid rain over the study period ph 5 6 to 4 5 had no discernable effect on the quantity and quality of dom in karst soil and soil solution likely being strongly buffered by soil carbonates therefore despite large increases in anthropogenic acid rain in recent chinese history hydrologic forcing is the predominant factor driving variations in dom in karst aquifers keywords karst groundwater unsaturated zone dissolved organic matter fluorescence climate change acid rain 1 introduction groundwater is a major water resource for human societies and is of increasing importance because of overuse and serious contamination of surface fresh water in some countries shen et al 2015 mccormack et al 2016 this situation is much worse in the karst aquifers of southern china which are characterized by a high vulnerability to contamination ford and williams 2007 jiang et al 2009 protecting the quality of karst groundwater is therefore a key challenge for this region natural organic matter nom in groundwater mainly derives from the soil zone and is a potential contaminant in groundwater because of the ability of nom to transport contaminants ritson et al 2014 schiperski et al 2015 graham et al 2015 hartmann et al 2016 nom can also transform into carcinogenic disinfection by products during ozonation and chlorination in drinking water treatment processes and this becomes relevant when considering groundwater for use as a potable water resource papageorgiou et al 2016 moreover the composition of nom also influences groundwater quality nom can be operationally divided into particle organic matter pom around 0 45 μm and dissolved organic matter dom around 0 45 μm based on typical filtration protocols e g hartland et al 2011 andrade eiroa et al 2013 dom can be further classified into colloidal diameter defined between 1 nm and 1 μm generally e g lead and wilkinson 2006 hartland et al 2012 hydrophobic characterized by high aromaticity and molecular weight e g containing a higher proportion of phenolic groups and hydrophilic fractions characterized by low aromaticity and molecular weight e g containing more carboxylic groups thurman 1985 senesi et al 1991 tipping and woof 1991 ekström et al 2011 due to the specific surface chemistry and high stability of dom it can directly facilitate the solubility and transport of contaminants such as toxic metals between surface environments and aquifers ultimately deteriorating groundwater quality hartland et al 2012 2014 2015 yang et al 2012 rutlidge et al 2014 klučáková and kalina 2015 it is well understood that dom accounts for a large fraction of nom in groundwater up to 90 and can be considered synonymous with nom e g thurman 1985 andrade eiroa et al 2013 acid rain ph 5 6 has been proposed to strongly influence the quantity and quality of dom in soil solution through changes in the ionization of constituent organic molecules evans et al 2005 sanclements et al 2012 widespread studies of dom increases in natural waters from across europe and north america have been reported over the last two decades these have been largely ascribed to the long term rebound in rainwater ph which has been recorded across many of these areas and which is the result of reductions in the emission of sulfur and nitrogen oxides de wit et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 clark et al 2010 sanclements et al 2012 these widely observed increases in dom in surface waters are also supported by data from laboratory experiments substantiating the positive relationship between dom solubility and the ph of soil or soil solution through two processes 1 increased solubility of al and fe ions which strongly complex with dom bohan et al 1997 lofts et al 2001 qiu et al 2015 and 2 the addition of acidity which can reduce the solubility of organic matter by increases in intermolecular and intramolecular bonding tipping and woof 1991 lumsdon et al 2005 in conjunction with large changes in dom concentration induced by acidification changes in dom quality are expected hydrophobic dom requires a greater net charge to become soluble relative to hydrophilic dom thurman 1985 senesi et al 1991 tipping and woof 1991 ekström et al 2011 decreasing ph therefore lowers the solubility of phenol rich hydrophobic acids leading to soil water dominated by hydrophilic compounds david et al 1989 ekström et al 2011 the current debate around the effects of acidification on dom implicitly assumes that ph increases have the opposite effect the effect of acid rain on dom in different terrains remains controversial due to the heterogeneities in pedology and hydrology kennedy et al 1996 bohan et al 1997 evans et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 and the intervention of climate factors e g air temperature precipitation evans et al 2005 clark et al 2010 ritson et al 2014 for example many temperate soils rich in clay minerals and organic matter have substantial acid neutralising capacities likens et al 1996 schlesinger and bernhardt 2013 which show relatively little ph change when they exposed to acid rain whereas strongly acid soils from the humid tropics have little capacity to buffer additional acidity and therefore may respond more quickly to acid deposition in karstic systems overlying soils generally contain broken up carbonate bedrock fairchild and baker 2012 and should have considerable capacity to buffer the acidity of the soil solution previous cave studies of dom have mainly focused on the relationship between the variation of dom and climate changes on seasonal timescales dom concentration in karst dripwaters have been thought to be driven by the flushing of soil dom which is dependent on production of mobile soil dom and rainfall exceeding field capacity e g toth 1998 baker and genty 1999 van beynen et al 2000 2002 ban et al 2008 tissier et al 2013 on inter annual timescales cruz et al 2005 identified that increased dom concentration and fluorescence intensity in cave dripwaters could be related to increased air temperature in the prior winter which potentially promoted greater humification in the soil zone and an increased supply of dom in the following wet season furthermore ban et al 2008 have shown that the structure of the dom peak in dripwaters from shihua cave northern china varies from year to year influenced by the intensity and frequency of rainfall however the effect of acid rain as a driver of dom dynamics in karst systems remains largely untested when soil dom is mobilized into the karst aquifer the transport process in the unsaturated zone consisting of soil epikarst and transmission zone ford and williams 2007 pronk et al 2009 also exerts an influence on the concentration of dom many studies of dom discharge from karst springs have shown higher dom concentration in the wet season and lower concentration in the dry season the lower dry season concentration potentially being caused by increased mineralization and degradation of dom during transit emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2014 dom was therefore often considered a useful tracer relative to certain traditional geochemical tracers to characterize the hydrological process infiltration residence time emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 most of the previous studies on this topic focused on the soil epikarst where infiltrating water was sensitive to the infiltration event e g pronk et al 2009 mudarra and andreo 2011 tissier et al 2013 mudarra et al 2014 however studies focusing on the transfer of dom in the unsaturated zone transmission zone are clearly needed to better understand dom dynamics within the entire karst system southern china following europe and north america became the third region to suffer from acid rain in the beginning of the 1990s fig 1 a larssen et al 1999 tang et al 2010 at the same time the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river have exhibited frequent episodes of droughts and floods over the past ten years this sensitive region which is now exposed to climate change and acid rain offers an opportunity to evaluate the effect of acid rain as well as climate change on the variation of dom in karst groundwater heshang cave 30 27 n 110 25 e 294 m altitude fig 1a is situated in the middle reaches of the yangtze river southern china hu et al 2008 previous studies have confirmed that perennial dripwaters in heshang cave are fed by the large overlying aquifer reservoir duan et al 2016 owen et al 2016 heshang cave is therefore eligible as a sentinel of changes in local karst groundwater quality in this study samples of groundwater collected from two drip sites in heshang cave between 2005 and 2014 were analyzed using fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize both the quantity and quality of dom baker et al 2007 fellman et al 2010 bridgeman et al 2011 stedmon et al 2011 ritson et al 2014 the long term dom record from heshang cave also can offer an opportunity to investigate the dom transfer process and evaluate the residence time of dom in the unsaturated zone of the karst aquifer 2 method 2 1 study site the east asian monsoon dominates the climate of the study region with a warm and moist summer but a relatively cold and dry winter fig 1a annual rainfall recorded at yichang about 90 km away from the study site is 1162 234 mm 1s n 59 from 1950 to 2008 fig 1b approximately 70 of the annual rainfall occurs between may and september and the annual mean evapotranspiration of the yichang region from 1985 to 2005 was 734 mm zhang and li 2006 heshang cave extends sub horizontally from its mouth on the bank of the qingjiang river for a distance of 250 m the cave is developed on the hinge zone of a large ns anticline within cambrian dolomite fig 1c hu et al 2008 the dolomite host rock is permeable due to fracturing and karstification and thus forms a carbonate aquifer the cave is currently located in the unsaturated zone of the aquifer and the entrance of the cave is about 30 m above the present day level of the qingjiang river fig 1c the thickness of the unsaturated zone above the cave is highly variable from about 50 300 m due to a steep terrain hu et al 2008 the dolomite rock is covered by a discontinuous and thin 30 cm soil layer derived from wind blown carbonate bedrock and silicate dust human activity was rare due to the precipitous path leading to the cave rainwater infiltrates through fissures and fractures within the unsaturated zone to drip through the cave roof the cave is wet throughout the year with active drips standing pools of water and some flowing water close to the back of the cave during flood events hu et al 2008 long et al 2015 drip sites hs4 hs6 are located 150 m further into the cave and the distance between the two sites is about 4 m fig 1c two coeval columnar stalagmites fed by two drip points hu et al 2008 suggests that more than one steady reservoir exists above cave roof to recharge the two drip sites the drip rates of two sites can be considered to be fed by fissure flow according to the classification of smart and friedrich 1987 the lack of a geochemical response at two drippoints to the transition from drought to wet conditions e g δ44 42ca δ18o suggests that the perennial dripwaters are well mixed and hence geochemical signals become attenuated between event water and water stored in overlying aquifer reservoirs consistent with 1 year of residence time duan et al 2016 owen et al 2016 2 2 data and water sample collection precipitation and air temperature outside the cave since 2003 were measured automatically every 2 h using a hobo data logging rain gauge rg3 m and hobo pro v2 logger u23 001 both installed at a 1 5 meter high wood shelf on a flat roof of a dwelling in the local village which is 2 km away from heshang cave at a similar elevation the logger records are identical to those of the meteorological station at changyang 30 28 n 111 11 e 144 2 m fig 1b on both seasonal and shorter timescales hu et al 2008 the dataset of daily rainwater ph was collected from four acid rain monitoring stations including yichang zigui jianshi and wufeng around the study site fig 1b the basic coordinates and distances to heshang cave are summarized in table s1 the span of the dataset was from 2005 to 2015 data quality was examined by the conductivity of precipitation k ph inequality method proposed by tang et al 2008 analysis of ph values greater than 9 0 or less than 2 0 was not considered reliable and was discarded the monthly and annual january to december ph of rainwater was calculated by volume weighted mean method of concentration of h and rainfall amount water samples from two drip sites were collected at 30 40 day intervals between 2005 and 2014 the samples were collected in 50 ml sealed glass bottles and refrigerated immediately upon return from the field li et al 2014 drip rates were recorded by manual counting for two minute timespans during each sampling trip and then converted to ml min by assuming a constant volume of 0 15 ml per drip baker and barnes 1998 the annual mean drip rate is calculated as the arithmetic mean unless otherwise stated also the other parameters discussed herein monthly cumulative rainwater samples were collected in a 5 l hdpe bottle with a funnel which is placed at the wood shelf on the flat roof between 2011 and 2015 the external body of hdpe bottle was covered with foil paper and the bottom of the hdpe bottle was coated with 0 5 cm thick mineral oil to prevent evaporation prior to use for next month the bottle was cleaned and dried the sub samples of the homogenized precipitation were collected into pre cleaned 8 ml glass sealed bottles for measurement of sulfate concentration 2 3 sample analysis analysis of dom was completed on 0 22 μm filtered dripwater samples using a ls 55 perkin elmer luminescence spectrophotometer at china university of geosciences wuhan china fluorescence emission spectra at an optimal excitation wavelength of 320 nm were recorded across wavelengths scanning from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm steps with slits set to 5 nm for excitation and 20 nm for emission analyses were performed at room temperature and blank water deionized water scans were run every 10 15 analyses the fluorescence intensity for each sample was corrected against the intensity of blank water to eliminate the rayleigh and tyndall scatter and partly the raman scatter fig 2 the reproducibility of the emission spectrum of blank water was relatively high for which the emission intensity at 360 nm averaged out at 210 10 1s n 12 arbitrary units a u during the measurement sulfate concentration in rainwater was analysed using a dionex ics 900 system equipped with chromeleon 7 0 software at changsha uranium geology research institute the ion chromatograph was calibrated using an external standard sulfate solution gsb 07 1268 2000 to ensure accuracy and stability with a detection limit of 0 1 mg l sulfur emissions can be directly linked to the higher acidity of rainfall in this region therefore the ph of rainwater could be calculated by the sulfate concentration in rainwater due to a natural background s value exists in rainwater we assume that the minimum sulfate concentration in rainwater was as the natural background s value which exists in all local rainwaters and the ph of natural rainwater with minimum sulfate concentration is defined as 5 6 in addition we also need to assume that sulfuric acid could ionize completely that is one mole of s concentration can contribute 2 mol of h thus the equation was as follows 1 ph r log 10 2 c r c min m 10 5 6 where c r is the sulfate concentration in rainwater c min is the minimum sulfate concentration in rainwater from 2011 to 2015 m is mass number of sulfate ph r is the predicted ph of rainwater 3 results 3 1 climate variation the daily precipitation amount between january 2004 and february 2014 ranged from 0 to 98 mm and the seasonal rhythm of precipitation was characterized by higher rainfall in summer june august and lower rainfall in winter december february fig 3 a and cyan bars as the east asian monsoon varies in strength from year to year the annual precipitation amount varied distinctly and ranged from 763 mm to 1354 mm averaging 984 mm during the monitoring period table 1 mean monthly air temperature between january 2004 and february 2014 ranged from 2 9 to 29 6 c with the lowest air temperatures recorded in january february and the highest in july august fig 3i annual mean air temperature varied from 16 4 to 18 4 c with an average of 17 4 c table 1 the ph dataset of daily rainwater from four acid rain monitoring stations around heshang cave all presented increasing trends during 2005 2015 fig s1 the monthly volume weighted ph series from four stations each exhibited statistically significant increasing trends table s1 the monthly ph value from four stations ranged from 3 49 to 6 17 with higher ph values in summer and lower ph values in winter generally reflecting the relative intensity of the sulfate emission locally with lower rainwater sulfate concentration in summer and higher sulfate concentration in winter fig 4 the annual volume weighted ph value of rainwater from all stations ranged from 4 18 to 5 22 and showed increasing trends across the study period table s1 and fig s1 the sulfate concentration in monthly cumulative rainwater varied across a wide range from 1 89 to 30 1 mg l during the period 2011 2015 with a higher content in winter and lower content in summer fig 4 according to the eq 1 the predicted ph of local rainwater ranged from 3 53 to 5 60 with higher values in summer and lower values in winter fig 4 the annual volume weighted predicted ph value ranged from 4 17 to 4 57 with a statistically significant increasing trend fig 5 in spite of the bias between predicted ph value of rainwater in the study site and monitoring ph values of rainwater in yichang station the temporal variation of predicted ph in local rainwater is concordant with the temporal ph distribution of yichang station which suggested that deposition of acids of two places were synchronous fig 5 as for the bias it may be related to the incomplete ionization of sulfuric acid considering that the ph of rainwater in the study site was mainly responsive to the ph record of yichang station the ph dataset of yichang acid rain station is therefore adopted in the following discussion 3 2 dripwater discharge rates drip rates ranged from 1 28 to 5 25 ml min with a mean value of 2 51 ml min at drip site hs4 and 0 75 2 25 ml min at site hs6 with a mean value of 1 28 ml min fig 3b and e table 1 the seasonal variation in drip rates was more sensitive to seasonal rainfall than daily rain events with higher drip rates in summer and slower drip rates in winter generally 2 ml min for hs4 1 ml min for hs6 fig 3b and e blue horizontal dash lines compared with the drip rate of hs6 hs4 had a shorter lag time and was more sensitive in its response to seasonal rainfall variations fig 3b and e this difference arising due to differences in the hydrologic network feeding these drips on annual timescales the annual mean value of each drip rate varied from 1 83 to 3 40 ml min for hs4 and from 0 95 to 1 72 ml min for hs6 both were consistent with annual precipitation with faster drip rates in wetter years and slower drip rates in dryer years table 1 3 3 fluorescence the emission spectra at an excitation wavelength 320 nm shows three distinct peaks fig 2a after subtracting the intensity of blank water only a single peak remained with a fluorescence wavelength maxima varying between 399 nm and 410 5 nm and with a mean value of 405 3 nm for hs4 and varying between 397 5 nm and 414 5 nm with a mean value was 405 1 nm for hs6 fig 3c and f the fluorophore within this spectral range corresponds to humic like materials that have been identified in surface water baker et al 2008 and karst cave water hartland et al 2010 supporting the use of fluorescence as an analogue for dom in this study the fluorescence wavelength maxima time series of two dripwaters had no perceptible intra annual or inter annual variations fig 3c and f which would be expected if significant compositional changes in dom had occurred over the study period tipping and woof 1991 the fluorescence intensity of hs4 varied between 151 7 and 428 4 a u with a mean value of 229 6 a u fig 3d and table 1 and the fluorescence intensity for hs6 varied between 155 0 and 733 3 a u with a mean value of 253 9 a u fig 3 g and table 1 fluorescence intensity time series of the two dripwaters showed similar variations on seasonal timescales fluorescence intensity generally showed higher values in summer fig 3 cyan bars and lower values in winter 180 a u of hs4 210 a u for hs6 fig 3d and g blue horizontal dash lines although several significant peaks occurred in dry seasons outside of the cyan bars on inter annual timescales the annual mean fluorescence intensity varied between 174 2 and 313 8 a u for hs4 and between 217 7 and 316 8 a u for hs6 table 1 compared with the fluorescence intensity of hs6 hs4 had longer and frequent high values rather than transient single peaks fig 3d and g moreover the occurrence of high fluorescence values in hs4 dripwater seem to have generally occurred earlier than in hs6 dripwater to a first approximation the mean annual fluorescence intensity value of each dripwater appears to respond to the annual rainfall amount with a one year lag for example the low annual fluorescence intensity in 2007 corresponded to the low annual rainfall in 2006 and high annual fluorescence intensity in 2009 corresponded to the high annual rainfall in 2008 table 1 4 discussion 4 1 hydraulic response and dom transport delayed hydraulic responses and dom transport times after aquifer recharge events have been observed in karstic systems before and are generally attributed to the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the hydrologic decoupling of soil aquifer systems in delaying water and solute transport e g emblanch et al 1998 genty and deflandre 1998 batiot et al 2003 pronk et al 2009 charlier et al 2010 2012 tissier et al 2013 continuous monitoring provides the opportunity to quantify this lag time between rainfall drip discharge and dom breakthrough tissier et al 2013 riechelmann et al 2016 cross correlations with a 3 point running average over the monitoring period were computed the cross correlation between rainfall calculated as average daily precipitation and fluorescence intensity showed an optimal correlation coefficient r hs4 0 51 r hs6 0 40 p 0 01 with some 11 months of lag for hs4 and 13 months for hs6 and the rainfall drip rate cross correlation showed an optimal correlation coefficient r hs4 0 80 r hs6 0 58 p 0 01 with 0 months lag for hs4 and 3 months lag for hs6 fig 6 it is noteworthy that the rainfall fluorescence intensity cross correlation for hs6 also exhibits a significant correlation coefficient r hs6 0 39 p 0 01 with 0 months lag fig 6 considering that drip rate is more sensitive to rainfall than dom fluorescence we assert that the lag time of 13 months is more credible than 0 months for the fluorescence intensity of hs6 the disparate lag time for drip rate and fluorescence intensity can be reconciled by the different mechanisms driving the response of dom and drip rate to rainfall compared with fluorescence intensity variation the sensitive response of drip rates to rainfall can be explained by the change of head pressure affecting dripwaters in summer higher rainfall will increase the head pressure and then promote faster drip rates in winter low rainfall had a limited effect on head pressure so drip rates remained fairly constant being recharged by base flow from the overlying reservoir fig 3b and e in this case the seasonal lag in summer is expected to produce a negligible bias on inter annual timescales thus we could calculate the relationship between annual precipitation amount and annual mean drip rate without any lag fig 7 2 dr hs 4 0 0025 apa 0 16 r 2 0 80 n 9 p 0 01 3 dr hs 6 0 0010 apa 0 32 r 2 0 86 n 9 p 0 01 in eqs 2 and 3 dr and apa are initialisms of drip rate and annual precipitation amount respectively the slopes reflect the sensitivity of the two drip sites to local annual precipitation amount however we cannot interpret the significance of the intercepts which should correspond to the constant value of base flow recharged by the overlying reservoir fig 3b and e blue horizontal dash lines some case studies had deduced that drip rates in karstic caves respond to water excess rather than rainfall amount genty and deflandre 1998 riechelmann et al 2016 considering the annual mean evapotranspiration of yichang region was 734 mm from 1985 to 2005 zhang and li 2006 thus we also introduced the constant 734 and transfer the eqs 2 and 3 as follow 4 dr hs 4 0 0025 apa 734 2 00 r 2 0 80 n 9 p 0 01 5 dr hs 6 0 0010 apa 734 1 06 r 2 0 86 n 9 p 0 01 in eqs 4 and 5 the values between parentheses give the local annual effective rainfall amount as expected the values of the intercepts in these equations were close to the constant value of the base flow of two dripwaters respectively the results suggest that the drip rates were dominated by local effective rainfall amount which could modulate head pressure overlying the two drip sites on inter annual timescales in terms of fluorescence intensity the 1 year lag can be comprehended as the product of two sets of processes 1 soil humification process lofts et al 2001 michalzik et al 2003 blyth et al 2008 and 2 aquifer processes emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 pronk et al 2009 charlier et al 2010 2012 tissier et al 2013 previous studies have suggested that the decomposition rate of soil organic matter som varies considerably and that som can be divided into different pools with contrasting decay times which can be broadly seen to range between an old fraction that decays slowly 102 103 year and a young fraction that decays very quickly 1 year the 14c evidence from hs4 stalagmite fed by hs4 dripwater showed that the organic matter in hs4 is long lived noronha et al 2015 so we can disregard the possible role of young organic matter furthermore the geochemical evidence from the hs4 drip site especially the invariant calcium isotope ratio δ44 42ca value points to a long 1 year groundwater residence time owen et al 2016 weighing the contribution of the two processes the lag is most sensibly ascribed to an efficient transport process from soil to drip point the effect of the soil moisture deficit and the karst process on delaying water and solute transport instead of a rapid soil humification process considering of the effect of sampling frequency a 3 point running average was used in the evaluation of lag time of fluorescence intensity the average lag time of the two drip sites 1 year was used to define the lag time between the climate signal and the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters fig 8 notably several significant peaks remained outside the cyan bars after eliminating a one year lag we inferred that these peaks were related to the seasonal rainfall distribution which varies somewhat from year to year on inter annual timescales the robust linear relationship between annual precipitation amount and annual mean fluorescence intensity with a one year lag is statistically stronger than the relationship without any lag fig 9 6 fi hs 4 0 207 apa 734 177 5 r 2 0 86 n 9 p 0 01 7 fi hs 6 0 176 apa 734 209 5 r 2 0 77 n 9 p 0 01 where fi is the initialisms of fluorescence intensity similar to eqs 4 and 5 only considering apa and annual mean evapotranspiration as a whole the significance of intercepts in eqs 6 and 7 can be interpreted as the dom concentration of base flow from the overlying reservoir eqs 6 and 7 suggested that the annual mean fluorescence intensity was actually governed by local effective annual rainfall amount on inter annual timescales although only separated by some 4 meters in the cave the two drip points diverged significantly in their hydrologic characteristics compared with hs4 the drip rate of hs6 was slower and more hysteretic to rainfall we inferred that one larger reservoir recharged the hs6 drip site one with a higher capability to buffer the infiltrating water thus the lower sensitivity of hs6 to rainfall smaller slope was readily understood in this case longer residence times would cause the peak of hs6 drip rate and fluorescence intensity to occur later than for hs4 4 2 rainfall rainfall air temperature and ph of rainwater are three important factors capable of affecting the seasonal input of soil dom to the karst aquifer and the subsequent dom concentration in dripwater in our study site the seasonal variations of dom with high values in summer and constant low values in winter is consistent with the seasonal nature of rainfall air temperature and rainfall ph however the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and precipitation fig 8 as opposed to the sharp seasonal rhythms of air temperature fig 3i and increasing seasonal ph value of rainfall fig 5 suggests that summer rainfall is the more prominent factor controlling the flushing of som in the asian monsoon region ban et al 2008 in the winter the low ph of rainwater low air temperature and precipitation amounts are conducive to the retention and preservation of organic matter in karst kalbitz et al 2000 evans et al 2005 conant et al 2011 ekström et al 2011 the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters during the winter season therefore mainly reflects the characteristics of the base flow component from the overlying reservoir fig 3d and g blue horizontal dash lines when the coming spring approaches som decomposition and depolymerization are likely enhanced as temperatures rise kalbitz et al 2000 conant et al 2011 and with the approach of the monsoon in may generally soil dom is mobilized and transported by strong rainfall ban et al 2008 when soil leachate enters the unsaturated zone of the karst aquifer mineralization and degradation of dom during the transfer process affects the dom concentration compared with baseflow in winter generally the infiltrating water in summer has a shorter time to mineralize and degrade and promote higher dom in dripwaters in summer thurman 1985 emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2014 the annual effective precipitation amount can affect the concentration of dom in dripwaters through three different processes on inter annual timescales 1 more humid soil environments are favorable to the humification rate of som in the study site christ and david 1996 tipping et al 1999 mcgarry and baker 2000 which acts to increase the production of transportable dom in the soil 2 the greater annual precipitation amount tends to occur with more strong rainfall events contributing to the flushing and transportation of soil dom toth 1998 baker and genty 1999 van beynen et al 2000 2002 tissier et al 2013 3 the greater annual precipitation amount will increase the head pressure and decrease the residence time of infiltrating water lessening the influence of mineralization and degradation on dom which will thereby promote higher annual dom concentration in summer discharges thurman 1985 emblanch et al 1998 batiot et al 2003 mudarra and andreo 2011 mudarra et al 2014 these three processes likely act in unison to magnify the precipitation signal imprinted in the fluorescence intensity of dripwater in heshang cave 4 3 air temperature air temperature can control the humification rate and mineralization of organic matter in soil and solution oades 1988 davidson and janssens 2006 schipper et al 2014 cruz et al 2005 investigated the relationship between the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters from santana cave located in southeastern brazil and local climate in two hydrological years and found that the annual mean value of fluorescence intensity was sensitive to an increase of 5 5 c in mean winter temperature in the previous year however the fluorescence intensity of dripwaters in heshang cave appeared to be insensitive to local air temperature on either intra annual or inter annual timescales figs 3 and 10 we calculate the inter seasonal and inter annual air temperature variation during 2004 2014 which the heshang cave region experienced to be much smaller than that observed in brazil by cruz et al 2005 over the nine years during which monitoring was conducted air temperatures in summer ranged between 25 3 to 28 4 c δ 3 1 c and 5 8 to 8 7 c δ 3 2 c during the winter the annual average air temperatures ranged between 16 4 and 18 4 c a variation of 2 0 c relative to 5 5 c observed at santana cave the large variation in rainfall in the locality of heshang cave between 763 mm yr and 1354 mm yr from 2005 to 2013 is therefore likely to obscure the intrinsic air temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition schipper et al 2014 causing a lower observed apparent air temperature sensitivity as inferred from the fluorescence intensity measurements davidson and janssens 2006 4 4 ph of rainfall a little bias may exist in using rainfall ph of yichang acid rain station to represent the ph of rainfall in the vicinity of heshang cave in our analysis we focused on the linear ph regression over the eleven year rainfall dataset from 2005 to 2015 fig 5 which provides as a measure of the average change in rain ph over the study period laboratory experiments and field investigations have substantiated that ph varies positively with the quantity and quality of dom in soil water evans et al 2005 clark et al 2010 ekström et al 2011 qiu et al 2015 the monthly and annual volume weighted ph value of rainwater in this study showed a significant ascending trend ranging from 3 49 to 5 85 and from 4 19 to 5 13 respectively around the cave during 2005 to 2015 figs 5 and 11 if soil dom showed a response to these ph variations it is reasonable to expect that the fluorescence intensity time series should also show a similar ascending trend corresponding to a dom increase in response to the ph recovery monteith et al 2007 however the monitoring results showed that fluorescence intensity followed a descending trend on monthly and annual timescales figs 3 and 11 although not statistically significant consistent with the variation of precipitation amount figs 3 and 11 and contrary to the ph trend figs 5 and 11 this suggests that the aquifer dom concentration was insensitive to acid rain at heshang cave the quality of dom can be reflected by the variation of the fluorescence wavelength maxima which is also susceptible to the variation of ph increasing ph can raise the solubility of the hydrophobic acids leading to a soil water more dominated by hydrophobic compounds characterized by high aromaticity molecular weight and longer peak fluorescence wavelength and vice versa david et al 1989 ekström et al 2011 however no trends were observed in the variation in fluorescence wavelength maxima fig 3c and f suggesting that the quality of dom was also indifferent to variations in the ph of rainwater this phenomenon has been viewed in laboratory leaching experiments qiu et al 2015 conducted a laboratory leaching column experiment with an intact acid forest soil column from southern china and found that soil and soil solution chemistry including dom al and fe are not affected by an influent solution with a ph 4 5 furthermore evans et al 2012 found that further ph increases towards alkaline values generated only a slight additional increases in doc concentration at the migneint podzol site with a soil pretreatment ph of 4 4 the similar results from laboratory leaching experiments and our monitoring data indicate that current acid rain ph 5 6 to 4 5 will have a limited effect on the dissolution of dom in karst soil pore waters although some reasons for this lack of sensitivity have been proposed evans et al 2012 qiu et al 2015 we infer that it was likely to be linked to the buffering capacity of karst soil in the heshang region consisting of carbonate debris noronha et al 2015 yun et al 2016 which can buffer the ph values of rainwater rapidly on contact with infiltration bowman et al 2008 5 conclusions a monthly resolution nine year monitoring study of duplicate fluorescence intensity measurements of two dripwaters in heshang cave southern china provides insights into the hydrological characteristics and the drivers of dom mobilization on different timescales and allows us to reach the following conclusions 1 the cross correlation analysis is an efficient method to investigate the lag time between different variables of dripwaters and external environmental variables in heshang cave discharge of drip sites can respond to rainfall quickly with relatively short lag times due to the modulation of head pressure on intra annual and inter annual timescales compared with drip rates the fluorescence intensity in dripwaters displayed longer lag times 1 year from soil to drip sites reflecting the physical transport of dom through the aquifer system in addition compared with some traditional geochemical tracers dom can be an efficient tracer to investigate the transfer pathway of dom and evaluate the ability to trace residence time in the unsaturated zone of the karst aquifer 2 after eliminating the one year lag in our data the congruent seasonal pacing and amplitude between fluorescence intensity and rainfall suggested that in heshang cave seasonal dom variations were mainly a response to seasonal precipitation distribution which can determine the output of dom from the soil layer and the mineralization and degradation of dom during transport this result is comparable to monitoring results in other regions on inter annual timescales a robust linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and annual effective precipitation amount implies that precipitation is the most important determinant for dom concentration in karst aquifers through three processes 1 humification rate of som 2 flushing and transport following strong rainfall 3 mineralization and degradation of dom within transfer processes 3 combined with previous results from laboratory leaching experiments the insensitivity of fluorescence intensity and fluorescence wavelength maxima of unsaturated zone flow to the local ph of acid rain on intra annual and inter annual time scales implies that current acid rain ph 5 6 to 4 5 has a limited effect on the dissolution of dom in karst soil and soil solution 4 the results presented permit an improved understanding of the influence of climate and acid rain on dom mobilization into karst aquifers on intra inter annual scales however heshang cave is only a case study it would be necessary in future studies to assess whether and how geographic differences between karstic systems

7569,the world s aquatic ecosystems yield numerous vital services which are essential to human existence but have deteriorated seriously in recent years by studying the mechanisms of interaction between ecosystems and habitat processes the constraining factors can be identified and this knowledge can be used to improve the success rate of ecological restoration initiatives at present there is insufficient data on the link between hydrological water quality factors and the changes in the structure of aquatic communities to allow any meaningful study of driving factors of aquatic ecosystems in this study the typical monitoring stations were selected by fuzzy clustering analysis based on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water ecology in jinan city the first pilot city for the construction of civilized aquatic ecosystems in china the dominant species identification model was used to identify the dominant species of the aquatic community the driving effect of hydrological and water quality factors on dominant species was analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis then the principal factors of aquatic ecosystem dependence were selected the results showed that there were 10 typical monitoring stations out of 59 monitoring sites which were representative of aquatic ecosystems 9 dominant fish species and 20 dominant invertebrate species the selection of factors for aquatic ecosystem dependence in jinan were highly influenced by its regional conditions chemical environmental parameters influence the temporal and spatial variation of invertebrate much more than that of fish in jinan city however the methodologies coupling typical monitoring stations selection dominant species determination and driving factors identification were certified to be a cost effective way which can provide in deep theoretical and technical directions for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems elsewhere keywords hydrology water quality driving factor fish invertebrate 1 introduction the world s ecosystems are important capital assets yielding numerous vital services that are essential to human existence zhao et al 2012 unfortunately escalating impacts of human activities on ecosystems imperil their delivery ecosystems are undergoing rapid degradation and depletion daily 1999 daily et al 2000 and are increasingly threatened by human induced habitat loss kagalou et al 2010 moreover large quantities of pollutants have been discharged into rivers resulting in water quality degradation and damaging aquatic ecosystems zhao et al 2012 in aquatic ecosystems fish species are the most important ecological groups playing an important role in the material recycling and energy flow through the system mansor et al 2012 fish communities are effective indicators of ecosystem health as they are relatively easy to identify and their position at the top of the food chain means that they reflect the overall health of the environment wu et al 2014 some habitat restoration programs have taken fish as representative of ecosystems health and used them to evaluate aquatic ecosystem restoration potential e g the use of the endangered species act to list the anadromous pacific salmon and steelhead populations in the united states bernhardt et al 2005 bellmore et al 2012 habitat type and complexity or habitat heterogeneity influences the resource usage by many fish species okun and mehner 2005 visintainer et al 2006 along with biological interactions such as competition and predation coen et al 1981 danielson 1991 whitley and bollens 2014 fish on the top of the food chain are more sensitive to chemical pollution than other species and their changes reflect changes of other organisms therefore the status of the fish can reflect the environmental status of the entire ecosystems average age oviposition capacity and conditional factors are applied as monitoring indicators to track fish population responses to environmental changes and thereby to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems norris and thoms 1999 huo et al 2012 in addition to fish invertebrate species also play a very important role in aquatic ecosystems schröder et al 2013 they are an important nutritional link between microbial algae fish and birds keast 1985 mcqueen et al 1986 xie et al 2007a by accelerating mineralization of the nutrients and facilitating the interchange of materials between the water and bottom sediment invertebrate species can accelerate the self purification of a water body ingham 1985 lindegaard 1995 benke 1993 kennedy 1994 wolfram 1996 xie et al 2007a furthermore invertebrate species are sensitive to environmental change and are therefore important indicator species for water pollution xie et al 2007b these factors have led to the widespread use of invertebrate species in the evaluation of the health of aquatic ecosystems and having a guiding role in the protection utilization and management of freshwater habitats in recent years a number of ecological restoration projects in europe and the united states have been carried out and an assessment of 78 large scale projects has shown that only a few have achieved their aims palmer et al 2010 due to the inadequacy in the researches on the response of species to environmental factors which can make clear the relations between environmental factors and biological metrics and further identify the principal limiting factors in freshwater ecosystems gieswein et al 2017 statzner and dolédec 2011 study on the interaction between ecosystem biological processes hydrological and water quality processes of aquatic habitats as well as identification of restricting factors can improve the success rate of ecological restoration projects palmer et al 2005 therefore research is urgently necessitated to identify the principal factors driving ecosystem development across the world especially in the areas with ecological restoration projects at present most researches on the ecosystem driving factors are based on the large scale sampling of the river basin and analyze the impact of social factors and water quality factors on ecosystems caused by human activities liu et al 2016 wu et al 2014 there is insufficient research on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquatic ecology of the river basin and its relationship with hydrology and water quality with the existing studies based mostly on integrated index analyses of all biological factors in aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 he et al 2014 a failure to consider the change in the aquatic community structure obscured the behavior of the principal aquatic organisms resulting in the uncertainty of the research results research is urgently needed to identify typical sites that reflect the characteristics of the different temporal and spatial distribution of watershed habitats and the principal organisms that can reflect the changes of aquatic community structure through analyses of hydrological and water quality coupled with observations of principal indicator species in typical sites it should be a cost effective way to identify the principal factors driving the dependence of aquatic ecosystems due to the critical role of fish and invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems improving our understanding of their tempo spatial heterogeneity is key to the maintenance and remediation of aquatic ecosystems in terms of controlling the amount of pollutants put into rivers which in turns sustains the development of society and economy this is especially important for the jinan city a pilot for the construction of a civilized and ecological city in china due to rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in jinan are severely polluted and depleted through extraction hong et al 2010 as a result river ecosystems are being increasingly threatened and degraded policy makers and stakeholders are aware of the need to rehabilitate the river ecosystems in jinan city to ensure successful ecosystem restoration in all rivers river administrators need a practical understanding of the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of river ecosystems which up to now has received little attention outside the research community the objectives of this study are to explore the methodologies to improve our understanding of the tempo spatial heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems and their change in the community structure based on variation of fish and invertebrate as well as their habitat factors taking the pilot city jinan as a case to improve the success rate of ecosystem restoration project all over the world 2 study area jinan city 36 0 37 5 n 116 2 117 7 e or the spring city is a pilot city for the construction of a civilized and ecological city in china it is bordered by mount tai to the south and traversed by the yellow river with a steeper topography in the south than in the north fig 1 hilly areas piedmont clinoplain and alluvial plains span the city from north to south the altitude within the area ranges from 30 to 937 m asl with highly contrasting relief the semi humid continental monsoon climate in the city area is characterized by cold dry winters and hot wet summers the average annual precipitation is 636 mm with 75 falling during the high flow periods the average annual temperature is 14 3 c the average monthly temperature is highest in july ranging from 26 8 to 27 4 c and lowest in january ranging from 3 2 to 1 4 c cui et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 jinan city represents a typical developing city in china with an area of 8227 km2 and a population of 5 69 million zhang et al 2007 with rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in jinan are severely polluted and reduced in quantity through extraction as a result drinking water and human health and well being are becoming increasingly threatened hong et al 2010 as is the fish community sixty routine monitoring stations distributed evenly on typical rivers were established fig 1 in the spring summer and autumn of the year 2014 2015 and 2016 nine large scale field investigations measured 37 hydrologic water quality physical and water quality chemical factors table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 data based on the comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the watershed and administrative regions of jinan city and the consideration of the spatial differentiation of hydrological water quality the hydrology water quality aquatic ecosystem monitoring stations were identified located counties cities and districts of jinan city in spring summer and autumn of 2014 2015 and 2016 nine large scale field investigations recorded a large quantity of hydrological water quality and water biological synchronization data to analyze the principal driving factors of aquatic ecosystem changes in jinan city the monitoring seasons make inter annual observations fully comparable and intra annual observations well representative of variability of the synchronization data data from the nine field investigations for each monitoring station were averaged to reduce influence of the temporal variation on the spatial site clustering whereby to make prominent the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrology water quality and biological factors with the help of spatial site clustering typical monitoring stations were determined all data from the nine field investigations for each typical monitoring station were then used for driving factors identification 3 1 1 fish and invertebrate monitoring 3 1 1 1 fish species fish were collected over 30 min in three habitat types i e pools riffles and runs within a 500 m section of river at each sampling site individuals caught from the three habitats were combined to represent a site in wadeable streams fish collection was performed by a two person team according to the method described by barbour et al 1999 in unwadeable streams seine nets mesh sizes of 30 and 40 mm were used to collect fish from a boat in addition electrofishing was conducted to ensure that a complete representation of fish species was collected at each site all individuals collected were identified in situ using the method described by chen et al 1987 and their numbers and masses were recorded in field data sheets all identified fish were then released a few specimens that could not be identified in the field were preserved in 10 formalin solution and stored in labeled jars for subsequent laboratory identification zhao et al 2015a 3 1 1 2 invertebrate species an oyster bucket harvester with a mouth area of 29 cm 29 cm was used to dig substrate sludge which was then washed with a 60 mesh filter finally invertebrate was isolated and 75 alcohol solution was added to preserve it zhao et al 2010 as invertebrate species are larger than plankton protoctists and bacteria they can be counted and classified by eye the masses of all aquatic organisms were recorded in the laboratory using a torque balance or a pharmaceutical scale depending on size and then classified using an aquatic organism atlas zhao et al 2010 wang and yang 2003 3 1 2 water quality parameters monitoring in the nine field investigations 480 water samples were collected the physical parameters in table 1 were measured in situ with portable equipment and the chemical parameters in table 1were obtained by testing water samples in the laboratory within 24 h which were collected at monitoring sites a spectrophotometer dr5000 was used to measure ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen and hexavalent chromium an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo m6 was used to measure copper zinc cadmium lead etc and an ion chromatograph dionex 600 was used to measure sulfate fluoride chloride and nitrate concentrations details of the techniques employed are described by zhao et al 2015b 3 1 3 hydrological parameters monitoring the hydrological parameters were shown in table 1 other indicators such as substrate were also monitored in the part of habitat health assessment in the study area there were only 6 60 stations where substrate consisted of pebble or gravel the rest were all of sludge these were insufficient to allow for key habitat factor selection and were therefore excluded in this study in the monitoring stations water depth and flow velocity were routinely monitored the flow velocity was measured by radio flow meter stalker ii svr v1 0 and traditional flow meter ls25 1 to ensure the accuracy of the results water depth and river width were measured with a tape gauge and flow was calculated from the flow velocity water depth and cross sectional area unmanned aerial vehicle uav was used to retrieve river course cross sections with high resolution stereoscopic images zhao et al 2017 3 2 method 3 2 1 fuzzy clustering method based on biological indices and habitat parameters clustering is important for pattern recognition classification model reduction and optimization clustering analysis can be performed using the traditional hard clustering method or the fuzzy clustering method fcm the hard clustering method is more suitable for clustering conditions with clear boundaries whereas for problems with unclear boundaries an fcm is usually adopted pan 2010 zhao et al 2013a in this study monitoring stations distribute randomly covering the whole study area and it is hard to find clear boundaries therefore clustering with fcm is the best choice the advantage of this algorithm is that it can effectively avoid setting thresholds and can solve the difficult problem of multiple branches in threshold segmentation li et al 2007 pan 2010 shafi et al 2010 to facilitate calculation data in a n m matrix was pre processed using the model x ij x ij x j 1 n i 1 n x ij x j i 1 n j 1 m with the average value x j i 1 n x ij n during the establishment of a similar matrix the widely used euclidean distance r ij 1 k 1 m x ik x jk 2 max k 1 m x ik x jk 2 was adopted zhao et al 2013a the maximum euclidean distance between clusters were calculated during fuzzy clustering which was conducted in the software data processing system dps tang and zhang 2012 in this study fcm was used to cluster monitoring stations based on biological indices and habitat parameters which were dealt with the normalized formula x x x min x max x min before calculation the habitat parameters include monitored water quality and hydrological variables three biological indices were used the biodiversity index was calculated by shannon weaver weaver and shannon 1949 and evenness was calculated by pielou lloyd et al 1968 ibi is one of the principal indices for ecosystem health assessment wang et al 2005 in the process of fish ibi calculation we used three parameters as core parameters including the number of fish species the number of dominant fish species and the biodiversity index of fish five core parameters of invertebrate were selected inclusive of ept taxa mathers et al 2017 the aquatic insects taxa the percentage of the individual population the chironomidae taxa and shannon weaver biodiversity index based on the 17 factors listed in table 2 the stations with similar indices were divided into one class in the results of fcm the large difference between two station indices usually results in far distance between the stations to keep as far distance among clusters as one can the middle station in a cluster was selected to represent all stations in the cluster 3 2 2 dominant species identification with dominance breakpoints abundance and biomass of biota are fundamental indices for biological monitoring abundance reflects the individual number of a species while biomass reflects the size of a species in this study they were combined to determine the dominant fish and invertebrate species using eq 1 zhao et al 2014 1 i mportance i ω 1 p a i ω 2 p b i where i mportance stands for the dominance of a species p a and p b refer respectively to the ratios of the species abundance and biomass to the total for the communities considering the spatial presence absence of the species p a i n i i n p b i b i i b n i is the abundance of the i th species and b i is the biomass of the species and ω 1 and ω 2 are the weightings of abundance and biomass ω 1 ω 2 1 0 they are determined by using center of mass zhao et al 2015b as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 ω 1 ω 2 a b ω 1 ω 2 1 3 a a i p n i i n b b i p b i i b after the dominance index of all species was calculated the dominant species of the biological community were identified by the breakpoint i e the point on the dominance curve where the curvature is significantly smaller after that point than the curvature before was determined based on curvature of cumulative dominance using eq 4 gippel and stewardson 1998 liu et al 2006 zhao et al 2015b 4 κ d 2 y dx 2 1 dy dx 2 3 2 κ represents the curvature of the dominance curve on the dominance curve the curvature after a certain point is significantly smaller than the curvature before that point which is called breakpoint it is more objective to choose the dominant species in the aquatic population in this way 3 2 3 canonical correspondence analysis with the monte carlo permutation test canonical correspondence analysis cca is a multivariate gradient analysis method designed to elucidate relationships between biological assemblages of species and environmental factors it develops a coordinate system that is optimal for correlation analysis with the eigenvectors defining this coordinate system eigenvectors of environmental variables permit the identification of those variables with higher loadings and thereby those that have more important relationships with biological data cca creates orthogonal components and a set of scores for each item it has been widely used to predict interactions between community structure and environmental variables godoy et al 2002 martino and able 2003 biswas et al 2014 cca is based on the corresponding analysis of the development of a sorting method where the corresponding analysis and multiple regression analysis of the combination of each step are calculated with environmental factors regression also known as multiple direct gradient analysis during the iterative process of the corresponding analysis the quadratic coordinate values obtained each time are subjected to multiple linear regression with the environmental factors it requires two data matrices which were the species data matrix and the environmental data matrix in this study a set of quadratic ordering values and sorting values corresponding to the corresponding analysis were calculated and then the quadratic ordering values were combined with the environmental factors by regression analysis the weighted average of the sorted values was then ranked mansor et al 2012 barrella et al 2014 habitat factors influencing fish and invertebrate communities include hydrologic physical and water chemical parameters methods using unimodal ordination with a monte carlo permutation test were used to select principal factors p 05 from the above three types of parameters that underpinned the spatial heterogeneity of the fish and invertebrate communities the figures of cca were drawn by using canoco lepš and šmilauer 2003 4 results 4 1 typical monitoring stations selection hydrological factors flow velocity flow river width etc biological factors biodiversity evenness index of biotic integrity ibi and water quality factors turbidity total phosphorus cod mn etc were included in the classification table 2 factors were excluded which were below detection level or similar across the stations in fig 2 it can be seen that j12 j23 and j36 have a high degree of similarity belonging to the same cluster and likewise j7 and j14 have a high degree of similarity so belonging to the same cluster the cluster containing j12 j23 and j36 is far away from the cluster containing j7 and j14 indicating significant differences the reason is that as j12 j23 are j36 are all located in the mainstream of the yellow river j7 and j14 are both in reservoirs though the spatial locations are different the similarities in river landscape means that there will be similarities also in hydrology water quality and water ecology overall the 59 monitoring stations can be divided into three clusters cluster 1 j14 j7 j56 j26 j9 j27 j15 j42 j32 j41 j39 j34 j48 j40 j43 j25 j17 j11 j38 j45 j37 cluster 2 j33 j8 j28 j55 j47 j30 j24 j46 j10 j58 j19 j18 j57 j22 j16 j44 j35 j21 j31 j20 j13 j54 cluster 3 j23 j12 j36 clusters 1 2 and 3 have 21 22 and 3 monitoring stations respectively cluster 1 and cluster 2 belong to the same high level cluster which contains most of the monitoring stations most stations in cluster 1 locate in lakes or reservoirs those in cluster 2 locate in rivers and those in cluster 3 locate in the mainstream of the yellow river which is the second largest river in china stations in cluster 1 have deep water depth and low flow velocity while those in cluster 3 have great flow and river width opposing to the stations in cluster 2 the difference of hydrological conditions among the clusters resulted in great variation in water quality the results of fcm conform to the actual situation to a certain extent the results reflect that monitoring stations located in the mainstream of the yellow river are different from others the ecological status of the yellow river has a special status in all the watersheds of jinan city from the results of fcm analysis the middle stations of each subordinate cluster was selected as the typical stations for that cluster for example j7 was selected as the typical station from the cluster containing j7 j14 and j56 according to this principle 10 typical stations were selected in order to ensure the representativeness of each selected station the water quality level and flow of the monitoring stations were used to check that each monitoring station can represent a gradient range the final typical monitoring stations are shown in fig 1 4 2 dominant species of fish and invertebrate species in typical stations in the nine field investigations from 2014 to 2016 58 species of bony fish were identified belonging to 7 orders 19 families and 50 genera the proportion of the abundance and biomass of each fish relative to the whole community was calculated ω 1 0 33 and ω 2 0 67 were brought into equation 1 to calculate species dominance i mportance sorting the dominance from large to small and calculating the degree of accumulation to plot the dominance curve the breakpoint was then calculated from the dominance curve fig 3 as 9 0 838 which corresponds to the species which were then selected as the dominant species in the fish population carassiusauratus fsp1 channa argus fsp2 misgurnus anguillicaudatus fsp3 hemiculter leucisculus fsp4 pseudorasbora parva fsp5 abbottina rivularis fsp6 ctenogobius brunneus fsp7 cyprinus carpio linnaeus fsp8 and rhodeus ocellatus fsp9 seventy three invertebrate species were identified belonging to 3 phyla 6 classes 12 orders 26 families and 31 genera and the ratio of the abundance and biomass of the benthic fauna relative to the whole community was calculated the weights of the abundance weights and biomass were calculated using the same method with ω 1 equal to 0 625 and ω 2 equal to 0 375 the dominance curve was plotted in the same way as with the fish data to identify the dominant species in the benthic fauna population as shown in fig 3 the breakpoint in fig 3 is 20 0 873 corresponding to the dominant invertebrate species of limnodrilus hoffmeisteri isp1 b fuchsiana isp2

modestus isp20 4 3 driving factors of fish and invertebrate species based on the dominant species of the fish and invertebrate in typical monitoring stations the response to the changes in aquatic parameters of fish and invertebrate species was studied using cca wherein the principal driving factors were selected the hydrological driving factors were identified solely based on monitoring data from rivers while the water quality driving factors were identified with monitoring data from both rivers and lakes reservoirs for fish species from 2014 to 2016 in jinan results of cca showed that the principal hydrological factors affecting the distribution of fish in jinan were river flow and river width the principal water quality physical factors were the conductivity turbidity and temperature of the water and the principal water quality chemical factors were carbonate and chloride levels fig 4 for invertebrate species in jinan from 2014 to 2016 results of cca showed that the principal hydrological factors affecting the distribution of invertebrate species in jinan were water depth and flow velocity the principal water quality physical factors were water temperature and ph and the principal water quality chemical factors were total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen fig 4 the hydrological factor that had the greatest impact on both fish and invertebrate species was water depth in addition the dependence of fish communities was mainly driven by flow and river width and the dependence of invertebrate species was mainly driven by flow velocity the water quality physical factor that had the greatest impact on both fish and invertebrate species was water temperature in addition the dependence of the fish community was driven by water conductivity and turbidity and the dependence of invertebrate species was driven by ph the principal water quality chemical factors for the dependence of fish communities was carbonate and chloride and the principal water quality chemical factors for the dependence of invertebrate species was total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen dissolved oxygen 5 discussion 5 1 similarities and differences in driving factors of fish and invertebrate species hydrological factors have a great impact on the health of aquatic ecosystems hydrological conditions are the principal influence on fish community structure and the flow velocity water depth and flow play an important role in the reproduction and survival of fish and invertebrate species duan et al 2008 marchetti and moyle 2001 wu et al 2014 the four major hydrological factors are included in the principal driving factors of the aquatic ecosystem identified in this study which again demonstrates the importance of hydrological factors in aquatic ecosystem health studies have shown that water temperature ph turbidity total phosphorus total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen all have a strong effect on the dependence of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2016 yang et al 2007 and with the exception of tn our findings are consistent with this total nitrogen has much more influence on phytoplankton than on fish and invertebrates and therefore it did not appear in our research results in brief more hydrological and physical environmental parameters than chemical environmental ones were identified as principal driving factors for fish while more chemical environmental parameters were selected for invertebrate in other words chemical environmental parameters drive the temporal and spatial distribution of invertebrate much more than that of fish in our study area 5 2 rationality analysis of the driving factors pollutant concentration is the most important variable affecting the chance of successful fish spawning nelson and lieberman 2002 liu et al 2011 and further affects the structure and behavior of the aquatic ecosystem communities our study indicates that when taking fish and invertebrates as representatives of aquatic ecosystems the principal factors driving aquatic ecosystem such as tp and nh3 n closely match the temporal and spatial patterns of these water quality factors exceeding water quality standard limits this can be used to reflect the patterns of water quality in the jinan city which in turns suggests that the identification of these principal driving factors in this study can be of practical use in guiding policy making for ecological and water quality remediation in the study area zhao et al 2015b identified principal habitat factors influencing the spatial variation of fish species in the jinan city their results as well as the results in the research of rodríguez and lewis 1997 suggested that fish assemblage structure in freshwater areas was related to but not restricted to transparency and surface area or river width transparency can be transformed into turbidity driving factors for fish in table 3 in the present study based on the research of zhang et al 2009 where the two factors were found negatively correlated p 01 in other words the fish driving factors of river width and turbidity identified in our study are acceptable wang et al 2017 identified the principal limiting water quality factors for invertebrate in jinan city which suggested that total phosphorus dissolved oxygen and ph were the principal factors the three factors were also identified as principal factors in our study moreover our results keep consistent with the research of hering et al 2006 which showed that nutrient enrichment had more effect on aquatic organism groups analysis on the geophysical conditions of the study area indicated that the cross sectional shape of the river was altered significantly the cross sectional shape includes orthogonal trapezoidal parabolic and compound types the immense changes in the cross sectional shape make water depth a constraining factor besides water temperature is the factor influencing both fish and invertebrates due to the spatial heterogeneity of the types and the height of plants below or above covering water surface some waters are shaded by leaves e g j34 in fig 1 while the others are barely exposed to the sun e g j23 locating in the yellow river which resulted in great spatial variation of the water temperature aquatic biota assemblages are not limited by a single factor but an interaction among many variables rahel 1984 which may change with the geographical location regional characteristics of study area the jinan city is dominated by farmland and downtown areas where non point source pollutants are from agricultural and domestic activities with poorly planned settlers nearby the river these pollutants are flushed into river along with runoff the variant degree of disturbances on freshwater increases the spatial heterogeneity of cross section water temperature dissolved oxygen carbonate etc these have been implicated to be causative to the variant degree of poor quality of the river and its aquatic life kolawole et al 2011 5 3 indicator species of the principal driving factor at present the study of indicator species is only on the community scale such as fish invertebrate species phytoplankton and zooplankton wu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 findlay and shearer 1992 even if there is a study of a single species but also to study the degree of dirt tolerance such as α polysaprobic β polysaprobic α mesosaprobic β mesosaprobic oligosaprobic clear water zhao et al 2013b peng and li 2016 only few studies have been conducted on specific indicator species for specific water quality factors water quality factors have a great impact on the survival distribution and community dependence of aquatic organisms to provide a ready method for stakeholders to estimate water quality we have summarized the indicator species of the principal driving water quality factors of jinan in table 4 the indicator species was selected according to fig 3 where the more the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between a species and an environmental factor is closer to 1 the closer the relationship between the species and the environmental factor is this will allow a determination of the status of water quality factors and the health of the aquatic ecosystem which can then provide a reference for long term monitoring and control of aquatic ecosystem health in jinan our results for the species dependencies are in line with studies based on the database http www freshwaterecology info schmidt kloiber and hering 2012 schröder et al 2013 which mean the relationships between species and factors in our study are not only useful to study area but applicable elsewhere table 4 shows that h leucisculus and chironomus spp are indicative for water environmental index h leucisculus can indicate the regime of conductivity turbidity water temperature ph and total phosphorus and chironomus spp can indicate the situations of conductivity ph carbonate chloride total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen overall the research methods in this paper have great potential to make clear the factors driving spatiotemporal variation and community structure of the aquatic ecology by coupling typical monitoring stations selection dominant species determination and driving factors identification though some results were highly influenced by its regional conditions in jinan the methodologies can help policy makers and stakeholders to manage freshwater habitat by reducing discharge quantity of pollutant e g with chemical factors influencing dominant species and laying emphasis in ecological restoration on the dominant species principle driving factors and typical stations or river sections selected through our methods this will significantly improve the cost effectiveness and success rate of restoration projects 6 conclusions based on hydrological water quality and aquatic organism data obtained from nine large scale field surveys at 59 water ecological monitoring sites in jinan city from 2014 to 2016 we selected 10 typical stations by fuzzy clustering method the dominant species of fish and invertebrate species were obtained by using the identification model of aquatic dominant species combined with the canonical correspondence analysis the principal driving factors of aquatic ecosystem dependence were identified and the indicator species of the principal driving factors were selected the main conclusions are as follows 1 the 59 monitoring stations for hydrological water quality and water ecological data in jinan were divided into three clusters the stations of the middle of each cluster was selected as the typical stations 2 in the nine field investigations 58 species of bony fish were identified belonging to 7 orders 19 families and 50 genera seventy three invertebrate species were identified belonging to 3 phyla 6 classes 12 orders 26 families and 31 genera there are nine dominant species in the fish population of jinan city with a cumulative dominance of 0 838 and 20 dominant species in the invertebrate population with a cumulative dominance of 0 873 the common driving factors for fish and invertebrate communities are water depth and water temperature in addition the principal driving factors of fish communities also include flow river width conductivity turbidity carbonate chloride and the principal driving factors of invertebrate species communities also include flow velocity ph total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen 3 the principal factors driving aquatic ecosystem e g total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen closely match the temporal and spatial pattern of water quality factors exceeding the maximum levels for water quality standards and can well reflect the patterns of water quality in the jinan city which in turn suggests those principal driving factors can inform the development of practical policies for ecological and water quality remediation in the study area 4 the indicator species for the principal factors driving the aquatic ecosystem dependence in jinan was selected ctenogobius brunneus and chironomus spp were more likely to appear in an environment with a high ammonia nitrogen content but m anguillicaudatus and hydropsyche spp were more likely to appear in an environment with low ammonia nitrogen content hemiculter leucisculus and chironomus spp were more likely to appear in locations with high total phosphorus content but m anguillicaudatus and hydropsyche spp were more likely to appear in locations with low total phosphorus content this study selected the typical monitoring stations based on the characteristics of temporal and spatial distribution of aquatic ecology and the factors that drive the dependence of aquatic ecosystems were analyzed in typical monitoring stations these driving factors therefore are able to accurately reflect the status and health of aquatic ecosystems for the first time we have applied these research methods to identify the driving factors of aquatic ecosystem based on aquatic organisms to china s first water ecological civilization construction pilot city this provides the route to a successful restoration of the aquatic ecosystem in jinan city and provides the scientific basis for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems in other such cities the specific results obtained in this study are valid for the investigated region only but the methodologies can provide in deep theoretical and technical directions for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems elsewhere due to the complexity of aquatic ecosystems the study of the driving factors in this paper needs to further investigate the ecosystem natural characteristics in order to better preserve and promote the health of the aquatic ecosystems some results in this paper were preliminarily qualitative and therefore quantitative research with the

7569,the world s aquatic ecosystems yield numerous vital services which are essential to human existence but have deteriorated seriously in recent years by studying the mechanisms of interaction between ecosystems and habitat processes the constraining factors can be identified and this knowledge can be used to improve the success rate of ecological restoration initiatives at present there is insufficient data on the link between hydrological water quality factors and the changes in the structure of aquatic communities to allow any meaningful study of driving factors of aquatic ecosystems in this study the typical monitoring stations were selected by fuzzy clustering analysis based on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of water ecology in jinan city the first pilot city for the construction of civilized aquatic ecosystems in china the dominant species identification model was used to identify the dominant species of the aquatic community the driving effect of hydrological and water quality factors on dominant species was analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis then the principal factors of aquatic ecosystem dependence were selected the results showed that there were 10 typical monitoring stations out of 59 monitoring sites which were representative of aquatic ecosystems 9 dominant fish species and 20 dominant invertebrate species the selection of factors for aquatic ecosystem dependence in jinan were highly influenced by its regional conditions chemical environmental parameters influence the temporal and spatial variation of invertebrate much more than that of fish in jinan city however the methodologies coupling typical monitoring stations selection dominant species determination and driving factors identification were certified to be a cost effective way which can provide in deep theoretical and technical directions for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems elsewhere keywords hydrology water quality driving factor fish invertebrate 1 introduction the world s ecosystems are important capital assets yielding numerous vital services that are essential to human existence zhao et al 2012 unfortunately escalating impacts of human activities on ecosystems imperil their delivery ecosystems are undergoing rapid degradation and depletion daily 1999 daily et al 2000 and are increasingly threatened by human induced habitat loss kagalou et al 2010 moreover large quantities of pollutants have been discharged into rivers resulting in water quality degradation and damaging aquatic ecosystems zhao et al 2012 in aquatic ecosystems fish species are the most important ecological groups playing an important role in the material recycling and energy flow through the system mansor et al 2012 fish communities are effective indicators of ecosystem health as they are relatively easy to identify and their position at the top of the food chain means that they reflect the overall health of the environment wu et al 2014 some habitat restoration programs have taken fish as representative of ecosystems health and used them to evaluate aquatic ecosystem restoration potential e g the use of the endangered species act to list the anadromous pacific salmon and steelhead populations in the united states bernhardt et al 2005 bellmore et al 2012 habitat type and complexity or habitat heterogeneity influences the resource usage by many fish species okun and mehner 2005 visintainer et al 2006 along with biological interactions such as competition and predation coen et al 1981 danielson 1991 whitley and bollens 2014 fish on the top of the food chain are more sensitive to chemical pollution than other species and their changes reflect changes of other organisms therefore the status of the fish can reflect the environmental status of the entire ecosystems average age oviposition capacity and conditional factors are applied as monitoring indicators to track fish population responses to environmental changes and thereby to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems norris and thoms 1999 huo et al 2012 in addition to fish invertebrate species also play a very important role in aquatic ecosystems schröder et al 2013 they are an important nutritional link between microbial algae fish and birds keast 1985 mcqueen et al 1986 xie et al 2007a by accelerating mineralization of the nutrients and facilitating the interchange of materials between the water and bottom sediment invertebrate species can accelerate the self purification of a water body ingham 1985 lindegaard 1995 benke 1993 kennedy 1994 wolfram 1996 xie et al 2007a furthermore invertebrate species are sensitive to environmental change and are therefore important indicator species for water pollution xie et al 2007b these factors have led to the widespread use of invertebrate species in the evaluation of the health of aquatic ecosystems and having a guiding role in the protection utilization and management of freshwater habitats in recent years a number of ecological restoration projects in europe and the united states have been carried out and an assessment of 78 large scale projects has shown that only a few have achieved their aims palmer et al 2010 due to the inadequacy in the researches on the response of species to environmental factors which can make clear the relations between environmental factors and biological metrics and further identify the principal limiting factors in freshwater ecosystems gieswein et al 2017 statzner and dolédec 2011 study on the interaction between ecosystem biological processes hydrological and water quality processes of aquatic habitats as well as identification of restricting factors can improve the success rate of ecological restoration projects palmer et al 2005 therefore research is urgently necessitated to identify the principal factors driving ecosystem development across the world especially in the areas with ecological restoration projects at present most researches on the ecosystem driving factors are based on the large scale sampling of the river basin and analyze the impact of social factors and water quality factors on ecosystems caused by human activities liu et al 2016 wu et al 2014 there is insufficient research on the spatiotemporal variation of the aquatic ecology of the river basin and its relationship with hydrology and water quality with the existing studies based mostly on integrated index analyses of all biological factors in aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2016 xu et al 2016 he et al 2014 a failure to consider the change in the aquatic community structure obscured the behavior of the principal aquatic organisms resulting in the uncertainty of the research results research is urgently needed to identify typical sites that reflect the characteristics of the different temporal and spatial distribution of watershed habitats and the principal organisms that can reflect the changes of aquatic community structure through analyses of hydrological and water quality coupled with observations of principal indicator species in typical sites it should be a cost effective way to identify the principal factors driving the dependence of aquatic ecosystems due to the critical role of fish and invertebrates in aquatic ecosystems improving our understanding of their tempo spatial heterogeneity is key to the maintenance and remediation of aquatic ecosystems in terms of controlling the amount of pollutants put into rivers which in turns sustains the development of society and economy this is especially important for the jinan city a pilot for the construction of a civilized and ecological city in china due to rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in jinan are severely polluted and depleted through extraction hong et al 2010 as a result river ecosystems are being increasingly threatened and degraded policy makers and stakeholders are aware of the need to rehabilitate the river ecosystems in jinan city to ensure successful ecosystem restoration in all rivers river administrators need a practical understanding of the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of river ecosystems which up to now has received little attention outside the research community the objectives of this study are to explore the methodologies to improve our understanding of the tempo spatial heterogeneity of aquatic ecosystems and their change in the community structure based on variation of fish and invertebrate as well as their habitat factors taking the pilot city jinan as a case to improve the success rate of ecosystem restoration project all over the world 2 study area jinan city 36 0 37 5 n 116 2 117 7 e or the spring city is a pilot city for the construction of a civilized and ecological city in china it is bordered by mount tai to the south and traversed by the yellow river with a steeper topography in the south than in the north fig 1 hilly areas piedmont clinoplain and alluvial plains span the city from north to south the altitude within the area ranges from 30 to 937 m asl with highly contrasting relief the semi humid continental monsoon climate in the city area is characterized by cold dry winters and hot wet summers the average annual precipitation is 636 mm with 75 falling during the high flow periods the average annual temperature is 14 3 c the average monthly temperature is highest in july ranging from 26 8 to 27 4 c and lowest in january ranging from 3 2 to 1 4 c cui et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 jinan city represents a typical developing city in china with an area of 8227 km2 and a population of 5 69 million zhang et al 2007 with rapid industrial development and urbanization in recent decades the water resources in jinan are severely polluted and reduced in quantity through extraction as a result drinking water and human health and well being are becoming increasingly threatened hong et al 2010 as is the fish community sixty routine monitoring stations distributed evenly on typical rivers were established fig 1 in the spring summer and autumn of the year 2014 2015 and 2016 nine large scale field investigations measured 37 hydrologic water quality physical and water quality chemical factors table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 data based on the comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the watershed and administrative regions of jinan city and the consideration of the spatial differentiation of hydrological water quality the hydrology water quality aquatic ecosystem monitoring stations were identified located counties cities and districts of jinan city in spring summer and autumn of 2014 2015 and 2016 nine large scale field investigations recorded a large quantity of hydrological water quality and water biological synchronization data to analyze the principal driving factors of aquatic ecosystem changes in jinan city the monitoring seasons make inter annual observations fully comparable and intra annual observations well representative of variability of the synchronization data data from the nine field investigations for each monitoring station were averaged to reduce influence of the temporal variation on the spatial site clustering whereby to make prominent the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrology water quality and biological factors with the help of spatial site clustering typical monitoring stations were determined all data from the nine field investigations for each typical monitoring station were then used for driving factors identification 3 1 1 fish and invertebrate monitoring 3 1 1 1 fish species fish were collected over 30 min in three habitat types i e pools riffles and runs within a 500 m section of river at each sampling site individuals caught from the three habitats were combined to represent a site in wadeable streams fish collection was performed by a two person team according to the method described by barbour et al 1999 in unwadeable streams seine nets mesh sizes of 30 and 40 mm were used to collect fish from a boat in addition electrofishing was conducted to ensure that a complete representation of fish species was collected at each site all individuals collected were identified in situ using the method described by chen et al 1987 and their numbers and masses were recorded in field data sheets all identified fish were then released a few specimens that could not be identified in the field were preserved in 10 formalin solution and stored in labeled jars for subsequent laboratory identification zhao et al 2015a 3 1 1 2 invertebrate species an oyster bucket harvester with a mouth area of 29 cm 29 cm was used to dig substrate sludge which was then washed with a 60 mesh filter finally invertebrate was isolated and 75 alcohol solution was added to preserve it zhao et al 2010 as invertebrate species are larger than plankton protoctists and bacteria they can be counted and classified by eye the masses of all aquatic organisms were recorded in the laboratory using a torque balance or a pharmaceutical scale depending on size and then classified using an aquatic organism atlas zhao et al 2010 wang and yang 2003 3 1 2 water quality parameters monitoring in the nine field investigations 480 water samples were collected the physical parameters in table 1 were measured in situ with portable equipment and the chemical parameters in table 1were obtained by testing water samples in the laboratory within 24 h which were collected at monitoring sites a spectrophotometer dr5000 was used to measure ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus total nitrogen and hexavalent chromium an atomic absorption spectrophotometer thermo m6 was used to measure copper zinc cadmium lead etc and an ion chromatograph dionex 600 was used to measure sulfate fluoride chloride and nitrate concentrations details of the techniques employed are described by zhao et al 2015b 3 1 3 hydrological parameters monitoring the hydrological parameters were shown in table 1 other indicators such as substrate were also monitored in the part of habitat health assessment in the study area there were only 6 60 stations where substrate consisted of pebble or gravel the rest were all of sludge these were insufficient to allow for key habitat factor selection and were therefore excluded in this study in the monitoring stations water depth and flow velocity were routinely monitored the flow velocity was measured by radio flow meter stalker ii svr v1 0 and traditional flow meter ls25 1 to ensure the accuracy of the results water depth and river width were measured with a tape gauge and flow was calculated from the flow velocity water depth and cross sectional area unmanned aerial vehicle uav was used to retrieve river course cross sections with high resolution stereoscopic images zhao et al 2017 3 2 method 3 2 1 fuzzy clustering method based on biological indices and habitat parameters clustering is important for pattern recognition classification model reduction and optimization clustering analysis can be performed using the traditional hard clustering method or the fuzzy clustering method fcm the hard clustering method is more suitable for clustering conditions with clear boundaries whereas for problems with unclear boundaries an fcm is usually adopted pan 2010 zhao et al 2013a in this study monitoring stations distribute randomly covering the whole study area and it is hard to find clear boundaries therefore clustering with fcm is the best choice the advantage of this algorithm is that it can effectively avoid setting thresholds and can solve the difficult problem of multiple branches in threshold segmentation li et al 2007 pan 2010 shafi et al 2010 to facilitate calculation data in a n m matrix was pre processed using the model x ij x ij x j 1 n i 1 n x ij x j i 1 n j 1 m with the average value x j i 1 n x ij n during the establishment of a similar matrix the widely used euclidean distance r ij 1 k 1 m x ik x jk 2 max k 1 m x ik x jk 2 was adopted zhao et al 2013a the maximum euclidean distance between clusters were calculated during fuzzy clustering which was conducted in the software data processing system dps tang and zhang 2012 in this study fcm was used to cluster monitoring stations based on biological indices and habitat parameters which were dealt with the normalized formula x x x min x max x min before calculation the habitat parameters include monitored water quality and hydrological variables three biological indices were used the biodiversity index was calculated by shannon weaver weaver and shannon 1949 and evenness was calculated by pielou lloyd et al 1968 ibi is one of the principal indices for ecosystem health assessment wang et al 2005 in the process of fish ibi calculation we used three parameters as core parameters including the number of fish species the number of dominant fish species and the biodiversity index of fish five core parameters of invertebrate were selected inclusive of ept taxa mathers et al 2017 the aquatic insects taxa the percentage of the individual population the chironomidae taxa and shannon weaver biodiversity index based on the 17 factors listed in table 2 the stations with similar indices were divided into one class in the results of fcm the large difference between two station indices usually results in far distance between the stations to keep as far distance among clusters as one can the middle station in a cluster was selected to represent all stations in the cluster 3 2 2 dominant species identification with dominance breakpoints abundance and biomass of biota are fundamental indices for biological monitoring abundance reflects the individual number of a species while biomass reflects the size of a species in this study they were combined to determine the dominant fish and invertebrate species using eq 1 zhao et al 2014 1 i mportance i ω 1 p a i ω 2 p b i where i mportance stands for the dominance of a species p a and p b refer respectively to the ratios of the species abundance and biomass to the total for the communities considering the spatial presence absence of the species p a i n i i n p b i b i i b n i is the abundance of the i th species and b i is the biomass of the species and ω 1 and ω 2 are the weightings of abundance and biomass ω 1 ω 2 1 0 they are determined by using center of mass zhao et al 2015b as shown in eqs 2 and 3 2 ω 1 ω 2 a b ω 1 ω 2 1 3 a a i p n i i n b b i p b i i b after the dominance index of all species was calculated the dominant species of the biological community were identified by the breakpoint i e the point on the dominance curve where the curvature is significantly smaller after that point than the curvature before was determined based on curvature of cumulative dominance using eq 4 gippel and stewardson 1998 liu et al 2006 zhao et al 2015b 4 κ d 2 y dx 2 1 dy dx 2 3 2 κ represents the curvature of the dominance curve on the dominance curve the curvature after a certain point is significantly smaller than the curvature before that point which is called breakpoint it is more objective to choose the dominant species in the aquatic population in this way 3 2 3 canonical correspondence analysis with the monte carlo permutation test canonical correspondence analysis cca is a multivariate gradient analysis method designed to elucidate relationships between biological assemblages of species and environmental factors it develops a coordinate system that is optimal for correlation analysis with the eigenvectors defining this coordinate system eigenvectors of environmental variables permit the identification of those variables with higher loadings and thereby those that have more important relationships with biological data cca creates orthogonal components and a set of scores for each item it has been widely used to predict interactions between community structure and environmental variables godoy et al 2002 martino and able 2003 biswas et al 2014 cca is based on the corresponding analysis of the development of a sorting method where the corresponding analysis and multiple regression analysis of the combination of each step are calculated with environmental factors regression also known as multiple direct gradient analysis during the iterative process of the corresponding analysis the quadratic coordinate values obtained each time are subjected to multiple linear regression with the environmental factors it requires two data matrices which were the species data matrix and the environmental data matrix in this study a set of quadratic ordering values and sorting values corresponding to the corresponding analysis were calculated and then the quadratic ordering values were combined with the environmental factors by regression analysis the weighted average of the sorted values was then ranked mansor et al 2012 barrella et al 2014 habitat factors influencing fish and invertebrate communities include hydrologic physical and water chemical parameters methods using unimodal ordination with a monte carlo permutation test were used to select principal factors p 05 from the above three types of parameters that underpinned the spatial heterogeneity of the fish and invertebrate communities the figures of cca were drawn by using canoco lepš and šmilauer 2003 4 results 4 1 typical monitoring stations selection hydrological factors flow velocity flow river width etc biological factors biodiversity evenness index of biotic integrity ibi and water quality factors turbidity total phosphorus cod mn etc were included in the classification table 2 factors were excluded which were below detection level or similar across the stations in fig 2 it can be seen that j12 j23 and j36 have a high degree of similarity belonging to the same cluster and likewise j7 and j14 have a high degree of similarity so belonging to the same cluster the cluster containing j12 j23 and j36 is far away from the cluster containing j7 and j14 indicating significant differences the reason is that as j12 j23 are j36 are all located in the mainstream of the yellow river j7 and j14 are both in reservoirs though the spatial locations are different the similarities in river landscape means that there will be similarities also in hydrology water quality and water ecology overall the 59 monitoring stations can be divided into three clusters cluster 1 j14 j7 j56 j26 j9 j27 j15 j42 j32 j41 j39 j34 j48 j40 j43 j25 j17 j11 j38 j45 j37 cluster 2 j33 j8 j28 j55 j47 j30 j24 j46 j10 j58 j19 j18 j57 j22 j16 j44 j35 j21 j31 j20 j13 j54 cluster 3 j23 j12 j36 clusters 1 2 and 3 have 21 22 and 3 monitoring stations respectively cluster 1 and cluster 2 belong to the same high level cluster which contains most of the monitoring stations most stations in cluster 1 locate in lakes or reservoirs those in cluster 2 locate in rivers and those in cluster 3 locate in the mainstream of the yellow river which is the second largest river in china stations in cluster 1 have deep water depth and low flow velocity while those in cluster 3 have great flow and river width opposing to the stations in cluster 2 the difference of hydrological conditions among the clusters resulted in great variation in water quality the results of fcm conform to the actual situation to a certain extent the results reflect that monitoring stations located in the mainstream of the yellow river are different from others the ecological status of the yellow river has a special status in all the watersheds of jinan city from the results of fcm analysis the middle stations of each subordinate cluster was selected as the typical stations for that cluster for example j7 was selected as the typical station from the cluster containing j7 j14 and j56 according to this principle 10 typical stations were selected in order to ensure the representativeness of each selected station the water quality level and flow of the monitoring stations were used to check that each monitoring station can represent a gradient range the final typical monitoring stations are shown in fig 1 4 2 dominant species of fish and invertebrate species in typical stations in the nine field investigations from 2014 to 2016 58 species of bony fish were identified belonging to 7 orders 19 families and 50 genera the proportion of the abundance and biomass of each fish relative to the whole community was calculated ω 1 0 33 and ω 2 0 67 were brought into equation 1 to calculate species dominance i mportance sorting the dominance from large to small and calculating the degree of accumulation to plot the dominance curve the breakpoint was then calculated from the dominance curve fig 3 as 9 0 838 which corresponds to the species which were then selected as the dominant species in the fish population carassiusauratus fsp1 channa argus fsp2 misgurnus anguillicaudatus fsp3 hemiculter leucisculus fsp4 pseudorasbora parva fsp5 abbottina rivularis fsp6 ctenogobius brunneus fsp7 cyprinus carpio linnaeus fsp8 and rhodeus ocellatus fsp9 seventy three invertebrate species were identified belonging to 3 phyla 6 classes 12 orders 26 families and 31 genera and the ratio of the abundance and biomass of the benthic fauna relative to the whole community was calculated the weights of the abundance weights and biomass were calculated using the same method with ω 1 equal to 0 625 and ω 2 equal to 0 375 the dominance curve was plotted in the same way as with the fish data to identify the dominant species in the benthic fauna population as shown in fig 3 the breakpoint in fig 3 is 20 0 873 corresponding to the dominant invertebrate species of limnodrilus hoffmeisteri isp1 b fuchsiana isp2

parameters of fish and invertebrate species was studied using cca wherein the principal driving factors were selected the hydrological driving factors were identified solely based on monitoring data from rivers while the water quality driving factors were identified with monitoring data from both rivers and lakes reservoirs for fish species from 2014 to 2016 in jinan results of cca showed that the principal hydrological factors affecting the distribution of fish in jinan were river flow and river width the principal water quality physical factors were the conductivity turbidity and temperature of the water and the principal water quality chemical factors were carbonate and chloride levels fig 4 for invertebrate species in jinan from 2014 to 2016 results of cca showed that the principal hydrological factors affecting the distribution of invertebrate species in jinan were water depth and flow velocity the principal water quality physical factors were water temperature and ph and the principal water quality chemical factors were total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen fig 4 the hydrological factor that had the greatest impact on both fish and invertebrate species was water depth in addition the dependence of fish communities was mainly driven by flow and river width and the dependence of invertebrate species was mainly driven by flow velocity the water quality physical factor that had the greatest impact on both fish and invertebrate species was water temperature in addition the dependence of the fish community was driven by water conductivity and turbidity and the dependence of invertebrate species was driven by ph the principal water quality chemical factors for the dependence of fish communities was carbonate and chloride and the principal water quality chemical factors for the dependence of invertebrate species was total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen dissolved oxygen 5 discussion 5 1 similarities and differences in driving factors of fish and invertebrate species hydrological factors have a great impact on the health of aquatic ecosystems hydrological conditions are the principal influence on fish community structure and the flow velocity water depth and flow play an important role in the reproduction and survival of fish and invertebrate species duan et al 2008 marchetti and moyle 2001 wu et al 2014 the four major hydrological factors are included in the principal driving factors of the aquatic ecosystem identified in this study which again demonstrates the importance of hydrological factors in aquatic ecosystem health studies have shown that water temperature ph turbidity total phosphorus total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen all have a strong effect on the dependence of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2016 yang et al 2007 and with the exception of tn our findings are consistent with this total nitrogen has much more influence on phytoplankton than on fish and invertebrates and therefore it did not appear in our research results in brief more hydrological and physical environmental parameters than chemical environmental ones were identified as principal driving factors for fish while more chemical environmental parameters were selected for invertebrate in other words chemical environmental parameters drive the temporal and spatial distribution of invertebrate much more than that of fish in our study area 5 2 rationality analysis of the driving factors pollutant concentration is the most important variable affecting the chance of successful fish spawning nelson and lieberman 2002 liu et al 2011 and further affects the structure and behavior of the aquatic ecosystem communities our study indicates that when taking fish and invertebrates as representatives of aquatic ecosystems the principal factors driving aquatic ecosystem such as tp and nh3 n closely match the temporal and spatial patterns of these water quality factors exceeding water quality standard limits this can be used to reflect the patterns of water quality in the jinan city which in turns suggests that the identification of these principal driving factors in this study can be of practical use in guiding policy making for ecological and water quality remediation in the study area zhao et al 2015b identified principal habitat factors influencing the spatial variation of fish species in the jinan city their results as well as the results in the research of rodríguez and lewis 1997 suggested that fish assemblage structure in freshwater areas was related to but not restricted to transparency and surface area or river width transparency can be transformed into turbidity driving factors for fish in table 3 in the present study based on the research of zhang et al 2009 where the two factors were found negatively correlated p 01 in other words the fish driving factors of river width and turbidity identified in our study are acceptable wang et al 2017 identified the principal limiting water quality factors for invertebrate in jinan city which suggested that total phosphorus dissolved oxygen and ph were the principal factors the three factors were also identified as principal factors in our study moreover our results keep consistent with the research of hering et al 2006 which showed that nutrient enrichment had more effect on aquatic organism groups analysis on the geophysical conditions of the study area indicated that the cross sectional shape of the river was altered significantly the cross sectional shape includes orthogonal trapezoidal parabolic and compound types the immense changes in the cross sectional shape make water depth a constraining factor besides water temperature is the factor influencing both fish and invertebrates due to the spatial heterogeneity of the types and the height of plants below or above covering water surface some waters are shaded by leaves e g j34 in fig 1 while the others are barely exposed to the sun e g j23 locating in the yellow river which resulted in great spatial variation of the water temperature aquatic biota assemblages are not limited by a single factor but an interaction among many variables rahel 1984 which may change with the geographical location regional characteristics of study area the jinan city is dominated by farmland and downtown areas where non point source pollutants are from agricultural and domestic activities with poorly planned settlers nearby the river these pollutants are flushed into river along with runoff the variant degree of disturbances on freshwater increases the spatial heterogeneity of cross section water temperature dissolved oxygen carbonate etc these have been implicated to be causative to the variant degree of poor quality of the river and its aquatic life kolawole et al 2011 5 3 indicator species of the principal driving factor at present the study of indicator species is only on the community scale such as fish invertebrate species phytoplankton and zooplankton wu et al 2014 liu et al 2016 findlay and shearer 1992 even if there is a study of a single species but also to study the degree of dirt tolerance such as α polysaprobic β polysaprobic α mesosaprobic β mesosaprobic oligosaprobic clear water zhao et al 2013b peng and li 2016 only few studies have been conducted on specific indicator species for specific water quality factors water quality factors have a great impact on the survival distribution and community dependence of aquatic organisms to provide a ready method for stakeholders to estimate water quality we have summarized the indicator species of the principal driving water quality factors of jinan in table 4 the indicator species was selected according to fig 3 where the more the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between a species and an environmental factor is closer to 1 the closer the relationship between the species and the environmental factor is this will allow a determination of the status of water quality factors and the health of the aquatic ecosystem which can then provide a reference for long term monitoring and control of aquatic ecosystem health in jinan our results for the species dependencies are in line with studies based on the database http www freshwaterecology info schmidt kloiber and hering 2012 schröder et al 2013 which mean the relationships between species and factors in our study are not only useful to study area but applicable elsewhere table 4 shows that h leucisculus and chironomus spp are indicative for water environmental index h leucisculus can indicate the regime of conductivity turbidity water temperature ph and total phosphorus and chironomus spp can indicate the situations of conductivity ph carbonate chloride total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen overall the research methods in this paper have great potential to make clear the factors driving spatiotemporal variation and community structure of the aquatic ecology by coupling typical monitoring stations selection dominant species determination and driving factors identification though some results were highly influenced by its regional conditions in jinan the methodologies can help policy makers and stakeholders to manage freshwater habitat by reducing discharge quantity of pollutant e g with chemical factors influencing dominant species and laying emphasis in ecological restoration on the dominant species principle driving factors and typical stations or river sections selected through our methods this will significantly improve the cost effectiveness and success rate of restoration projects 6 conclusions based on hydrological water quality and aquatic organism data obtained from nine large scale field surveys at 59 water ecological monitoring sites in jinan city from 2014 to 2016 we selected 10 typical stations by fuzzy clustering method the dominant species of fish and invertebrate species were obtained by using the identification model of aquatic dominant species combined with the canonical correspondence analysis the principal driving factors of aquatic ecosystem dependence were identified and the indicator species of the principal driving factors were selected the main conclusions are as follows 1 the 59 monitoring stations for hydrological water quality and water ecological data in jinan were divided into three clusters the stations of the middle of each cluster was selected as the typical stations 2 in the nine field investigations 58 species of bony fish were identified belonging to 7 orders 19 families and 50 genera seventy three invertebrate species were identified belonging to 3 phyla 6 classes 12 orders 26 families and 31 genera there are nine dominant species in the fish population of jinan city with a cumulative dominance of 0 838 and 20 dominant species in the invertebrate population with a cumulative dominance of 0 873 the common driving factors for fish and invertebrate communities are water depth and water temperature in addition the principal driving factors of fish communities also include flow river width conductivity turbidity carbonate chloride and the principal driving factors of invertebrate species communities also include flow velocity ph total phosphorus bicarbonate ammonia nitrogen and dissolved oxygen 3 the principal factors driving aquatic ecosystem e g total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen closely match the temporal and spatial pattern of water quality factors exceeding the maximum levels for water quality standards and can well reflect the patterns of water quality in the jinan city which in turn suggests those principal driving factors can inform the development of practical policies for ecological and water quality remediation in the study area 4 the indicator species for the principal factors driving the aquatic ecosystem dependence in jinan was selected ctenogobius brunneus and chironomus spp were more likely to appear in an environment with a high ammonia nitrogen content but m anguillicaudatus and hydropsyche spp were more likely to appear in an environment with low ammonia nitrogen content hemiculter leucisculus and chironomus spp were more likely to appear in locations with high total phosphorus content but m anguillicaudatus and hydropsyche spp were more likely to appear in locations with low total phosphorus content this study selected the typical monitoring stations based on the characteristics of temporal and spatial distribution of aquatic ecology and the factors that drive the dependence of aquatic ecosystems were analyzed in typical monitoring stations these driving factors therefore are able to accurately reflect the status and health of aquatic ecosystems for the first time we have applied these research methods to identify the driving factors of aquatic ecosystem based on aquatic organisms to china s first water ecological civilization construction pilot city this provides the route to a successful restoration of the aquatic ecosystem in jinan city and provides the scientific basis for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems in other such cities the specific results obtained in this study are valid for the investigated region only but the methodologies can provide in deep theoretical and technical directions for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems elsewhere due to the complexity of aquatic ecosystems the study of the driving factors in this paper needs to further investigate the ecosystem natural characteristics in order to better preserve and promote the health of the aquatic ecosystems some results in this paper were preliminarily qualitative and therefore quantitative research with the
