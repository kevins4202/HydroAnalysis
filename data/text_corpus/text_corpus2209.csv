11045,water rights and corresponding markets work to address water scarcity by establishing tradable limited access permits to water resources under certain water rights law rights holders face uncertainty in terms of right allocation value which is set annually based on reservoir storage expected inflow and expected future conditions such is the case in the elqui valley chile where the economy is driven by agriculture which requires water rights to ensure profitable yields due to a mismatch between the season of precipitation may august and growing season september april perennial crop farmers address allocation uncertainty by securing additional water a farm scale agro economic demand modelling framework is developed which utilizes the temporary transferability of rights to describe how grape famers may engage optimally in water markets to maximize annual profits 2000 2015 and produces an upper bound on grape farmer price negotiation space for desired allocation transactions the results show grape farmers holding 1 0 and 2 25 water rights per hectare could increase expected profits by 98 and 27 respectively by engaging optimally in the temporary water market over the period evaluated a grape farmer holding a single water right may expect to engage in market activity 80 of years two rights require farmers to engage during 30 of years with seven rights market engagement is avoided the broader insights of the research suggest where rights holders accurately assess the value of water optimal engagement strategies can be developed that add to farm scale profitability and act as an assessment of whether existing rights ownership matches risk tolerance keywords tradable allocation optimal surplus 1 introduction adaptive water resources and agricultural management strategies must be developed collaboratively to address increasing hydrologic uncertainty while much research has been dedicated to top down water resources management decision making integrated water resources management iwrm strategic vision planning svp and other structured water resources planning guidance suggest an equal bottom up effort is warranted to inform agricultural decision making processes at the farm scale röckstrom 2000 dungumaro and madulu 2003 loucks et al 2005 palmer et al 2013 watson 2014 in regions with temporal mismatches between growing and wet season which may render rain fed cropping unfeasible farmers must act to secure adequate supplies of water to optimize crop production where surface water resources can be relied upon to provide for irrigated agriculture water rights as a means of efficient centralized allocation decision making have emerged bjornlund and mckay 2002 crase et al 2004 zaeske and krishnamurthy 2017 laws governing the distribution ability to buy and sell and whether the allocation value of a right is fixed or uncertain and determined by water availability play a central role in rights holder decision making for some regions already managed through water rights entitlements or allocations e g australia chile and mexico and those with emergent water law and markets roson 2017 uncertainty in allocation value is a function of natural climate variability and may increase with longer lead time from the allocation issuance date rosegrant and renato gazmuri 1995 freebairn and quiggin 2006 grantham and viers 2014 syme 2014 delorit et al 2017a b in these regions water allocations are determined using a combination of reservoir storage expected inflow and expected future conditions decisions are made by the reservoir manager but the uncertainty is predominantly held by the water right holder and usually in the form of reduced allocations delorit et al 2017a b allocation decisions may not be truly reflective of the reservoir s ability to supply for legal structures where the annual per right allocation value is uncertain and subject to available supply and transaction of rights permanent and or temporary is permissible rights holders may choose to engage in water rights market to secure additional or sell surplus water bjornlund and mckay 2002 zaeske and krishnamurthy 2017 when in need of additional supply the core of the farmer s decision is choosing to engage in the water rights market only when water may be obtained at a cost inclusive of other production inputs which is less than the expected profit simply the marginal benefits of participating in the market must be greater than the marginal costs or expected losses if plant kill is expected to optimize market engagement water right holding farmers must understand the complex interactions of water allocations crop phenology and markets for inputs water fertilizer labor and outputs amalgamating these complex interactions to evaluate farm scale water resource decision making as a means of satisfying demand for bottom up water resources management planning warrants further study 1 1 the chilean water code of 1981 and water markets chile s 1981 water code wc applies free market economic principles to surface water resources management and establishes the framework by which water rights are governed the wc was initially viewed somewhat positively and celebrated by some as a successful application of coasean economics rosegrant and binswanger 1994 holden and thobani 1996 briscoe et al 1998 hearne and donoso 2014 molinos senante et al 2016 chikozho and kujinga 2017 most notably the world bank and international food policy and research institute ifpri have recommended the wc as a model for international water resources management reform particularly for developing countries the coase theorem in terms of water markets postulates that regardless of the initial allocation of water rights among profit maximizing agents trading of rights will result in pareto efficiency provided transaction costs are low preferably non existent that is parties will naturally bargain the most mutually beneficial outcome provided rights ownership is secure and transactions are allowed by law the pillars of the coase theorem are written into the wc and stipulate that the distribution of rights from the chilean federal government to perspective rights holders be costless each right initially endowed free of cost to prospective water rights holders is equally valued in terms of its written mean annual maximum flow there is no hierarchy of ownership the annual allocation value can vary unlike other markets in which it is fixed and is set using a combination of reservoir storage expected inflow and expected future conditions simply each water right carries with it a written value equal to all water rights within a given basin the annual allocation value delivered may not exceed the written value but may be less dependent upon storage and expectations of future conditions aside from nominal fees paid to maintain canals the allocation is provided without cost water rights can be sold permanently or leased temporarily by their owner ideally in exchange for compensation the wc is crafted to limit institutional barriers to transactions to provide for a rapid reallocation of rights to the most economically efficient use hearne and donoso 2014 borgias and bauer 2017 burgos 2017 delorit and block 2018 permanent transactions occur over longer periods of time and may describe macro scale market trends e g transfers of rights over years from agriculture to mining as it becomes more profitable than agriculture opposingly temporary transactions account for finer seasonal scale efficiencies e g a market price differential increase generates transfers from one crop type farmer to another and may generally be preferred because of the annual uncertainty of the value assigned to water rights while celebrated by some since its implementation the wc has been the subject of some social and environmental and many economic criticisms which are repeated throughout literature bauer 1998 bauer 2004 borgias and bauer 2017 brehm and quiroz 1995 donoso 2006 hearne and william easter 1995 ríos and quiroz 1995 burgos 2017 1 ownership uncertainty a rights holder registries are either incomplete or inconsistent and many rights and transfers are not recorded this makes permanent and or temporary transfers between buyer and seller difficult if not impossible i this implies property rights while perhaps initially 1981 well defined are no longer certain b therefore rights holder decision making is hampered because they cannot accurately assess social benefits and economic efficiency of rights use due to a lack of accurate information in the water rights holder registry the holder is thus unable to determine a fair market value of their right i economic equilibrium cannot be achieved where the value of the resource is disputed rights holders may choose to retain their right while a more economically efficient use may exist this is partially because water is not priced in chile there is no benchmark to which permanent and temporary water right sale prices may be calibrated c although permanent transactions are uncommon due to the uncertainty of the registry rights holders seek to sell more water than they are entitled to all permanent transactions require a legal rights study and discrepancies in ownership may increase the length of time and the cost required to complete a transaction d spillover volumes are claimed by others this has created a classic freerider issue and has led to conflict between right holders particularly when rights are sold or leased temporarily this issue may be present but is possible only when the point of extraction changes e the chilean ministry of public works dirrecion de aguas dga the federal agency mandated by the wc to oversee management of surface waters has limited ability to mediate more often administrative courts generally unfamiliar with the wc decide ownership disputes f investment in conveyance infrastructure has been deferred system losses are estimated between 20 40 2 transaction and water right purchase costs 3 there are transaction costs beyond agreed upon sale price common costs include permitting right registration and water inspection by dga rights holders in many cases must hire legal counsel to assist with these matters at additional cost there is no consensus over the magnitude of these costs furthermore the market price of permanent water rights dependent upon the basin have risen between 40 and 240 1986 2000 which has led to increased temporary leasing of water rights de la luz domper 2009 these findings suggest that since the time the wc was initially enacted the mechanisms required for the free market equilibrium to be achieved and maintained have eroded ornot developed organically the invisible hand as intended further the contrasting evaluations of wc performance and the fact that it is relatively unchanged in nearly 40 years at least in terms of water markets suggests that sweeping institutional level policy changes that would address the inefficiencies discussed here are unlikely to be considered pahl wostl 2006 cosens and gunderson 2018 as evidence the majority of interdisciplinary research targeted at rectifying economic inefficiencies of chilean water markets prescribes only national scale policy changes which have not been adopted hearne and william easter 1995 1997 bauer 2010 burgos 2017 borgias and bauer 2017 moreover very few give direct focus to the more active temporary market for water rights thus an alternative approach to water market performance improvement that functions within the constraints of existing water law and targets water right holder interactions may be necessary 1 2 study area the elqui river valley the semi arid elqui river valley of north central chile fig 1 is selected for evaluation as it experiences many of the economic inefficiencies discussed above hearne and william easter 1995 young et al 2009 contends with a high degree of inter annual hydrologic variability verbist et al 2010 robertson et al 2014 delorit et al 2017a b and possesses the agricultural and per water right allocation data necessary to conduct an optimization of temporary water right market engagement strategy cai 2008 de la luz domper 2009 zunino et al 2009 delorit and block 2018 the elqui valley rises 5000 m from sea level in the span of 150 km east to the andes and the boarder with argentina is just south of the atacama desert and 500 km due north of santiago the valley area 10 000 square kilometers is relatively small with 600 000 inhabitants mostly engaged in agriculture drawing water resource needs almost entirely from the river which is fed predominantly by summer october january runoff from the el tapado glacier and snow melt from the previous winter may august precipitation in the valley exhibits large interannual variability with most of the 90 millimeter average annual total falling between may and august years of above and below normal precipitation are generally associated with the el niño and la niña phases of el niño southern oscillation respectively and both correlate highly with summer growing season streamflow verbist et al 2010 1 2 1 water system and market to manage the interannual variability in streamflow for agricultural production the chilean ministry of public works built the puclaro reservoir in 1997 with a storage capacity of 200 million cubic meters since completion puclaro has been managed by a single privately held water user association wua junta de vigilancia del rio elqui y sus afluentes jvre the jvre is responsible for ensuring delivery of water to the mouths of nearly 120 water channel association and water community owned and maintained canals which are comprised of water rights holding individuals and firms who share a common irrigation canal from which individual allocations are drawn and used these associations and communities along with jvre are wuas the elqui river valley has approximately 25 000 fully allocated acciones each not to exceed 1 liter per second average annually the jvre is responsible for setting the per accion annual allocation value on september 1st and uses puclaro s existing storage and estimates of expected inflow acciones are not the same as water rights although each is a function of the other in chile water rights can exceed 1 liter per second but when summed across the elqui valley can be expressed in accione equivalent units because acciones and water rights are translatable acciones are the basis for the expression of the annual allocation value assigned by jvre and acciones is not a universal term we proceed using water rights as a surrogate for acciones during the most recent drought 2012 2015 allocation values fell below 0 20 liters per second according to jvre well below the 0 50 liters per second long term average donoso 2006 water market engagement through permanent or temporary transactions is the mechanism by which water is secured permanent transactions are those in which a water right is sold in perpetuity in addition to the agreed upon sale price of the right administrative costs detailed above are incurred the record of transactions in the elqui valley is incomplete however surveys of rights holders conclude permanent rights transactions are less common than temporary transactions and occur mostly for small quantities of water and between similar use types e g farmer to farmer hearne and william easter 1995 maestu 2012 bauer 2015 chikozho and kujinga 2017 temporary transactions are more informal as they do not require legal documentation and coordination occurs only between the buyer seller and jvre to reallocate transaction price length and or volume are negotiated provided right ownership is not disputed donoso 2006 hearne and donoso 2014 molinos senante et al 2016 jvre tracks only the water transfer and does not maintain records of temporary transaction price the market for temporary transactions is active personal communications jvre and has not been investigated in terms of farm scale economic impact and is the central focus of this work evidence suggests that temporary transactions occur with regularity both on an intra canal and inter canal basis in terms of both flow and volume although data to support this claim is limited to maximize profits farmers must decide when the prospective benefit of procuring water outweighs the cost molinos senante et al 2016 use a water use efficiency metric and find that farmers who trade in water markets in the limari valley immediately south of the elqui valley are more efficient in their water use than their counterparts who do not trade they conclude that agricultural water productivity rises when farmers interact in water market using non radial data envelopment other recent analyses applied to regions beyond but with water law similar to chile have investigated both how water rights holders might adapt to increasing drought frequency by developing trading strategies based on categorical supply likelihoods adamson et al 2017 and how forward contracts might improve water allocation efficiency where spot market mispricing and inequality in basin wealth challenge market efficiency bayer and loch 2017 1 2 2 agricultural production and economy most wuas consist of farmers using surface sprinkler and drip irrigation systems as such agricultural exports lead the valley s economy with grapes 12 of elqui valley irrigated area and other perennial fruit and vegetable crops holding the highest value yet accounting for only 21 of the total irrigated area zunino et al 2009 chile s office of agricultural policies and studies odepa keeps basin scale records for crops arriving at market weight and corresponding price but only for those crops with a meaningful market presence and value market statistics for elqui produced grapes have been tracked by odepa since 1995 no other elqui produced crop possess a similarly long and complete record in 2015 the elqui produced 14 35 metric tons and 9 million chilean pesos clp on a per hectare basis in addition the mean price of elqui valley grapes in chilean markets have been variable coefficient of variation 0 47 between 2000 and 2015 additional discussion of market data is provided in the data collection section of this paper aside from grapes approximately 30 crop types are cultivated regularly in the elqui valley of the nearly 30 000 ha reported as planted and irrigated the mean distribution of each crop is 4 of the total irrigated area grapes 12 and potatoes 24 are planted most widely while the next most prevalent crop green beans represent only 7 of the total area planted crops planted on an annual basis are predominantly planted downstream of puclaro 91 of all annual crops while grapes are planted mostly upstream of puclaro 85 of all grapes and account for 59 of all hectares planted upstream while grapes are a potentially lucrative crop for elqui valley farmers the perennial vines are at risk to failure in years where allocation values are low a full description of cropping patterns within the elqui valley is provided in zunino et al 2009 unlike annual crop farmers who may choose whether and what to plant grape and other perennial crop farmers are tied to their cropping decisions for up to 50 years and face a 3 year yield latency if drought vine kill forces replanting verdegaal et al 2016 due to the volatile nature of the grape market the distinct risks faced by grape producers in years of drought and the uncertainty of annual water allocation values a key input to grape production farmers can take advantage of transfers to secure additional water to protect their vineyards and maximize profits nagues et al 2016 for these reasons coupled with the spatial and economic dominance and the length and completeness of the record of elqui produced grapes they are selected for analysis of water trading in the elqui valley 2 objectives many of the studies that have targeted water system reforms both in chile and other regions where strong water law has emerged but not resulted in system efficiency focus on institutional level interventions based on coarse market scale analyses hearne and donoso 2014 molinos senante et al 2016 burgos 2017 chikozho and kujinga 2017 bayer and loch 2017 here we abstract from a market scale analysis and develop a water demand derivation framework using a coupled agro econ model to assess when and how aggressively perennial crop farmers should engage in temporary market activity to maximize profit regardless of initial rights ownership using grape farmers in the elqui valley as a case study the demand framework proposed here may hold the potential for application to market scale analyses and may be combined with additional crop type water demand models to assess supply and demand interactions to provide a more complete analysis of inter farmer trade potential temporary market transactions are the focus of this work because jvre has stated the market for temporary transactions is active although market informality prevents the development of a price revealing mechanism additionally temporary transactions may be preferred by water rights holders due to the fact the uncertain nature of the annual per water right allocation means optimization may require annual market engagement depending on initial rights ownership as such the remainder of this paper addresses the following question given that temporary water markets lack a price revealing mechanism can a comprehensive framework be developed such that a farmer may assess a a the economic value of their initial allocation i e crop yield sold at market and b determine the amount of water they need to produce maximum economic or optimal yield and its fair market value in the temporary water market the answers to these questions have the potential to equip farmers with information to confidently engage with willing sellers that is because the market lacks a price revealing mechanism price uncertainty may dissuade potential buyers and sellers from entering the water market precisely because they have little idea of a feasible price to buy or sell the market scale effect of price uncertainty is latent or unrealized trade which moves the water market away from efficiency by creating a farm scale water demand model that defines water s value at the initial allocation and optimal allocation a range of profitable water market engagement scenarios is developed 3 methodology to approach modeling a farmer s optimal decision path to maximizing expected profit utilizing temporary transactions it is prudent to begin by framing the problem in economic terms this work treats grape farmers as agents seeking to make efficient decisions which maximize their expected profits considering the levels and costs of inputs which are expected during the cropping season to optimize farmers must understand how the cumulative water allocation they will receive per right allocation times the number of rights currently owned is likely to be converted to grape yield based upon an estimate of potential grape yield and expected market price gross expected profit can be calculated from which fixed and variable expected costs of operation must be subtracted to obtain net expected profit by calculating net expected profit for a range of possible per right allocation values an optimal frontier of net expected profits can be presented as a farmer s decision space calculating the marginal benefits associated with yield increase from additional water a farmer s total willingness to pay twtp for water can be determined the twtp can be used as a decision rule by which farmers engage in the water market this methodology is achieved by coupling a crop water model with an economic model 3 1 crop water model describing the dynamic and non linear biologic relationship between water and grape yield is a critical step in constructing a model linking agricultural production to farm level profit and ultimately to optimal water market engagement by a farmer crop water modeling is used to calculate maximum grape yield and the corresponding sufficient water allocation equivalent to the crop water requirement cwr as well as to simulate yields for observed per water right allocation values with these parameters regression techniques are used to derive a biologic relationship between water and yield response hoffman et al 2018 oguntunde et al 2018 jin et al 2018 several crop water productivity models i e aquacrop ceres cropsyst cropwat gcwm dssat and other similar models have been developed to simulate crop yield response in herbaceous plants hunink and droogers 2010a b ovando et al 2018 beveridge et al 2018 the land and water division of the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations aquacrop raes et al 2009 is a crop water model known for linking crop water and climate interactions and is built to achieve a reasonable balance of accuracy simplicity and robustness according to the fao aquacrop is widely used and has been continuously updated by the fao version 6 1 was released in may 2018 raes et al 2018 its ability to reproduce observed yield has been proven by agronomists which is supported by a review of recent literature jones et al 2017 nyathi et al 2018 ran et al 2018 tan et al 2018 tsakmakis et al 2019 xu et al 2019 yet vine phenology is not well explored in open source crop models as most models are intended for use with herbaceous annual crop varieties rather than perennial vine or wood crops the only example of modelled grape production encountered in peer reviewed literature was that of hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b who used aquacrop while hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b provides many grape phenology parameters personal communications between the authors and hunink yielded additional information necessary to parameterize aquacrop such that reliable results are achieved aquacrop is design with a user interface and parameterization menus that allow users to create and populate four module components to simulate location specific climate crop characteristics management techniques and soil parameters sub modules for management techniques irrigation and field management and soil parameters profile and groundwater are also utilized location specific climate requires daily data for rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and reference evapotranspiration eto elqui valley wide precipitation and temperature data daily 1950 present are readily available through the chilean dga data from the algarrobal streamflow gauge on the elqui river serves as inflow for the puclaro reservoir and is near much of the grape production eto is calculated using the modified hargreaves equation eq 1 1 e t o 0 0023 0 408 r a t a v g 17 8 t d 0 5 where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 obtained from tables hargreaves 1994 droogers and allen 2002 and is multiplied by the constant 0 408 to convert to millimeters t a v g is average mean daily temperature in degrees celsius and t d is the daily temperature range the remaining constants are calculated by hargreaves et al 1985 the crop characteristics module requires use of a pre built crop profile or user specified phenology aquacrop is built primarily for crop yield simulation of herbaceous crops however hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b construct a grape crop profile for aquacrop which skillfully reproduces expected grape yields using the same critical crop characteristics an elqui valley grape crop profile is created major parameters are shown in table 1 as adapted from hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b the irrigation management sub module allows for selection of irrigation technique and whether crop yield simulation will be based upon 1 the net irrigation requirement analogous to cwr determination 2 generation of an irrigation schedule daily distribution of water which results in cwr or 3 user specification of an irrigation schedule generation of an irrigation schedule is selected to determine the grape cwr and corresponding unconstrained yield while user specification of the irrigation schedule is selected to simulate yields for annual per water right allocation values when the irrigation schedule is specified by the user the average annual per right allocation value is uniformly distributed to a daily scale per the historical monthly distribution of the right 72 of annual allocation value is typically distributed september march personal communications jvre the per right allocation value for the elqui valley is calculated using outflow from the puclaro reservoir as measured at the almendral streamflow gauge station 3 km below puclaro less base flow the irrigation method used by most grape farmers in the elqui valley is drip irrigation the field management sub module allows for specification of mulching and other soil preparation techniques intended to enhance yield production no advanced techniques of in and off season soil preparation are assumed here which is consistent with practices in the elqui valley in the soil and groundwater profile sub modules two soil horizons are specified for the elqui valley which replicates in situ conditions at elevations where grapes are grown soils are a clay sand and gravel mix with the proportion of gravel increasing from 10 80 from the surface to 1 2 m groundwater is set to an inaccessible depth melendez 1979 after the modules are populated simulations are conducted for 1999 2015 puclaro came online in 1999 with harvest set at march 15th cwr and corresponding yield pairings are calculated along with annual yields corresponding to the per right specified irrigation schedule aquacrop produces per hectare pairings of water input and yield output for the elqui valley this is described as the yield in dry metric tons corresponding to a case in which a farmer holds some number of water rights which provide an allocation equal to the annual irrigation value dry tons are converted to fresh yield by dividing by 0 20 which recognizes grapes as containing 20 dry and 80 wet matter hunink and droogers 2010a b most grapes produced in the elqui are brought to market before processing and market prices are reported by odepa in fresh yields it is widely accepted that grapevines are naturally long lived 100 years and in terms of production for alcohol old vines are often preferred for fruit quality lasko et al 2003 robinson et al 2013 in addition the high cost associated with vineyard replacement planting and maintenance trellis systems foregone yield drives farmers to avoid allocations which might result in vine kill 3 2 yield regression model crop yield response to water is a non linear process with yield dependent on both how much and when water is applied steduto et al 2012 the yield and per water right allocation paring outputs from aquacrop exhibit this relationship there are many approaches to yield calibration the purpose of this research is to produce a coupled farm scale agro econ model thus an approach approximating the continuous relationship between water and yield is viewed as sufficient for interpretability stone and schlegel 2006 hsiao et al 2009 a simple regression of allocation value onto yield is selected this relationship holds to the point where the cwr is achieved beyond the cwr any additional application of water results in no increase in grape yield 3 3 agro economic model coupled agricultural and economic models optimize production of farmed goods and can be manipulated to determine the shadow value of production inputs while agro economic models are useful for producing optimal outcomes they are subject to both limitations that apply to all models as approximations of reality and specifically limitations tied to models of coupled human natural systems just 2003 cai 2008 griffith et al 2009 harou et al 2009 there are three major classes of agro economic optimization models designed to handle the complexities of coupled human natural systems which are used to determine the shadow value of water in agricultural production modular holistic and computable general equilibrium models brouwer and hofkes 2008 holistic and computable models are top down and are best suited for evaluating sectoral level policy changes i e tariffs and taxes while modular approaches are bottom up and target localized changes to production in this work a modular framework is used as the level of concern is at the farm scale bottom up and because the crop water and economic models do not interact directly that is the outputs of the crop water model may be thought of as exogenous inputs to the economic model linking grape yield as a function of water to the costs of production and profits using a modular approach allows for estimation of the water s value to a farmer there is a rich body of literature investigating farmer decision making which predominantly points toward risk averse behavior under uncertainty gómez limón et al 2003 just 2003 gardebroek et al 2010 nagues et al 2016 some studies suggest farmers seek to maximize their von neumann morgenstern utility function holding farmers as both risk and downside averse others suggest a spectrum of risk attitudes exists within farmer communities especially where farmers are economically stratified ziervogel et al 2005 kosovac et al 2017 however to our knowledge there are no studies eliciting grape farmer risk attitudes in the elqui valley in addition an important component of this research aims to evaluate economically stratified grape farmer behavior manifested here as differences in permanent water rights endowment thus rather than apply the von neumann morgenstern utility function a more simplistic approach which treats farmers as risk neutral maximizing expected profits for their water right endowment is applied here the model evaluates varied permanent water rights ownership strategies a realistic response to allocation uncertainty by perennial crop type farmers rather than specify a risk attitude farmers are able to match their ownership to expected profit and market engagement outcomes and decide whether their water rights ownership matches their risk attitude in water rights managed basins perennial crop farmers lack crop type decision flexibility their annual crop type farmer counterparts possess e g farmers making annual crop type decisions can choose to plant drought tolerant crops in years of low allocation thus the primary mechanism available to grape and other perennial crop type farmers to cope with allocation uncertainty is to secure additional water the model is purposefully simplistic and is intended to balance complexity and interpretability of results focused specifically on identifying both the frequency of expected temporary water market engagement and expected gains from trade across the endowment scenarios the basic model is constructed such that a set of expected annual optimal net profits are calculated for the range of feasible per right allocation values 0 05 1 varied by 0 05 liters per second for which expected yields are achieved eq 2 2 max e π t w e p t e y t w i 1 n e c i t e q i t w e f e e s t t 2000 2015 where e π t w is expected net profit clp per hectare for each feasible water right allocation value w in year t e p t is the march mean market price clp per metric ton of grapes in year t e y t w is the expected yield metric tons per hectare of grapes produced for each feasible water right allocation value w in year t e c i t is the expected cost of input i in year t e q i t w is the quantity of input i for each feasible water right allocation value w in year t and e f e e s t is the expected per right administrative fees paid to the jvre and water community or canal association in year t and are unaffected by allocation value in simplified form the objective function may be written as expected profit equal to expected benefits less the sum of actual costs where π t w is maximized across feasible values of w for each year the corresponding yield is referred to as the maximum economic yield mey which is the yield level at which net profit total revenue minus total cost are maximized mey is also known as optimum yield per water right allocation values w are always subscripts w is used to describe the range of feasible per water right allocation values but can also take on specific values e g water required to achieve a desired level of profit for any variable that has w is a subscript e g q i t w the variable s value will correspond to the allocation value assigned to w ultimately w is a subscript even though w may not appear as a subscript in the calculation expected profit is constrained by yield and variable input costs expected yield is a polynomial fit of yield and corresponding water right allocation value pairings to the cwr above the cwr yield is maximized comas et al 2019 labor and fertilizer are modeled as a variable input costs expected cost per unit c i t is exogenously determined however the quantity of each input is modeled as a constant return to scale which suggests an increasing level of input results in a proportional increase in output eqs 3 4 3 e q l a b o r t w 6 q l m a x e y t w e y m a x 4 e q f e r t t w q f m a x e y t w e y m a x where e q l a b o r t w is the labor required hours to achieve the corresponding e y t w 6 q l m a x is the seasonal labor requirement hours that achieves expected maximum yield e y m a x and the ratio of e y t w to e y m a x forces the labor requirement to be proportional to the expected yield q l m a x is set at 165 h per month verdegaal et al 2016 the fertilizer constraint e q f e r t t w kilograms per hectare follows a similar technique to achieve a corresponding e y t w q f m a x is the fertilizer application weight required to maximize yield and is set to 504 kg per hectare faostat 2015 3 4 farm scale profit model the agro econ model produces annual optimal pairings of expected profit and water allocations on a per hectare basis using a polynomial regression applied to each year truncated to the cwr and corresponding profit for each year simulated the optimal expected profit corresponding to the per right allocation value calculated based upon streamflow at almendral is used to establish a base case where a farmer holds one water right for a single hectare from the base case alternative scenarios can be simulated in which farmers procure additional rights to achieve the cwr and maximize profit insight gained from these simulations include the minimum number of rights required to achieve mey and farmer total willingness to pay twtp for water deficit eq 5 5 t w t p t π me y t π w t o b s where π m e y t is calculated as the maximum expected profit achievable in year t and π w t o b s is the optimal expected profit achieved by yield produced with the year t observed per water right allocation w t o b s the twtp represents the most a farmer should be willing to pay to secure water fertilizer and labor required to achieve mey such that the cost of procuring the inputs is equal to the additional profit received the optimization is completed by forming a lagrangian of the expected profit maximizing objective and the input cost constraints the model calculates the marginal value λ t clp per hectare of a one ton yield increase for each year for each constraint including yield response to water to determine the value of the water that corresponds to λ t the water required to

reported by odepa the aquacrop climate submodule includes atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations as measured at mauna loa which produce a slight positive linear trend in yield pearson s correlation

demand for water for each year 2000 2015 potential per right water allocation value and ensuing yield the agro econ model calculates the optimal level of the present value of gross profits costs production and optimal net present value of expected profit hereafter referred to as optimal profit optimal expected profit is the largest profit a farmer could obtain at any per water right allocation value the set of annual optimal profit values forms an optimized frontier from which a farmer can assess the level of optimal expected profit that can be achieved given a single water right and subsequently contrast it with the expected annual mey profit level fig 4 the shape and vertical magnitude of the optimized frontier is annually variable and dominated by the market price of grapes the optimal expected profit at mey is upper limit of the value of water as a function of grape yield unrealized expected profit resulting from holding a suboptimal number of water rights is calculated as vertical difference between the mey expected profit and optimal expected profit for the actual per right allocation for a given year concurrently the additional water required to achieve the mey profit in any given year is the difference between 0 7 liters per second and the actual observed allocation value this represents a farmer s tradeoffs between expected profit and water procurement for example in 2000 securing 0 34 liters per second less than 1 additional water right increases per hectare expected profit by 10 million clp in contrast for 2012 0 51 liters per second greater than 2 5 additional water rights results in per hectare expected profit increases of 3 million clp mey expected profit variability for these years is explained by the fact that elqui valley produced grapes were nearly eight times more valuable in chilean markets in 2000 than 2012 to achieve mey expected profits grape farmers must also optimize the flow of water procured in the water market during years of deficiency the optimal procurement strategy is calculated as the horizontal distance between the observed annual per right allocation value and the cwr the efficient pathway to mey expected profit in terms of whole water rights is simply the number of water rights required to reach the cwr given the value of the annual allocation viewed retrospectively over the simulation period a farmer might choose to seek permanent transactions consistent with a level of risk tolerance eliminating necessary leasing through the water market fig 5 a single water right per hectare provides mey profits for 20 of years between 2000 and 2015 while a second water right secures mey profits for an additional 50 of the period of record not until seven rights are owned has a farmer obtained sufficient water to avoid temporary procurement in the market for the 16 years evaluated holding seven water rights is suboptimal and results in instances of surplus which the profit maximizing farmer should seek to sell assesments of rights procurement strategy and corresponding potential expected profit gains are informative but not sensitive to diminishing marginal utility of water tranformed to yield and ultimately to expected profit that is the difference between mey expected profit and optimal expected profit for the actual per right allocation is representative only of the potential gross gains from procuring water and indicates nothing about the cost farmers should be willing to pay for the water establishing the utility of water in terms of per right allocation fig 6 a and demand fig 6b has the potential to provide farmers a more realistic estimate of the cost at which water should be procured the utility of water u w exhibits an exponentially increasing trend eq 11 consistent with expected behavior griffin 2006 this suggests as the per right allocation value increases the profit potential utility increases 11 u w 2 10 7 w t 1 4752 the demand schedule d w describes diminishing marginal utility and is defined by the negative second derivative of the utility function 2 u w 2 and given by eq 12 griffin 2006 the constant subtracted from the demand function constrains the price of water to be zero at the cwr the area under the demand curve fig 6b from the observed per right allocation value to the cwr is the twtp for water required to achieve mey profit on a per hectare basis here for the twtp for water as the observed allocation rises the value farmers attach to water required to reach mey decreases 12 d w u 2 w 2 1 4 10 7 w t 0 52 1 69 10 7 the range over which per water right allocations result in measurable yields 0 05 liters per second 1 0 liters per second provides a lower bound at which the crop water model indicates allocations result in vine kill below 0 05 liters per second although observed allocation values never violate this threshold and likely jvre would work to provide at least the amount of water required to protect against vine kill an analysis of grape farmer willingness to avoid vine kill is provided to describe the full range of the demand function grape vineyard establishment costs include planting and maintenance trellis system construction and installation irrigation fertilization and pest management verdegaal et al 2016 marketable yields are not expected for the first two growing seasons after planting and in the third year 5 tons per acre is expected before full production is anticipated utilizing an annual discount rate of 2 and accounting for foregone mean annual yields 11 76 metric tons per hectare 2000 2015 grape farmer willingness to avoid a single vine kill event net allocation less than 0 05 liters per second is 24 2 million clp thus the full extent of the demand function is revealed fig 7 5 3 analysis of rights owner expected profitability an important variable in production which is relatively unknown in the elqui valley is the distribution of rights among farmers the difference in the number of water rights held per hectare provides insight to farmer behavior expected profit potential and the requirement for market engagement to investigate the degree to which different initial water rights ownership strategies have the potential to impact grape farmer decision making two cases are developed 1 a farmer owns one hectare for which a single water right is held hereafter referred to as 1wr this ownership strategy may represent a risk accepting farmer willing to engage in the temporary water market when the per right allocation value historically at 0 5 l s on average is below what is required to maximize per hectare expected profit donoso 2006 1wr farmers should expect frequent water market engagement to achieve mey fig 5 2 a farmer owns one hectare for which 2 25 water rights are held hereafter referred to as 2 25wr the 2 25wr strategy is based on a uniform distribution of water rights to currently irrigated land area planted in grapes per zunino et al 2009 this strategy represents risk aversion relative to the 1wr strategy and it is expected these farmers will engage in market activity in less than 30 of years fig 5 in both cases farmers are profit maximizing and engage in market activity in any year where per right allocation and water rights ownership status result in a water deficit it is assumed farmers seek only temporary water transfers through the market and at the end of the year revert to their initial water right ownership status likewise sufficient water is assumed available in the market such that farmers can procure enough to achieve mey however a farmer only purchases water if the twtp for the water a function of potential increases in profit is less than the point at which the cost of production exceeds profit such that profit after market engagement must be exceed initial expected profit evaluating water surplus and deficit in terms of cwr illustrates how initial rights holdings are affected by inter annual variability and the relationship correlation between allocation and observed storage in puclaro pearson correlation coefficient 0 76 fig 8 a for the 1wr case water deficit occurs in 13 of the 16 years requiring market engagement to achieve mey in contrast the 2 25wr scenario results in relative surplus and market engagement is only required during a four year period of the 2009 2015 drought the largest deficits in both scenarios occur during the prolonged drought 2012 2015 when observed allocations were 0 20 liters per second personal communication jvre to measure the effect procuring water at the twtp has on profit a baseline scenario in which no water market engagement occurs is evaluated as expected expected profits fig 8b for both the 1wr and 2 25wr cases are substantially reduced without market engagement fig 8c aggregating across the 16 years on a per hectare basis for the 1wr case 58 66 million clp of mey potential profit is foregone while 26 28 million clp is foregone for the 2 25wr case the difference in optimal expected profit between 1wr and 2 25wr t 2000 2015 π 2 25 w r π 1 w r is 37 million clp indicating farmers initially holding 2 25 water rights make substantially larger profits when both do not engage in the water market if full market engagement is allowed including temporarily buying and selling water rights annually expected profit increases for both the 1wr and 2 25wr cases for all years where the per water right allocation value does not allow for mey to be obtained without market engagement the twtp is less than the potential gains which prompts trading expected profits post engagement are given by eq 9 see above and shown by fig 9 a b gains from market engagement are significant in both cases with post market engagement optimal expected profit difference of 14 5 million clp compared to 37 million clp without market engagement which suggests that there is both a benefit to market engagement and that given adequate market supply trading closes the expected profit gap between farmers with different rights holding strategies table 2 the analysis assumes an adequate supply of rights exists in the temporary market such that 1wr and 2 25wr holders would bargain and secure the optimal number of rights at the twtp profits for 1wr nearly double despite high twtp costs in drought years 2009 2014 in 2012 the combined effect of the below average per right allocation value 0 19 liters per second and below average grape market prices 252 thousand clp per metric ton make profits gained by market engagement nearly equal the potential profit gains for the 1wr case in contrast for 2013 2015 the per right allocation continues to decrease 0 12 liters per second average while grape market prices rebound 637 thousand clp per metric ton by 2015 which provides increased incentive to engage in the water market resulting in nearly ten fold increases in profit for both the 1wr and 2 25wr cases the drastic difference between potential outcomes 2012 verses 2013 2015 suggests farmer decisions should be based on an agro economic approach 6 discussion and conclusion the framework presented here creates a mechanism by which the fair market value of water to grape farmers is revealed by coupling yield response to water with profit maximization it addresses both components of the objective as it describes optimal behavior under initial per water right allocations and pathways to maximum economic yield mey attained through optimal market engagement the analysis indicates that for the period 2000 2015 optimal market engagement by farmers holding 1 and 2 25 water rights per hectare could increase per hectare profits by up to 98 45 mill chilean pesos and 27 22 mill chilean pesos respectively market engagement occurs only when a positive difference between profit at mey and profit at the initial allocation value exists and when a farmer s total willingness to pay for the additional water is less than the difference however this study reveals that water market engagement could be vigorous if farmers used an agro economic framework to assess the value of water for example farmers holding a single water right should seek to engage in market activity each year 2000 2015 due to the fact input costs fertilizer labor and fees even at their highest levels are insignificant in comparison to the market price of grapes further an assessment of initial water rights ownership and profit potential illustrates how farmers might act to secure permanent rights to manage the degree to which they engage in the temporary market over the period evaluated rights holders with a single right can expect to engage in market activity in 80 of years increasing ownership to two rights requires farmers to engage during 30 of years and with seven rights market engagement is avoided completely the analysis reveals a water price negotiation space available to grape farmers where there is a demand based incentive to enter the water market in any year where the per right allocation and initial rights ownership combination result in yields below mey calculating the annual difference between profit achieved with mey and profit at the pre trade per water right allocation value equips the farmer with a profit and cost sensitive estimate of the fair market value or total willingness to pay twtp for a water right used as an input to grape production the twtp derived from the demand function represents an upper bound of the fair market value of water and allows the buyer to frame their negotiation space or range of acceptable water prices the negotiation space is thus the difference between water received free of charge and the twtp thus a grape farmer should be willing to pay any value within the negotiation space for the allocation of water which allows them to achieve benefits up to mey contrastingly economic logic suggests farmers with excess water or an initial endowment beyond the cwr have no incentive to retain it applying excess irrigation to grapes in exceedance of the crop water requirement cwr is wasteful and has the potential to damage the crop thus the marginal benefit of water beyond the cwr is zero and theoretically excess water could be relinquished without cost however market activity indicates sales of excess water do occur where at least two growers competitively seek water the price for which excess water should be sold is not addressed here and can be investigated to further analyze optimal market engagement modelling water rights holders as a buyer or seller dependent upon the year and climate condition given a mean seasonal allocation 2000 2015 of 0 36 liters per second with the independent assumption that rights are uniformly distributed among hectares planted in grapes zunino et al 2009 which is embodied by the 2 25wr case the corresponding mean per hectare allocation is 0 81 liters per second this suggests farmers are responding to continuously below normal allocations by permanently buying rights which ensure that for all but the worst drought years mey is reached this is evident in the model results as shown by fig 8 b still the purported vigor of temporary transactions in the water market suggests some water rights holders have either chosen or are not able to secure permanent rights which protect against drought these are likely to be farmers of smaller vineyards holding fewer water rights per hectare than average and those unable to purchase permanent rights which have become increasingly costly to procure de la luz domper 2009 although observed allocations never fall below the vine kill threshold 0 05 liters per second a net present value calculation reveals per hectare replacement costs to be between 20 2 25 water rights per hectare and 53 1 water rights per hectare of the sum of corresponding profits over the period analyzed this result suggests grape farmers have a strong economic incentive to avoid vine kill as the expected cost of vine replacement is roughly 3 5 times greater than largest willingness to pay for allocations resulting in productive yields while the work presented here is focused only establishing a comprehensive demand derivation framework for temporary water markets it is subject to assumptions which may limit its applicability we assume rights availability in the market to be sufficient to meet annual demands of grape farmers no supply constraints or two firm analysis described above are performed here assuming each farmer in the basin across all crop types seeks to meet their crop s cwr there exists the possibility for rights supply and demand inequality in a competitive water market in the elqui hearne and william easter 1997 report that essco the private company responsible for water supply in the elqui valley s populous coastal region is expected to hold more than 2000 uninterruptible water rights by 2018 which are not considered tradable a uniform distribution of 8000 water rights among hectares planted in grapes in the elqui zunino et al 2009 suggests that roughly 15 000 rights are dedicated to other types of agriculture and other minority uses based on the assumed number of potentially tradable rights 23 000 and the feasible range of annual per water right allocation values instances of both excess and insufficient supply may occur additional research is required to investigate how farmers of different crop types perennial vs annual high vs low value might interact such that profits are optimized on a basin scale and how rights supply and demand inequality affect basin scale economic outcomes farmers are assumed to have a priori knowledge prices fertilizer and labor requirements or equivalently perfect information a season ahead forecast of per right allocation values market prices and inputs could allow farmers to make early cropping and water market decisions presumably the market price of water varies throughout the austral winter and spring prior to the date september 1st jvre sets the annual allocation value however once the allocation value is set the market price should not vary and is given by the peak demand for water streamflow forecast models could benefit from the strong relationship with the el nino southern oscillation in the elqui and market forecast model could draw on the relationship between usda reported market price of grapes aug sep and prior march chilean harvest prices pearson correlation coefficient 0 50 this warrants further investigation the water code of 1981 stipulates water rights initially be supplied free of cost which alleviates water rights holders from paying the opportunity cost of water for another perhaps superior economic use this is because dga bestows water rights based on order of application provided the use is deemed beneficial and is not permitted to bestow water rights to the applicant with the greatest expected economic use in addition water rights applicants do not necessarily consider the opportunity cost of their chosen use at the basin scale that is a farmer s intended use may not represent the best economic use a two firm economic equilibrium model may be used to determine the economically efficient distribution of water and its accompanying price a two firm model requires identification and demand derivation for at least a second crop type farmer so the potential for water trades may be addressed this is possible using the framework constructed here the treatment of farmer decision making used here is simplistic and highly stylized as to represent a basic allocation uncertainty coping strategy available to grape farmers the agro economic model component that simulates this while perhaps logical is only one of many ways farmer attitude toward risk can be formulated utilizing an alternative approach like the von neumann morgenstern utility function which holds farmers as risk averse and downside prudent could be substituted in place of the maximization of expected profits model used here and will likely produce different results the decision model only permits grape farmers to engage in temporary allocation transactions realistically economically rational farmers would consider both the expected present value of a permanent transaction and the expected annual value of temporary transfers choosing the option which holds greater value in addition the decision model requires farmers to seek transfers that span the entire growing season in the elqui valley temporary transfers can occur in many temporal configurations both in terms of flow and quantity to supplement flow as required additional research is required to address these limitations the ability to explicitly verify and validate the model is currently limited for the elqui valley for a full validation candidate farms should be identified with historical yields water rights holding and area cultivated provided odepa only tracks yield at the regional scale coquimbo contains three provinces elqui limari and choapa aggregated yield is reported and only for table grapes and only 2015 in its fruit land principal results report published in july 2015 odepa reports per hectare yields of 14 35 metric tons this result is within the range of yields produced by the crop water model which suggests the model is calibrated appropriately in addition yields calculated by the crop water model do fluctuate temporally as expected in response to the observed per water right allocation value it is not appropriate to downscale this result to the elqui valley without knowing the production of the remaining provinces in the region it does suggest however that grape farmers are likely overcoming low per water right allocation values to produce substantial yields 83 of aquacrop yield at cwr we postulate these results are achieved through the procurement of a sufficient number of water rights either permanently or temporarily which motivates this research while validation is difficult the stability of the economic model can be evaluated by reformulation using observed production input and market prices to identify which parameters the model is most sensitive this is achieved by maximizing minimum benefits and maximizing maximum costs over the retrospective period which results in a minimization of expected profit the expected maximized minimum per hectare yield gross revenue is 4 4 mill chilean pesos and occurs in 2012 the maximized expected cost of production inputs on a per hectare basis is 127 thousand chilean pesos in 2015 606 thousand chilean pesos in 2011 and 46 thousand chilean pesos in 2015 for labor fertilizer and water user association fees respectively thus resultant expected profit is 3 6 mill chilean pesos which is only 186 thousand 4 8 less than the 2012 maximum expected profit smallest maximized profit 2000 2015 this result illustrates that the market price of grapes is the dominant feature in production even in the most profit limiting case constructible using observed price information fertilizer is two to 12 5 times more expensive than labor and five to 31 times more expensive than fees in corresponding years for maximized values of each thus it is evident that fertilizer has the largest influence over expected benefits yet the cost of maximized fertilizer use is 2 11 of corresponding annual yield which further illustrates the degree to which farmer decisions are market price driven as the model is formulated in addition the allocation in 2012 while below average 0 19 liters per second μ 0 47 liters per second is still larger than the allocation in the following three years by 46 72 and 90 the grape market prices in these same years are 231 276 and 248 larger than 2012 the effects of market price and allocation value on twtp and expected profit from engagement during this period 2012 2015 are best illustrated by fig 8 noting specifically the difference in magnitude between expected benefits from optimal market engagement red line and no market engagement dashed black line in 2012 the difference is much smaller than it is in any of the following three years which suggests that even though the per water right allocation values continue to fall from 0 19 liters per second in 2012 to 0 10 liters per second in 2015 which in turn results in corresponding growth in twtp it is the market price of the grapes that is driving the magnitude of the difference between expected profit under optimal engagement and expected profit under no engagement water rights have developed as a legal mechanism by which water scarcity is addressed through the establishment of limited access permits such is the case in the elqui valley of north central chile where water rights holders face uncertainty in terms of the allocation value of a right which is set annually based on a combination of reservoir storage expected inflow and expected future conditions water rights are transferable temporarily or permanently which allows rights holders to further address allocation uncertainty by securing additional water the farm scale agro economic modelling demand framework developed here uses the temporary transferability of water rights to describe how grape farmers may seek engage optimally in water markets such that their expected annual profits are maximized this work relies of the free market economic basis of the water code to guide the selection of framework components the result is an innovative demand derivation framework which produces water price and quantity signals farmers may choose to incorporate in their agricultural decision making thereby encouraging economically driven behavior within the constraints of the existing law thus policy implications are rightfully targeted to the water right holder rather than the water code and the accompanying institutional arrangements the broader insights of the research can be summarized 1 informal temporary water markets constructed on neo liberal economic principles lack a price revealing mechanism the coupled crop water agro economic approach allows for the establishment of a price negation space and quantity farmers should seek in the temporary market this basic structure may be adapted to different crops crop models and economic models because all basins in chile are subject to the water code and temporary markets are largely informal the framework may be applied most directly the framework may also be applicable to regions where similar temporary water markets exist e g mexico australia and new zealand tietenberg 2002 bjornlund and mckay 2002 bjornlund 2003 further applications may be made where water law and associated markets are emerging as the water code has been presented by global development agencies as a positive model water managers in these regions must decide the economic basis upon which transactions can occur the framework proposed here could be used to guide the level of temporary market formality such that the inefficiencies associated with the informality of temporary markets in chile can be avoided 2 risk attitude is a well studied topic and there are many ways to model economic agents the framework presented here treats the farmer simply as a profit maximizer and provides profit and interaction information for varied water rights ownership strategies this allows the farmer to adopt the ownership and interaction strategy that aligns with their risk tolerance rather than specifying a single optimal policy 3 the framework reveals that in locations where rights holders can accurately assess the value of water in terms of its utility optimal market engagement strategies can be developed which can add to farm scale profitability and act as an assessment of whether existing rights ownership matches farmer risk tolerance farmers reliant on centrally managed water allocations as a means of obtaining adequate water supplies to irrigate crops face endogenous and exogenous uncertainties including hydrology and water allocation decision making optimal farm scale water resource decision making requires water rights holders to engage in permanent and or temporary water transactions to hedge against these uncertainties the decision making strategies proposed here presents a process by which water rights holders engaged in agriculture may make informed water market engagement decisions with limited information to maximize annual profits implementation of the approach presented here by rights holders suggests improved economic efficiency for basins where water rights markets exist is possible funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding

11045,water rights and corresponding markets work to address water scarcity by establishing tradable limited access permits to water resources under certain water rights law rights holders face

krishnamurthy 2017 when in need of additional supply the core of the farmer s decision is choosing to engage in the water rights market only when water may be obtained at a cost inclusive of other production inputs which is less than the expected profit simply the marginal benefits of participating in the market must be greater than the marginal costs or expected losses if plant kill is expected to optimize market engagement water right holding farmers must understand the complex interactions of water allocations crop phenology and markets for inputs water fertilizer labor and

study 1 1 the chilean water code of 1981 and water markets chile s 1981 water code wc applies free market economic principles to surface water resources management and establishes the framework by which water rights are governed the wc was initially viewed somewhat positively and celebrated by some as a successful application of coasean economics rosegrant and binswanger 1994 holden and thobani 1996 briscoe et al 1998 hearne and donoso 2014 molinos senante et al 2016 chikozho and kujinga 2017 most notably the world bank and international food policy and research institute ifpri have recommended the wc as a model for international water resources management reform particularly for developing countries the coase theorem in terms of water markets postulates that regardless of the initial allocation of water rights among profit maximizing agents trading of rights will result in pareto efficiency provided transaction costs are low preferably non existent that is parties will naturally bargain the most mutually beneficial outcome provided rights ownership is secure and transactions are allowed by law the pillars of the coase theorem are written into the wc and stipulate that the distribution of rights from the chilean federal government to perspective rights holders be costless each right initially endowed free of cost to prospective water rights holders is equally valued in terms of its written mean annual maximum flow there is no hierarchy of ownership the annual allocation value can vary unlike other markets in which it is fixed and is set using a combination of reservoir storage expected inflow and expected future conditions simply each water right carries with it a written value equal to all water rights within a given basin the annual allocation value delivered may not exceed the written value but may be less dependent upon storage and expectations of future conditions aside from nominal fees paid to maintain canals the allocation is provided without cost water rights can be sold permanently or leased temporarily by their owner ideally in exchange for compensation the wc is crafted to limit institutional barriers to transactions to provide for a rapid reallocation of rights to the most economically efficient use hearne and donoso 2014 borgias and bauer 2017 burgos 2017 delorit and block 2018 permanent transactions occur over longer periods of time and may describe macro scale market trends e g transfers of rights over years from agriculture to mining as it becomes more profitable than agriculture opposingly temporary transactions account for finer seasonal scale efficiencies e g a market price differential increase generates transfers from one crop type farmer to another and may generally be preferred because of the annual uncertainty of the value assigned to water rights while celebrated by some since its implementation the wc has been the subject of some social and environmental and many economic criticisms which are repeated throughout literature bauer 1998 bauer 2004 borgias and bauer 2017 brehm and quiroz 1995 donoso 2006 hearne and william easter 1995 ríos and quiroz 1995 burgos 2017 1 ownership uncertainty a rights holder registries are either incomplete or inconsistent and many rights and transfers are not recorded this makes permanent and or temporary transfers between buyer and seller difficult if not impossible i this implies property rights while perhaps initially 1981 well defined are no longer certain b therefore rights holder decision making is hampered because they cannot accurately assess social benefits and economic efficiency of rights use due to a lack of accurate information in the water rights holder registry the holder is thus unable to determine a fair market value of their right i economic equilibrium cannot be achieved where the value of the resource is disputed rights holders may choose to retain their right while a more economically efficient use may exist this is partially because water is not priced in chile there is no benchmark to which permanent and temporary water right sale prices may be calibrated c although permanent transactions are uncommon due to the uncertainty of the registry rights holders seek to sell more water than they are entitled to all permanent transactions require a legal rights study and discrepancies in ownership may increase the length of time and the cost required to complete a transaction d spillover volumes are claimed by others this has created a classic freerider issue and has led to conflict between right holders particularly when rights are sold or leased temporarily this issue may be present but is possible only when the point of extraction changes e the chilean ministry of public works dirrecion de aguas dga the federal agency mandated by the wc to oversee management of surface waters has limited ability to mediate more often administrative courts generally unfamiliar with the wc decide ownership disputes f investment in conveyance infrastructure has been deferred system losses are estimated between 20 40 2 transaction and water right purchase costs 3 there are transaction costs beyond agreed upon sale price common costs include permitting right registration and water inspection by dga rights holders in many cases must hire legal counsel to assist with these matters at additional cost there is no consensus over the magnitude of these costs furthermore the market price of permanent water rights dependent upon the basin have risen between 40 and 240 1986 2000 which has led to increased temporary leasing of water rights de la luz domper 2009 these findings suggest that since the time the wc was initially enacted the mechanisms required for the free market equilibrium to be achieved and maintained have eroded ornot developed organically the invisible hand as intended further the contrasting evaluations of wc performance and the fact that it is relatively unchanged in nearly 40 years at least in terms of water markets suggests that sweeping institutional level policy changes that would address the inefficiencies discussed here are unlikely to be considered pahl wostl 2006 cosens and gunderson 2018 as evidence the majority of interdisciplinary research targeted at rectifying economic inefficiencies of chilean water markets prescribes only national scale policy changes which have not been adopted hearne and william easter 1995 1997 bauer 2010 burgos 2017 borgias and bauer 2017 moreover very few give direct focus to the more active temporary market for water rights thus an alternative approach to water market performance improvement that functions within the constraints of existing water law and targets water right holder interactions may be necessary 1 2 study area the elqui river valley the semi arid elqui river valley of north central chile fig 1 is selected for evaluation as it experiences many of the economic inefficiencies discussed above hearne and william easter 1995 young et al 2009 contends with a high degree of inter annual hydrologic variability verbist et al 2010 robertson et al 2014 delorit et al 2017a b and possesses the agricultural and per water right allocation data necessary to conduct an optimization of temporary water right market engagement strategy cai 2008 de la luz domper 2009 zunino et al 2009 delorit and block 2018 the elqui valley rises 5000 m from sea level in the span of 150 km east to the andes and the boarder with argentina is just south of the atacama desert and 500 km due north of santiago the valley area 10 000 square kilometers is relatively small with 600 000 inhabitants mostly engaged in agriculture drawing water resource needs almost entirely from the river which is fed predominantly by summer october january runoff from the el tapado glacier and snow melt from the previous winter may august precipitation in the valley exhibits large interannual variability with most of the 90 millimeter average annual total falling between may and august years of above and below normal precipitation are generally associated with the el niño and la niña phases of el niño southern oscillation respectively and both correlate highly with summer growing season streamflow verbist et al 2010 1 2 1 water system and market to manage the interannual variability in streamflow for agricultural production the chilean ministry of public works built the puclaro reservoir in 1997 with a storage capacity of 200 million cubic meters since completion puclaro has been managed by a single privately held water user association wua junta de vigilancia del rio elqui y sus afluentes jvre the jvre is responsible for ensuring delivery of water to the mouths of nearly 120 water channel association and water community owned and maintained canals which are comprised of water rights holding individuals and firms who share a common irrigation canal from which individual allocations are drawn and used these associations and communities along with jvre are wuas the elqui river valley has approximately 25 000 fully allocated acciones each not to exceed 1 liter per second average annually the jvre is responsible for setting the per accion annual allocation value on september 1st and uses puclaro s existing storage and estimates of expected inflow acciones are not the same as water rights although each is a function of the other in chile water rights can exceed 1 liter per second but when summed across the elqui valley can be expressed in accione equivalent units because acciones and water rights are translatable acciones are the basis for the expression of the annual allocation value assigned by jvre and acciones is not a universal term we proceed using water rights as a surrogate for acciones during the most recent drought 2012 2015 allocation values fell below 0 20 liters per second according to jvre well below the 0 50 liters per second long term average donoso 2006 water market engagement through permanent or temporary transactions is the mechanism by which water is secured permanent transactions are those in which a water right is sold in perpetuity in addition to the agreed upon sale price of the right administrative costs detailed above are incurred the record of transactions in the elqui valley is incomplete however surveys of rights holders conclude permanent rights transactions are less common than temporary transactions and occur mostly for small quantities of water and between similar use types e g farmer to farmer hearne and william easter 1995 maestu 2012 bauer 2015 chikozho and kujinga 2017 temporary transactions are more informal as they do not require legal documentation and coordination occurs only between the buyer seller and jvre to reallocate transaction price length and or volume are negotiated provided right ownership is not disputed donoso 2006 hearne and donoso 2014 molinos senante et al 2016 jvre tracks only the water transfer and does not maintain records of temporary transaction price the market for temporary transactions is active personal communications jvre and has not been investigated in terms of farm scale economic impact and is the central focus of this work evidence suggests that temporary transactions occur with regularity both on an intra canal and inter canal basis in terms of both flow and volume although data to support this claim is limited to maximize profits farmers must decide when the prospective benefit of procuring water outweighs the cost molinos senante et al 2016 use a water use efficiency metric and find that farmers who trade in water markets in the limari valley immediately south of the elqui valley are more efficient in their water use than their counterparts who do not trade they conclude that agricultural water productivity rises when farmers interact in water market using non radial data envelopment other recent analyses applied to regions beyond but with water law similar to chile have investigated both how water rights holders might adapt to increasing drought frequency by developing trading strategies based on categorical supply likelihoods adamson et al 2017 and how forward contracts might improve water allocation efficiency where spot market mispricing and inequality in basin wealth challenge market efficiency bayer and loch 2017 1 2 2 agricultural production and economy most wuas consist of farmers using surface sprinkler and drip irrigation systems as such agricultural exports lead the valley s economy with grapes 12 of elqui valley irrigated area and other perennial fruit and vegetable crops holding the highest value yet accounting for only 21 of the total irrigated area zunino et al 2009 chile s office of agricultural policies and studies odepa keeps basin scale records for crops arriving at market weight and corresponding price but only for those crops with a meaningful market presence and value market statistics for elqui produced grapes have been tracked by odepa since 1995 no other elqui produced crop possess a similarly long and complete record in 2015 the elqui produced 14 35 metric tons and 9 million chilean pesos clp on a per hectare basis in addition the mean price of elqui valley grapes in chilean markets have been variable coefficient of variation 0 47 between 2000 and 2015 additional discussion of market data is provided in the data collection section of this paper aside from grapes approximately 30 crop types are cultivated regularly in the elqui valley of the nearly 30 000 ha reported as planted and irrigated the mean distribution of each crop is 4 of the total irrigated area grapes 12 and potatoes 24 are planted most widely while the next most prevalent crop green beans represent only 7 of the total area planted crops planted on an annual basis are predominantly planted downstream of puclaro 91 of all annual crops while grapes are planted mostly upstream of puclaro 85 of all grapes and account for 59 of all hectares planted upstream while grapes are a potentially lucrative crop for elqui valley farmers the perennial vines are at risk to failure in years where allocation values are low a full description of cropping patterns within the elqui valley is provided in zunino et al 2009 unlike annual crop farmers who may choose whether and what to plant grape and other perennial crop farmers are tied to their cropping decisions for up to 50 years and face a 3 year yield latency if drought vine kill forces replanting verdegaal et al 2016 due to the volatile nature of the grape market the distinct risks faced by grape producers in years of drought and the uncertainty of annual water allocation values a key input to grape production farmers can take advantage of transfers to secure additional water to protect their vineyards and maximize profits nagues et al 2016 for these reasons coupled with the spatial and economic dominance and the length and completeness of the record of elqui produced grapes they are selected for analysis of water trading in the elqui valley 2 objectives many of the studies that have targeted water system reforms both in chile and other regions where strong water law has emerged but not resulted in system efficiency focus on institutional level interventions based on coarse market scale analyses hearne and donoso 2014 molinos senante et al 2016 burgos 2017 chikozho and kujinga 2017 bayer and loch 2017 here we abstract from a market scale analysis and develop a water demand derivation framework using a coupled agro econ model to assess when and how aggressively perennial crop farmers should engage in temporary market activity to maximize profit regardless of initial rights ownership using grape farmers in the elqui valley as a case study the demand framework proposed here may hold the potential for application to market scale analyses and may be combined with additional crop type water demand models to assess supply and demand interactions to provide a more complete analysis of inter farmer trade potential temporary market transactions are the focus of this work because jvre has stated the market for temporary transactions is active although market informality prevents the development of a price revealing mechanism additionally temporary transactions may be preferred by water rights holders due to the fact the uncertain nature of the annual per water right allocation means optimization may require annual market engagement depending on initial rights ownership as such the remainder of this paper addresses the following question given that temporary water markets lack a price revealing mechanism can a comprehensive framework be developed such that a farmer may assess a a the economic value of their initial allocation i e crop yield sold at market and b determine the amount of water they need to produce maximum economic or optimal yield and its fair market value in the temporary water market the answers to these questions have the potential to equip farmers with information to confidently engage with willing sellers that is because the market lacks a price revealing mechanism price uncertainty may dissuade potential buyers and sellers from entering the water market precisely because they have little idea of a feasible price to buy or sell the market scale effect of price uncertainty is latent or unrealized trade which moves the water market away from efficiency by creating a farm scale water demand model that defines water s value at the initial allocation and optimal allocation a range of profitable water market engagement scenarios is developed 3 methodology to approach modeling a farmer s optimal decision path to maximizing expected profit utilizing temporary transactions it is prudent to begin by framing the problem in economic terms this work treats grape farmers as agents seeking to make efficient decisions which maximize their expected profits considering the levels and costs of inputs which are expected during the cropping season to optimize farmers must understand how the cumulative water allocation they will receive per right allocation times the number of rights currently owned is likely to be converted to grape yield based upon an estimate of potential grape yield and expected market price gross expected profit can be calculated from which fixed and variable expected costs of operation must be subtracted to obtain net expected profit by calculating net expected profit for a range of possible per right allocation values an optimal frontier of net expected profits can be presented as a farmer s decision space calculating the marginal benefits associated with yield increase from additional water a farmer s total willingness to pay twtp for water can be determined the twtp can be used as a decision rule by which farmers engage in the water market this methodology is achieved by coupling a crop water model with an economic model 3 1 crop water model describing the dynamic and non linear biologic relationship between water and grape yield is a critical step in constructing a model linking agricultural production to farm level profit and ultimately to optimal water market engagement by a farmer crop water modeling is used to calculate maximum grape yield and the corresponding sufficient water allocation equivalent to the crop water requirement cwr as well as to simulate yields for observed per water right allocation values with these parameters regression techniques are used to derive a biologic relationship between water and yield response hoffman et al 2018 oguntunde et al 2018 jin et al 2018 several crop water productivity models i e aquacrop ceres cropsyst cropwat gcwm dssat and other similar models have been developed to simulate crop yield response in herbaceous plants hunink and droogers 2010a b ovando et al 2018 beveridge et al 2018 the land and water division of the food and agricultural organization fao of the united nations aquacrop raes et al 2009 is a crop water model known for linking crop water and climate interactions and is built to achieve a reasonable balance of accuracy simplicity and robustness according to the fao aquacrop is widely used and has been continuously updated by the fao version 6 1 was released in may 2018 raes et al 2018 its ability to reproduce observed yield has been proven by agronomists which is supported by a review of recent literature jones et al 2017 nyathi et al 2018 ran et al 2018 tan et al 2018 tsakmakis et al 2019 xu et al 2019 yet vine phenology is not well explored in open source crop models as most models are intended for use with herbaceous annual crop varieties rather than perennial vine or wood crops the only example of modelled grape production encountered in peer reviewed literature was that of hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b who used aquacrop while hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b provides many grape phenology parameters personal communications between the authors and hunink yielded additional information necessary to parameterize aquacrop such that reliable results are achieved aquacrop is design with a user interface and parameterization menus that allow users to create and populate four module components to simulate location specific climate crop characteristics management techniques and soil parameters sub modules for management techniques irrigation and field management and soil parameters profile and groundwater are also utilized location specific climate requires daily data for rainfall maximum and minimum temperature and reference evapotranspiration eto elqui valley wide precipitation and temperature data daily 1950 present are readily available through the chilean dga data from the algarrobal streamflow gauge on the elqui river serves as inflow for the puclaro reservoir and is near much of the grape production eto is calculated using the modified hargreaves equation eq 1 1 e t o 0 0023 0 408 r a t a v g 17 8 t d 0 5 where r a is the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 obtained from tables hargreaves 1994 droogers and allen 2002 and is multiplied by the constant 0 408 to convert to millimeters t a v g is average mean daily temperature in degrees celsius and t d is the daily temperature range the remaining constants are calculated by hargreaves et al 1985 the crop characteristics module requires use of a pre built crop profile or user specified phenology aquacrop is built primarily for crop yield simulation of herbaceous crops however hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b construct a grape crop profile for aquacrop which skillfully reproduces expected grape yields using the same critical crop characteristics an elqui valley grape crop profile is created major parameters are shown in table 1 as adapted from hunink and droogers 2010a hunink and droogers 2010b the irrigation management sub module allows for selection of irrigation technique and whether crop yield simulation will be based upon 1 the net irrigation requirement analogous to cwr determination 2 generation of an irrigation schedule daily distribution of water which results in cwr or 3 user specification of an irrigation schedule generation of an irrigation schedule is selected to determine the grape cwr and corresponding unconstrained yield while user specification of the irrigation schedule is selected to simulate yields for annual per water right allocation values when the irrigation schedule is specified by the user the average annual per right allocation value is uniformly distributed to a daily scale per the historical monthly distribution of the right 72 of annual allocation value is typically distributed september march personal communications jvre the per right allocation value for the elqui valley is calculated using outflow from the puclaro reservoir as measured at the almendral streamflow gauge station 3 km below puclaro less base flow the irrigation method used by most grape farmers in the elqui valley is drip irrigation the field management sub module allows for specification of mulching and other soil preparation techniques intended to enhance yield production no advanced techniques of in and off season soil preparation are assumed here which is consistent with practices in the elqui valley in the soil and groundwater profile sub modules two soil horizons are specified for the elqui valley which replicates in situ conditions at elevations where grapes are grown soils are a clay sand and gravel mix with the proportion of gravel increasing from 10 80 from the surface to 1 2 m groundwater is set to an inaccessible depth melendez 1979 after the modules are populated simulations are conducted for 1999 2015 puclaro came online in 1999 with harvest set at march 15th cwr and corresponding yield pairings are calculated along with annual yields corresponding to the per right specified irrigation schedule aquacrop produces per hectare pairings of water input and yield output for the elqui valley this is described as the yield in dry metric tons corresponding to a case in which a farmer holds some number of water rights which provide an allocation equal to the annual irrigation value dry tons are converted to fresh yield by dividing by 0 20 which recognizes grapes as containing 20 dry and 80 wet matter hunink and droogers 2010a b most grapes produced in the elqui are brought to market before processing and market prices are reported by odepa in fresh yields it is widely accepted that grapevines are naturally long lived 100 years and in terms of production for alcohol old vines are often preferred for fruit quality lasko et al 2003 robinson et al 2013 in addition the high cost associated with vineyard replacement planting and maintenance trellis systems foregone yield drives farmers to avoid allocations which might result in vine kill 3 2 yield regression model crop yield response to water is a non linear process with yield dependent on both how much and when water is applied steduto et al 2012 the yield and per water right allocation paring outputs from aquacrop exhibit this relationship there are many approaches to yield calibration the purpose of this research is to produce a coupled farm scale agro econ model thus an approach approximating the continuous relationship between water and yield is viewed as sufficient for interpretability stone and schlegel 2006 hsiao et al 2009 a simple regression of allocation value onto yield is selected this relationship holds to the point where the cwr is achieved beyond the cwr any additional application of water results in no increase in grape yield 3 3 agro economic model coupled agricultural and economic models optimize production of farmed goods and can be manipulated to determine the shadow value of production inputs while agro economic models are useful for producing optimal outcomes they are subject to both limitations that apply to all models as approximations of reality and specifically limitations tied to models of coupled human natural systems just 2003 cai 2008 griffith et al 2009 harou et al 2009 there are three major classes of agro economic optimization models designed to handle the complexities of coupled human natural systems which are used to determine the shadow value of water in agricultural production modular holistic and computable general equilibrium models brouwer and hofkes 2008 holistic and computable models are top down and are best suited for evaluating sectoral level policy changes i e tariffs and taxes while modular approaches are bottom up and target localized changes to production in this work a modular framework is used as the level of concern is at the farm scale bottom up and because the crop water and economic models do not interact directly that is the outputs of the crop water model may be thought of as exogenous inputs to the economic model linking grape yield as a function of water to the costs of production and profits using a modular approach allows for estimation of the water s value to a farmer there is a rich body of literature investigating farmer decision making which predominantly points toward risk averse behavior under uncertainty gómez limón et al 2003 just 2003 gardebroek et al 2010 nagues et al 2016 some studies suggest farmers seek to maximize their von neumann morgenstern utility function holding farmers as both risk and downside averse others suggest a spectrum of risk attitudes exists within farmer communities especially where farmers are economically stratified ziervogel et al 2005 kosovac et al 2017 however to our knowledge there are no studies eliciting grape farmer risk attitudes in the elqui valley in addition an important component of this research aims to evaluate economically stratified grape farmer behavior manifested here as differences in permanent water rights endowment thus rather than apply the von neumann morgenstern utility function a more simplistic approach which treats farmers as risk neutral maximizing expected profits for their water right endowment is applied here the model evaluates varied permanent water rights ownership strategies a realistic response to allocation uncertainty by perennial crop type farmers rather than specify a risk attitude farmers are able to match their ownership to expected profit and market engagement outcomes and decide whether their water rights ownership matches their risk attitude in water rights managed basins perennial crop farmers lack crop type decision flexibility their annual crop type farmer counterparts possess e g farmers making annual crop type decisions can choose to plant drought tolerant crops in years of low allocation thus the primary mechanism available to grape and other perennial crop type farmers to cope with allocation uncertainty is to secure additional water the model is purposefully simplistic and is intended to balance complexity and interpretability of results focused specifically on identifying both the frequency of expected temporary water market engagement and expected gains from trade across the endowment scenarios the basic model is constructed such that a set of expected annual optimal net profits are calculated for the range of feasible per right allocation values 0 05 1 varied by 0 05 liters per second for which expected yields are achieved eq 2 2 max e π t w e p t e y t w i 1 n e c i t e q i t w e f e e s t t 2000 2015 where e π t w is expected net profit clp per hectare for each feasible water right allocation value w in year t e p t is the march mean market price clp per metric ton of grapes in year t e y t w is the expected yield metric tons per hectare of grapes produced for each feasible water right allocation value w in year t e c i t is the expected cost of input i in year t e q i t w is the quantity of input i for each feasible water right allocation value w in year t and e f e e s t is the expected per right administrative fees paid to the jvre and water community or canal association in year t and are unaffected by allocation value in simplified form the objective function may be written as expected profit equal to expected benefits less the sum of actual costs where π t w is maximized across feasible values of w for each year the corresponding yield is referred to as the maximum economic yield mey which is the yield level at which net profit total revenue minus total cost are maximized mey is also known as optimum yield per water right allocation values w are always subscripts w is used to describe the range of feasible per water right allocation values but can also take on specific values e g water required to achieve a desired level of profit for any variable that has w is a subscript e g q i t w the variable s value will correspond to the allocation value assigned to w ultimately w is a subscript even though w may not appear as a subscript in the calculation expected profit is constrained by yield and variable input costs expected yield is a polynomial fit of yield and corresponding water right allocation value pairings to the cwr above the cwr yield is maximized comas et al 2019 labor and fertilizer are modeled as a variable input costs expected cost per unit c i t is exogenously determined however the quantity of each input is modeled as a constant return to scale which suggests an increasing level of input results in a proportional increase in output eqs 3 4 3 e q l a b o r t w 6 q l m a x e y t w e y m a x 4 e q f e r t t w q f m a x e y t w e y m a x where e q l a b o r t

follows a similar technique to achieve a corresponding e y t w q f m a x is the fertilizer application weight required to maximize yield and is set to 504 kg per hectare faostat 2015 3 4 farm scale profit model the agro econ model produces annual optimal pairings of expected profit and water allocations on a per hectare basis using a polynomial regression applied to each year truncated to the cwr and corresponding profit for each year simulated the optimal expected profit corresponding to the per right allocation value calculated based upon streamflow at almendral is used to establish a base case where a farmer holds one water right for a single hectare from the base case alternative scenarios can be simulated in which farmers procure additional rights to achieve the cwr and maximize profit insight gained from these simulations include the minimum number of rights required to achieve mey and farmer total willingness to pay twtp for water deficit eq 5 5 t w t p t π me y t π w t o b s where π m e y t is calculated as the maximum expected profit achievable in year t and π w t o b s is the optimal expected profit achieved by yield produced with the year t observed per water right allocation w t o b s the twtp represents the most a farmer should be willing to pay to secure water fertilizer and labor required to achieve mey such that the cost of procuring the inputs is equal to the additional profit received the optimization is completed by forming a lagrangian of the expected profit maximizing objective and the input cost constraints the model calculates the marginal value λ t clp per hectare of a one ton yield increase for each year for each constraint including yield response to water to determine the value of the water that corresponds to λ t the water required to produce the per hectare yield corresponding to the annual water right allocation value and the allocation required to produce an additional ton of yield is calculated by solving eq 2 for subscript w taking their difference produces the marginal allocation requirement w t r e q eq 6 6 w t r e q w y t 1 w y t the utility of water u w clp is calculated as the net benefit a grape farmer could achieve by utilizing a single right eq 7 7 u w λ t w t r e q w t o b s w t o b s is the observed per right allocation of water in year t a positive relationship between utility and allocation value holds and is best fit by an exponential function griffin 2006 the second negative derivative of the utility function is synonymous with demand d w eq 8 in the case of water allocations the area under the demand curve between two points current allocation and desired allocation is a farmer s total willingness to pay twtp for the excess water required to maximize profit 8 d w 2 u w 2 in theory a farmer should purchase water if market price of water desired is less than the twtp which signifies the benefit a farmer receives in terms of profit from increased yield exceeding the cost of the water this relationship is evaluated on an annual basis to determine the frequency of expected market engagement and the excess benefits created by optimal participation eq 9 9 π t π m e y t t w t p t where π t is profit after market engagement and π m e y t is profit at mey market engagement not required to achieve mey this metric represents the profit a grape farmer could expect to make on a per hectare basis if the twtp is the market price of water 4 data collection input costs for grape production include fertilizer labor and administrative fees paid to jvre and wuas fig 2 all costs are discounted

in modern times for the elqui valley is captured in the period analyzed 5 results each phase of the framework must be fully explored and because each of the framework s model components are additive the results are presented sequentially each section provides additional insight by describing the linkage between phases which reveals each phase s contribution to the framework and as such shows the framework s value to the overarching objectives of the study 5 1 crop water and yield regression model grape cwr and corresponding yield are produced for 2000 2015 the cwr is calculated to be 0 70 liters per second with an maximum yield of 17 35 wet metric tons per hectare maximum yield falls within the range of expected per hectare maximums faostat 2015 and is consistent with output as reported by odepa the aquacrop climate submodule includes atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations as measured at mauna loa which produce a slight positive linear trend in yield pearson s correlation

production and optimal net present value of expected profit hereafter referred to as optimal profit optimal expected profit is the largest profit a farmer could obtain at any per water right

and subsequently contrast it with the expected annual mey profit level fig 4 the shape and vertical magnitude of the optimized frontier is annually variable and dominated by the market price of grapes the optimal expected profit at mey is upper limit of the value of water as a function of grape yield unrealized expected profit resulting from holding a suboptimal number of water rights is calculated as vertical difference between the mey expected profit and optimal expected profit for the actual per right allocation for a given year concurrently the additional water required to achieve the mey profit in any given year is the difference between 0 7 liters per second and the actual observed allocation value this represents a farmer s tradeoffs between expected profit and water procurement for example in 2000 securing 0 34 liters per second less than 1 additional water right increases per hectare expected profit by 10 million clp in contrast for 2012 0 51 liters per second greater than 2 5 additional water rights results in per hectare expected profit increases of 3 million clp mey expected profit variability for these years is explained by the fact that elqui valley produced grapes were nearly eight times more valuable in chilean markets in 2000 than 2012 to achieve mey expected profits grape farmers must also optimize the flow of water procured in the water market during years of deficiency the optimal procurement strategy is calculated as the horizontal distance between the observed annual per right allocation value and the cwr the efficient pathway to mey expected profit in terms of whole water rights is simply the number of water rights required to reach the cwr given the value of the annual allocation viewed retrospectively over the simulation period a farmer might choose to seek permanent transactions consistent with a level of risk tolerance eliminating necessary leasing through the water market fig 5 a single water right per hectare provides mey profits for 20 of years between 2000 and 2015 while a second water right secures mey profits for an additional 50 of the period of record not until seven rights are owned has a farmer obtained sufficient water to avoid temporary procurement in the market for the 16 years evaluated holding seven water rights is suboptimal and results in instances of surplus which the profit maximizing farmer should seek to sell assesments of rights procurement strategy and corresponding potential expected profit gains are informative but not sensitive to diminishing marginal utility of water tranformed to yield and ultimately to expected profit that is the difference between mey expected profit and optimal expected profit for the actual per right allocation is representative only of the potential gross gains from procuring water and indicates nothing about the cost farmers should be willing to pay for the water establishing the utility of water in terms of per right allocation fig 6 a and demand fig 6b has the potential to provide farmers a more realistic estimate of the cost at which water should be procured the utility of water u w exhibits an exponentially increasing trend eq 11 consistent with expected behavior griffin 2006 this suggests as the per right allocation value increases the profit potential utility increases 11 u w 2 10 7 w t 1 4752 the demand schedule d w describes diminishing marginal utility and is defined by the negative second derivative of the utility function 2 u w 2 and given by eq 12 griffin 2006 the constant subtracted from the demand function constrains the price of water to be zero at the cwr the area under the demand curve fig 6b from the observed per right allocation value to the cwr is the twtp for water required to achieve mey profit on a per hectare basis here for the twtp for water as the observed allocation rises the value farmers attach to water required to reach mey decreases 12 d w u 2 w 2 1 4 10 7 w t 0 52 1 69 10 7 the range over which per water right allocations result in measurable yields 0 05 liters per second 1 0 liters per second provides a lower bound at which the crop water model indicates allocations result in vine kill below 0 05 liters per second although observed allocation values never violate this threshold and likely jvre would work to provide at least the amount of water required to protect against vine kill an analysis of grape farmer willingness to avoid vine kill is provided to describe the full range of the demand function grape vineyard establishment costs include planting and maintenance trellis system construction and installation irrigation fertilization and pest management verdegaal et al 2016 marketable yields are not expected for the first two growing seasons after planting and in the third year 5 tons per acre is expected before full production is anticipated utilizing an annual discount rate of 2 and accounting for foregone mean annual yields 11 76 metric tons per hectare 2000 2015 grape farmer willingness to avoid a single vine kill event net allocation less than 0 05 liters per second is 24 2 million clp thus the full extent of the demand function is revealed fig 7 5 3 analysis of rights owner expected profitability an important variable in production which is relatively unknown in the elqui valley is the distribution of rights among farmers the difference in the number of water rights held per hectare provides insight to farmer behavior expected profit potential and the requirement for market engagement to investigate the degree to which different initial water rights ownership strategies have the potential to impact grape farmer decision making two cases are developed 1 a farmer owns one hectare for which a single water right is held hereafter referred to as 1wr this ownership strategy may represent a risk accepting farmer willing to engage in the temporary water market when the per right allocation value historically at 0 5 l s on average is below what is required to maximize per hectare expected profit donoso 2006 1wr farmers should expect frequent water market engagement to achieve mey fig 5 2 a farmer owns one hectare for which 2 25 water rights are held hereafter referred to as 2 25wr the 2 25wr strategy is based on a uniform distribution of water rights to currently irrigated land area planted in grapes per zunino et al 2009 this strategy represents risk aversion relative to the 1wr strategy and it is expected these farmers will engage in market activity in less than 30 of years fig 5 in both cases farmers are profit maximizing and engage in market activity in any year where per right allocation and water rights ownership status result in a water deficit it is assumed farmers seek only temporary water transfers through the market and at the end of the year revert to their initial water right ownership status likewise sufficient water is assumed available in the market such that farmers can procure enough to achieve mey however a farmer only purchases water if the twtp for the water a function of potential increases in profit is less than the point at which the cost of production exceeds profit such that profit after market engagement must be exceed initial expected profit evaluating water surplus and deficit in terms of cwr illustrates how initial rights holdings are affected by inter annual variability and the relationship correlation between allocation and observed storage in puclaro pearson correlation coefficient 0 76 fig 8 a for the 1wr case water deficit occurs in 13 of the 16 years requiring market engagement to achieve mey in contrast the 2 25wr scenario results in relative surplus and market engagement is only required during a four year period of the 2009 2015 drought the largest deficits in both scenarios occur during the prolonged drought 2012 2015 when observed allocations were 0 20 liters per second personal communication jvre to measure the effect procuring water at the twtp has on profit a baseline scenario in which no water market engagement occurs is evaluated as expected expected profits fig 8b for both the 1wr and 2 25wr cases are substantially reduced without market engagement fig 8c aggregating across the 16 years on a per hectare basis for the 1wr case 58 66 million clp of mey potential profit is foregone while 26 28 million clp is foregone for the 2 25wr case the difference in optimal expected profit between 1wr and 2 25wr t 2000 2015 π 2 25 w r π 1 w r is 37 million clp indicating farmers initially holding 2 25 water rights make substantially larger profits when both do not engage in the water market if full market engagement is allowed including temporarily buying and selling water rights annually expected profit increases for both the 1wr and 2 25wr cases for all years where the per water right allocation value does not allow for mey to be obtained without market engagement the twtp is less than the potential gains which prompts trading expected profits post engagement are given by eq 9 see above and shown by fig 9 a b gains from market engagement are significant in both cases with post market engagement optimal expected profit difference of 14 5 million clp compared to 37 million clp without market engagement which suggests that there is both a benefit to market engagement and that given adequate market supply trading closes the expected profit gap between farmers with different rights holding strategies table 2 the analysis assumes an adequate supply of rights exists in the temporary market such that 1wr and 2 25wr holders would bargain and secure the optimal number of rights at the twtp profits for 1wr nearly double despite high twtp costs in drought years 2009 2014 in 2012 the combined effect of the below average per right allocation value 0 19 liters per second and below average grape market prices 252 thousand clp per metric ton make profits gained by market engagement nearly equal the potential profit gains for the 1wr case in contrast for 2013 2015 the per right allocation continues to decrease 0 12 liters per second average while grape market prices rebound 637 thousand clp per metric ton by 2015 which provides increased incentive to engage in the water market resulting in nearly ten fold increases in profit for both the 1wr and 2 25wr cases the drastic difference between potential outcomes 2012 verses 2013 2015 suggests farmer decisions should be based on an agro economic approach 6 discussion and conclusion the framework presented here creates a mechanism by which the fair market value of water to grape farmers is revealed by coupling yield response to water with profit maximization it addresses both components of the objective as it describes optimal behavior under initial per water right allocations and pathways to maximum economic yield mey attained through optimal market engagement the analysis indicates that for the period 2000 2015 optimal market engagement by farmers holding 1 and 2 25 water rights per hectare could increase per hectare profits by up to 98 45 mill chilean pesos and 27 22 mill chilean pesos respectively market engagement occurs only when a positive difference between profit at mey and profit at the initial allocation value exists and when a farmer s total willingness to pay for the additional water is less than the difference however this study reveals that water market engagement could be vigorous if farmers used an agro economic framework to assess the value of water for example farmers holding a single water right should seek to engage in market activity each year 2000 2015 due to the fact input costs fertilizer labor and fees even at their highest levels are insignificant in comparison to the market price of grapes further an assessment of initial water rights ownership and profit potential illustrates how farmers might act to secure permanent rights to manage the degree to which they engage in the temporary market over the period evaluated rights holders with a single right can expect to engage in market activity in 80 of years increasing ownership to two rights requires farmers to engage during 30 of years and with seven rights market engagement is avoided completely the analysis reveals a water price negotiation space available to grape farmers where there is a demand based incentive to enter the water market in any year where the per right allocation and initial rights ownership combination result in yields below mey calculating the annual difference between profit achieved with mey and profit at the pre trade per water right allocation value equips the farmer with a profit and cost sensitive estimate of the fair market value or total willingness to pay twtp for a water right used as an input to grape production the twtp derived from the demand function represents an upper bound of the fair market value of water and allows the buyer to frame their negotiation space or range of acceptable water prices the negotiation space is thus the difference between water received free of charge and the twtp thus a grape farmer should be willing to pay any value within the negotiation space for the allocation of water which allows them to achieve benefits up to mey contrastingly economic logic suggests farmers with excess water or an initial endowment beyond the cwr have no incentive to retain it applying excess irrigation to grapes in exceedance of the crop water requirement cwr is wasteful and has the potential to damage the crop thus the marginal benefit of water beyond the cwr is zero and theoretically excess water could be relinquished without cost however market activity indicates sales of excess water do occur where at least two growers competitively seek water the price for which excess water should be sold is not addressed here and can be investigated to further analyze optimal market engagement modelling water rights holders as a buyer or seller dependent upon the year and climate condition given a mean seasonal allocation 2000 2015 of 0 36 liters per second with the independent assumption that rights are uniformly distributed among hectares planted in grapes zunino et al 2009 which is embodied by the 2 25wr case the corresponding mean per hectare allocation is 0 81 liters per second this suggests farmers are responding to continuously below normal allocations by permanently buying rights which ensure that for all but the worst drought years mey is reached this is evident in the model results as shown by fig 8 b still the purported vigor of temporary transactions in the water market suggests some water rights holders have either chosen or are not able to secure permanent rights which protect against drought these are likely to be farmers of smaller vineyards holding fewer water rights per hectare than average and those unable to purchase permanent rights which have become increasingly costly to procure de la luz domper 2009 although observed allocations never fall below the vine kill threshold 0 05 liters per second a net present value calculation reveals per hectare replacement costs to be between 20 2 25 water rights per hectare and 53 1 water rights per hectare of the sum of corresponding profits over the period analyzed this result suggests grape farmers have a strong economic incentive to avoid vine kill as the expected cost of vine replacement is roughly 3 5 times greater than largest willingness to pay for allocations resulting in productive yields while the work presented here is focused only establishing a comprehensive demand derivation framework for temporary water markets it is subject to assumptions which may limit its applicability we assume rights availability in the market to be sufficient to meet annual demands of grape farmers no supply constraints or two firm analysis described above are performed here assuming each farmer in the basin across all crop types seeks to meet their crop s cwr there exists the possibility for rights supply and demand inequality in a competitive water market in the elqui hearne and william easter 1997 report that essco the private company responsible for water supply in the elqui valley s populous coastal region is expected to hold more than 2000 uninterruptible water rights by 2018 which are not considered tradable a uniform distribution of 8000 water rights among hectares planted in grapes in the elqui zunino et al 2009 suggests that roughly 15 000 rights are dedicated to other types of agriculture and other minority uses based on the assumed number of potentially tradable rights 23 000 and the feasible range of annual per water right allocation values instances of both excess and insufficient supply may occur additional research is required to investigate how farmers of different crop types perennial vs annual high vs low value might interact such that profits are optimized on a basin scale and how rights supply and demand inequality affect basin scale economic outcomes farmers are assumed to have a priori knowledge prices fertilizer and labor requirements or equivalently perfect information a season ahead forecast of per right allocation values market prices and inputs could allow farmers to make early cropping and water market decisions presumably the market price of water varies throughout the austral winter and spring prior to the date september 1st jvre sets the annual allocation value however once the allocation value is set the market price should not vary and is given by the peak demand for water streamflow forecast models could benefit from the strong relationship with the el nino southern oscillation in the elqui and market forecast model could draw on the relationship between usda reported market price of grapes aug sep and prior march chilean harvest prices pearson correlation coefficient 0 50 this warrants further investigation the water code of 1981 stipulates water rights initially be supplied free of cost which alleviates water rights holders from paying the opportunity cost of water for another perhaps superior economic use this is because dga bestows water rights based on order of application provided the use is deemed beneficial and is not permitted to bestow water rights to the applicant with the greatest expected economic use in addition water rights applicants do not necessarily consider the opportunity cost of their chosen use at the basin scale that is a farmer s intended use may not represent the best economic use a two firm economic equilibrium model may be used to determine the economically efficient distribution of water and its accompanying price a two firm model requires identification and demand derivation for at least a second crop type farmer so the potential for water trades may be addressed this is possible using the framework constructed here the treatment of farmer decision making used here is simplistic and highly stylized as to represent a basic allocation uncertainty coping strategy available to grape farmers the agro economic model component that simulates this while perhaps logical is only one of many ways farmer attitude toward risk can be formulated utilizing an alternative approach like the von neumann morgenstern utility function which holds farmers as risk averse and downside prudent could be substituted in place of the maximization of expected profits model used here and will likely produce different results the decision model only permits grape farmers to engage in temporary allocation transactions realistically economically rational farmers would consider both the expected present value of a permanent transaction and the expected annual value of temporary transfers choosing the option which holds greater value in addition the decision model requires farmers to seek transfers that span the entire growing season in the elqui valley temporary transfers can occur in many temporal configurations both in terms of flow and quantity to supplement flow as required additional research is required to address these limitations the ability to explicitly verify and validate the model is currently limited for the elqui valley for a full validation candidate farms should be identified with historical yields water rights holding and area cultivated provided odepa only tracks yield at the regional scale coquimbo contains three provinces elqui limari and choapa aggregated yield is reported and only for table grapes and only 2015 in its fruit land principal results report published in july 2015 odepa reports per hectare yields of 14 35 metric tons this result is within the range of yields produced by the crop water model which suggests the model is calibrated appropriately in addition yields calculated by the crop water model do fluctuate temporally as expected in response to the observed per water right allocation value it is not appropriate to downscale this result to the elqui valley without knowing the production of the remaining provinces in the region it does suggest however that grape farmers are likely overcoming low per water right allocation values to produce substantial yields 83 of aquacrop yield at cwr we postulate these results are achieved through the procurement of a sufficient number of water rights either permanently or temporarily which motivates this research while validation is difficult the stability of the economic model can be evaluated by reformulation using observed production input and market prices to identify which parameters the model is most sensitive this is achieved by maximizing minimum benefits and maximizing maximum costs over the retrospective period which results in a minimization of expected profit the expected maximized minimum per hectare yield gross revenue is 4 4 mill chilean pesos and occurs in 2012 the maximized expected cost of production inputs on a per hectare basis is 127 thousand chilean pesos in 2015 606 thousand chilean pesos in 2011 and 46 thousand chilean pesos in 2015 for labor fertilizer and water user association fees respectively thus resultant expected profit is 3 6 mill chilean pesos which is only 186 thousand 4 8 less than the 2012 maximum expected profit smallest maximized profit 2000 2015 this result illustrates that the market price of grapes is the dominant feature in production even in the most profit limiting case constructible using observed price information fertilizer is two to 12 5 times more expensive than labor and five to 31 times more expensive than fees in corresponding years for maximized values of each thus it is evident that fertilizer has the largest influence over expected benefits yet the cost of maximized fertilizer use is 2 11 of corresponding annual yield which further illustrates the degree to which farmer decisions are market price driven as the model is formulated in addition the allocation in 2012 while below average 0 19 liters per second μ 0 47 liters per second is still larger than the allocation in the following three years by 46 72 and 90 the grape market prices in these same years are 231 276 and 248 larger than 2012 the effects of market price and allocation value on twtp and expected profit from engagement during this period 2012 2015 are best illustrated by fig 8 noting specifically the difference in magnitude between expected benefits from optimal market engagement red line and no market engagement dashed black line in 2012 the difference is much smaller than it is in any of the following three years which suggests that even though the per water right allocation values continue to fall from 0 19 liters per second in 2012 to 0 10 liters per second in 2015 which in turn results in corresponding growth in twtp it is the market price of the grapes that is driving the magnitude of the difference between expected profit under optimal engagement and expected profit under no engagement water rights have developed as a legal mechanism by which water scarcity is addressed through the establishment of limited access permits such is the case in the elqui valley of north central chile where water rights holders face uncertainty in terms of the allocation value of a right which is set annually based on a combination of reservoir storage expected inflow and expected future conditions water rights are transferable temporarily or permanently which allows rights holders to further address allocation uncertainty by securing additional water the farm scale agro economic modelling demand framework developed here uses the temporary transferability of water rights to describe how grape farmers may seek engage optimally in water markets such that their expected annual profits are maximized this work relies of the free market economic basis of the water code to guide the selection of framework components the result is an innovative demand derivation framework which produces water price and quantity signals farmers may choose to incorporate in their agricultural decision making thereby encouraging economically driven behavior within the constraints of the existing law thus policy implications are rightfully targeted to the water right holder rather than the water code and the accompanying institutional arrangements the broader insights of the research can be summarized 1 informal temporary water markets constructed on neo liberal economic principles lack a price revealing mechanism the coupled crop water agro economic approach allows for the establishment of a price negation space and quantity farmers should seek in the temporary market this basic structure may be adapted to different crops crop models and economic models because all basins in chile are subject to the water code and temporary markets are largely informal the framework may be applied most directly the framework may also be applicable to regions where similar temporary water markets exist e g mexico australia and new zealand tietenberg 2002 bjornlund and mckay 2002 bjornlund 2003 further applications may be made where water law and associated markets are emerging as the water code has been presented by global development agencies as a positive model water managers in these regions must decide the economic basis upon which transactions can occur the framework proposed here could be used to guide the level of temporary market formality such that the inefficiencies associated with the informality of temporary markets in chile can be avoided 2 risk attitude is a well studied topic and there are many ways to model economic agents the framework presented here treats the farmer simply as a profit maximizer and provides profit and interaction information for varied water rights ownership strategies this allows the farmer to adopt the ownership and interaction strategy that aligns with their risk tolerance rather than specifying a single optimal policy 3 the framework reveals that in locations where rights holders can accurately assess the value of water in terms of its utility optimal market engagement strategies can be developed which can add to farm scale profitability and act as an assessment of whether existing rights ownership matches farmer risk tolerance farmers reliant on centrally managed water allocations as a means of obtaining adequate water supplies to irrigate crops face endogenous and exogenous uncertainties including hydrology and water allocation decision making optimal farm scale water resource decision making requires water rights holders to engage in permanent and or temporary water transactions to hedge against these uncertainties the decision making strategies proposed here presents a process by which water rights holders engaged in agriculture may make informed water market engagement decisions with limited information to maximize annual profits implementation of the approach presented here by rights holders suggests improved economic efficiency for basins where water rights markets exist is possible funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding

11046,watershed management wm aims at enhancing the water availability in rainfed areas through water conservation structures which facilitate storage of water and recharge to ground water identification of suitable locations for placing these structures play a major role in the effectiveness of the water conservation site suitability evaluation of water conservation structures is performed through an assessment of various biophysical and socio economic factors many of these factors are expressed in linguistic terms rather than precise numeric values and therefore the output of the evaluation gets subjective in this study a fuzzy inference system fis is developed for site selection of water harvesting structures check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks owing to its capability to handle linguistic data effectively the suitability zones were identified using the slope soil permeability and runoff potential as input variables to the fis trapezoidal membership function mf was considered for the input and output variables for the fuzzy model and mf parameters were obtained from literature and expert knowledge the developed fis is illustrated through an application to kondepi watershed andhra pradesh india the fis categorized the majority of the watershed area into high suitability class for both farm ponds and check dams however the watershed characteristics were not conducive for percolation tanks according to the fis a sensitivity analysis of the fis parameters suggested that the check dam suitability was sensitive to the soil permeability classes the suitability maps from the fis were in good agreement with the location of the existing structures in the watershed suggesting potential use of the developed fis in wm decisions keywords fuzzy inference system water harvesting structures watershed management site suitability 1 introduction watershed management wm strategies such as rain water harvesting rwh enhance the land productivity by enhancing the water availability for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi arid regions adham et al 2016a 2016b kahinda et al 2008 singh et al 2017 wani and garg 2009 the success and sustainability of these wm programs depend on the identification of suitable sites and technical design of water harvesting structures adham et al 2016a al adamat et al 2012 de winnaar et al 2007 the food and agricultural organization fao suggested guidelines for site selection for rwh structures based on six different criteria which include climate hydrology topography agronomy soil and socio economics kahinda et al 2008 in addition many additional factors based on the field conditions have also been considered for site selection de winnaar et al 2007 kahinda et al 2008 mbilinyi et al 2007 padmavathy et al 1993 prinz et al 1998 senay and verdin 2004 these factors can be broadly classified into two categories biophysical rainfall slope soil type drainage network etc and socio economic distance to streams distance to settlements etc the biophysical characteristics of the site determine the rwh structures suitability in terms of their applicability and use to the stakeholders and the socio economic factors determine the intended beneficiaries and equitable distribution of resources among the various stakeholders etc in the recent years the socio economic factors are considered through participatory watershed management approaches while biophysical factors are considered for developing suitability maps that help in taking wm decisions since the site suitability for rwh structures require handling and analysing different criteria multi criteria analysis mca appraoch is used by many researchers de winnaar et al 2007 durbude and venkatesh 2004 mwenge kahinda et al 2009 sekar and randhir 2007 some of the common mca methods such as analytical hierarchy process weighted overlay process weighted linear combination and boolean method have been employed in different wm studies adham et al 2016a al adamat 2008 al adamat et al 2010 krois and schulte 2014 mwenge kahinda et al 2009 sekar and randhir 2007 one of the limitation for mca techniques in site suitability analysis for rwh structures is that mca require the inputs to be in the form of numerical values while most of the attributes considered for the site suitability analysis are generally in qualitative forms thus for application of mca methods the qualitative information needs to be converted to numerical values consequently the effectiveness of the decisions arrived using mca methods is influenced by the accuracy of the input data and the expertise of the decision maker hence the conversion of the qualitative information into quantitative input data needs careful consideration and fuzzy logic based mca approaches have been proven to be very effective in such cases nayak et al 2005 reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 sasikala et al 1996 fuzzy inference systems fis is one such approach that has the ability to deal with an evaluation and assessment of imprecise and uncertain data and thus have an advantage over traditional mca techniques reshmidevi et al 2009 tsiko and haile 2011 as mentioned earlier most of the attributes for site suitability analysis of the rwh structures are qualitative in nature and a quantitative classification of these attributed to various classes is difficult to achieve the fis adopts a fuzzy set theory as opposed to the classical set theory adopted by traditional mca techniques a variable element in classical set theory adopts only two values true one if the variable belongs to the set or false zero if the variable does not belong to the set while in fuzzy set theory the sharp boundaries between the sets is replaced by the concept of degree of membership thus a variable can belong to the fuzzy set with its membership ranging from 0 to 1 hence with the concept of degree of membership the fuzzy sets and fis account for the linguistic uncertainty in the qualitative input data in addition fis simplifies the mca process by splitting complex decisions into small criteria reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 each criterion of the mca problem or knowledge is expressed using if then rules in the fis the if part contains the conditions to be satisfied and then part contains the conclusions the final decision is arrived at by aggregating the output from each rule fis approach is reported to be successful in problems involving multi criteria based decision making that use qualitative information such as land suitability evaluations for agriculture and identification of potential soil erosion zones adriaenssens et al 2004 dixon 2005 kweon 2012 reshmidevi et al 2009 sasikala et al 1996 tsiko and haile 2011 in this paper a fis for site suitability evaluation of rwh techniques in rainfed agricultural watershed is presented this study considered only biophysical factors for site suitability in fis as it is envisaged that the fis output will complement the participatory approach of decision making accordingly attributes related to the biophysical criteria soil permeability runoff potential and slope were considered for site suitability evaluation of rwh structures the developed site suitability maps would aid the decision makers and local stakeholders in arriving at more efficient decisions the fis approach is demonstrated through a case study of rwh structures check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks site suitability in kondepi watershed prakasam district of andhra pradesh india 2 fuzzy inference system the fis is a rule based system comprising of three components a rule base that consists of a collection of fuzzy if then rules a database that defines the membership function mf of the input output variables used in the fuzzy rules and a reasoning procedure that aggregates the output from fuzzy rules to arrive at a reasonable conclusion nayak et al 2005 while the input variables can be presented to the fis either as crisp values or fuzzy set the output from an fis is generally a fuzzy set consequently the fuzzy output requires defuzzificaiton in order to take decisions based on fis output the if then rules in the fis facilitate a nonlinear mapping between the input and output space of the system being modeled the fuzzy rules split the total input output space into a number of local regions and each rule represents the local behavior of the nonlinear mapping therefore the efficacy of the fis is largely dependent on the number of fuzzy rules it is to note that while the efficacy of the fis increases with increase in number of rules as the inference space increases with rules formulating high number of rules is a tedious task there are two approaches in the fis development i the mamdani approach mamdani and assilian 1975 and ii the takagi sugeno approach takagi and sugeno 1985 for the mamdani approach there are three clear procedures i e fuzzification of the input variables logic decision and defuzzification of the fis output the takagi sugeno approach however does not have an explicit defuzzification procedure rather it amalgamates the logic decision and defuzzification procedures into one composite procedure application of the takagi sugeno approach in hydrology has been mostly to function approximation nayak et al 2005 the mamdani approach has been used in some site suitability applications reshmidevi et al 2009 and is also employed in this study in the mamdani approach the first procedure of fuzzification assigns the degree of membership of various classes to the input variables the second procedure evaluates the fuzzy rules from the rule base for the degree of membership of input variables the degree of membership of the input variables to different classes determines the contribution of a rule to the possible value of the output variable the third procedure of defuzzification involves conversion of the fuzzified output to a crisp value the detailed procedures and methodology for the three processes is described in the subsequent sections 3 fis for site suitability of rwh structures water harvesting structures in wm program are aimed at increasing land productivity by improving the soil moisture and water availability for agriculture the commonly employed water harvesting structures include check dams farm ponds percolation tanks recharge wells and injection wells these structures serve the dual purpose of facilitating recharge to ground water as well as for direct use of water in this study we have considered check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks for the site suitability analysis the criteria for site suitability for these rwh structures based on biophysical factors napoli et al 2014 ramakrishnan et al 2009 rao and bhaumik 2003 is presented in table 1 it is evident from the table 1 that the defined criteria for different variables are in qualitative terms and therefore the class definition for each variable may be highly subjective in different applications consequently no consistency is observed in the site selection criteria across different studies as described the development of fis involves fuzzification of attributes generation of fuzzy rules aggregation of rules and defuzzification to find crisp suitability class in this study three biophysical criteria soil permeability runoff potential and slope were considered as input variables to the fis for evaluating the site suitability of check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks the three input variables were classified into 3 fuzzy classes in terms of suitability viz low medium and high to pair with the suggested site suitability criteria table 1 fuzzy rules were generated based on the selection criteria for check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks detailed description of different components of the fis is presented in the following sections 3 1 fuzzification fuzzification is the process by which the crisp attribute values are mapped into common range 0 1 by using mf a mf used within the fis is a function which returns the degree of the truth membership grade possibility for a given variable and it indicates the degree of belongingness of the variable to a specific class the mf for a variable needs to be defined in terms of its crisp quantitative value while there are various choices for the mf trapezoidal mf eq 1 is assumed for all the variables in this study trapezoidal mf has a flat top and has 4 parameters a b c and d 2 shoulder and 2 base parameters a and d correspond to the base of the trapezoid b and c correspond to the shoulder of the trapezoid class boundaries of the fuzzy variables for trapezoidal mf are defined as ross 2004 zadeh 1965 1 f x a b c d 0 d x a x a b a a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d where f is the trapezoidal mf of a variable x a b c and d are the four parameters which depict the shape of the trapezoidal function 3 2 description of mf for the input attributes for site suitability 3 2 1 slope slope is an important factor in selection of the suitable site for rwh structures as it controls the size of the structure and the quantity of water that can be stored areas with high slope are not suitable for surface storage structures as it requires a large structure in terms of height to store a significant amount of water areas with medium or low slope are more suitable sites as storage capacity can be increased even with smaller structures in this study slope is classified into 3 classes as mentioned earlier low medium and high the mf for each class of slope can be computed from eqs 2 4 for various values of the slope in this equation slope is expressed in terms of percentage if μ s l μ s m and μ s h are the mf for the classes low medium and high then 2 μ s l f s a s l b s l c s l d s l 3 μ s m f s a s m b s m c s m d s m 4 μ s h f s a s h b s h c s h d s h where the function f s a b c d is as defined in eq 1 s is the slope and the subscripts sl sm and sh indicate that mf parameters a b c and d belong to the low medium and high classes of slope 3 2 2 soil permeability soil permeability is the physical property of the soil which shows the readiness of soil to transport water through the soil soil permeability is also an important factor in the effectiveness of water harvesting structure the water harvesting structures for surface water storage to aid rainfed agriculture are more suitable in areas with low values of soil permeability similar to slope the soil permeability is also classified into low medium and high classes if μ p l μ p m and μ p h are the mf for the classes low medium and high then 5 μ p l f p a p l b p l c p l d p l 6 μ p m f p a p m b p m c p m d p m 7 μ p h f p a p h b p h c p h d p h where the function f p a b c d is as defined in eq 1 p is the soil permeability cm day and the subscripts pl pm and ph indicate that mf parameters a b c and d belong to the low medium and high classes of soil permeability 3 2 3 runoff potential runoff potential of a location implies the ability of the location to generate runoff and consequently the volume of water that can be captured by the rwh structures the runoff volume from a location catchment can be estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method generally runoff potential maps are generated by simulating the runoff using the scs cn method for a 67 dependable rainfall 67 dependable rainfall is the amount of rainfall with an average recurrence interval of 1 5 years de winnaar et al 2007 mwenge kahinda et al 2009 ramakrishnan et al 2009 the runoff generated for this rainfall at various locations is then categorized into different classes to generate the runoff potential maps it is to note the cn is a function of hydrologic soil group land use and antecedent moisture condition and the runoff potential of an area is directly proportional to the value of cn i e a higher cn indicates a higher runoff potential hence the runoff potential map generated from the simulated runoff would be similar to the cn map of the catchment therefore it is rational to use cn directly as an indicator of runoff potential and is employed in this study similar to other variables runoff potential also is divided into 3 classes namely low medium and high in this study if μ r l μ r m and μ r h are the mf for the classes low medium and high then 8 μ r l f r a r l b r l c r l d r l 9 μ r m f r a r m b r m c r m d r m 10 μ r h f r a r h b r h c r h d r h where the function f r a b c d is as defined in eq 1 and r is the runoff potential and the subscripts rl rm and rh indicate that mf parameters a b c and d belong to the low medium and high classes of runoff potential 3 2 4 parameters of mf for the input variables the mf parameters define the structure of the trapezoid curve with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1 generally the mf parameters are determined by the expert knowledge and or are generated using measured data and the procedure depends on the availability of data and proposed application various researchers have used optimization techniques to identify the best set of mf parameters for the specific application of fis adriaenssens et al 2004 dai et al 2016 li and guo 2015 however in this study due to the limitation of available data to validate the developed fis output with the observed data mf parameters are determined based on literature survey and expert knowledge the mf parameters of the fuzzy sets map the input variable into a number of fuzzy regions with overlap unlike the classical sets having crisp boundaries nayak et al 2005 reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 the advantage of fuzzy sets is that the overlap of the fuzzy region makes the element to be partial in the set and also the transition from one region to another is gradual fig 1 depicts the mf of the different classes considered for the input variables as is evident from the figure the mf of different classes overlap with each other and an element would have a membership in different classes the mf of the input variables overlap each other as shown in fig 1 for example in fig 1 a a value of 8 slope falls in both low and medium class with varying degree of belongingness as the mf for each class overlap the value of 8 of slope would have a membership value of 0 2 0 8 and 0 for low medium and high classes respectively it is to note the summation of the membership values for different classes of an element should be equal to one similarly figs 1 b and 1 c depict the mf of soil permeability and runoff potential the mf parameters of the three input variables for each class derived from the expert knowledge are presented in table 2 3 3 development of the fis for rwh suitability 3 3 1 fuzzy rule base the fuzzy rule base developed in this study is based on the literature adham et al 2016a kadam et al 2012 ramakrishnan et al 2009 rao and bhaumik 2003 and the expert knowledge as discussed earlier each of the 3 input variables are classified into 3 classes making a total of 27 if then rules in the fis the fuzzy outputs from the fis are classified into 4 groups viz not suitable low suitability medium suitability and highly suitable note that all the three variables are given equal weightage in the fis rules and a typical example of fis rules are if soil permeability is low and slope is low and runoff potential is high then check dam suitability is high farm pond is high percolation tank is not suitable if soil permeability is low and slope is low and runoff potential is medium then check dam suitability is high farm pond is high percolation tank is not suitable if soil permeability is high and slope is low and runoff potential is low then check dam suitability is not suitable farm pond is not suitable percolation tank is medium if soil permeability is low and slope is high and runoff potential is low then check dam suitability is low farm pond is not suitable percolation tank is medium each rule in the rule base considers a combination of the fuzzy class of the input variables and specifies the appropriate degree of membership in class of suitability for the water harvesting structure 3 3 2 aggregation of rules the overall site suitability for the water harvesting structure is determined by combining the output from all the fuzzy rules this process of obtaining the final output from the rule base is called aggregation of rules in this study mamdani implication method reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 tsiko and haile 2011 is adopted which is a maximum minimum aggregation method in this method minimum among the attribute mf of a criterion is selected the corresponding outputs from all the rules are aggregated using the fuzzy union operator where the maximum values are selected from the set of outputs from each rule as follows eq 11 reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 11 s u i t a b i l i t y μ max min μ c k v a r i a b l e 1 μ c k v a r i a b l e 2 μ c k v a r i a b l e 3 k 1 2 27 n u m b e r o f r u l e s and c 1 2 3 where s u i t a b i l i t y μ is the membership grade of the suitability μ is the mf of the input variable c is the membership class of the input variable in rule k and the variable1 variable 2 and variable 3 are the input variables to the fis schematic representation of the developed fis is shown in fig 2 the inference engine considers the fuzzified input variables and evaluates all the fuzzy rules and the output of the all rules is aggregated to get the fuzzified output which are defuzzified to arrive at the suitability class 3 3 3 defuzzification of the fis output in the mamdani approach of aggregation of rules the output of the fis is a fuzzy variable and needs to be defuzzified to the decision domain several defuzzification methods are available in the literature some of the commonly used methods are maximum membership principle mean maximum membership ross 2004 weighted average method reshmidevi et al 2009 centroid method ross 2004 and use of inflection points sicat et al 2005 this study used maximum membership principle for defuzzification in this method the maximum of the largest membership value of suitability class is taken as the most representative value 4 demonstrative case example the developed fis is envisaged to be used for developing the site suitability maps of the water harvesting structures in a given watershed to aid the participatory watershed management the fis is applied to a study watershed under rainfed agriculture in india and is discussed in the following section 4 1 description of the study area the developed fis is applied to kondepi watershed near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh in india fig 3 the watershed has a total geographical area of 4157 ha and a net cropped area of about 1100 ha the watershed lies between latitudes 15 23 n and 15 25 n and longitudes 79 48 e and 79 53 e and falls under the sub tropical climate with average annual rainfall of about 690 mm elevation of the watershed ranges from 18 8 m to 71 3 m the agricultural practices are rainfed in this watershed except 20 ha 0 2 of the cropped area which is cropped using drip irrigation with water drawn from groundwater only a few tube wells are in working condition in the watershed with ground water level at 350 m below the surface primary crops grown in the watershed include tobacco nicotiana tabcum red gram cajanus cajan bengal gram cicer arietinum groundnut arachis hypogaea and rice oryza sativa the watershed is plagued with agro ecological problems such as soil erosion poor crop productivity land degradation etc and these issues are exacerbated by spatio temporal variability of rainfall an integrated water management program iwmp is implemented by the department of rural development andhra pradesh in the watershed to increase the water availability for agriculture and consequently mitigate ecological and socio economic problems of the watershed various water conservation measures such as farm ponds check dams percolation tanks infiltration trenches and rock filled dams are being implemented under iwmp in this watershed these water conservation measures are essential in the watershed to maintain soil moisture levels during the crop growing period july to january as the majority of rainfall is received between mid july to mid october in the form of high intensity short duration storms the soil and land use maps used in this study are obtained from the department of rural development andhra pradesh the soil in the watershed is classified into 10 different classes based on the percentage of sand silt and clay and the majority of the area belongs to silty clay and silty clay loam the physical properties of the soil are derived using pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 from the textural classification land use data from the global dataset of waterbase was used to complement the land use information from department of rural development the dem of 30 m resolution was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm database and slope map was derived using this dem the derived thematic layers of input variables slope runoff potential and soil permeability are shown in fig 4 4 2 fis model application the derived thematic layers of the input variables slope soil permeability and runoff potential for the kondepi watershed were in a raster format with a spatial resolution of 30 m each pixel i e every 30 m 30 m grid cell of the raster had a specific value for the slope soil permeability and runoff potential in the first step of fuzzification the membership of the each pixel of the input variables was evaluated for different classes using the membership values for different classes the fuzzy rules were evaluated for each pixel and the membership for the output classes was obtained the obtained output membership value was defuzzified to get a crisp output for each pixel and the suitability maps were generated based on the defuzzified output the developed suitability maps were compared against the existing rwh structures in the watershed the existing rwh structures were located and constructed by the iwmp considering only socio economic factors through the participatory watershed management the type of the structure and location of the structure were decided based on the stakeholders preference and biophysical factors were not considered in the decision making process while considering only socio economic factors improves the maintenance of the rwh structures by the stakeholders they may not perform the intended purpose 5 results and discussions 5 1 map of fuzzified slope as discussed earlier the fuzzificaiton of the slope variable classifies the range of slope of watershed into different classes using the criteria in table 2 and accordingly the slope in the kondepi watershed fig 4 b slope ranges from 0 to 11 97 is classified into classes a low and b medium note that this watershed did not have slope in high class above 20 see table 2 the fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of fuzzified low and medium slope classes as evident from fig 5 a most of the watershed area falls into the low slope category which is highly suitable for water harvesting structures there are some areas of the watershed that have been classified into medium slope class it can be seen from fig 5 a and 5 b that some of the locations belong to both low and medium class but with varying degree of belongingness according to the mf values this indicates that these locations have varying degree of suitability of water harvesting structures according to the slope variable 5 2 map of fuzzified soil permeability the soil permeability of the area defines the function of water harvesting structure as a surface storage structure or groundwater recharge structure since a major portion of the watershed has silty clay and silty clay loam which have low soil permeability the water harvesting structures will be mostly of surface storage structures the soil permeability of the watershed varied from 0 3 cm day to 31 cm day fig 4 c and is classified into 3 classes a low b medium and c high the fig 6 depicts the spatial distribution of the low and medium soil permeability classes for the watershed as can be seen from the fig 6 whole of the watershed is classified into low category and more than 2 3rd of the watershed is also classified under the medium category which indicates an overlap between categories for this variable too however degree of belongingness of the area to the low and medium categories is varying according to the mf values it is to be noted that the watershed doesn t have any area under high soil permeability category 5 3 map of fuzzified runoff potential the runoff potential of the area indicates the runoff generation capacity of the area the runoff potential of the study area varied from 70 to 90 and is classified into 3 classes a low b medium and c high the spatial distribution of the runoff potential in the watershed fig 7 show that most of the watershed is classified in high runoff potential class with a limited area under medium class and no area under low class similar to the slope and soil permeability two of the runoff potential classes have overlapped but with varying degree of belongingness surface storage water harvesting structures favor high and medium runoff potential classes while groundwater recharge structures favor the low runoff potential areas 5 4 site suitability for water harvesting structures the fis generated site suitability map for check dam farm pond and percolation tank are presented in fig 8 most of the area in the watershed falls in low slope category and most of the locations have low permeability a combination that is highly suitable for check dams the fis classified nearly 94 of the area as highly suitable for check dam installation the remaining area is equally shared between low and medium suitability for the check dam a cross examination of the maps of check dam suitability and soil indicates that the area that are classified as low suitability for check dams is with soil that has relatively more silt content compared to other soil types present in the watershed the areas that have more silt content in the soil are relatively more permeable and hence cannot hold water for a longer duration a few locations under the medium suitability for check dams is due to the medium slope gradient in these areas it should be noted that the check dams are constructed across a water course and the locations have to be decided considering this factor therefore even though 94 of the total area is classified under high suitability class for check dams the actual potential locations are only along the drainage lines of the watershed the existing check dams in the watershed showed a good agreement with the generated check dam suitability map as can be seen from fig 8 a similar to the check dam suitability farm ponds are also suitable for areas with low slope and low soil permeability since most of the area in the watershed falls in the low slope and the low permeability category majority of the area 99 is under high farm pond suitability class there is a negligible area under low suitability in the watershed a cross examination of the slope map and farm pond suitability map indicates that the areas with low suitability of farm ponds are the areas classified as medium slope in medium and high slope areas larger farm ponds need to be installed to increase the storage compared to the farm ponds installed in low slopes since farm ponds are on farm structures and cropping area is lost for implementation of farm ponds these structures are not preferred in medium to high slope areas the existing farm ponds in the watershed showed a good agreement with the generated farm pond suitability map fig 8b the purpose of percolation tanks in the watershed is to recharge the groundwater and improve the groundwater levels generally these structures are implemented on permeable soils for easy recharge of groundwater since the watershed is primarily consisting of silty clay and silty clay loam soils which have low permeability percolation tanks suitability is less similar results are obtained from the developed fis where the entire watershed area is classified under the not suitable category fig 8 c there is a very small area 0 01 under the medium suitability class the watershed has few existing percolation tanks as shown in the fig 8 c these tanks in reality serve the purpose of larger farm ponds rather than facilitating as groundwater recharge structures therefore these percolation tanks will not work effectively for the purpose that it is intended to serve 5 5 sensitivity of fis parameters on output the classification of the watershed locations for water harvesting structure suitability by the fis model for kondepi watershed is in concurrence with the spatial variability of the input variables the validity of the suitability maps is verified with the locations of the existing structures in this basin nonetheless the output of the fis is highly dependent of the fuzzy parameters of the fuzzy variables in the fis which categorizes the input variable into different classes as mentioned earlier the fuzzy mf parameters for the input variables in this study has been obtained from literature and expert knowledge therefore there is certainly a level of subjectivity in these mf parameters consequently an analysis was planned to check the sensitivity of these mf parameters on the final suitability maps the impact of the mf parameters on the developed maps was evaluated through performing monte carlo simulations 1000 number of the fis model by perturbing the mf parameters within a range of 10 to 10 of the suggested value the change in area of suitability with the suggested value combination of mf parameters as reference is considered as a measure of sensitivity and 5 change is considered to be significant a plot of the percentage change in suitability area against the percentage change in the mf parameter is presented in fig 9 for all the three input variables it is observed that a deviation of 3 5 for the permeability mf parameters results in a significant change in the locations that are suitable for check dams the mf parameters for runoff potential did not exhibit any sensitivity on the output however slope showed a good degree of sensitivity in the final suitability maps but with small amount 1 of change in suitability area the change in area from one suitability class to a different suitability class was increasing when the mf parameters for slope were perturbed from the expert suggested value to identify the spatial locations of the change in the areas in suitability classes two random simulation results fig 11 which had a change in the suitability area 5 were selected for analysis a cross examination of the spatial distribution of the check dam suitable areas where the suitability class of check dams has changed significantly and the soil permeability map indicated that the changed areas have the same soil group the soil textural class of this area belonged to the silty clay loam with relatively more silt content the permeability of this soil is 29 cm day which was classified to fall in both low and medium classes a perturbation of 3 5 and more of the mf parameters resulted in a change of belongingness of the low and medium classes for these areas thus resulting in change of suitability class from high to low no clear trends were visible for farm pond suitability as can be seen from the fig 10 there are a few simulations that exhibit a change in suitability area for farm pond greater than 5 fig 10 possibly due to the combined effect of change of parameters of all the three input variables a few locations in the watershed experience a change in suitability from high to low for farm ponds fig 12 two randomly selected simulations from the monte carlo experiment and similar to the check dams these areas also belong to the same soil class 6 summary and conclusions a fis model is developed in this study to identify suitable zone for check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks in rainfed agricultural watersheds the suitability zones were identified using the slope soil permeability and runoff potential as input variables to the fis trapezoidal mf was considered for the input and output variables for the fuzzy model and mf parameters were obtained from literature and expert knowledge the developed model was applied to kondepi watershed andhra pradesh india to delineate the suitability zones for the three water harvesting structures the fis categorized the majority of the watershed area into high suitability class for both farm ponds and check dams the watershed characteristics were not conducive for percolation tanks according to the fis a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the fuzzy model to evaluate the impacts of the mf parameters on the output suitability classes input mf parameters were perturbed between 10 to 10 of the expert suggested values the results showed that check dam suitability zones was sensitive to the soil permeability classes the other variables classes were not sensitive to identify the check dam suitability in the case of farm pond suitability all the three variables did not show significant sensitivity confirming the experts suggestion for mf parameters the fis suggested suitability maps were in good agreement with the existing rwh structures in kondepi watershed except for percolation tanks the percolation tanks in the watershed were probably constructed considering socio economic factors the fis suggested suitability maps can hence be used to help take appropriate decisions in the participatory watershed management program 
11046,watershed management wm aims at enhancing the water availability in rainfed areas through water conservation structures which facilitate storage of water and recharge to ground water identification of suitable locations for placing these structures play a major role in the effectiveness of the water conservation site suitability evaluation of water conservation structures is performed through an assessment of various biophysical and socio economic factors many of these factors are expressed in linguistic terms rather than precise numeric values and therefore the output of the evaluation gets subjective in this study a fuzzy inference system fis is developed for site selection of water harvesting structures check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks owing to its capability to handle linguistic data effectively the suitability zones were identified using the slope soil permeability and runoff potential as input variables to the fis trapezoidal membership function mf was considered for the input and output variables for the fuzzy model and mf parameters were obtained from literature and expert knowledge the developed fis is illustrated through an application to kondepi watershed andhra pradesh india the fis categorized the majority of the watershed area into high suitability class for both farm ponds and check dams however the watershed characteristics were not conducive for percolation tanks according to the fis a sensitivity analysis of the fis parameters suggested that the check dam suitability was sensitive to the soil permeability classes the suitability maps from the fis were in good agreement with the location of the existing structures in the watershed suggesting potential use of the developed fis in wm decisions keywords fuzzy inference system water harvesting structures watershed management site suitability 1 introduction watershed management wm strategies such as rain water harvesting rwh enhance the land productivity by enhancing the water availability for rainfed agriculture in arid and semi arid regions adham et al 2016a 2016b kahinda et al 2008 singh et al 2017 wani and garg 2009 the success and sustainability of these wm programs depend on the identification of suitable sites and technical design of water harvesting structures adham et al 2016a al adamat et al 2012 de winnaar et al 2007 the food and agricultural organization fao suggested guidelines for site selection for rwh structures based on six different criteria which include climate hydrology topography agronomy soil and socio economics kahinda et al 2008 in addition many additional factors based on the field conditions have also been considered for site selection de winnaar et al 2007 kahinda et al 2008 mbilinyi et al 2007 padmavathy et al 1993 prinz et al 1998 senay and verdin 2004 these factors can be broadly classified into two categories biophysical rainfall slope soil type drainage network etc and socio economic distance to streams distance to settlements etc the biophysical characteristics of the site determine the rwh structures suitability in terms of their applicability and use to the stakeholders and the socio economic factors determine the intended beneficiaries and equitable distribution of resources among the various stakeholders etc in the recent years the socio economic factors are considered through participatory watershed management approaches while biophysical factors are considered for developing suitability maps that help in taking wm decisions since the site suitability for rwh structures require handling and analysing different criteria multi criteria analysis mca appraoch is used by many researchers de winnaar et al 2007 durbude and venkatesh 2004 mwenge kahinda et al 2009 sekar and randhir 2007 some of the common mca methods such as analytical hierarchy process weighted overlay process weighted linear combination and boolean method have been employed in different wm studies adham et al 2016a al adamat 2008 al adamat et al 2010 krois and schulte 2014 mwenge kahinda et al 2009 sekar and randhir 2007 one of the limitation for mca techniques in site suitability analysis for rwh structures is that mca require the inputs to be in the form of numerical values while most of the attributes considered for the site suitability analysis are generally in qualitative forms thus for application of mca methods the qualitative information needs to be converted to numerical values consequently the effectiveness of the decisions arrived using mca methods is influenced by the accuracy of the input data and the expertise of the decision maker hence the conversion of the qualitative information into quantitative input data needs careful consideration and fuzzy logic based mca approaches have been proven to be very effective in such cases nayak et al 2005 reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 sasikala et al 1996 fuzzy inference systems fis is one such approach that has the ability to deal with an evaluation and assessment of imprecise and uncertain data and thus have an advantage over traditional mca techniques reshmidevi et al 2009 tsiko and haile 2011 as mentioned earlier most of the attributes for site suitability analysis of the rwh structures are qualitative in nature and a quantitative classification of these attributed to various classes is difficult to achieve the fis adopts a fuzzy set theory as opposed to the classical set theory adopted by traditional mca techniques a variable element in classical set theory adopts only two values true one if the variable belongs to the set or false zero if the variable does not belong to the set while in fuzzy set theory the sharp boundaries between the sets is replaced by the concept of degree of membership thus a variable can belong to the fuzzy set with its membership ranging from 0 to 1 hence with the concept of degree of membership the fuzzy sets and fis account for the linguistic uncertainty in the qualitative input data in addition fis simplifies the mca process by splitting complex decisions into small criteria reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 each criterion of the mca problem or knowledge is expressed using if then rules in the fis the if part contains the conditions to be satisfied and then part contains the conclusions the final decision is arrived at by aggregating the output from each rule fis approach is reported to be successful in problems involving multi criteria based decision making that use qualitative information such as land suitability evaluations for agriculture and identification of potential soil erosion zones adriaenssens et al 2004 dixon 2005 kweon 2012 reshmidevi et al 2009 sasikala et al 1996 tsiko and haile 2011 in this paper a fis for site suitability evaluation of rwh techniques in rainfed agricultural watershed is presented this study considered only biophysical factors for site suitability in fis as it is envisaged that the fis output will complement the participatory approach of decision making accordingly attributes related to the biophysical criteria soil permeability runoff potential and slope were considered for site suitability evaluation of rwh structures the developed site suitability maps would aid the decision makers and local stakeholders in arriving at more efficient decisions the fis approach is demonstrated through a case study of rwh structures check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks site suitability in kondepi watershed prakasam district of andhra pradesh india 2 fuzzy inference system the fis is a rule based system comprising of three components a rule base that consists of a collection of fuzzy if then rules a database that defines the membership function mf of the input output variables used in the fuzzy rules and a reasoning procedure that aggregates the output from fuzzy rules to arrive at a reasonable conclusion nayak et al 2005 while the input variables can be presented to the fis either as crisp values or fuzzy set the output from an fis is generally a fuzzy set consequently the fuzzy output requires defuzzificaiton in order to take decisions based on fis output the if then rules in the fis facilitate a nonlinear mapping between the input and output space of the system being modeled the fuzzy rules split the total input output space into a number of local regions and each rule represents the local behavior of the nonlinear mapping therefore the efficacy of the fis is largely dependent on the number of fuzzy rules it is to note that while the efficacy of the fis increases with increase in number of rules as the inference space increases with rules formulating high number of rules is a tedious task there are two approaches in the fis development i the mamdani approach mamdani and assilian 1975 and ii the takagi sugeno approach takagi and sugeno 1985 for the mamdani approach there are three clear procedures i e fuzzification of the input variables logic decision and defuzzification of the fis output the takagi sugeno approach however does not have an explicit defuzzification procedure rather it amalgamates the logic decision and defuzzification procedures into one composite procedure application of the takagi sugeno approach in hydrology has been mostly to function approximation nayak et al 2005 the mamdani approach has been used in some site suitability applications reshmidevi et al 2009 and is also employed in this study in the mamdani approach the first procedure of fuzzification assigns the degree of membership of various classes to the input variables the second procedure evaluates the fuzzy rules from the rule base for the degree of membership of input variables the degree of membership of the input variables to different classes determines the contribution of a rule to the possible value of the output variable the third procedure of defuzzification involves conversion of the fuzzified output to a crisp value the detailed procedures and methodology for the three processes is described in the subsequent sections 3 fis for site suitability of rwh structures water harvesting structures in wm program are aimed at increasing land productivity by improving the soil moisture and water availability for agriculture the commonly employed water harvesting structures include check dams farm ponds percolation tanks recharge wells and injection wells these structures serve the dual purpose of facilitating recharge to ground water as well as for direct use of water in this study we have considered check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks for the site suitability analysis the criteria for site suitability for these rwh structures based on biophysical factors napoli et al 2014 ramakrishnan et al 2009 rao and bhaumik 2003 is presented in table 1 it is evident from the table 1 that the defined criteria for different variables are in qualitative terms and therefore the class definition for each variable may be highly subjective in different applications consequently no consistency is observed in the site selection criteria across different studies as described the development of fis involves fuzzification of attributes generation of fuzzy rules aggregation of rules and defuzzification to find crisp suitability class in this study three biophysical criteria soil permeability runoff potential and slope were considered as input variables to the fis for evaluating the site suitability of check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks the three input variables were classified into 3 fuzzy classes in terms of suitability viz low medium and high to pair with the suggested site suitability criteria table 1 fuzzy rules were generated based on the selection criteria for check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks detailed description of different components of the fis is presented in the following sections 3 1 fuzzification fuzzification is the process by which the crisp attribute values are mapped into common range 0 1 by using mf a mf used within the fis is a function which returns the degree of the truth membership grade possibility for a given variable and it indicates the degree of belongingness of the variable to a specific class the mf for a variable needs to be defined in terms of its crisp quantitative value while there are various choices for the mf trapezoidal mf eq 1 is assumed for all the variables in this study trapezoidal mf has a flat top and has 4 parameters a b c and d 2 shoulder and 2 base parameters a and d correspond to the base of the trapezoid b and c correspond to the shoulder of the trapezoid class boundaries of the fuzzy variables for trapezoidal mf are defined as ross 2004 zadeh 1965 1 f x a b c d 0 d x a x a b a a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d where f is the trapezoidal mf of a variable x a b c and d are the four parameters which depict the shape of the trapezoidal function 3 2 description of mf for the input attributes for site suitability 3 2 1 slope slope is an important factor in selection of the suitable site for rwh structures as it controls the size of the structure and the quantity of water that can be stored areas with high slope are not suitable for surface storage structures as it requires a large structure in terms of height to store a significant amount of water areas with medium or low slope are more suitable sites as storage capacity can be increased even with smaller structures in this study slope is classified into 3 classes as mentioned earlier low medium and high the mf for each class of slope can be computed from eqs 2 4 for various values of the slope in this equation slope is expressed in terms of percentage if μ s l μ s m and μ s h are the mf for the classes low medium and high then 2 μ s l f s a s l b s l c s l d s l 3 μ s m f s a s m b s m c s m d s m 4 μ s h f s a s h b s h c s h d s h where the function f s a b c d is as defined in eq 1 s is the slope and the subscripts sl sm and sh indicate that mf parameters a b c and d belong to the low medium and high classes of slope 3 2 2 soil permeability soil permeability is the physical property of the soil which shows the readiness of soil to transport water through the soil soil permeability is also an important factor in the effectiveness of water harvesting structure the water harvesting structures for surface water storage to aid rainfed agriculture are more suitable in areas with low values of soil permeability similar to slope the soil permeability is also classified into low medium and high classes if μ p l μ p m and μ p h are the mf for the classes low medium and high then 5 μ p l f p a p l b p l c p l d p l 6 μ p m f p a p m b p m c p m d p m 7 μ p h f p a p h b p h c p h d p h where the function f p a b c d is as defined in eq 1 p is the soil permeability cm day and the subscripts pl pm and ph indicate that mf parameters a b c and d belong to the low medium and high classes of soil permeability 3 2 3 runoff potential runoff potential of a location implies the ability of the location to generate runoff and consequently the volume of water that can be captured by the rwh structures the runoff volume from a location catchment can be estimated using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method generally runoff potential maps are generated by simulating the runoff using the scs cn method for a 67 dependable rainfall 67 dependable rainfall is the amount of rainfall with an average recurrence interval of 1 5 years de winnaar et al 2007 mwenge kahinda et al 2009 ramakrishnan et al 2009 the runoff generated for this rainfall at various locations is then categorized into different classes to generate the runoff potential maps it is to note the cn is a function of hydrologic soil group land use and antecedent moisture condition and the runoff potential of an area is directly proportional to the value of cn i e a higher cn indicates a higher runoff potential hence the runoff potential map generated from the simulated runoff would be similar to the cn map of the catchment therefore it is rational to use cn directly as an indicator of runoff potential and is employed in this study similar to other variables runoff potential also is divided into 3 classes namely low medium and high in this study if μ r l μ r m and μ r h are the mf for the classes low medium and high then 8 μ r l f r a r l b r l c r l d r l 9 μ r m f r a r m b r m c r m d r m 10 μ r h f r a r h b r h c r h d r h where the function f r a b c d is as defined in eq 1 and r is the runoff potential and the subscripts rl rm and rh indicate that mf parameters a b c and d belong to the low medium and high classes of runoff potential 3 2 4 parameters of mf for the input variables the mf parameters define the structure of the trapezoid curve with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1 generally the mf parameters are determined by the expert knowledge and or are generated using measured data and the procedure depends on the availability of data and proposed application various researchers have used optimization techniques to identify the best set of mf parameters for the specific application of fis adriaenssens et al 2004 dai et al 2016 li and guo 2015 however in this study due to the limitation of available data to validate the developed fis output with the observed data mf parameters are determined based on literature survey and expert knowledge the mf parameters of the fuzzy sets map the input variable into a number of fuzzy regions with overlap unlike the classical sets having crisp boundaries nayak et al 2005 reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 the advantage of fuzzy sets is that the overlap of the fuzzy region makes the element to be partial in the set and also the transition from one region to another is gradual fig 1 depicts the mf of the different classes considered for the input variables as is evident from the figure the mf of different classes overlap with each other and an element would have a membership in different classes the mf of the input variables overlap each other as shown in fig 1 for example in fig 1 a a value of 8 slope falls in both low and medium class with varying degree of belongingness as the mf for each class overlap the value of 8 of slope would have a membership value of 0 2 0 8 and 0 for low medium and high classes respectively it is to note the summation of the membership values for different classes of an element should be equal to one similarly figs 1 b and 1 c depict the mf of soil permeability and runoff potential the mf parameters of the three input variables for each class derived from the expert knowledge are presented in table 2 3 3 development of the fis for rwh suitability 3 3 1 fuzzy rule base the fuzzy rule base developed in this study is based on the literature adham et al 2016a kadam et al 2012 ramakrishnan et al 2009 rao and bhaumik 2003 and the expert knowledge as discussed earlier each of the 3 input variables are classified into 3 classes making a total of 27 if then rules in the fis the fuzzy outputs from the fis are classified into 4 groups viz not suitable low suitability medium suitability and highly suitable note that all the three variables are given equal weightage in the fis rules and a typical example of fis rules are if soil permeability is low and slope is low and runoff potential is high then check dam suitability is high farm pond is high percolation tank is not suitable if soil permeability is low and slope is low and runoff potential is medium then check dam suitability is high farm pond is high percolation tank is not suitable if soil permeability is high and slope is low and runoff potential is low then check dam suitability is not suitable farm pond is not suitable percolation tank is medium if soil permeability is low and slope is high and runoff potential is low then check dam suitability is low farm pond is not suitable percolation tank is medium each rule in the rule base considers a combination of the fuzzy class of the input variables and specifies the appropriate degree of membership in class of suitability for the water harvesting structure 3 3 2 aggregation of rules the overall site suitability for the water harvesting structure is determined by combining the output from all the fuzzy rules this process of obtaining the final output from the rule base is called aggregation of rules in this study mamdani implication method reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 tsiko and haile 2011 is adopted which is a maximum minimum aggregation method in this method minimum among the attribute mf of a criterion is selected the corresponding outputs from all the rules are aggregated using the fuzzy union operator where the maximum values are selected from the set of outputs from each rule as follows eq 11 reshmidevi et al 2009 ross 2004 11 s u i t a b i l i t y μ max min μ c k v a r i a b l e 1 μ c k v a r i a b l e 2 μ c k v a r i a b l e 3 k 1 2 27 n u m b e r o f r u l e s and c 1 2 3 where s u i t a b i l i t y μ is the membership grade of the suitability μ is the mf of the input variable c is the membership class of the input variable in rule k and the variable1 variable 2 and variable 3 are the input variables to the fis schematic representation of the developed fis is shown in fig 2 the inference engine considers the fuzzified input variables and evaluates all the fuzzy rules and the output of the all rules is aggregated to get the fuzzified output which are defuzzified to arrive at the suitability class 3 3 3 defuzzification of the fis output in the mamdani approach of aggregation of rules the output of the fis is a fuzzy variable and needs to be defuzzified to the decision domain several defuzzification methods are available in the literature some of the commonly used methods are maximum membership principle mean maximum membership ross 2004 weighted average method reshmidevi et al 2009 centroid method ross 2004 and use of inflection points sicat et al 2005 this study used maximum membership principle for defuzzification in this method the maximum of the largest membership value of suitability class is taken as the most representative value 4 demonstrative case example the developed fis is envisaged to be used for developing the site suitability maps of the water harvesting structures in a given watershed to aid the participatory watershed management the fis is applied to a study watershed under rainfed agriculture in india and is discussed in the following section 4 1 description of the study area the developed fis is applied to kondepi watershed near kondepi mandal prakasam district andhra pradesh in india fig 3 the watershed has a total geographical area of 4157 ha and a net cropped area of about 1100 ha the watershed lies between latitudes 15 23 n and 15 25 n and longitudes 79 48 e and 79 53 e and falls under the sub tropical climate with average annual rainfall of about 690 mm elevation of the watershed ranges from 18 8 m to 71 3 m the agricultural practices are rainfed in this watershed except 20 ha 0 2 of the cropped area which is cropped using drip irrigation with water drawn from groundwater only a few tube wells are in working condition in the watershed with ground water level at 350 m below the surface primary crops grown in the watershed include tobacco nicotiana tabcum red gram cajanus cajan bengal gram cicer arietinum groundnut arachis hypogaea and rice oryza sativa the watershed is plagued with agro ecological problems such as soil erosion poor crop productivity land degradation etc and these issues are exacerbated by spatio temporal variability of rainfall an integrated water management program iwmp is implemented by the department of rural development andhra pradesh in the watershed to increase the water availability for agriculture and consequently mitigate ecological and socio economic problems of the watershed various water conservation measures such as farm ponds check dams percolation tanks infiltration trenches and rock filled dams are being implemented under iwmp in this watershed these water conservation measures are essential in the watershed to maintain soil moisture levels during the crop growing period july to january as the majority of rainfall is received between mid july to mid october in the form of high intensity short duration storms the soil and land use maps used in this study are obtained from the department of rural development andhra pradesh the soil in the watershed is classified into 10 different classes based on the percentage of sand silt and clay and the majority of the area belongs to silty clay and silty clay loam the physical properties of the soil are derived using pedo transfer functions saxton and rawls 2006 soundharajan and sudheer 2009 from the textural classification land use data from the global dataset of waterbase was used to complement the land use information from department of rural development the dem of 30 m resolution was obtained from shuttle radar topography mission srtm database and slope map was derived using this dem the derived thematic layers of input variables slope runoff potential and soil permeability are shown in fig 4 4 2 fis model application the derived thematic layers of the input variables slope soil permeability and runoff potential for the kondepi watershed were in a raster format with a spatial resolution of 30 m each pixel i e every 30 m 30 m grid cell of the raster had a specific value for the slope soil permeability and runoff potential in the first step of fuzzification the membership of the each pixel of the input variables was evaluated for different classes using the membership values for different classes the fuzzy rules were evaluated for each pixel and the membership for the output classes was obtained the obtained output membership value was defuzzified to get a crisp output for each pixel and the suitability maps were generated based on the defuzzified output the developed suitability maps were compared against the existing rwh structures in the watershed the existing rwh structures were located and constructed by the iwmp considering only socio economic factors through the participatory watershed management the type of the structure and location of the structure were decided based on the stakeholders preference and biophysical factors were not considered in the decision making process while considering only socio economic factors improves the maintenance of the rwh structures by the stakeholders they may not perform the intended purpose 5 results and discussions 5 1 map of fuzzified slope as discussed earlier the fuzzificaiton of the slope variable classifies the range of slope of watershed into different classes using the criteria in table 2 and accordingly the slope in the kondepi watershed fig 4 b slope ranges from 0 to 11 97 is classified into classes a low and b medium note that this watershed did not have slope in high class above 20 see table 2 the fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of fuzzified low and medium slope classes as evident from fig 5 a most of the watershed area falls into the low slope category which is highly suitable for water harvesting structures there are some areas of the watershed that have been classified into medium slope class it can be seen from fig 5 a and 5 b that some of the locations belong to both low and medium class but with varying degree of belongingness according to the mf values this indicates that these locations have varying degree of suitability of water harvesting structures according to the slope variable 5 2 map of fuzzified soil permeability the soil permeability of the area defines the function of water harvesting structure as a surface storage structure or groundwater recharge structure since a major portion of the watershed has silty clay and silty clay loam which have low soil permeability the water harvesting structures will be mostly of surface storage structures the soil permeability of the watershed varied from 0 3 cm day to 31 cm day fig 4 c and is classified into 3 classes a low b medium and c high the fig 6 depicts the spatial distribution of the low and medium soil permeability classes for the watershed as can be seen from the fig 6 whole of the watershed is classified into low category and more than 2 3rd of the watershed is also classified under the medium category which indicates an overlap between categories for this variable too however degree of belongingness of the area to the low and medium categories is varying according to the mf values it is to be noted that the watershed doesn t have any area under high soil permeability category 5 3 map of fuzzified runoff potential the runoff potential of the area indicates the runoff generation capacity of the area the runoff potential of the study area varied from 70 to 90 and is classified into 3 classes a low b medium and c high the spatial distribution of the runoff potential in the watershed fig 7 show that most of the watershed is classified in high runoff potential class with a limited area under medium class and no area under low class similar to the slope and soil permeability two of the runoff potential classes have overlapped but with varying degree of belongingness surface storage water harvesting structures favor high and medium runoff potential classes while groundwater recharge structures favor the low runoff potential areas 5 4 site suitability for water harvesting structures the fis generated site suitability map for check dam farm pond and percolation tank are presented in fig 8 most of the area in the watershed falls in low slope category and most of the locations have low permeability a combination that is highly suitable for check dams the fis classified nearly 94 of the area as highly suitable for check dam installation the remaining area is equally shared between low and medium suitability for the check dam a cross examination of the maps of check dam suitability and soil indicates that the area that are classified as low suitability for check dams is with soil that has relatively more silt content compared to other soil types present in the watershed the areas that have more silt content in the soil are relatively more permeable and hence cannot hold water for a longer duration a few locations under the medium suitability for check dams is due to the medium slope gradient in these areas it should be noted that the check dams are constructed across a water course and the locations have to be decided considering this factor therefore even though 94 of the total area is classified under high suitability class for check dams the actual potential locations are only along the drainage lines of the watershed the existing check dams in the watershed showed a good agreement with the generated check dam suitability map as can be seen from fig 8 a similar to the check dam suitability farm ponds are also suitable for areas with low slope and low soil permeability since most of the area in the watershed falls in the low slope and the low permeability category majority of the area 99 is under high farm pond suitability class there is a negligible area under low suitability in the watershed a cross examination of the slope map and farm pond suitability map indicates that the areas with low suitability of farm ponds are the areas classified as medium slope in medium and high slope areas larger farm ponds need to be installed to increase the storage compared to the farm ponds installed in low slopes since farm ponds are on farm structures and cropping area is lost for implementation of farm ponds these structures are not preferred in medium to high slope areas the existing farm ponds in the watershed showed a good agreement with the generated farm pond suitability map fig 8b the purpose of percolation tanks in the watershed is to recharge the groundwater and improve the groundwater levels generally these structures are implemented on permeable soils for easy recharge of groundwater since the watershed is primarily consisting of silty clay and silty clay loam soils which have low permeability percolation tanks suitability is less similar results are obtained from the developed fis where the entire watershed area is classified under the not suitable category fig 8 c there is a very small area 0 01 under the medium suitability class the watershed has few existing percolation tanks as shown in the fig 8 c these tanks in reality serve the purpose of larger farm ponds rather than facilitating as groundwater recharge structures therefore these percolation tanks will not work effectively for the purpose that it is intended to serve 5 5 sensitivity of fis parameters on output the classification of the watershed locations for water harvesting structure suitability by the fis model for kondepi watershed is in concurrence with the spatial variability of the input variables the validity of the suitability maps is verified with the locations of the existing structures in this basin nonetheless the output of the fis is highly dependent of the fuzzy parameters of the fuzzy variables in the fis which categorizes the input variable into different classes as mentioned earlier the fuzzy mf parameters for the input variables in this study has been obtained from literature and expert knowledge therefore there is certainly a level of subjectivity in these mf parameters consequently an analysis was planned to check the sensitivity of these mf parameters on the final suitability maps the impact of the mf parameters on the developed maps was evaluated through performing monte carlo simulations 1000 number of the fis model by perturbing the mf parameters within a range of 10 to 10 of the suggested value the change in area of suitability with the suggested value combination of mf parameters as reference is considered as a measure of sensitivity and 5 change is considered to be significant a plot of the percentage change in suitability area against the percentage change in the mf parameter is presented in fig 9 for all the three input variables it is observed that a deviation of 3 5 for the permeability mf parameters results in a significant change in the locations that are suitable for check dams the mf parameters for runoff potential did not exhibit any sensitivity on the output however slope showed a good degree of sensitivity in the final suitability maps but with small amount 1 of change in suitability area the change in area from one suitability class to a different suitability class was increasing when the mf parameters for slope were perturbed from the expert suggested value to identify the spatial locations of the change in the areas in suitability classes two random simulation results fig 11 which had a change in the suitability area 5 were selected for analysis a cross examination of the spatial distribution of the check dam suitable areas where the suitability class of check dams has changed significantly and the soil permeability map indicated that the changed areas have the same soil group the soil textural class of this area belonged to the silty clay loam with relatively more silt content the permeability of this soil is 29 cm day which was classified to fall in both low and medium classes a perturbation of 3 5 and more of the mf parameters resulted in a change of belongingness of the low and medium classes for these areas thus resulting in change of suitability class from high to low no clear trends were visible for farm pond suitability as can be seen from the fig 10 there are a few simulations that exhibit a change in suitability area for farm pond greater than 5 fig 10 possibly due to the combined effect of change of parameters of all the three input variables a few locations in the watershed experience a change in suitability from high to low for farm ponds fig 12 two randomly selected simulations from the monte carlo experiment and similar to the check dams these areas also belong to the same soil class 6 summary and conclusions a fis model is developed in this study to identify suitable zone for check dams farm ponds and percolation tanks in rainfed agricultural watersheds the suitability zones were identified using the slope soil permeability and runoff potential as input variables to the fis trapezoidal mf was considered for the input and output variables for the fuzzy model and mf parameters were obtained from literature and expert knowledge the developed model was applied to kondepi watershed andhra pradesh india to delineate the suitability zones for the three water harvesting structures the fis categorized the majority of the watershed area into high suitability class for both farm ponds and check dams the watershed characteristics were not conducive for percolation tanks according to the fis a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the fuzzy model to evaluate the impacts of the mf parameters on the output suitability classes input mf parameters were perturbed between 10 to 10 of the expert suggested values the results showed that check dam suitability zones was sensitive to the soil permeability classes the other variables classes were not sensitive to identify the check dam suitability in the case of farm pond suitability all the three variables did not show significant sensitivity confirming the experts suggestion for mf parameters the fis suggested suitability maps were in good agreement with the existing rwh structures in kondepi watershed except for percolation tanks the percolation tanks in the watershed were probably constructed considering socio economic factors the fis suggested suitability maps can hence be used to help take appropriate decisions in the participatory watershed management program 
11047,in midwestern agricultural fields subsurface tile drainage has been widely used to remove excess water from the soil through perforated tubes installed beneath the ground surface while it plays an important role in enabling agricultural activities in wet but productive areas this system is a major driving factor affecting water and nutrient dynamics and water quality in this region however despite its critical role the specific locations of subsurface tile drainage structures are not generally available nor well captured by conventional optical image processing due to soil surface features such as topographic depressions and tillage to overcome these challenges in this study we have explored the potential of using thermal images to identify the location of a subsurface drainage pipe the hypothesis is that the unique spatial distribution of soil moisture set up by tile drains can result in the difference in surface soil temperature between areas near and away from drainage pipes toward this objective we designed and developed an experimental device based on a dimensionless analysis at a scale of 1 20 which was deployed in the open air for 4 5 months the experimental results demonstrate that 1 there is an ideal time for thermal image acquisition that maximizes the contrast between the regions close to and distant from subsurface drainage systems and 2 the thermal image processing approach proposed in this study is a promising tool that has advantages of higher accuracy and stability in localizing subsurface drainage pipes over optical image based approaches keywords tile drain thermal image nitrogen loss image processing 1 introduction subsurface tile drainage systems have been widely used for water management technique to remove excess water from the poorly drained soils in the midwestern united states for more than 100 years pavelis 1987 approximately 85 percent of croplands in this region have subsurface tile drainage systems pavelis 1987 sugg 2007 jaynes et al 2010 in general 0 25 m diameter tile at 1 3 m depth is installed at 20 m spacing although a proper configuration of the tile layout for a given field is highly dependent on soil type slopes surface conditions and crops fraser and fleming 2001 wright and sands 2001 tile outlets are generally located at drainage ditches waterways streams and or wetlands most crops require specific soil moisture conditions for their growth and do not tolerate and survive well in soils that are constantly wet tile drain systems enable earlier planting kornecki and fouss 2001 and improve soil aeration lal and taylor 1970 fausey 2005 therefore high crop yields are attained cannell et al 1979 du et al 2005 for example helmers et al 2017 observed a 10 percent increase in average corn yield and a 5 percent increase in average soybean yield compared to sites without subsurface drainage therefore it is out of great necessity to achieve increases in crop yields in wet but productive areas by avoiding crop mortality due to waterlogging zucker and brown 1998 despite the advantages of drainage tile systems they can also increase nutrient losses through the root zone by channeling subsurface water runoff to tile drainage which increases riverine nutrient loads and subsequent degradation of receiving water bodies fausey et al 1995 li et al 2010 radcliffe et al 2015 woo and kumar 2019 to reduce nitrogen loss and increase crop nitrogen use efficiency the safe drainage time was estimated to be 11 16 days after fertilizer applications wang et al 2011 in addition li et al 2010 showed that approximately 80 of stream water and 90 of nitrate are contributed by tile drain flows in this region however the specific locations of tile drainage systems are not generally available allred et al 2018 hindering the spatial analysis and modeling there are several studies attempting to identify subsurface drain lines by employing soil physical properties land cover and aerial optical images naz and bowling 2008 conducted a decision tree classification to estimate potential tile drained areas and then perform image processing to locate subsurface tile drain pipes high resolution color infrared and surface slope data and directional first differential horizontal and vertical filtering techniques have been also used to improve the detections of tile drain locations northcott et al 1996 varner et al 2002 naz et al 2009 however none of these methods are able to attribute surface signatures arising from tile drains as distinct from other surface features such as topographic depressions and tillage such a distinction appears to be essential since the specific tile locations are highly desirable for performing accurate simulations of subsurface water and nutrient processes at fine spatial resolution 1 m e g woo and kumar 2019 and for identifying hot spots where the inputs of nutrient are produced in intensively managed agricultural landscape randall and iragavarapu 1995 dinnes et al 2002 the abovementioned background leads us to a point that the reliable prediction of subsurface tile drains cannot be achieved by using spatial optical images due to the existence of other surface features similar to tile drain lines such as tillage and machinery traffic verma and cooke 1996 naz et al 2009 to improve its accuracy we propose the use of thermal images instead that is a unique spatial distribution of soil moisture set up by tile drains can result in differences in surface soil temperature between near and distant points from tile drain pipes this is because a convex subsurface water potential between tile drains subsequent to precipitation fig 1 a provides distinct characteristics of soil heat capacity compared to the period long after precipitation fig 1b the reduction of moisture above the tile results in a decrease in soil heat capacity near tile drains thereby increasing in surface soil temperature therefore in this study we posit that the spatial variations in surface soil temperature resulting from soil moisture variation induced by tile drains are effective indicators to define the locations of subsurface tile drainage pipes the overarching objective of this study is to experimentally validate the feasibility of the use of thermal images to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems toward this objective we conducted downscaled experiments along with thermal image processing to investigate the extent to which using thermal images is a convincing experimental method to detect subsurface tile drains therefore in this study we are not striving to obtain large scale tile maps but rather to attempt to assess its feasibility by producing comparable macroscopic scale patterns and trends using a simplified experimental design 2 methods 2 1 experimental design a down scaled experimental setup was designed based on the dimensionless study used in shokri and bardsley 2014 at a scale of 1 20 as shown in fig 1c and d a perforated plastic drainage pipe was installed in the middle of the experimental domain 1 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 244 m high at the depth of 0 067 m in the direction of width two drainage outlets are located through the walls the internal diameter of the pipe was 0 013 m and five rows of 7 10 5 m 2 drain holes were drilled at every 0 035 m over the length of the pipe for drainage water to enter the dimensions used in this study enable dynamics and processes naturally occurring in tile drained agricultural fields to be reproduced the dimensions were also designed to meet the specific need of measurement and instrumentation systems maximizing the area covered by the thermal camera used in this study while minimizing blurring effects caused by the thermal camera an infrared camera t620 flir inc featuring the temperature resolution of 0 04 c was used to obtain surface thermal images for reference optical images were also acquired using the optical camera integrated with the infrared camera while thermal images were taken to create a soil environment similar to the agriculture field soils were collected from an agricultural field latitude 40 03 and longitude 88 66 in september 2017 which supported corn soybean rotation the soils were characterized as a mixture of ipava silt loam and sable silty clay loam that had relatively low hydraulic conductivity e g the typical range of saturated hydraulic conductivity is from 1 08 cm d 1 to 1 68 cm d 1 carsel and parrish 1988 with granular structure as a typical soil property in this area wilkins et al 2019 the soil sample was exposed to the natural environment so that soil surface energy dynamics with subsurface tile drainage systems can interact with natural weather conditions the experiments were conducted from october 1 2017 to february 15 2018 this testing period correspond to the non growing period that helps minimizing the error caused by a thick vegetation cover to allow time for the suppression of transients from the experimental setup due to disturbed soil conditions the experimental equipment was left deployed for a month and then we started obtaining thermal images thermal and optical images were taken to fully cover the surface of the experimental device and obtained around noon when the solar radiation was strong enough to heat up the surface and hence to enhance the contrast between the areas close to and distant from the subsurface drainage pipe within the sample surface although the thermal image collection was performed regularly throughout the testing period a strict daily based collection was not available mainly due to intermittent unfavorable weather conditions e g snows and heavy rains 2 2 tile detection algorithm to improve the accuracy of tile drain recognition we performed image processing on the thermal images also the study domain was reduced by 20 on each side for the image analysis to minimize boundary effects within the experimental device an overview of the developed tile detection algorithm is provided in fig 2 first a raw thermal image represented in the rgb colormap was converted into a gray scale image then denoising operation was performed by two dimensional 2 d median filtering to remove salt and paper like noise in the gray scale image acharya and ray 2005 the denoised image by the median filtering t med m n where m and n denote image dimension is given by 1 t med m n median t m k n l k l w where t m n is the raw thermal image and k l is the size of the window w the pixel values of t m n is replaced by the median value of the neighborhood in w here both k and l were set to be 20 in the next step thresholding was applied to the denoised image by assigning zero intensity to the pixels that had intensities lower than 80 percentile t 0 8 of t med m n shown as 2 t th t med m n if t med m n t 0 8 0 otherwise this thresholding operation was performed based on the spatial distribution of soil heat capacity that relatively low soil moisture conditions in the areas near tile drain pipes lead to higher temperature than the other areas once thresholding was complete locally separated entities in t th were detected and suppressed this processing was due to the structure of subsurface drainage systems that have geometrically linear and connected features next the location of the tile was estimated through local peak detection in this step the processed image was subdivided into six row images then pixel values were summed up in the vertical axis within a row image so that a 1 d summation signal is obtained the centroid of each 1 d signal was then obtained and it was mapped at the center of each subdivided row image linear regression was performed using the four center points to obtain a fitted line that represents the location of a tile pipe finally the detected tile location the fit line was mapped on the optical image representing the area captured by the original raw thermal image 3 results 3 1 thermal image selection to ensure the distinctive spatial patterns of soil moisture induced by tile drainage systems fig 1a as shown in fig 3 a we have obtained precipitation from an adjacent weather station latitude 40 03 and longitude 88 27 from weather underground https www wunderground com 10 km away from the location of the experimental device deployed for the purpose of comparison between surface soil and air temperatures we also show the latter in fig 3b we find that the optimum thermal image acquisition time that maximizes the contrast between the regions close to and distant from subsurface drainage pipe in thermal images is within 12 h after 2 54 mm of precipitation on the test sample fig 3c to m the threshold of 2 54 mm is determined based on previous studies e g mccabe et al 2010 and nakano et al 2011 which is often used to categorize a day as dry on the other hand there are no strong relationships between soil and atmospheric temperatures confirming our hypothesis that the surface soil temperature driven by tile drainage outweighs that redistributed by the thermal convection optical images fig 3n to r taken at the same time as the selected thermal images do not show any detectable feature linked to tile drain although identifiable cracks in the soil can be seen this observation demonstrates that the use of thermal images has potential to provide a better prediction of subsurface tile drain systems than that of optical images however it is still difficult to clearly delineate subsurface tile drains with raw thermal images thereby requiring image processing 3 2 identifying tile drainage systems the experimental results to identify the subsurface tile drainage system using the proposed method illustrated in fig 2 are shown in fig 4 raw thermal images obtained before introducing artificial tillage in the experimental setup are shown in fig 4 a and d these thermal images are those shown in fig 3 j and m respectively relatively high temperature distribution is observed above the tile location the center line of the image plane however the contrast between the region close to and distant from subsurface tile is not clear in the raw thermal images the processed images using the proposed method are shown in fig 4 b and e where the detected tile locations are also overlaid it is seen that the tile locations are clearly visualized but not in the raw thermal images finally the detected tile locations are mapped on optical images as shown in fig 4 c and f for clear comparison the location of the subsurface drainage pipe is indicated as black dotted lines the tile locations are well identified by the tile indicating line obtained by the proposed method note that without the mapped tile indicating line there is no clue to identify the location of the subsurface tile in the optical images the final mapped images demonstrate the potential of the proposed thermal image based approach and its superior tile detectability over conventional optical image based approaches see more results in fig a 1 in appendix 3 3 tillage effect in order to ensure that the detection algorithm is applicable in field conditions the effect of tillage on thermal variability needs to be accounted for to address this we created artificial tillage in the experimental setup to a depth of 0 6 cm

drained agricultural areas can be expressed and evaluated to simultaneously maximize the reliability of the thermal image processing algorism developed in this study the raw thermal processed and final optical images that correspond to the timeline after introducing tillage are shown in fig 4 g h and i respectively in the raw thermal image shown in fig 4 g the location of the subsurface tile is intuitively identified by the contrast between the region close to and distant from the tile drain also the effect of introducing tillage is negligible in the thermal image implying that the proposed thermal image based approach is less likely to mislead a tillage as a subsurface tile drainage pipe in addition the distinction between the regions with and without tile is much clearer in the processed image shown in fig 4 h finally the detected tile location is mapped onto the optical image in fig 4 i similar to the results obtained before the tillage introduction the location of the subsurface tile drain pipe is clearly detected even with tillage induced multiple surface line features 4 discussion and conclusions the surface temperature at a certain spatial point is governed by soil moisture that plays a dominant role in affecting soil heat capacity e g campbell and norman 1998 therefore the magnitude of the spatial distribution of soil heat capacity created by subsurface water table gradients toward a drainage tile after precipitation events should be highly influential in determining surface soil temperature based on this theoretical framework in this study we have explored and established the feasibility of using thermal images to identify subsurface tile drains rather than optical images in the downscaled experiment detecting subsurface tile drainage pipes has

clear tile delineation due to surface features such as tillage and topographic depressions naz and bowling 2008 a recent study by allred et al 2018 noted that surveys carried out by a drone with thermal infrared sensors could provide adequate representation of tile delineation the proposed approach showed consistent results with those shown in allred et al 2018 the superior performance of thermal images over optical images in subsurface tile detection in addition based on the experimental results the following conclusions are drawn 1 there is an optimal time for thermal image acquisition that maximizes the contrast between regions close to and distant from subsurface drainage tile systems 2 thermal images provide higher contrast between the regions close to and distant from subsurface drainage tile systems than optical images do and 3 the proposed thermal image processing approach successfully detects and localizes subsurface drainage pipes admittedly designing a downscaled experiment that can accurately represent a large scale experiment is often challenging to a certain degree the results obtained and methods presented in this study may be limiting and have unexpected flaws that may be discovered when they are deployed into an actual scale however given the experimental conditions and theory based approaches the feasibility of the use of thermal images for identifying subsurface tile drain pipes is proved by the experimental results therefore this study has potential to provide an effective and promising analytical tool that can be used to precisely locate subsurface tile drain systems over a large area acknowledgement we thank insun park for discussions that led to the implementation of this study and her zealous help in improving the manuscript

11047,in midwestern agricultural fields subsurface tile drainage has been widely used to remove excess water from the soil through perforated tubes installed beneath the ground surface while it plays an important role in enabling agricultural activities in wet but productive areas this system is a major driving factor affecting water and nutrient dynamics and water quality in this region however despite its critical role the specific locations of subsurface tile drainage structures are not generally available nor well captured by conventional optical image processing due to soil surface features such as topographic depressions and tillage to overcome these challenges in this study we have explored the potential of using thermal images to identify the location of a subsurface drainage pipe the hypothesis is that the unique spatial distribution of soil moisture set up by tile drains can result in the difference in surface soil temperature between areas near and away from drainage pipes toward this objective we designed and developed an experimental device based on a dimensionless analysis at a scale of 1 20 which was deployed in the open air for 4 5 months the experimental results demonstrate that 1 there is an ideal time for thermal image acquisition that maximizes the contrast between the regions close to and distant from subsurface drainage systems and 2 the thermal image processing approach proposed in this study is a promising tool that has advantages of higher accuracy and stability in localizing subsurface drainage pipes over optical image based approaches keywords tile drain thermal image nitrogen loss image processing 1 introduction subsurface tile drainage systems have been widely used for water management technique to remove excess water from the poorly drained soils in the midwestern united states for more than 100 years pavelis 1987 approximately 85 percent of croplands in this region have subsurface tile drainage systems pavelis 1987 sugg 2007 jaynes et al 2010 in general 0 25 m diameter tile at 1 3 m depth is installed at 20 m spacing although a proper configuration of the tile layout for a given field is highly dependent on soil type slopes surface conditions and crops fraser and fleming 2001 wright and sands 2001 tile outlets are generally located at drainage ditches waterways streams and or wetlands most crops require specific soil moisture conditions for their growth and do not tolerate and survive well in soils that are constantly wet tile drain systems enable earlier planting kornecki and fouss 2001 and improve soil aeration lal and taylor 1970 fausey 2005 therefore high crop yields are attained cannell et al 1979 du et al 2005 for example helmers et al 2017 observed a 10 percent increase in average corn yield and a 5 percent increase in average soybean yield compared to sites without subsurface drainage therefore it is out of great necessity to achieve increases in crop yields in wet but productive areas by avoiding crop mortality due to waterlogging zucker and brown 1998 despite the advantages of drainage tile systems they can also increase nutrient losses through the root zone by channeling subsurface water runoff to tile drainage which increases riverine nutrient loads and subsequent degradation of receiving water bodies fausey et al 1995 li et al 2010 radcliffe et al 2015 woo and kumar 2019 to reduce nitrogen loss and increase crop nitrogen use efficiency the safe drainage time was estimated to be 11 16 days after fertilizer applications wang et al 2011 in addition li et al 2010 showed that approximately 80 of stream water and 90 of nitrate are contributed by tile drain flows in this region however the specific locations of tile drainage systems are not generally available allred et al 2018 hindering the spatial analysis and modeling there are several studies attempting to identify subsurface drain lines by employing soil physical properties land cover and aerial optical images naz and bowling 2008 conducted a decision tree classification to estimate potential tile drained areas and then perform image processing to locate subsurface tile drain pipes high resolution color infrared and surface slope data and directional first differential horizontal and vertical filtering techniques have been also used to improve the detections of tile drain locations northcott et al 1996 varner et al 2002 naz et al 2009 however none of these methods are able to attribute surface signatures arising from tile drains as distinct from other surface features such as topographic depressions and tillage such a distinction appears to be essential since the specific tile locations are highly desirable for performing accurate simulations of subsurface water and nutrient processes at fine spatial resolution 1 m e g woo and kumar 2019 and for identifying hot spots where the inputs of nutrient are produced in intensively managed agricultural landscape randall and iragavarapu 1995 dinnes et al 2002 the abovementioned background leads us to a point that the reliable prediction of subsurface tile drains cannot be achieved by using spatial optical images due to the existence of other surface features similar to tile drain lines such as tillage and machinery traffic verma and cooke 1996 naz et al 2009 to improve its accuracy we propose the use of thermal images instead that is a unique spatial distribution of soil moisture set up by tile drains can result in differences in surface soil temperature between near and distant points from tile drain pipes this is because a convex subsurface water potential between tile drains subsequent to precipitation fig 1 a provides distinct characteristics of soil heat capacity compared to the period long after precipitation fig 1b the reduction of moisture above the tile results in a decrease in soil heat capacity near tile drains thereby increasing in surface soil temperature therefore in this study we posit that the spatial variations in surface soil temperature resulting from soil moisture variation induced by tile drains are effective indicators to define the locations of subsurface tile drainage pipes the overarching objective of this study is to experimentally validate the feasibility of the use of thermal images to map agricultural subsurface drainage systems toward this objective we conducted downscaled experiments along with thermal image processing to investigate the extent to which using thermal images is a convincing experimental method to detect subsurface tile drains therefore in this study we are not striving to obtain large scale tile maps but rather to attempt to assess its feasibility by producing comparable macroscopic scale patterns and trends using a simplified experimental design 2 methods 2 1 experimental design a down scaled experimental setup was designed based on the dimensionless study used in shokri and bardsley 2014 at a scale of 1 20 as shown in fig 1c and d a perforated plastic drainage pipe was installed in the middle of the experimental domain 1 m long 0 5 m wide and 0 244 m high at the depth of 0 067 m in the direction of width two drainage outlets are located through the walls the internal diameter of the pipe was 0 013 m and five rows of 7 10 5 m 2 drain holes were drilled at every 0 035 m over the length of the pipe for drainage water to enter the dimensions used in this study enable dynamics and processes naturally occurring in tile drained agricultural fields to be reproduced the dimensions were also designed to meet the specific need of measurement and instrumentation systems maximizing the area covered by the thermal camera used in this study while minimizing blurring effects caused by the thermal camera an infrared camera t620 flir inc featuring the temperature resolution of 0 04 c was used to obtain surface thermal images for reference optical images were also acquired using the optical camera integrated with the infrared camera while thermal images were taken to create a soil environment similar to the agriculture field soils were collected from an agricultural field latitude 40 03 and longitude 88 66 in september 2017 which supported corn soybean rotation the soils were characterized as a mixture of ipava silt loam and sable silty clay loam that had relatively low hydraulic conductivity e g the typical range of saturated hydraulic conductivity is from 1 08 cm d 1 to 1 68 cm d 1 carsel and parrish 1988 with granular structure as a typical soil property in this area wilkins et al 2019 the soil sample was exposed to the natural environment so that soil surface energy dynamics with subsurface tile drainage systems can interact with natural weather conditions the experiments were conducted from october 1 2017 to february 15 2018 this testing period correspond to the non growing period that helps minimizing the error caused by a thick vegetation cover to allow time for the suppression of transients from the experimental setup due to disturbed soil conditions the experimental equipment was left deployed for a month and then we started obtaining thermal images thermal and optical images were taken to fully cover the surface of the experimental device and obtained around noon when the solar radiation was strong enough to heat up the surface and hence to enhance the contrast between the areas close to and distant from the subsurface drainage pipe within the sample surface although the thermal image collection was performed regularly throughout the testing period a strict daily based collection was not available mainly due to intermittent unfavorable weather conditions e g snows and heavy rains 2 2 tile detection algorithm to improve the accuracy of tile drain recognition we performed image processing on the thermal images also the study domain was reduced by 20 on each side for the image analysis to minimize boundary effects within the experimental device an overview of the developed tile detection algorithm is provided in fig 2 first a raw thermal image represented in the rgb colormap was converted into a gray scale image then denoising operation was performed by two dimensional 2 d median filtering to remove salt and paper like noise in the gray scale image acharya and ray 2005 the denoised image by the median filtering t med m n where m and n denote image dimension is given by 1 t med m n median t m k n l k l w where t m n is the raw thermal image and k l is the size of the window w the pixel values of t m n is replaced by the median value of the neighborhood in w here both k and l were set to be 20 in the next step thresholding was applied to the denoised image by assigning zero intensity to the pixels that had intensities lower than 80 percentile t 0 8 of t med m n shown as 2 t th t med m n if t med m n t 0 8 0 otherwise this thresholding operation was performed based on the spatial distribution of soil heat capacity that relatively low soil moisture conditions in the areas near tile drain pipes lead to higher temperature than the other areas once thresholding was complete locally separated entities in t th were detected and suppressed this processing was due to the structure of subsurface drainage systems that have geometrically linear and connected features next the location of the tile was estimated through local peak detection in this step the processed image was subdivided into six row images then pixel values were summed up in the vertical axis within a row image so that a 1 d summation signal is obtained the centroid of each 1 d signal was then obtained and it was mapped at the center of each subdivided row image linear regression was performed using the four center points to obtain a fitted line that represents the location of a tile pipe finally the detected tile location the fit line was mapped on the optical image representing the area captured by the original raw thermal image 3 results 3 1 thermal image selection to ensure the distinctive spatial patterns of soil moisture induced by tile drainage systems fig 1a as shown in fig 3 a we have obtained precipitation from an adjacent weather station latitude 40 03 and longitude 88 27 from weather underground https www wunderground com 10 km away from the location of the experimental device deployed for the purpose of comparison between surface soil and air temperatures we also show the latter in fig 3b we find that the optimum thermal image acquisition time that maximizes the contrast between the regions close to and distant from subsurface drainage pipe in thermal images is within 12 h after 2 54 mm of precipitation on the test sample fig 3c to m the threshold of 2 54 mm is determined based on previous studies e g mccabe et al 2010 and nakano et al 2011 which is often used to categorize a day as dry on the other hand there are no strong relationships between soil and atmospheric temperatures confirming our hypothesis that the surface soil temperature driven by tile drainage outweighs that redistributed by the thermal convection optical images fig 3n to r taken at the same time as the selected thermal images do not show any detectable feature linked to tile drain although identifiable cracks in the soil can be seen this observation demonstrates that the use of thermal images has potential to provide a better prediction of subsurface tile drain systems than that of optical images however it is still difficult to clearly delineate subsurface tile drains with raw thermal images thereby requiring image processing 3 2 identifying tile drainage systems the experimental results to identify the subsurface tile drainage system using the proposed method illustrated in fig 2 are shown in fig 4 raw thermal images obtained before introducing artificial tillage in the experimental setup are shown in fig 4 a and d these thermal images are those shown in fig 3 j and m respectively relatively high temperature distribution is observed above the tile location the center line of the image plane however the contrast between the region close to and distant from subsurface tile is not clear in the raw thermal images the processed images using the proposed method are shown in fig 4 b and e where the detected tile locations are also overlaid it is seen that the tile locations are clearly visualized but not in the raw thermal images finally the detected tile locations are mapped on optical images as shown in fig 4 c and f for clear comparison the location of the subsurface drainage pipe is indicated as black dotted lines the tile locations are well identified by the tile indicating line obtained by the proposed method note that without the mapped tile indicating line there is no clue to identify the location of the subsurface tile in the optical images the final mapped images demonstrate the potential of the proposed thermal image based approach and its superior tile detectability over conventional optical image based approaches see more results in fig a 1 in appendix 3 3 tillage effect in order to ensure that the detection algorithm is

11048,poor irrigation scheduling practices have been quoted as the major challenges for sustainability of small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia due to complexity of scheduling techniques cost and inaccessibility of soil water monitoring tools lack of various local climatic data and soil water parameters for local experts to easily schedule irrigation and to promote adoption by farmers a cheap and simple computation procedure of irrigation scheduling is needed that considers local resources and opinions so far there is no such study in the context of ethiopia a simple irrigation scheduling method practical was developed based on the fao procedure brouwer et al 1989 employing hargreaves et0 equation and the opinions of local farmers and extension agents then the method was validated on farm through participatory and close observation of farmers by comparing with cropwat simulated sophisticated and local traditional scheduling practices for 2015and 2015 16 irrigation seasons considering maize as indicator crop data on irrigation depths yield and yield components and soil salinity were collected and analysed furthermore a farmers day was arranged to collect opinions on the crop stand and scheduling techniques in both irrigation seasons the practical irrigation schedule method resulted in higher grain yield while saving substantial amount of water and in significantly higher water productivity wp compared to the other methods maximum 0 68 kg m 3 in 2015 and minimum 0 47 kg m 3 in 2015 16 wp were found in the practical and sophisticated approaches respectively the average root zone salinities among the alterative irrigation scheduling methods were not significantly different in both irrigation seasons farmers and experts opinions were in favour of the practical scheduling method the practical irrigation scheduling method is thus recommended for maize around gumselassa area further the presented procedure can be adopted for preparation of irrigation calendars

major reasons quoted for underperformance of the schemes tigray is one of the most degraded and drought prone regions of ethiopia similar to the other schemes in the country poor water management practices particularly improper irrigation scheduling is one of the factors for underperformances of most ssi schemes in the region eyasu 2005 libseka et al 2015 yohannes et al 2017 lack of simple and practical scheduling techniques limited knowledge and inadequate practical skills of farmers and local extension agents on crop water needs soil types and climatic conditions in the country awulachew

have been the major reason for poor on farm water management practices in tigray region irrigation scheduling is being decided by a local water committee and or based on the farmer s intuition insufficiently accounting for soil plant and weather conditions eyasu 2005 mintesinot 2002 mitiku et al 2002 as a result over or under irrigation of fields is common in the region eyasu 2005 as well as in many irrigation schemes in the country moa 2011 these poor on farm water management practices have resulted in low production and water productivity waterlogging soil salinization rise in groundwater levels and decrease in command area eyasu 2005 mintesinot 2002 many studies alemayehu et al 2006 ayenew 2007 fanadzo et al 2010 haile and kasa 2015 also confirmed that inappropriate irrigation scheduling as among the major factors for poor performance of many irrigation schemes many advanced and novel scientific irrigation scheduling techniques have been developed in the past three decades however the adoption by farmers is low especially in developing countries annandale et al 2011 fanadzo et al 2010 the major reasons for low adoption are reported to be lack of soil water parameters and weather conditions torres 1998 and complexity of the techniques such that farmers are confused by choice and do not understand the difference between the different scheduling techniques stirzaker 2006 failure of the scientist to understand the situation of farmers and the constraints under which they operate pleban and israeli 1989 vanclay 2003 much of the studies are focused on the exact science of irrigation scheduling rather than simple and practical measures that would improve farmers decision maheshwari et al 2003 although various researches and attempts were conducted on irrigation scheduling demelash 2013 kifle et al 2017 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 mintesinot et al 2004 muktar and yigezu 2016 using the cropwat model in ethiopia none of these involved the participation of local farmers and extension agents and consequently the outputs didn t serve the end users besides the sophisticated conventional approach applied by researchers cannot be practiced by the local extension agents unavailability of climatic data and absence of simple implementation manuals for farmers were also among the major reasons for failure of the attempts in addition to the need of reliable climatic data the sophisticated method of irrigation scheduling requires computer access trained professionals and soil water monitoring tools which are rarely available in most parts of ethiopia the choice of the irrigation scheduling method should consider the technology level of the farm icid fao 1995 past research and practical experience emphasized that irrigation scheduling practices must be simple useable and understandable by farmers in order for them to be adopted hargreaves and samani 1987 hill and allen 1996 though some simple methods of scheduling have been developed torres 1998 the practicality and adoption is still low for several reasons for example simple irrigation scheduling calendars hill and allen 1996 were developed which demand professional and sufficient weather data to apply to secure food security in drought prone regions like tigray concrete efforts to improve on farm water management is required hillel 1997 thus improving irrigation scheduling by individual farmers in the region should be a matter of urgency not much has been done on development of simple and practical irrigation scheduling techniques that can be exercised by local extension agents and easily adopted by farmers innovations are required for current irrigation management and practices pereira et al 2002 and there is a need to develop simple monitoring tools and conceptual frameworks that enable structured learning annandale et al 2011 considering the poor socioeconomic status of the farmers very low technology level of the farms inaccessibility of tools and lack of local climatic data and trained professional in tigray as well as in most rural parts of the country there is an urgent need to develop more simple and easy to apply irrigation scheduling techniques the aim of the study is therefore to identify test and validate practical irrigation scheduling that considers the local conditions which can be easily practiced by the local extension agents and easily understood and applied by the farmers a participatory procedure that included local farmers and extension agents opinions in combination with a method published by fao brouwer et al 1989 and hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 were used for this study the fao approach requires limited data and the procedures to be followed are easy for local extension agents hargreaves equation is a worldwide accepted simple and reliable method of estimating evapotranspiration that requires only temperature data allen 1993 hargreaves 1994 hargreaves and allen 2003 jensen et al 1990 in most rural parts of ethiopia where computers are not accessible the other advantage of the hargreaves approach is that et0 computation can be done manually using ordinary simple calculating machine local extension agents can benefit from the simple procedures in developing irrigation calendars for other irrigated crops finally this study gives important lesson for local and regional decision makers on their endeavour to increase the productivity of small scale irrigated agriculture this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area practical irrigation schedule development method alternative irrigation schedules and data collection and analysis methods section 3 presents the results in this section results of the alternative irrigation schedules which included depth of the applied water yield and yield components soil salinity and local opinions are presented section 4 discusses the results section 5 draws conclusions on the main findings of the

administration tigray region ethiopia in 2015 and 2015 16 irrigation seasons at the gumselassa ssi scheme located between 13 13 to 13 15 n and 39 30 to 39 33 e fig 1 more than 60 of the study area is covered with black clayey soil mintesinot et al 1999 some physical properties of the soil in the study area are shown in table 1 the rainfall in the study area is unimodal and highly erratic in space and time the annual average rainfall is 500 mm and agro ecologically the area is classified as typical semi arid yohannes et al 2017 the water source for gumselassa irrigation scheme is an earthen micro dam designed to irrigate 110 ha review of secondary past studies sources and discussions with the local office of agriculture and rural development indicated poor on farm water management practices as among the major causes for overall poor performance of the irrigation scheme that resulted in low crop yields and development of soil salinization 2 2 farmers and extension agents participation 2 2 1 participation during pre implementation in the first step discussions with local extension agents local leaders irrigation committee farmers representatives and elder farmers were done individually regarding irrigation water management related problems particularly on irrigation scheduling then in the second step a meeting was arranged where 25 farmers including the irrigation committee and the abomays water distribution leaders and 3 local extension agents were present intensive discussion was made on the problem and challenges of irrigation scheduling in the study area in the second step further discussion was carried out on different techniques of irrigation scheduling then we proposed our initiatives on the development of simple and practical irrigation technique on farm test and comparison against their scheduling practices and sophisticated scheduling technique using cropwat then intensive discussions were done on the participants concern suggestion and comment regarding the alternative scheduling techniques to suit local conditions and to facilitate further adoption adjustments were done to our first proposed irrigation calendars based on the vital inputs of the participants the opinions and suggestions forwarded by the majority of the farmers were based on their local practices and experience which focused on adjustments for easier understanding follow up and comparisons of the new scheduling techniques beyond on farm scheduling they also shared the need of creating convenience for water allocators distributors at scheme level moreover the crop characteristics and the selection of the experiment plot which could represent the majority of plots in the irrigation scheme were determined based on their suggestion to avoid repetition and for the purpose of clarity the local inputs are described in relevant steps of the study 2 2 2 participation during the experimental period during the experiment period more efforts were done to involve farmers from the inception till the end since they are the ultimate beneficiaries they were participating in installation of parshall flumes diversion and distribution of water cultivation weeding harvesting activities and guarding of the experimental plot moreover informal field visits and discussions were common among the local farmers during several irrigation events the premise was through participation and frequent field observation by which farmers would acquire practical knowledge on the performance and constraints of the alternative irrigation scheduling approaches besides facilitating and improving information feedback between farmers and researchers the farmers would be in a position to judge the different irrigation scheduling techniques from their own perspectives 2 3 development of irrigation schedule 2 3 1 practical irrigation schedule the development of the practical irrigation schedule was based on procedures of the simple calculation method in fao training manual no 4 brouwer et al 1989 in combination with the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 and local farmers and extension agents inputs the fao approach requires limited data and the procedures to be followed are easy to suite the local conditions and to facilitate adoption the local farmers and extension agents inputs were also used in the development process the hargreaves equation was used for estimation of the potential evapotranspiration et0 then a predefined irrigation calendar was prepared following the steps indicated below step i estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 shown below was used to estimate et0 1 e t 0 0 0023 r a t 0 c 17 8 t d 0 5 where et0 is reference evapotranspiration in mm day ra is extraterrestrial radiation in equivalent mm of water evaporation t c is mean monthly temperature tmx tmi 2 in degree celsius td is mean maximum minus mean minimum temperatures in degree celsius the monthly mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures were computed table 2 from a 35 years temperature data of the nearest about 43 km far meteorological station ra values were used from doorenbos and pruitt 1977 step ii estimation of crop water need etc approximate durations of growth stages 20 40 40 and 35 days table 3 for the initial development mid and late seasons stages respectively were used for maize from the local farmers and extension agents suggestion since there is no location specific crop factor kc in the country the growth stages based kc values for maize were adopted from brouwer and heibloem 1986 as etc had to be determined on a monthly basis for months that do not correspond with the growth stages the average weighted kc values were computed to change the growth stages based kc to monthly based kc table 3 as indicated in brouwer and heibloem 1986 for ease of computation 30 numbers of days were considered for all months for the computations of the average monthly kc then the monthly etc mm day 1 was computed using eq 2 2 e t c e t 0 k c where etc crop evapotranspiration or crop water need mm day 1 then the monthly crop water need etc mm month 1 was obtained by multiplying the monthly etc mm day by the respective number of days in each month as shown in table 3 step iii estimation of net and gross irrigation application depths the net irrigation depth dnet was adapted from brouwer et al 1989 that the net irrigation depth is estimated using only soil type texture and crop root depth as inputs the maize crop deep rooted under clayey soil in the case of the study area requires dnet of 70 mm considering short 10 m well graded and closed furrows no runoff and controlled discharge 75 field application efficiency was considered then using eq 3 the gross applied depth dgross of 93 3 mm was computed and rounded to the nearest 5 mm and obtained 95 mm 3 d g r o s s d n e t a e 100 where dnet and dgoss in mm ea field application efficiency in

calculated dmnet were deducted from the estimated monthly in as shown in table 6 positive and negative values of the differences indicate excess and deficit of water respectively to avoid crop water stress especially in the months of peak irrigation water need it is important to refine the scheduling method based on the recalculated irrigation interval for the months of peak irrigation water need table 7 the dmnet values for the entire irrigation season were refined table 6 following the procedure indicated by brouwer et al 1989 through reiterations to avoid deficits especially in the peak months based on the planting dates and determined irrigation interval a predefined irrigation calendar was prepared considering the shallow crop root depth early stage and the farmers and woreda extension agents suggestions and local practices the net irrigation depths dnet for the first three irrigation events were reduced to 50 mm to avoid excess water loss step viii calendar validation the calendar was tested and validated on farm against cropwat simulated sophisticated and farmers traditional scheduling techniques for 2015 and 2015 16 irrigation seasons as shown in tables 9 and 10 in the second irrigation season in 2015 16 due to insufficient rainfall the harvested water in the reservoir was very low the size of irrigated area in the irrigation scheme is usually decided based on the amount of harvested water besides the low amount of harvested water considering the amount of water that can be saved which otherwise would have been lost by seepage and evaporation from the reservoir the irrigation committee shifted the irrigation calendar by more than a month earlier from january 2016 to the end of november 2015 so that more farmers could be accommodated thus the practical and sophisticated irrigation calendars for the second season were updated accordingly 2 3 2 sophisticated cropwat simulated irrigation scheduling the cropwat 8 computer software developed by fao swennenhuis 2009 was used for determination of the crop and irrigation water requirement and irrigation scheduling this program helps to calculate the potential evapotranspiration et0 using various climatic data temperature humidity wind speed and sunshine hours based on penman monteith method long term climatic data table 2 from the nearby about 43 km far station were used the crop factor and length of growing season used were the same as in the practical approach using the cropwat model several options such as variable irrigation interval and amount irrigating at critical or fixed depletion fixed interval per growing stage and variable depth were consulted with the farmers and extension agents however for ease of understanding and comparisons of the new scheduling techniques practical and sophisticated by the majority farmers fixed irrigation interval for these two scheduling techniques were suggested by the group the soil input data for cropwat considered were texture clay total available soil moisture 160 mm table 2 maximum rain infiltration rate 30 mm day adapted from cropwat for clay soil initial moisture depletion 80 the amounts of applied water for all treatments were accounted starting on the first irrigation event day one which was done immediately after sowing 80 depletion was considered based on feel and appearance approach maximum rooting depth 2 m then based on the fixed irrigation interval and refilling to field capacity option the irrigation schedule was calculated 2 3 3 traditional irrigation schedule the traditional method of irrigation schedule represented the farmer s existing scheduling practice and was considered as a control the farmer was allowed to irrigate all the replications of the traditional treatment based on his experience without any interference of the researcher for the entire growth period yet the amount of applied water during each irrigation event was simply recorded using a parshall flume 2 4 experimental design nationally developed maize variety melkassa ii zea mays l which is popular in the study area was used as indicator crop in this study three treatments irrigation scheduling methods namely traditional practical and sophisticated cropwat simulated were replicated three times in randomized block design on farm in 2015 and 2015 16 irrigation seasons 2 5 data collection and analysis 2 5 1 soil samples from the experimental field pre treatment composite as well as undisturbed soil samples at 20 cm intervals down the profile up to 1 m were collected from three random locations in 2015 the soil texture ph and organic matter were analysed from the composite soil samples in a laboratory following the standard procedures soil bulk density bd field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp were analysed from the undisturbed soil samples further at planting and at harvest in both irrigation seasons soil samples were collected at 20 cm interval up to 1 m depth from all replications of each treatment and soil salinity of saturated extracts ece were measured at laboratory following a validated procedure 2 5 2 irrigation water pre plant irrigation is common practice in the study area to soften the soil for ploughing since it was done for the entire farm before the experimental lay out the amount was not included in our study the irrigation amounts applied to each plot were monitored starting the sowing date for the traditional scheduling treatment the farmer s irrigation intervals were recorded and the amount of applied water was monitored using parshall flume in each irrigation event for the practical and sophisticated treatments simple data sheets displaying instant calculations of the depths of applied water were prepared and the determined amounts of water were applied using parshall flumes at each irrigation events the salinity electrical conductivities ecw and ph of the irrigation water were monitored using portable and calibrated ec and ph meters 2 5 3 yield and yield components grain yield and yield components total fresh biomass plant height number of ears per plant ear length number of kernels per ear and 1000 kernels weight were measured at harvest physiological maturity 2 5 4 water productivity wp the ratio of crop yield to the amount of water applied was calculated using eq 8 8 w p y i where wp in kg m 3 y grain yield of maize kg ha 1 i total irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 2 5 5 farmers and local experts opinion farmers day was arranged at harvest of the maize crop in both irrigation seasons in the farmers day four groups were formed three groups were farmers group consisting of six farmers each and the fourth group was expert group formed from four staff members of the woreda local office of agriculture and rural development which constituted experts from extension irrigation crop and natural resources then each group was allowed to rank the crop stand of the three treatments moreover the farmers and the local experts opinions and suggestions regarding the conveniences and appropriateness of the different scheduling methods were collected through open discussions 2 5 6 statistical analysis mean comparison on the effect of irrigation treatments on yield and yield components as well as the soil salinity were done using spss 20 statistical software separately for each irrigation season 3 results 3 1 potential evapotranspiration et0 and crop evapotranspiration etc as depicted in table 2 the estimated monthly et0 for the irrigation season of the study area were higher for penman monteith as compared to the hargeaves method except in those three months from july to september although the climatic data used for both methods were collected from the same station at about 43 km distance in both irrigation seasons lower crop water needs etc were found in the practical method as compared to the sophisticated method the determined etc using the practical scheduling method were 508 mm and 456 mm in the 1st 2015 and 2nd 2015 16 irrigation seasons respectively table 3 in the sophisticated method these values were 756 8 mm and 708 9 mm for the former and latter irrigation seasons respectively table 8 3 2 irrigation amount and interval following the practical method the first calculated number of irrigation events 7 and the irrigation intervals 19 days were the same for both irrigation seasons table 5 however for the 1st season experiment the calculated dmnet using 19 days interval showed 33 mm and 32 mm water deficit in the months of march and april respectively table 6 similarly for the 2nd season a deficit of about 36 mm and 2 mm were shown in the months of february and march respectively to avoid crop losses refinement were done for the entire growing season based on the calculated deficit months iint 15 days as shown in table 7 for clarity the refined recalculated dmnet is placed in table 6 below 19 days interval column despite the difference in the planting dates of the irrigation seasons the adjusted irrigation interval appeared to be the same for both irrigation seasons in our calculation as shown in table 6 both deficit months feb mar were considered still for both irrigation seasons a small amount of monthly deficits are shown these deficits would be smaller when partitioned in the two irrigation events moreover considering the higher application depth 95 mm than the determined 93 3 mm due to rounding the deficits were ignored for the sophisticated method discussed in section 2 the irrigation interval considered 15 days and the determined irrigation events 9 times were the same as for the practical method the farmer s traditional irrigation interval ranged from 13 to 17 days and from 14 to 21 days for the 1st and 2nd season experiments respectively table 10 the minimum intervals were recorded in the 2nd and the maximum in the 3rd 4th and around the last irrigation events for both irrigation seasons the same numbers of irrigation events 8 were recorded for the traditional method for both irrigation seasons which were lower than the other approaches 9 the total water applied by the practical approach was 765 mm which was the same for both irrigation seasons however the total applied water in the 1st season experiment were 898 4 mm and 983 8 mm for the traditional and sophisticated methods respectively and during the 2nd season 873 1 mm and 960 9 mm were applied by the former and later approaches respectively higher depths of water were applied by the sophisticated followed by the traditional and then by the practical methods in both irrigation seasons the amount of water applied by the traditional approach depends upon the farmers experience in the first two irrigations the applied water were lower as compared to the rest of the irrigation events and showed almost an increasing trend except the last in both irrigation seasons in the traditional scheduling maximum depth 120 mm per applications were recorded in the 5th 6th and 7th irrigation events for the sophisticated approach higher application depths 130 mm were recorded during the 5th to 8th irrigation events in both treatments starting the 3rd for traditional and the 4th for sophisticated up to the last irrigation events there were frequent ponding of water on the plots for a considerable time 3 8 h after irrigation during these irrigation events wet soil surface for a couple of days were also observed especially in the sophisticated treatment plots 3 3 soil salinization the salinity electrical conductivity of the irrigation water varied across the growing seasons from 0 45 ds m 1 ph 7 45 at the beginning of irrigation seasons to 0 68 ds m 1 ph 7 6 at the end the distribution of salts ece at 20 cm interval down the soil profile up to 100 cm at planting and at harvest for both irrigation seasons is depicted in table 11 in the 1st season 2015 experiment the average root zone 100 cm salinity ece at planting were 1 69 1 94 and 1 83 ds m 1for the sophisticated traditional and practical treatments respectively statistically all were similar in the same season at harvest higher surface 0 20 cm salinity was found in the i2 2 43 ds m 1 followed by i1 2 34 ds m 1 and lower value was found in the i3 2 03 ds m 1 treatment in contrast the ece in the preceding profile 20 40 cm was higher in the i3 1 88 ds m 1 as compared to the other treatments lower soil salinity below 50 cm down the soil profile was found in the i1 compared to the other treatments in all treatments as shown in table 11 starting the second layer 20 40 cm the ece showed an increasing trend downward of the soil profile except the last profile in the i2 in 2015 although variations on the profile salt distributions were observed among the different treatments statistically only the surface 0 20 cm ece was significantly p 0 05 higher in the i2 as compared to the i3 in the same season the average ece at harvest were 2 41 2 57 and 2 46 ds m 1 for the i1 i2 and i3 respectively although a significant increment in soil salinities were observed at harvest as compared to planting in all treatment the average root zone salinities at harvest among all the treatments were not significantly different in 2015 16 at harvest the ece of i1was higher 2 22 ds m 1 at the surface 0 20 cm and lower at the preceding profiles as compared to the other treatments in contrast except in the surface 0 20 cm higher ece was found in all layers in the i3 compared to the other treatments the average ece across the entire profile were 2 04 ds m 1 2 19 ds m 1 and 2 3 ds m 1 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively at harvest the soil salinity only in the 60 80 cm depth were significantly p 0 05 higher in i3 2 68 ds m 1 as compared to both i1 2 12 ds m 1 and i3 2 21 ds m 1 however the average root zone salinities between all treatments were not significantly different in both irrigation seasons although the severity varied between irrigation events after the soil dried a white efflorescence appeared on the surfaces of all treatments at harvest in both irrigation seasons lowest surface ece were found in the practical treatment and the lowest average root zone ece was found in the sophisticated treatment 3 4 yield and yield components the effect of different irrigation scheduling treatments showed significant results of maize biomass in both irrigation seasons table 12 in 2015 the i3 practical treatment significantly increased at p 0 05 the biomass as compared to other treatments i1 and i2 however in 2015 16 the results showed non significant differences in biomass between the i3 and other treatments maximum and minimum biomass of 25 8 t ha 1 2015 and 20 4 t ha 1 2015 16 were recorded in i3 and i1 treatments respectively in 2015 the biomass in both the i1 and i2 treatments showed non significant results although significant differences were found in 2015 16 as shown in table 12 the effect of different irrigation scheduling treatments showed non significant results in grain yield among all treatments in 2015 however in 2015 16 the i3 treatment gave significantly higher grain yield than all treatments in both irrigation seasons the i2 and i3 treatments were however statistically not significant in grain yield in 2015 average grain yield results were 4 78 4 83 and 5 22 t ha 1 in i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively the corresponding grain yield in 2015 16 was 4 5 4 41 and 5 05 t ha 1 respectively the plant height was significantly higher for i3 as compared to i1 in 2015 however no significant differences on plant height were observed in 2015 16 the effect of irrigation scheduling on ear length showed no significant differences among all treatments in both irrigation seasons the number of ears per plant and the number of kernels per ear in 2015 16 were significantly higher for i3 as compared to i1 though all the treatments failed to show any significant differences in 2015 in the number of ears per plant and the number of kernels per ear in both years the i3 treatment significantly enhanced 1000 kernel weight as compared to other treatments though no significant differences in 1000 kernels weights were found between the i1 and i2 treatments in both years 3 5 water productivity wp the average water productivity of the different irrigation scheduling treatments is presented in table 12 the wp was significantly influenced by the different irrigation schedules in both irrigation seasons maximum wp 0 68 kg m 3 in 2015 and 0 66 kg m 3 in 2015 16 was found in i3 in both irrigation seasons the i1 treatment resulted in lower wp 0 49 kg m 3 in 2015 and 0 47 kg m 3 in 2015 16 in both irrigation seasons the i3 treatment significantly increased the wp as compared to the other i1 and i2 treatments in both irrigation seasons the wp for both i1 and i2 were not statistically significant in 2015 though the wp for i2 in 2015 16 was significantly higher than i1 the simple linear regression between wp and yield fig 2 showed that an increase in wp with yield increment and water decrement 3 6 farmers and local experts extension agents opinion 3 6 1 ranking of crop stand the farmers and extension agents groups mean rank according to their own criteria of the treatments are depicted in table 13 each group was invited to present their ranking results as well as major justifications in 2015 the i3 treatment was ranked the best by all of the groups although statistically similar as compared to i2 in the farmer group ii the treatment mean rank in i1 and i2 were the same for farmers group i and iii although the mean rank of i1 was the least for the experts and the farmers group ii compared to i2 it was significant only for the latter group in the second season 2015 16 similarly the i3 treatment was given the best rank by all except for farmers group ii which they gave same rank as i2 treatment the mean rank variation between i1 and i2 were significant for farmers group i and group ii in both irrigation seasons the farmer groups overall mean rank variation for i3 were significantly different best as compared to both i1 and i2 however the overall mean rank between i1 and i2 were statistically similar for both irrigation season from the groups presentation the farmers major criterion of ranking of the crop stand were the expected grain yield and total biomass which were judged from observation of the plant height stem thickness diameter and number of ears these criterions were similar for all groups except for the inclusion of visible surface salt white salt efflorescence by the experts group 3 6 2 scheduling technique opinions all the participants appreciated the water saved by the i3 practical technique while comparing the irrigation intervals most of the participants were in favor of the fixed irrigation interval i1 and i3 the major reasons raised were its convenience and easiness for individual farmers and scheme water distributors in such a way that they both will know ahead whose turn is next important concern raised by the farmers was the capacity and skill of the water users association wua on providing fixed interval based irrigation scheduling at scheme level the second major point raised by the experts was on the technical feasibility of measuring water by individual farmer water is not metered on farm in most irrigation scheme in ethiopia however during the experimental seasons the farmers were surprisingly able to classify the irrigation scheduling techniques qualitatively in their own local language based on their observation of the applied water to each treatment ablek leck means too much water for i1 limud means usual for i2 and chebreck chebreck means little by little for i3 4 discussions 4 1 effect of irrigation scheduling on potential evapotranspiration et0 and irrigation amount the determined crop water needs etc using the practical scheduling method were about 33 and 36 lower than that of the sophisticated method for the 1st 2015 and 2nd 2015 16 irrigation seasons respectively the obtained results also showed that the gross amount of applied water by the sophisticated method was higher by 28 6 2015 and 25 6 2015 16 than the practical method similarly the gross applied depths by the traditional method were higher by 17 4 and 14 1 as compared to the practical method for the corresponding irrigation seasons the big difference between the practical and sophisticated methods were entirely attributed to the methods used for estimating the potential evapotranspiration et0 by hargreaves and the penman monteith equations based on various climatic factors acquired from a meteorology station located at about 43 km distance respectively the penman monteith pm estimated monthly et0 were higher in all months except for the months of july to september as compared to hargreaves table 2 frequent field observations confirmed surface water pond and saturated soil for a significant time after irrigation in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments regarding the traditional practices this is in line with the finding of yohannes et al 2017 that reported qualitatively over watering practices of the farmers in the same irrigation scheme from their scheme level survey conducted in 2015 16 the penman monteith is worldwide recommended methodology under availability of representative and accurate weather data gathered from large and well watered area droogers and allen 2002 although the station where the climatic data adopted and the study area have similar elevation ethiopia in general and the region in particular is characterized with a complex variation in local topography yet dinku et al 2014 found strong dependence of temperature on elevation in ethiopia another study conducted in the country by boke 2017 generally indicated large errors in predicting or interpolating wind speed as compared to temperature sunshine fraction and rainfall although further robust researches on local climate and et0 are required considering the irrigation depth applied by the alternative approaches versus field observations the obtained crop performances and the observation by dinku et al 2014 and boke 2017 the findings of this research indicates that the overestimation of the penman monteith et0 was probably due to poor representation of most of the climatic data acquired from 43 km far station on the other hand the better performance of the hargreaves could be due to relatively better representation of temperature data the higher etc values in the 1st irrigation season as compared to the 2nd irrigation season in both scheduling methods were due to change in the irrigation calendar start of irrigation of the irrigation scheme which was relatively cooler for the 2nd season experiment 4 2 effect of irrigation scheduling on crop performance and water productivity higher grain yields were recorded in the practical method in both irrigation seasons although it was significant only in 2015 16 a significant biomass increase was also obtained in 2015 for the practical as compared to the other treatments over all the practical method resulted in better crop performance as compared to the other treatments since land preparation fertilizer application and other agronomic practices were the same for all treatments it can be concluded that the combined effect of the applied amount of irrigation water and interval created a favorable soil water environment for production of a greater amount of grain yield and overall better crop performance besides to lower grain yields the sophisticated and traditional methods resulted in applying more water than the practical method especially in the sophisticated method about 218 mm in 2015 and 196 mm in 2015 16 in excess of the practical method were applied the practical method significantly increased the water productivity in both irrigation seasons compared to the other methods table 12 the finding of this study showed that higher water productivities are associated with higher grain yields fig 2a as well as lower total irrigation depths fig 2b in both irrigation seasons these also confirms that there were over irrigation in both the sophisticated and traditional methods the higher amounts of applied water especially in i1 treatment were mainly responsible for lower photosynthetic performance through creation of aeration problem and other nutritional factors according to sakamoto et al 2011 peak development stage of the corn is more sensitive to over irrigation and over irrigation could essentially prevent the plants from retaining nutrition required for its development in a research conducted to quantify the impact of over irrigation on maize yield in nebraska united states irmak 2008 over irrigation of maize to 125 percent of etc resulted in yield reduction as compared with fully irrigated 100 percent etc another study conducted in limpopo south africa reported excessive irrigation water is among the factors for poor maize yields on farmer s fields machethe et al 2004 4 3 effect of irrigation schedules on soil salinization in both irrigation seasons at harvest table 11 lower surface 0 20 cm soil salinity and in the succeeding profile 20 40 cm higher soil salinity was observed in the practical compared to the other treatments during harvest the salinity values presented in table 11 generally indicated capillary salinization dominates compared to any potential leaching in the upper soil profiles of all treatments except for the practical treatment in 2015 16 as discussed in section 3 surface water ponds were common in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments due to the higher application depths in most of the irrigation events and poor internal drainage of the clayey soil table 1 thus evaporative concentration of salts at the surface and capillary movement from the succeeding soil profile are among the likely major reasons for relatively higher surface salt concentration in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments due to similar reasons akhand and al araj 2013 found higher salts in the upper 0 25 cm relative to the lower 25 50 cm depth which is in line with the finding of this research according to a survey conducted in 2015 16 in similar seasons in the study area yohannes et al 2017 also revealed that farmers believed over irrigation as the major cause for soil salinization in the irrigation scheme on the other hand in both irrigation seasons the average root zone salinity was slightly lower in the sophisticated treatment this indicates that despite the clayey textured soil leaching seem to be relatively better in the sophisticated treatment at planting of both irrigation seasons the salt concentrations were lower in all treatments this indicates that the effect of the rainy season decreases the salt concentration difference in salt concentration was also found between the irrigation seasons which was over all lower in the 2nd season this is attributed to the change in the planting date of the 2nd a month earlier experiment which reduced the capillary movement of soluble salts owing to relatively colder periods although a wide salinity tolerance exist among different maize cultivars genotypes as a general indication the yield potential under increasing salinity of water eci and soil ece is 100 at eci 1 1 ds m 1 and ece 1 7 ds m 1 90 at eci 1 7 ds m 1 and ece 2 5 ds m 1 and so on during harvest the average root zone salinity found in all treatments were lower than 2 5 ds m 1 the threshold for 90 yield potential except in 2015 where slightly higher 2 57 ds m 1 salinity was found in the traditional treatment according to various literatures farooq et al 2015 maas et al 1983 maas and hoffman 1976 maize is more sensitive to salinity at early stage emergence and vegetative than later growth stages development of grain yield and yield components considering the good quality 0 45 0 67 ds m 1 of the irrigation water utilized and the obtained average root zone salinities which were lower at planting and higher at harvest which is expected to be the maximum during the growing period due to gradual buildup of salts the average root zone salinity in all treatments will not generally significantly decrease the yield of maize in both irrigation seasons 4 4 farmers and experts opinion while conducting the field experiments many farmers had followed the entire progress cautiously in both irrigation seasons allowing farmers participation in on farm research encourages information feedback between farmers and researches it helps in identification of the limitations and requirements by the farmers in the selection of appropriate irrigation scheduling methods the local farmers and extension agents were in favor of the practical approach this result is more or less in agreement with the obtained results in section 3 in addition to water saving and better crop performance advantages the major reason for selection of the practical approach was its convenience for farmers and water distributors due to the fixed interval and constant application local extension agents need easy scheduling methodology while farmers also demand for simple practical and convenient calendars to achieve improved irrigation management at farm level clyma 1996 under low technology situations icid fao 1995 simple and operational rules with fixed interval and constant water application are recommended other main concerns raised by the farmers were skill and capacity of the wua to provide such schedule the wuas in many countries need capacity building in technical and institutional issues to improve the performance of irrigation schemes ghazouani et al 2012 kazbekov et al 2009 mutambara et al 2016 thiruchelvam 2010 the world bank 2006 thus building institutional capacity and technical skill of the wua should be considered to arrange and enforce predetermined scheduling calendars based on continuous field observation the farmers classification of the alternative irrigation scheduling techniques qualitatively and in their own local language in this study indicated that they are more or less capable of applying the desired amount of water roughly if allowed or participated in scheduling practices 5 conclusions despite the availability of various scientific irrigation scheduling techniques the adoption by farmers is poor mainly due the complexity of techniques inaccessibility of soil water monitoring tools lack of local climatic and soil water data and absence of stakeholders participation using hargreaves equation which requires only temperature data for estimation of et0 and based on the simple procedures for irrigation scheduling in brouwer et al 1989 as well as the local farmers and extension agents inputs a simple scheduling calendar practical for maize was tested and validated on farm against cropwat sophisticated simulated and farmers traditional scheduling methods for two years 2015 and 2015 16 at gumselassa irrigation scheme north ethiopia the result of the study showed that the practical approach resulted in higher grain yield substantial saving in irrigation water amount and subsequently in significant improvement in water productivity as compared to the other approaches in both years although most of the farmers in the study area are illiterate or completed an elementary school level they were surprisingly able to classify the alternative irrigation scheduling approaches based on the amount of applied water qualitatively in their own local language this leads to the conclusion that if allowed participated in scheduling practices farmers are more or less capable of applying the desired amount of water roughly based on their observations overall from results of the crop stand ranking and opinions of the alternative approaches the local farmers and experts were in favor of the practical approach this also gives important information that if the beneficiaries are allowed participated they can be equipped with practical facts to judge alternative technologies from their own perspectives for successful implementation of such simple irrigation calendar in a community managed irrigation schemes like gumselassa technical support and capacity building of the water users associations is required urgently especially on arranging and synchronizing schedules at scheme level in most rural areas of ethiopia as well as in other similar countries where climatic data are lacking or unreliable and the technology level of the farm is low this technique can significantly improve the irrigation water management practices furthermore local extension agents can practice and easily prepare irrigation calendars for different crops and planting dates following based on the practical procedure moreover researchers should build on and rectify on such simple procedures in different agro hydrological environments for wider use this study also recommended the need for local climate studies as well as observations facilities in the vicinity of irrigation schemes of the rural areas so that they can have their own representative meteorological data and accurate scheduling acknowledgment the research was funded by eau4food european union and african union cooperative research to increase food production in irrigated farming systems in africa project the authors would like to thank mr yemane adane mr tesfay k mariam and the farmers and extension agents around gumselassa irrigation scheme for their dedicated support and cooperation during the study 
11048,poor irrigation scheduling practices have been quoted as the major challenges for sustainability of small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia due to complexity of scheduling techniques cost and inaccessibility of soil water monitoring tools lack of various local climatic data and soil water parameters for local experts to easily schedule irrigation and to promote adoption by farmers a cheap and simple computation procedure of irrigation scheduling is needed that considers local resources and opinions so far there is no such study in the context of ethiopia a simple irrigation scheduling method practical was developed based on the fao procedure brouwer et al 1989 employing hargreaves et0 equation and the opinions of local farmers and extension agents then the method was validated on farm through participatory and close observation of farmers by comparing with cropwat simulated sophisticated and local traditional scheduling practices for 2015and 2015 16 irrigation seasons considering maize as indicator crop data on irrigation depths yield and yield components and soil salinity were collected and analysed furthermore a farmers day was arranged to collect opinions on the crop stand and scheduling techniques in both irrigation seasons the practical irrigation schedule method resulted in higher grain yield while saving substantial amount of water and in significantly higher water productivity wp compared to the other methods maximum 0 68 kg m 3 in 2015 and minimum 0 47 kg m 3 in 2015 16 wp were found in the practical and sophisticated approaches respectively the average root zone salinities among the alterative irrigation scheduling methods were not significantly different in both irrigation seasons farmers and experts opinions were in favour of the practical scheduling method the practical irrigation scheduling method is thus recommended for maize around gumselassa area further the presented procedure can be adopted for preparation of irrigation calendars

rainfall ethiopia is characterized by food insecurity due to high risk of annual droughts as well as intraseasonal dry spells cia 2018 fao 2014 wfp 2016 in order to address the problem of water scarcity and food insecurity promotion and development of small scale irrigation ssi has been a priority policy for the ethiopian government fdre 2007 mofed 2010 2006 mowr 2002 as a result of this policy the irrigated area of ssi increased from 853 100 ha in 2009 10 to 1 853 100 ha in 2012 13 mofed 2014 despite the huge expansion the performance of most ssi schemes in the country is far from

major reasons quoted for underperformance of the schemes tigray is one of the most degraded and drought prone regions of ethiopia similar to the other schemes in the country poor water management practices particularly improper irrigation scheduling is one of the factors for underperformances of most ssi schemes in the region eyasu 2005 libseka et al 2015 yohannes et al 2017 lack of simple and practical scheduling techniques limited knowledge and inadequate practical skills of farmers and local extension agents on crop water needs soil types and climatic conditions in the country awulachew 2010 etissa et al 2014 haile and kasa 2015 moa 2011 and particularly in tigray region eyasu 2005 yohannes et al 2017 as well in many countries hill and allen 1996 icid fao 1995 maheshwari et al 2003 have been the major reason for poor on farm water management practices in tigray region irrigation scheduling is being decided by a local water committee and or based on the farmer s intuition insufficiently accounting for soil plant and weather conditions eyasu 2005 mintesinot 2002 mitiku et al 2002 as a result over or under irrigation of fields is common in the region eyasu 2005 as well as in many irrigation schemes in the country moa 2011 these poor on farm water management practices have resulted in low production and water productivity waterlogging soil salinization rise in groundwater levels and decrease in command area eyasu 2005 mintesinot 2002 many studies alemayehu et al 2006 ayenew 2007 fanadzo et al 2010 haile and kasa 2015 also confirmed that inappropriate irrigation scheduling as among the major factors for poor performance of many irrigation schemes many advanced and novel scientific irrigation scheduling techniques have been developed in the past three decades however the adoption by farmers is low especially in developing countries annandale et al 2011 fanadzo et al 2010 the major reasons for low adoption are reported to be lack of soil water parameters and weather conditions torres 1998 and complexity of the techniques such that farmers are confused by choice and do not understand the difference between the different scheduling techniques stirzaker 2006 failure of the scientist to understand the situation of farmers and the constraints under which they operate pleban and israeli 1989 vanclay 2003 much of the studies are focused on the exact science of irrigation scheduling rather than simple and practical measures that would improve farmers decision maheshwari et al 2003 although various researches and attempts were conducted on irrigation scheduling demelash 2013 kifle et al 2017 kifle and gebretsadikan 2016 mintesinot et al 2004 muktar and yigezu 2016 using the cropwat model in ethiopia none of these involved the participation of local farmers and extension agents and consequently the outputs didn t serve the end users besides the sophisticated conventional approach applied by researchers cannot be practiced by the local extension agents unavailability of climatic data and absence of simple implementation manuals for farmers were also among the major reasons for failure of the attempts in addition to the need of reliable climatic data the sophisticated method of irrigation scheduling requires computer access trained professionals and soil water monitoring tools which are rarely available in most parts of ethiopia the choice of the irrigation scheduling method should consider the technology level of the farm icid fao 1995 past research and practical experience emphasized that irrigation scheduling practices must be simple useable and understandable by farmers in order for them to be adopted hargreaves and samani 1987 hill and allen 1996 though some simple methods of scheduling have been developed torres 1998 the practicality and adoption is still low for several reasons for example simple irrigation scheduling calendars hill and allen 1996 were developed which demand professional and sufficient weather data to apply to secure food security in drought prone regions like tigray concrete efforts to improve on farm water management is required hillel 1997 thus improving irrigation scheduling by individual farmers in the region should be a matter of urgency not much has been done on development of simple and practical irrigation scheduling techniques that can be exercised by local extension agents and easily adopted by farmers innovations are required for current irrigation management and practices pereira et al 2002 and there is a need to develop simple monitoring tools and conceptual frameworks that enable structured learning annandale et al 2011 considering the poor socioeconomic status of the farmers very low technology level of the farms inaccessibility of tools and lack of local climatic data and trained professional in tigray as well as in most rural parts of the country there is an urgent need to develop more simple and easy to apply irrigation scheduling techniques the aim of the study is therefore to identify test and validate practical irrigation scheduling that considers the local conditions which can be easily practiced by the local extension agents and easily understood and applied by the farmers a participatory procedure that included local farmers and extension agents opinions in combination with a method published by fao brouwer et al 1989 and hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 were used for this study the fao approach requires limited data and the procedures to be followed are easy for local extension agents hargreaves equation is a worldwide accepted simple and reliable method of estimating evapotranspiration that requires only temperature data allen 1993 hargreaves 1994 hargreaves and allen 2003 jensen et al 1990 in most rural parts of ethiopia where computers are not accessible the other advantage of the hargreaves approach is that et0 computation can be done manually using ordinary simple calculating machine local extension agents can benefit from the simple procedures in developing irrigation calendars for other irrigated crops finally this study gives important lesson for local and regional decision makers on their endeavour to increase the productivity of small scale irrigated agriculture this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the study area practical irrigation schedule development method alternative irrigation schedules and data collection and analysis methods section 3 presents the results in this section results of the alternative irrigation schedules which included depth of the applied water yield and yield components soil salinity and local opinions are presented section 4 discusses the results section 5 draws conclusions on the main findings of the study and presents policy implications 2 methodology 2 1 study area description on farm experiments were conducted in hintalo wojerat woreda 1 1 district or an administrative hierarchy below zonal administration tigray region ethiopia in 2015 and 2015 16 irrigation seasons at the gumselassa ssi scheme located between 13 13 to 13 15 n and 39 30 to 39 33 e fig 1 more than 60 of the study area is covered with black clayey soil mintesinot et al 1999 some physical properties of the soil in the study area are shown in table 1 the rainfall in the study area is unimodal and highly erratic in space and time the annual average rainfall is 500 mm and agro ecologically the area is classified as typical semi arid yohannes et al 2017 the water source for gumselassa irrigation scheme is an earthen micro dam designed to irrigate 110 ha review of secondary past studies sources and discussions with the local office of agriculture and rural development indicated poor on farm water management practices as among the major causes for overall poor performance of the irrigation scheme that resulted in low crop yields and development of soil salinization 2 2 farmers and extension agents participation 2 2 1 participation during pre implementation in the first step discussions with local extension agents local leaders irrigation committee farmers representatives and elder farmers were done individually regarding irrigation water management related problems particularly on irrigation scheduling then in the second step a meeting was arranged where 25 farmers including the irrigation committee and the abomays water distribution leaders and 3 local extension agents were present intensive discussion was made on the problem and challenges of irrigation scheduling in the study area in the second step further discussion was carried out on different techniques of irrigation scheduling then we proposed our initiatives on the development of simple and practical irrigation technique on farm test and comparison against their scheduling practices and sophisticated scheduling technique using cropwat then intensive discussions were done on the participants concern suggestion and comment regarding the alternative scheduling techniques to suit local conditions and to facilitate further adoption adjustments were done to our first proposed irrigation calendars based on the vital inputs of the participants the opinions and suggestions forwarded by the majority of the farmers were based on their local practices and experience which focused on adjustments for easier understanding follow up and comparisons of the new scheduling techniques beyond on farm scheduling they also shared the need of creating convenience for water allocators distributors at scheme level moreover the crop characteristics and the selection of the experiment plot which could represent the majority of plots in the irrigation scheme were determined based on their suggestion to avoid repetition and for the purpose of clarity the local inputs are described in relevant steps of the study 2 2 2 participation during the experimental period during the experiment period more efforts were done to involve farmers from the inception till the end since they are the ultimate beneficiaries they were participating in installation of parshall flumes diversion and distribution of water cultivation weeding harvesting activities and guarding of the experimental plot moreover informal field visits and discussions were common among the local farmers during several irrigation events the premise was through participation and frequent field observation by which farmers would acquire practical knowledge on the performance and constraints of the alternative irrigation scheduling approaches besides facilitating and improving information feedback between farmers and researchers the farmers would be in a position to judge the different irrigation scheduling techniques from their own perspectives 2 3 development of irrigation schedule 2 3 1 practical irrigation schedule the development of the practical irrigation schedule was based on procedures of the simple calculation method in fao training manual no 4 brouwer et al 1989 in combination with the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 and local farmers and extension agents inputs the fao approach requires limited data and the procedures to be followed are easy to suite the local conditions and to facilitate adoption the local farmers and extension agents inputs were also used in the development process the hargreaves equation was used for estimation of the potential evapotranspiration et0 then a predefined irrigation calendar was prepared following the steps indicated below step i estimation of reference evapotranspiration et0 the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 shown below was used to estimate et0 1 e t 0 0 0023 r a t 0 c 17 8 t d 0 5 where et0 is reference evapotranspiration in mm day ra is extraterrestrial radiation in equivalent mm of water evaporation t c is mean monthly temperature tmx tmi 2 in degree celsius td is mean maximum minus mean minimum temperatures in degree celsius the monthly mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures were computed table 2 from a 35 years temperature data of the nearest about 43 km far meteorological station ra values were used from doorenbos and pruitt 1977 step ii estimation of crop water need etc approximate durations of growth stages 20 40 40 and 35 days table 3 for the initial development mid and late seasons stages respectively were used for maize from the local farmers and extension agents suggestion since there is no location specific crop factor kc in the country the growth stages based kc values for maize were adopted from brouwer and heibloem 1986 as etc had to be determined on a monthly basis for months that do not correspond with the growth stages the average weighted kc values were computed to change the growth stages based kc to monthly based kc table 3 as indicated in brouwer and heibloem 1986 for ease of computation 30 numbers of days were considered for all months for the computations of the average monthly kc then the monthly etc mm day 1 was computed using eq 2 2 e t c e t 0 k c where etc crop evapotranspiration or crop water need mm day 1 then the monthly crop water need etc mm month 1 was obtained by multiplying the monthly etc mm day by the respective number of days in each month as shown in table 3 step iii estimation of net and gross irrigation application depths the net irrigation depth dnet was adapted from brouwer et al 1989 that the net irrigation depth is estimated using only soil type texture and crop root depth as inputs the maize crop deep rooted under clayey soil in the case of the study area requires dnet of 70 mm considering short 10 m well graded and closed furrows no runoff and controlled discharge 75 field application efficiency was considered then using eq 3 the gross applied depth dgross of 93 3 mm was computed and rounded to the nearest 5 mm and obtained 95 mm 3 d g r o s s d n e t a e 100 where dnet and dgoss in mm ea field application efficiency in percent step iv computation of irrigation water need in over the total growing season the irrigation water need in in mm is calculated as table 4 4 i n e t c p e where pe effective rainfall in mm month 1 always equal to or larger than zero was calculated using the fao formula shown below p e 0 6 p 10 for p 70 mm month 1 p e 0 8 p 24 for p 70 mm month 1 p total rainfall in mm month 1 the monthly average rainfall was taken from 39 years 1975 2014 data in adigudom town rainfall station located about 3 km from the gumselassa irrigation scheme step v computation of number of irrigation applications and irrigation interval the number of irrigation applications ina was computed as 5 i n a i n d n e t where in irrigation water need in mm then the irrigation interval iint was calculated as 6 i i n t l g s i n a where iint in days lgs length of growing season in days step vi computation of monthly net irrigation depth dmnet the monthly net irrigation depths dmnet in the growing season of maize were calculated using eq 7 7 d m n e t n d i i n t d n e t where dmnet in mm nd number of days per month step vii checking and adjusting for deficit in the months of peak season the monthly calculated dmnet were deducted from the estimated monthly in as shown in table 6 positive and negative values of the differences indicate excess and deficit of water respectively to avoid crop water stress especially in the months of peak irrigation water need it is important to refine the scheduling method based on the recalculated irrigation interval for the months of peak irrigation water need table 7 the dmnet values for the entire irrigation season were refined table 6 following the procedure indicated by brouwer et al 1989 through reiterations to avoid deficits especially in the peak months based on the planting dates and determined irrigation interval a predefined irrigation calendar was prepared considering the shallow crop root depth early stage and the farmers and woreda extension agents suggestions and local practices the net irrigation depths dnet for the first three irrigation events were reduced to 50 mm to avoid excess water loss step viii calendar validation the calendar was tested and validated on farm against cropwat simulated sophisticated and farmers traditional scheduling techniques for 2015 and 2015 16 irrigation seasons as shown in tables 9 and 10 in the second irrigation season in 2015 16 due to insufficient rainfall the harvested water in the reservoir was very low the size of irrigated area in the irrigation scheme is usually decided based on the amount of harvested water besides the low amount of harvested water considering the amount of water that can be saved which otherwise would have been lost by seepage and evaporation from the reservoir the irrigation committee shifted the irrigation calendar by more than a month earlier from january 2016 to the end of november 2015 so that more farmers could be accommodated thus the practical and sophisticated irrigation calendars for the second season were updated accordingly 2 3 2 sophisticated cropwat simulated irrigation scheduling the cropwat 8 computer software developed by fao swennenhuis 2009 was used for determination of the crop and irrigation water requirement and irrigation scheduling this program helps to calculate the potential evapotranspiration et0 using various climatic data temperature humidity wind speed and sunshine hours based on penman monteith method long term climatic data table 2 from the nearby about 43 km far station were used the crop factor and length of growing season used were the same as in the practical approach using the cropwat model several options such as variable irrigation interval and amount irrigating at critical or fixed depletion fixed interval per growing stage and variable depth were consulted with the farmers and extension agents however for ease of understanding and comparisons of the new scheduling techniques practical and sophisticated by the majority farmers fixed irrigation interval for these two scheduling techniques were suggested by the group the soil input data for cropwat considered were texture clay total available soil moisture 160 mm table 2 maximum rain infiltration rate 30 mm day adapted from cropwat for clay soil initial moisture depletion 80 the amounts of applied water for all treatments were accounted starting on the first irrigation event day one which was done immediately after sowing 80 depletion was considered based on feel and appearance approach maximum rooting depth 2 m then based on the fixed irrigation interval and refilling to field capacity option the irrigation schedule was calculated 2 3 3 traditional irrigation schedule the traditional method of irrigation schedule represented the farmer s existing scheduling practice and was considered as a control the farmer was allowed to irrigate all the replications of the traditional treatment based on his experience without any interference of the researcher for the entire growth period yet the amount of applied water during each irrigation event was simply recorded using a parshall flume 2 4 experimental design nationally developed maize variety melkassa ii zea mays l which is popular in the study area was used as indicator crop in this study three treatments irrigation scheduling methods namely traditional practical and sophisticated cropwat simulated were replicated three times in randomized block design on farm in 2015 and 2015 16 irrigation seasons 2 5 data collection and analysis 2 5 1 soil samples from the experimental field pre treatment composite as well as undisturbed soil samples at 20 cm intervals down the profile up to 1 m were collected from three random locations in 2015 the soil texture ph and organic matter were analysed from the composite soil samples in a laboratory following the standard procedures soil bulk density bd field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp were analysed from the undisturbed soil samples further at planting and at harvest in both irrigation seasons soil samples were collected at 20 cm interval up to 1 m depth from all replications of each treatment and soil salinity of saturated extracts ece were measured at laboratory following a validated procedure 2 5 2 irrigation water pre plant irrigation is common practice in the study area to soften the soil for ploughing since it was done for the entire farm before the experimental lay out the amount was not included in our study the irrigation amounts applied to each plot were monitored starting the sowing date for the traditional scheduling treatment the farmer s irrigation intervals were recorded and the amount of applied water was monitored using parshall flume in each irrigation event for the practical and sophisticated treatments simple data sheets displaying instant calculations of the depths of applied water were prepared and the determined amounts of water were applied using parshall flumes at each irrigation events the salinity electrical conductivities ecw and ph of the irrigation water were monitored using portable and calibrated ec and ph meters 2 5 3 yield and yield components grain yield and yield components total fresh biomass plant height number of ears per plant ear length number of kernels per ear and 1000 kernels weight were measured at harvest physiological maturity 2 5 4 water productivity wp the ratio of crop yield to the amount of water applied was calculated using eq 8 8 w p y i where wp in kg m 3 y grain yield of maize kg ha 1 i total irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 2 5 5 farmers and local experts opinion farmers day was arranged at harvest of the maize crop in both irrigation seasons in the farmers day four groups were formed three groups were farmers group consisting of six farmers each and the fourth group was expert group formed from four staff members of the woreda local office of agriculture and rural development which constituted experts from extension irrigation crop and natural resources then each group was allowed to rank the crop stand of the three treatments moreover the farmers and the local experts opinions and suggestions regarding the conveniences and appropriateness of the different scheduling methods were collected through open discussions 2 5 6 statistical analysis mean comparison on the effect of irrigation treatments on yield and yield components as well as the soil salinity were done using spss 20 statistical software separately for each irrigation season 3 results 3 1 potential evapotranspiration et0 and crop evapotranspiration etc as depicted in table 2 the estimated monthly et0 for the irrigation season of the study area were higher for penman monteith as compared to the hargeaves method except in those three months from july to september although the climatic data used for both methods were collected from the same station at about 43 km distance in both irrigation seasons lower crop water needs etc were found in the practical method as compared to the sophisticated method the determined etc using the practical scheduling method were 508 mm and 456 mm in the 1st 2015 and 2nd 2015 16 irrigation seasons respectively table 3 in the sophisticated method these values were 756 8 mm and 708 9 mm for the former and latter irrigation seasons respectively table 8 3 2 irrigation amount and interval following the practical method the first calculated number of irrigation events 7 and the irrigation intervals 19 days were the same for both irrigation seasons table 5 however for the 1st season experiment the calculated dmnet using 19 days interval showed 33 mm and 32 mm water deficit in the months of march and april respectively table 6 similarly for the 2nd season a deficit of about 36 mm and 2 mm were shown in the months of february and march respectively to avoid crop losses refinement were done for the entire growing season based on the calculated deficit months iint 15 days as shown in table 7 for clarity the refined recalculated dmnet is placed in table 6 below 19 days interval column despite the difference in the planting dates of the irrigation seasons the adjusted irrigation interval appeared to be the same for both irrigation seasons in our calculation as shown in table 6 both deficit months feb mar were considered still for both irrigation seasons a small amount of monthly deficits are shown these deficits would be smaller when partitioned in the two irrigation events moreover considering the higher application depth 95 mm than the determined 93 3 mm due to rounding the deficits were ignored for the sophisticated method discussed in section 2 the irrigation interval considered 15 days and the determined irrigation events 9 times were the same as for the practical method the farmer s traditional irrigation interval ranged from 13 to 17 days and from 14 to 21 days for the 1st and 2nd season experiments respectively table 10 the minimum intervals were recorded in the 2nd and the maximum in the 3rd 4th and around the last irrigation events for both irrigation seasons the same numbers of irrigation events 8 were recorded for the traditional method for both irrigation seasons which were lower than the other approaches 9 the total water applied by the practical approach was 765 mm which was the same for both irrigation seasons however the total applied water in the 1st season experiment were 898 4 mm and 983 8 mm for the traditional and sophisticated methods respectively and during the 2nd season 873 1 mm and 960 9 mm were applied by the former and later approaches respectively higher depths of water were applied by the sophisticated followed by the traditional and then by the practical methods in both irrigation seasons the amount of water applied by the traditional approach depends upon the farmers experience in the first two irrigations the applied water were lower as compared to the rest of the irrigation events and showed almost an increasing trend except the last in both irrigation seasons in the traditional scheduling maximum depth 120 mm per applications were recorded in the 5th 6th and 7th irrigation events for the sophisticated approach higher application depths 130 mm were recorded during the 5th to 8th irrigation events in both treatments starting the 3rd for traditional and the 4th for sophisticated up to the last irrigation events there were frequent ponding of water on the plots for a considerable time 3 8 h after irrigation during these irrigation events wet soil surface for a couple of days were also observed especially in the sophisticated treatment plots 3 3 soil salinization the salinity electrical conductivity of the irrigation water varied across the growing seasons from 0 45 ds m 1 ph 7 45 at the beginning of irrigation seasons to 0 68 ds m 1 ph 7 6 at the end the distribution of salts ece at 20 cm interval down the soil profile up to 100 cm at planting and at harvest for both irrigation seasons is depicted in table 11 in the 1st season 2015 experiment the average root zone 100 cm salinity ece at planting were 1 69 1 94 and 1 83 ds m 1for the sophisticated traditional and practical treatments respectively statistically all were similar in the same season at harvest higher surface 0 20 cm salinity was found in the i2 2 43 ds m 1 followed by i1 2 34 ds m 1 and lower value was found in the i3 2 03 ds m 1 treatment in contrast the ece in the preceding profile 20 40 cm was higher in the i3 1 88 ds m 1 as compared to the other treatments lower soil salinity below 50 cm down the soil profile was found in the i1 compared to the other treatments in all treatments as shown in table 11 starting the second layer 20 40 cm the ece showed an increasing trend downward of the soil profile except the last profile in the i2 in 2015 although variations on the profile salt distributions were observed among the different treatments statistically only the surface 0 20 cm ece was significantly p 0 05 higher in the i2 as compared to the i3 in the same season the average ece at harvest were 2 41 2 57 and 2 46 ds m 1 for the i1 i2 and i3 respectively although a significant increment in soil salinities were observed at harvest as compared to planting in all treatment the average root zone salinities at harvest among all the treatments were not significantly different in 2015 16 at harvest the ece of i1was higher 2 22 ds m 1 at the surface 0 20 cm and lower at the preceding profiles as compared to the other treatments in contrast except in the surface 0 20 cm higher ece was found in all layers in the i3 compared to the other treatments the average ece across the entire profile were 2 04 ds m 1 2 19 ds m 1 and 2 3 ds m 1 in the i1 i2 and i3 respectively at harvest the soil salinity only in the 60 80 cm depth were significantly p 0 05 higher in i3 2 68 ds m 1 as compared to both i1 2 12 ds m 1 and i3 2 21 ds m 1 however the average root zone salinities between all treatments were not significantly different in both irrigation seasons although the severity varied between irrigation events after the soil dried a white efflorescence appeared on the surfaces of all treatments at harvest in both irrigation seasons lowest surface ece were found in the practical treatment and the lowest average root zone ece was found in the sophisticated treatment 3 4 yield and yield components the effect of different irrigation scheduling treatments showed significant results of maize biomass in both irrigation seasons table 12 in 2015 the i3 practical treatment significantly increased at p 0 05 the biomass as compared to other treatments i1 and i2 however in 2015 16 the results showed non significant differences in biomass between the i3 and other treatments maximum and minimum biomass of 25 8 t ha 1 2015 and 20 4 t ha 1 2015 16 were recorded in i3 and i1 treatments respectively in 2015 the biomass in both the i1 and i2 treatments showed non significant results although significant differences were found in 2015 16 as shown in table 12 the effect of different irrigation scheduling treatments showed non significant results in grain yield among all treatments in 2015 however in 2015 16 the i3 treatment gave significantly higher grain yield than all treatments in both irrigation seasons the i2 and i3 treatments were however statistically not significant in grain yield in 2015 average grain yield results were 4 78 4 83 and 5 22 t ha 1 in i1 i2 and i3 treatments respectively the corresponding grain yield in 2015 16 was 4 5 4 41 and 5 05 t ha 1 respectively the plant height was significantly higher for i3 as compared to i1 in 2015 however no significant differences on plant height were observed in 2015 16 the effect of irrigation scheduling on ear length showed no significant differences among all treatments in both irrigation seasons the number of ears per plant and the number of kernels per ear in 2015 16 were significantly higher for i3 as compared to i1 though all the treatments failed to show any significant differences in 2015 in the number of ears per plant and the number of kernels per ear in both years the i3 treatment significantly enhanced 1000 kernel weight as compared to other treatments though no significant differences in 1000 kernels weights were found between the i1 and i2 treatments in both years 3 5 water productivity wp the average water productivity of the different irrigation scheduling treatments is presented in table 12 the wp was significantly influenced by the different irrigation schedules in both irrigation seasons maximum wp 0 68 kg m 3 in 2015 and 0 66 kg m 3 in 2015 16 was found in i3 in both irrigation seasons the i1 treatment resulted in lower wp 0 49 kg m 3 in 2015 and 0 47 kg m 3 in 2015 16 in both irrigation seasons the i3 treatment significantly increased the wp as compared to the other i1 and i2 treatments in both irrigation seasons the wp for both i1 and i2 were not statistically significant in 2015 though the wp for i2 in 2015 16 was significantly higher than i1 the simple linear regression between wp and yield fig 2 showed that an increase in wp with yield increment and water decrement 3 6 farmers and local experts extension agents opinion 3 6 1 ranking of crop stand the farmers and extension agents groups mean rank according to their own criteria of the treatments are depicted in table 13 each group was invited to present their ranking results as well as major justifications in 2015 the i3 treatment was ranked the best by all of the groups although statistically similar as compared to i2 in the farmer group ii the treatment mean rank in i1 and i2 were the same for farmers group i and iii although the mean rank of i1 was the least for the experts and the farmers group ii compared to i2 it was significant only for the latter group in the second season 2015 16 similarly the i3 treatment was given the best rank by all except for farmers group ii which they gave same rank as i2 treatment the mean rank variation between i1 and i2 were significant for farmers group i and group ii in both irrigation seasons the farmer groups overall mean rank variation for i3 were significantly different best as compared to both i1 and i2 however the overall mean rank between i1 and i2 were statistically similar for both irrigation season from the groups presentation the farmers major criterion of ranking of the crop stand were the expected grain yield and total biomass which were judged from observation of the plant height stem thickness diameter and number of ears these criterions were similar for all groups except for the inclusion of visible surface salt white salt efflorescence by the experts group 3 6 2 scheduling technique opinions all the participants appreciated the water saved by the i3 practical technique while comparing the irrigation intervals most of the participants were in favor of the fixed irrigation interval i1 and i3 the major reasons raised were its convenience and easiness for individual farmers and scheme water distributors in such a way that they both will know ahead whose turn is next important concern raised by the farmers was the capacity and skill of the water users association wua on providing fixed interval based irrigation scheduling at scheme level the second major point raised by the experts was on the technical feasibility of measuring water by individual farmer water is not metered on farm in most irrigation scheme in ethiopia however during the experimental seasons the farmers were surprisingly able to classify the irrigation scheduling techniques qualitatively in their own local language based on their observation of the applied water to each treatment ablek leck means too much water for i1 limud means usual for i2 and chebreck chebreck means little by little for i3 4 discussions 4 1 effect of irrigation scheduling on potential evapotranspiration et0 and irrigation amount the determined crop water needs etc using the practical scheduling method were about 33 and 36 lower than that of the sophisticated method for the 1st 2015 and 2nd 2015 16 irrigation seasons respectively the obtained results also showed that the gross amount of applied water by the sophisticated method was higher by 28 6 2015 and 25 6 2015 16 than the practical method similarly the gross applied depths by the traditional method were higher by 17 4 and 14 1 as compared to the practical method for the corresponding irrigation seasons the big difference between the practical and sophisticated methods were entirely attributed to the methods used for estimating the potential evapotranspiration et0 by hargreaves and the penman monteith equations based on various climatic factors acquired from a meteorology station located at about 43 km distance respectively the penman monteith pm estimated monthly et0 were higher in all months except for the months of july to september as compared to hargreaves table 2 frequent field observations confirmed surface water pond and saturated soil for a significant time after irrigation in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments regarding the traditional practices this is in line with the finding of yohannes et al 2017 that reported qualitatively over watering practices of the farmers in the same irrigation scheme from their scheme level survey conducted in 2015 16 the penman monteith is worldwide recommended methodology under availability of representative and accurate weather data gathered from large and well watered area droogers and allen 2002 although the station where the climatic data adopted and the study area have similar elevation ethiopia in general and the region in particular is characterized with a complex variation in local topography yet dinku et al 2014 found strong dependence of temperature on elevation in ethiopia another study conducted in the country by boke 2017 generally indicated large errors in predicting or interpolating wind speed as compared to temperature sunshine fraction and rainfall although further robust researches on local climate and et0 are required considering the irrigation depth applied by the alternative approaches versus field observations the obtained crop performances and the observation by dinku et al 2014 and boke 2017 the findings of this research indicates that the overestimation of the penman monteith et0 was probably due to poor representation of most of the climatic data acquired from 43 km far station on the other hand the better performance of the hargreaves could be due to relatively better representation of temperature data the higher etc values in the 1st irrigation season as compared to the 2nd irrigation season in both scheduling methods were due to change in the irrigation calendar start of irrigation of the irrigation scheme which was relatively cooler for the 2nd season experiment 4 2 effect of irrigation scheduling on crop performance and water productivity higher grain yields were recorded in the practical method in both irrigation seasons although it was significant only in 2015 16 a significant biomass increase was also obtained in 2015 for the practical as compared to the other treatments over all the practical method resulted in better crop performance as compared to the other treatments since land preparation fertilizer application and other agronomic practices were the same for all treatments it can be concluded that the combined effect of the applied amount of irrigation water and interval created a favorable soil water environment for production of a greater amount of grain yield and overall better crop performance besides to lower grain yields the sophisticated and traditional methods resulted in applying more water than the practical method especially in the sophisticated method about 218 mm in 2015 and 196 mm in 2015 16 in excess of the practical method were applied the practical method significantly increased the water productivity in both irrigation seasons compared to the other methods table 12 the finding of this study showed that higher water productivities are associated with higher grain yields fig 2a as well as lower total irrigation depths fig 2b in both irrigation seasons these also confirms that there were over irrigation in both the sophisticated and traditional methods the higher amounts of applied water especially in i1 treatment were mainly responsible for lower photosynthetic performance through creation of aeration problem and other nutritional factors according to sakamoto et al 2011 peak development stage of the corn is more sensitive to over irrigation and over irrigation could essentially prevent the plants from retaining nutrition required for its development in a research conducted to quantify the impact of over irrigation on maize yield in nebraska united states irmak 2008 over irrigation of maize to 125 percent of etc resulted in yield reduction as compared with fully irrigated 100 percent etc another study conducted in limpopo south africa reported excessive irrigation water is among the factors for poor maize yields on farmer s fields machethe et al 2004 4 3 effect of irrigation schedules on soil salinization in both irrigation seasons at harvest table 11 lower surface 0 20 cm soil salinity and in the succeeding profile 20 40 cm higher soil salinity was observed in the practical compared to the other treatments during harvest the salinity values presented in table 11 generally indicated capillary salinization dominates compared to any potential leaching in the upper soil profiles of all treatments except for the practical treatment in 2015 16 as discussed in section 3 surface water ponds were common in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments due to the higher application depths in most of the irrigation events and poor internal drainage of the clayey soil table 1 thus evaporative concentration of salts at the surface and capillary movement from the succeeding soil profile are among the likely major reasons for relatively higher surface salt concentration in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments due to similar reasons akhand and al araj 2013 found higher salts in the upper 0 25 cm relative to the lower 25 50 cm depth which is in line with the finding of this research according to a survey conducted in 2015 16 in similar seasons in the study area yohannes et al 2017 also revealed that farmers believed over irrigation as the major cause for soil salinization in the irrigation scheme on the other hand in both irrigation seasons the average root zone salinity was slightly lower in the sophisticated treatment this indicates that despite the clayey textured soil leaching seem to be relatively better in the sophisticated treatment at planting of both irrigation seasons the salt concentrations were lower in all treatments this indicates that the effect of the rainy season decreases the salt concentration difference in salt concentration was also found between the irrigation seasons which was over all lower in the 2nd season this is attributed to the change in the planting date of the 2nd a month earlier experiment which reduced the capillary movement of soluble salts owing to relatively colder periods although a wide salinity tolerance exist among different maize cultivars genotypes as a general indication the yield potential under increasing salinity of water eci and soil ece is 100 at eci 1 1 ds m 1 and ece 1 7 ds m 1 90 at eci 1 7 ds m 1 and ece 2 5 ds m 1 and so on during harvest the average root zone salinity found in all treatments were lower than 2 5 ds m 1 the threshold for 90 yield potential except in 2015 where slightly higher 2 57 ds m 1 salinity was found in the traditional treatment according to various literatures farooq et al 2015 maas et al 1983 maas and hoffman 1976 maize is more sensitive to salinity at early stage emergence and vegetative than later growth stages development of grain yield and yield components considering the good quality 0 45 0 67 ds m 1 of the irrigation water utilized and the obtained average root zone salinities which were lower at planting and higher at harvest which is expected to be the maximum during the growing period due to gradual buildup of salts the average root zone salinity in all treatments will not generally significantly decrease the yield of maize in both irrigation seasons 4 4 farmers and experts opinion while conducting the field experiments many farmers had followed the entire progress cautiously in both irrigation seasons allowing farmers participation in on farm research encourages information feedback between farmers and researches it helps in identification of the limitations and requirements by the farmers in the selection of appropriate irrigation scheduling methods the local farmers and extension agents were in favor of the practical approach this result is more or less in agreement with the obtained results in section 3 in addition to water saving and better crop performance advantages the major reason for selection of the practical approach was its convenience for farmers and water distributors due to the fixed interval and constant application local extension agents need easy scheduling methodology while farmers also demand for simple practical and convenient calendars to achieve improved irrigation management at farm level clyma 1996 under low technology situations icid fao 1995 simple and operational rules with fixed interval and constant water application are recommended other main concerns raised by the farmers were skill and capacity of the wua to provide such schedule the wuas in many countries need capacity building in technical and institutional issues to improve the performance of irrigation schemes ghazouani et al 2012 kazbekov et al 2009 mutambara et al 2016 thiruchelvam 2010 the world bank 2006 thus building institutional capacity and technical skill of the wua should be considered to arrange and enforce predetermined scheduling calendars based on continuous field observation the farmers classification of the alternative irrigation scheduling techniques qualitatively and in their own local language in this study indicated that they are more or less capable of applying the desired amount of water roughly if allowed or participated in scheduling practices 5 conclusions despite the availability of various scientific irrigation scheduling techniques the adoption by farmers is poor mainly due the complexity of techniques inaccessibility of soil water monitoring tools lack of local climatic and soil water data and absence of stakeholders participation using hargreaves equation which requires only temperature data for estimation of et0 and based on the simple procedures for irrigation scheduling in brouwer et al 1989 as well as the local farmers and extension agents inputs a simple scheduling calendar practical for maize was tested and validated on farm against cropwat sophisticated simulated and farmers traditional scheduling methods for two years 2015 and 2015 16 at gumselassa irrigation scheme north ethiopia the result of the study showed that the practical approach resulted in higher grain yield substantial saving in irrigation water amount and subsequently in significant improvement in water productivity as compared to the other approaches in both years although most of the farmers in the study area are illiterate or completed an elementary school level they were surprisingly able to classify the alternative irrigation scheduling approaches based on the amount of applied water qualitatively in their own local language this leads to the conclusion that if allowed participated in scheduling practices farmers are more or less capable of applying the desired amount of water roughly based on their observations overall from results of the crop stand ranking and opinions of the alternative approaches the local farmers and experts were in favor of the practical approach this also gives important information that if the beneficiaries are allowed participated they can be equipped with practical facts to judge alternative technologies from their own perspectives for successful implementation of such simple irrigation calendar in a community managed irrigation schemes like gumselassa technical support and capacity building of the water users associations is required urgently especially on arranging and synchronizing schedules at scheme level in most rural areas of ethiopia as well as in other similar countries where climatic data are lacking or unreliable and the technology level of the farm is low this technique can significantly improve the irrigation water management practices furthermore local extension agents can practice and easily prepare irrigation calendars for different crops and planting dates following based on the practical procedure moreover researchers should build on and rectify on such simple procedures in different agro hydrological environments for wider use this study also recommended the need for local climate studies as well as observations facilities in the vicinity of irrigation schemes of the rural areas so that they can have their own representative meteorological data and accurate scheduling acknowledgment the research was funded by eau4food european union and african union cooperative research to increase food production in irrigated farming systems in africa project the authors would like to thank mr yemane adane mr tesfay k mariam and the farmers and extension agents around gumselassa irrigation scheme for their dedicated support and cooperation during the study 
11049,cotton is one of the major cash crops in xinjiang an arid region in northwestern china most cotton fields in this region are drip irrigated with plastic film mulch however few studies have tested the performance of the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer model on cotton under film mulched drip irrigation the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the modified csm cropgro cotton model and determine the genetic coefficients of cotton using data from different irrigation treatments conducted at the irrigation experiment station in bayingol mongolian autonomous prefecture korla china based on the selected genetic coefficients the model was calibrated using field experiment datasets in 2016 and validated using datasets in 2015 the simulation results of soil water content leaf area index phenological period and cotton yield were compared with their corresponding measurements absolute relative error are of seeding emergence date flowing date maturity date and cotton yield simulated by the original model were 5 8 7 3 5 0 and 70 6 respectively while those of the modified model were 1 7 1 1 1 1 and 0 1 respectively simulated leaf area index agreed well with the field observations with the coefficient of determination r2 0 739 the index of agreement d 0 910 and the root mean square error rmse 0 965 simulated soil water content in the 20 40 cm soil layer were generally consistent with the measured values with r2 0 724 d 0 639 and rmse 0 087 cm3 cm3 while the simulated soil water content in the 40 60 cm was slightly worse than the observations with r2 0 708 d 0 519 and rmse 0 109 cm3 cm3 overall the modified csm cropgro cotton model can be used as a practical tool to simulate the cotton growth under film mulched drip irrigation in this region potential opportunities for the model improvement in cotton growth include the influence of various scenarios such as soil types climates and irrigation strategies keywords cotton film mulched drip irrigation csm cropgro cotton model soil water content leaf area index 1 introduction dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer is currently one of the most widely used model systems for crop growth and development process on a daily basis it can respond to many factors including crop genetic characteristics management measures environment nitrogen and water stresses pests and diseases it is also used for agricultural experiment analysis agricultural output prediction agricultural production risk assessment and climate impact assessment on agriculture at present it consists of 26 main crop simulation models including ceres crop environment resource synthesis series cropgro bean crop model substorpotato potato model cropsimcassava cassava model oilcrop sunflower model and the newly added canegro sugarcane model jones et al 2003 however dssat lacked a module for fiber crops and cropgro is usually used as a template module for fiber crops instead of developing a new model thorp et al 2014 dssat 4 6 model integrates all the crop models into the csm cropping system model crop system model based on the modular simulation path dssat 4 6 is divided into data modules model modules analysis modules and tool modules jones et al 2003 after decades of improvement the ceres and cropgro models in the decision support system can better simulate and analyze the impact of many factors such as meteorology soil cultivar water and fertilizer management on the growth development and yield of various crops therefore the best decision for suitable local conditions can be made and has been widely applied successfully around the world mahmood 1998 asadi and clemente 2001 2003 huffman et al 2001 he et al 2011 2012 yang et al 2010 drip irrigation has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants fan et al 2017 yan et al 2019 while plastic film mulch can reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature li et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 drip irrigation under plastic film mulch has been widely used in the arid or semi arid regions such as the tarim river basin in xinjiang uygur autonomous region over the past two decades ayars et al 1999 feipeng et al 2003 ding et al 2013 wang et al 2018a b because it incorporates the advantages of drip irrigation and plastic film mulch in this irrigation system the soil is covered by plastic film to decrease evaporation effectively and cut off the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the soil at the same time and it also reduces soil salinization to some degree cai et al 2002 dong 2003 it can supply enough heat for sowing in the frigid spring sowing season especially for summer crops such as cotton which the largest crop in xinjiang s agricultural production in addition crops can acquire adequate water during the whole growing season in spite of high evaporative demands under this pattern li et al 2001 2004 on the other hand by avoiding water vapor waste and decreasing needless evaporation film mulched drip irrigation proves to be an economic technology to change soil micro climate thermal environment and improve water use efficiency zhang et al 2014b in this context crop evapotranspiration reduced under plastic mulch compared to the bare soil cotton is the most widely cultivated fiber crop in the world and its output directly affects the vital interests of famers yang et al 2016 meanwhile cotton gossypium hirsutum l is widely planted in southern xinjiang based on its favorable heat and sunlight conditions most cotton fields are irrigated using the film mulched drip irrigation system tian et al 2017 many researchers have performed the field experiments to explore the cotton growth and development rule and water requirement rule however the experimental results are difficult to popularize and apply because they are time consuming and laborious and the spatiotemporal environment and irrigation management limit their applications it is an economical and effective research method to establish a numerical simulation model and obtain an optimized scheme by using limited field experiment data wang et al 2012 2016 as for cotton simulation the performance of csm cropgro cotton model has not yet been evaluated under film mulched drip irrigation in the kaidu peacock river basin of xinjiang therefore the study on the simulation of cotton growth under the drip irrigation with plastic film mulch condition is necessary the csm cropgro cotton model cannot simulate the water saving and yield increasing processes under plastic film mulch as there is no mulch module in this model this largely limits the application of the model in drip irrigation fields under plastic film mulch although the csm cropgro cotton model has not yet been reported for simulating the process of crop growth under plastic film mulch this process has been investigated using other crop models for instance han et al 2014 proposed the theory of surface soil warming based on the dndc denitrification decomposition model and established a simulation model for the surface soil warming effect under plastic film mulch ning et al 2015 developed an improved aquacrop model suitable for maize growth under plastic film mulch based on the compensation effect of soil accumulated temperature on air accumulated temperature ai and yang 2016 discussed the parameterization scheme of the surface albedo of the priestley taylor model under film mulch and determined the priestley taylor parameters which accurately described the evapotranspiration under plastic film mulch li et al 2013 quantitatively analyzed the distribution mechanism of evapotranspiration under film mulch from the view of energy balance by means of vorticity observation system and lysimeter and also established the crop coefficients of the corresponding crops pan et al 1996 established the cotgrow explanatory model on cotton growth and development dynamic on the basis of gossym cotton model by introducing the film mulch ratio and influencing degree factors it is difficult to explain the complex interactions between plastic film mulch and soil environment at the site scale only based on field experiments and as noted in the literature review few models address it here we chose the csm cropgro cotton model for our studies which has been proved to simulate various crops at different scenarios the objective of this study was to adjust the csm cropgro cotton model to adapt to the plastic film mulch condition we hypothesize that potential evapotranspiration and soil evaporation are changed under plastic film mulch which further changes the soil moisture and cotton growth process first the estimation processes of surface albedo and potential evapotranspiration were modified by considering the impacts of plastic film mulch scenarios then soil evaporation was revised relying on evapotranspiration partitioning and cotton physiology finally the modified model was calibrated and validated using data from field experiments this study emphasizes the establishment of a modified csm cropgro cotton model under film mulched drip irrigation for the site in the kaidu peacock river basin and maybe elsewhere with similar drip irrigation practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiments were performed at the irrigation experiment station of xinjiang institute of water resources and hydropower research which belongs to the xinjiang bayingol mongolian autonomous prefecture water management office the filed site 86 09 e 42 35 n is located in the suburbs of korla in southern xinjiang an autonomous region in northwestern china which is on the foot of tianshan mountain and northeast edge of taklamakan desert this region has a temperate continental desert climate and belongs to the kaidu peacock river basin a tributary of tarim river the annual rainfall and temperature are about 60 mm and 11 5 respectively the mean annual potential evaporation measured using an evaporation pan with the inside diameter equal to 20 cm reaches 2788 mm according to the soil texture classification of the us department of agriculture the soil textures at this field is mainly composed of silty loam 41 4 sand 54 4 silt and 4 2 clay fig 1 the soil bulk density of the experiment field varies from 1 11 g cm 3 to 1 64 g cm 3 in the 0 1 5 m soil profile and the saturated water content of soil is nearly 0 45 before the experiment the 0 1 0 m soil depth were divided into 5 layers and the soil particle size distribution form each layer was analyzed by a laser particle size analyzer the wilting point field water capacity and saturated water content were determined by high speed centrifugation the bulk density of each layer was measured by the ring knife method the initial soil water content was also measured before planting and determined by the soil drying method other model input data were obtained from the china soil database the soil properties including the saturated water content field capacity and wilting point in the experiment field are listed in table 1 zhang et al 2014a yang et al 2016 tan et al 2018 the average depth of groundwater was about 6 m in 2015 and 2016 the experimental cotton cultivar is xinluzhong 55 one of gossypium hirsutum l 2 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted during the 2015 and 2016 cotton growing seasons under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch the cotton adopted the planting mode of one film two pipes and four rows of cotton arrangement fig 2 that is 15 cm 20 cm 40 cm 20 cm 15 cm with the row spacing of 40 cm 20 cm under the plastic film and 30 cm in the bare soil the plant spacing within a row was 10 cm and the actual planting density was 22 plants m 2 by considering an average emergency rate of 0 77 a polyethylene resin embedded thin walled labyrinth drip tape with an inner diameter of 16 mm was used with an emitter spacing of 30 cm and emitter discharge range of 1 8 l h in this pattern each drip pipe was placed in the middle of the two cotton rows beneath the film mulch so each basic planting unit was divided into three parts wide row narrow row and bare soil fig 2 the irrigation water mainly came from the peacock river with the average irrigation salinity of 0 8 g l in order to provide sufficient water and to leach salt from the soil flood irrigation irrigation amount about 300 mm was carried out every spring before seeding early april when the cotton started to emergence drip irrigation was conducted the conventional irrigation amount in this region was about 500 mm based on annual water requirement for cotton as for the 2015 season we took the conventional irrigation as full irrigation treatment t6 and other treatments t1 t5 were set up in proportion relative to t6 as for the 2016 season only two irrigation treatments t7 t8 were set up i e full and deficit irrigation the full irrigation was based on the results calculated by the water balance method in 2015 the details and irrigation schedules are shown in table 2 cotton was sown after plowing on 25 april in 2015 and 21 april in 2016 basal fertilizers 700 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate with 18 n and 46 p 75 kg ha 1 urea with 46 n 75 kg ha 1 potassium sulfate with 45 k2o and 600 kg ha 1 compound fertilizer with 25 n 25 k and 25 p were directly applied in the field before sowing following the local agronomic practices additional fertilizers 675 kg ha 1 urea and 150 kg ha 1 potassium dihydrogen phosphate were applied through the drip irrigation system during the two cotton growing seasons the cotton plants were manually topped at the end of july during the two seasons 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 meteorological data solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall are the main driving factors for plant growth and development garcia et al 2008 li et al 2015 fan et al 2018 2019b which are the minimum daily meteorological data required by the csm cropgro cotton model these meteorological data were collected from the davis wireless vantage pro2 weather station davis instruments hayward usa installed in the experimental field the daily meteorological data during the two cotton growing seasons are shown in fig 3 2 3 2 measurement of soil water content soil moisture was determined by the pr2 moisture meter which was calibrated by the oven drying method 105 24 h due to the large number of irrigation events over the whole growth period of cotton the soil samples were only collected before sowing before irrigation at the key growth stages three sampling points were set up in each plot to measure the soil water content in the same section at the wide row below the emitter narrow row and the bare soil middle position between the plastic film the description of soil moisture by dssat model is based on the principle of one dimensional water balance so the area weighted average soil moisture over the mulched and bare areas 0 79 under film 0 21 bare soil was calculated and used for model calibration and validation the soil sample layers were 0 10 10 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively 2 3 3 cotton growth measurement 2 3 3 1 emergence rate emergence counts were observed every three days after sowing at the end of seeding stage the survival rate of emergence per unit area was measured and then the whole area was estimated the emergence rate was calculated as follow 1 emergence rate plant count sowing number 100 2 3 3 2 cotton growth index six representative cotton plants three inside line and three outside line with uniform growth were selected for each plot the leaf area index and effective boll number of cotton were measured at each growth stage of cotton and addition tests were conducted at the flowering and boll formation stages the cotton yield was measured after the experiments leaf area index the length and width of each leaf was measured with a tape the leaf area of the whole individual plant was then calculated and leaf area index was finally calculated as follow 2 lai leaf area ground area where lai leaf area index a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies yield and components at harvest three fields with a uniform and robust area of 6 67 m2 were randomly selected from each treatment the number of bolls larger than 2 cm in diameter was recorded a total of 30 bolls 40 bolls and 30 bolls were picked from the upper middle and lower cotton plant layers of each plot respectively to calculate 100 bolls weight 2 4 model calibration and validation the crop management data was used to set up the test document and input field management data including sowing density sowing date irrigation and fertilization date the experiment data module in csm cropgro cotton was used to input test data experimental observation data were divided into two types one was time dependent observation data such as soil moisture plant height leaf area index and biomass etc and these observations were t files in the model input the other was final observation data such as phenology yield harvest etc and these observations were a files in the model input in the csm cropgro cotton model 18 cotton genetic coefficients debugged are shown in table 3 the method of photoperiod calculation for cotton growth period was used to calibrate the variety parameters phenology soil moisture cotton yield leaf area index and dry matter quality were selected as target variables a necessary prerequisite for model application is to calibrate and validate the model to ensure the accuracy and reliability of simulation because different model parameters will obtain various model output tremblay and wallach 2004 among many model calibration methods we can manually adjust several specific parameters by the trial and error method then compare the simulated values with the measured values to evaluate the accuracy of the model but the result is very subjective the most reliable method is to divide the field measured data into two parts one part is used to calibrate and the other is used to validate thorp et al 2007 in general it is necessary to use the data without water and nitrogen stress to calibrate the parameters of the model according to the previous study of ji et al 2014 the ceres and cropgro series model can accurately simulate the growth and yield of crops under the condition of sufficient water and nitrogen supply while the simulation accuracy is not high under the condition of water and nitrogen deficit according to the data of full irrigation and deficit irrigation experiments in this study the model was calibrated with full irrigation treatment in 2016 and validated with the other treatments this study did not adopt the glue generalized likelihood uncertainly estimation parameter adjustment method provided by csm cropgro cotton but adopted meteorological soil experimental observation data literature review and other methods combined with the photoperiod calculation method to select a set of reasonable parameterization formula the genetic coefficients used in this study are shown in table 4 the purpose of this study was to understand the process of crop growth rather than to derive the best parameterization scheme the selected parameters must ensure that the simulated phenological period is close to the observations because the high accuracy of phenological simulation is the key and foundation for crop models to simulate crop growth and subsequently soil water content leaf area index lai and yield this study is based on the supercomputing platform of northwest a f university microsoft visual studio 2015 professional and parallel studio 2016 for code compilation and computation origin 9 0 was used to create figures in this study the model was validated using the data from the 2016 season the calibration and validation of model parameters were evaluated by absolute relative error are eq 3 and root mean square error rmse eq 4 because they can reflect the relative difference between the simulated and the measured values moriasi et al 2007 fan et al 2019a at the same time are belongs to dimensionless statistics which can be used to compare different variables the smaller the value of the two the higher the accuracy of the simulation as they approach 0 it presents a good match between the simulations and observations the coefficient of determination r2 eq 5 represents the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model the index of agreement d eq 6 is a measure of the degree to which the observed data are approached by the simulated data and overcomes when r2 is close to 1 or d 0 65 it indicates that the performance of simulation is good while the results from simulation are considered acceptable if r2 0 5 van liew et al 2003 wu

2 5 model improvement 2 5 1 drawback of original csm cropgro cotton model plastic film mulch can increase soil surface temperature preserve soil moisture and improve radiation yang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 soil warming is mainly achieved by inhibiting soil evaporation reducing heat loss and blocking heat exchange in the surface layer and increasing net radiation jiye et al 2008 due to the change of soil temperature and water condition the simulation of the phenology soil moisture leaf area and yield have large deviation from fig 4 we can see that the model underestimated the growth process of cotton leaf area index which is due to that the film mulch greatly increased the soil temperature and soil water storage at the seeding stage however this was not considered in the model leading to inaccurate calculation of photoperiod and potential evapotranspiration while grown as an annual cotton is a perennial crop and cotton planted in xinjiang requires manual topping in many places pruning is needed and vegetative branches are removed topping is the traditional management practice for cotton in xinjiang which can stop the growth of the top promote the extension of fruit branches and improve the dry matter distribution most cotton models do not consider the topping phenomenon so they are capped cutout only when the nutrient supply is insufficient therefore when the nutrient supply is sufficient and the environmental conditions permit the plant height the number of main stem nodes and the number of fruit branches are likely to increase this is different from the development of cotton in xinjiang therefore when using the csm cropgro cotton model to simulate the dynamic process of cotton plant height there will have continuous growth condition as shown in fig 4 plastic film mulch can increase the soil surface temperature significantly reduce soil evaporation promote crop transpiration and significantly increase cotton yield and water use efficiency relative to cotton grown without a film mulch in this region the cropgro cotton model only has air temperature parameters and no soil temperature module so the model can not simulate the impact of increased soil temperature on growth processes under plastic film mulch at the same time the calculation of accumulated temperature is based on air temperature rather than soil temperature which determines the calculation of cotton phenology by the model the growth period of cotton under plastic film mulch is earlier than without mulch the main reason is that the accumulated temperature of cotton covered with plastic film compensates the deficiency of effective air accumulated temperature of cotton at the same time the model underestimates soil moisture because the model does not consider the fact that the plastic film mulch reduces soil evaporation and changes soil water storage the lower leaf area index simulated by the original model is mainly due to the turgor factor affecting the leaf development and the stress factors affecting other physiological processes when the seeding stage is subjected to water stress the leaf area growth is slower and the photosynthetic products are due to the influence of turgor factor in this way the growth of photosynthetic products and leaf area is very small after water stress and makes it impossible to restore leaf growth at later growth stages in addition to water nitrogen and phosphorus are also important components of leaves the single factor of water stress is considered in the model and the effect of nutrient content on plant transpiration is not considered therefore the simulation process can not completely reflect the actual growth of cotton leaves in addition the actual photosynthesis process is not considered in the model and the mechanism of physiological and ecological process is lacking water stress is a major factor threatening agricultural production across a wide range of irrigated croplands in china the first water stress factor mainly affects the extensional growth of crops such as elongation of internodes and extension of leaves the growth process of crops is more sensitive to water stress than other physiological processes the second water stress factor may decrease the development rate plastic film mulch can reduce soil water loss by inhibiting evaporation but it can also reduce soil water income the precipitation in this area during cotton growth period can be neglected or plant biomass is relatively large which can also enhance transpiration and soil water content may be reduced generally speaking the water content of cotton field covered with plastic film mulch before bud stage is higher than that after bud stage 2 5 2 improvement of potential evapotranspiration under plastic mulch in the csm cropgro cotton model the crop evapotranspiration etc is calculated by means of potential evapotranspiration pet and simulated crop coefficient kc the calculation of potential evapotranspiration includes the priestley taylor and fao56 penman monteith models the default calculation method of potential evapotranspiration in the csm cropgro cotton model is the priestley taylor model however the fao56 penman monteith method was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration in this paper the windy and sandy climate in bayingol of xinjiang will have a great impact on the cotton growth process in view of the fao56 penman monteith method the wind speed and relative humidity the input dew point temperature in csm model were considered in the calculation process the fao56 penman monteith method calculated the potential evapotranspiration based on solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity allen and pereiral 1998 fan et al 2016 7 e t 0

potential evapotranspiration at the same time during the simulating process of crop growth and development the first factor to consider was the accuracy of phenological simulation and the crop phenology was largely affected by crop potential evapotranspiration therefore the effect of film mulch on evapotranspiration needs to be considered first in this paper we used the stics model to describe the evapotranspiration under plastic mulch condition to improve the evapotranspiration estimation mary et al 2009 8 r n e t 1 a l b e d o l a i t r g r g l o where rnet net radiation mj m 2

and long wave radiation received by the earth surface will increase the land surface temperature emitting some long wave radiation while reflecting part of the solar radiation and the rest is the net radiation bonan 2015 net radiation is dissipated by potential evapotranspiration convection and conduction the potential evapotranspiration is allocated to soil evaporation and plant transpiration at a certain proportion sau et al 2004 found that among several methods for calculating potential evapotranspiration in the csm cropgro cotton model the priestley taylor model overestimated potential evapotranspiration to a certain extent especially at the early stage of crop growth and the simulation of fao24 penman monteith was the worst it was concluded that the default extinction coefficient in the dssat model was 0 85 while the accuracy of all the methods calculated for the potential evapotranspiration were increased when the extinction coefficient changed to 0 5 therefore the extinction coefficients used in this paper are as follows ktrans 0 85 ksevap 0 5 where ktrans light extinction coefficient used for computation of plant transpiration ksevap light extinction coefficient used for computation of soil evaporation crop models have been used to provide decision making for yield increase under water stress jones et al 2017 however this requires that the model has a precise water balance the csm cropgro cotton model defines whether crops are subjected to water stress by comparing the relationship between potential transpiration or plant water demand and potential root uptake or plant absorbable soil water saseendran et al 2008 therefore accurate allocation of crop potential evapotranspiration is also an important prerequisite for determining soil water status 2 5 4 improvement of soil evaporation under plastic mulch condition in the csm cropgro cotton model soil moisture is simulated by dividing the soil into different layers at first according to the water balance method ritchie 1998 and then using ritchie one dimensional tipping bucket water balance method jones et al 2003 to simulate soil water movement and root water uptake while soil evaporation is carried out by the two stage evaporation model ritchie 1972 which divides evaporation into two stages zheng et al 2016 the evaporation process of the first stage is described by the potential evaporation rate of the soil which is determined by the evaporation capacity of the atmosphere when evaporation reaches the evaporation limit value u at the first stage evaporation enters the second stage from the first stage this process is not affected by rainfall after entering the second stage the evaporation rate is lower than the potential evaporation rate of the soil and the cumulative evaporation in the second stage is a function of the square root of the time the two stages of evaporation are calculated as follows the first stage 11 e s 1 t 1 1 t 1 e s 0 u w h e n t t 1 the second stage 12 e s 2 α t t 1 w h e n t t 1 where es1 cumulative evaporation in the first stage mm d es0 evaporation on that day α soil hydraulic characteristic coefficient empirical parameters depending on different soil conditions mm d0 5 t1 the time of cumulative evaporation in the first stage d es2 cumulative evaporation in the second stage mm d t the total time of evaporation d because plastic film mulch can reduce soil moisture loss by inhibiting evaporation the influence of regional precipitation on soil moisture can be neglected that is the influence of soil infiltration can be neglected at the same time the calculation process of soil evaporation is also improved based on the introduction of the plastic film ratio as follows 13 e p e p 1 c o u v e r m u l c h 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration plastic film mulch can increase surface soil temperature conserve soil moisture and improve radiation status especially it has greater impact for cotton growth at the early stage but less impact after the cotton canopy closure the soil temperature at 5 cm depth covered with plastic film can be increased by 2 5 from mid april to late may 1 3 in early june and not in july the soil temperature at 10 cm depth was increased by 2 6 2 7 in april 2 4 3 7 in may and 2 0 2 9 in june but not after in july with the growth of cotton the shading area of branches and leaves increased and the warming effect decreased after soil warming the increase of accumulated soil temperature can compensate for the deficiency of accumulated air temperature accelerate the growth and development of aboveground parts by promoting root growth and activity every increase of soil temperature at 1 in bud stage can be equivalent to 0 5 in air temperature and 0 2 at the flowering stage china society of plastic film mulching cultivation 1988 pan 2003 the modified model can greatly improve the simulation results of leaf area index and soil water content fig 5 although the modified model has greatly improved the simulation performance of cotton under plastic mulch drip irrigation than the original model its mechanism still needs to be discussed it is also necessary to carry out multi sites and multi sample experiment data to further validate its universality and applicability it can be seen that the cropgro cotton could not accurately describe the phenological phase table 5 yield table 5 leaf area index fig 6 and soil moisture fig 7 of cotton under plastic film mulch first of all it is necessary to simulate the phenological phase precisely because the distribution and accumulation of photosynthates are completely different at various growth stages some field experiments have confirmed that plastic film mulch can advance emergence huang et al 2008 li et al 2010 and li et al 2004 observed that emergence was 8 d earlier for spring wheat under plastic film mulch these previous field studies well matched the simulated results of the present study table 5 soil water is an important factor affecting the phenology of cotton during the vegetative growth stage especially at the seeding stage water stress will postpone the flowering and emergency of cotton at the same time temperature is also an important factor during the reproductive stage especially during the boll opening stage and insufficient accumulated temperature will advance maturity of cotton that s why the simulated growth period is shorter than the actual one 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 leaf area index lai the model was further validated by the field experimental data obtained in 2015 the distribution of leaf area index fig 8 and soil volumetric water content figs 9 14 under the condition of plastic film mulch were simulated and the time interval output data with measured data can be selected it can be seen that the simulated value of lai is in good agreement with the measured value of the observed during the growth period lai showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing over time with the maximum reaching 200 220 days of year this period was in a relatively vigorous period of cotton vegetative growth and photosynthesis was relatively sufficient over time cotton growth gradually changed from vegetative growth to reproductive growth at this stage water and nutrition needed for cotton growth decreased and were gradually transferred from the leaves to the reproductive organs lai growth rate decreased and began to decline the simulated leaf area index fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r2 0 739 the index of agreement d 0 910 and root mean square error rmse 0 965 table 9 the model somewhat overestimated lai in t1 t4 at 200 220 doy it perhaps due to that the plant transpiration in the model was higher than the actual situation and the extent of the positive effect of plastic film mulching should be quantitative analysis we may be able to understand the soil water and heat transfer under mulch conditions through the relationship between plastic film mulch and bare soil temperature in future studies 3 2 2 soil water content the modified model predicted soil water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer during the two growing seasons for data of t1 t8 with r2 of 0 653 d of 0 5370 and rmse of 0 098 cm3 cm3 respectively tables 7 and 8 the model also slightly underestimated soil water content in the deep soil profile below 40 cm especially in the deficit irrigation treatments of t1 t2 and t3 figs 9 11 the simulated soil water content for the five treatments t1 t5 were close to the measured values in the 0 40 cm soil layer during the growing season except for that at late stage 250 300 doy while the model overestimated soil water content in the five treatments for the 0 20 cm layer these overestimations may be due to that the coefficient for plant transpiration was not adjusted in the model similar differences have been found in the studies on the application of other models for cotton hussein et al 2011 meanwhile the csm cropgro cotton model described the root development as an empirical formula related to maximum effective root length and time water stress was determined by potential root uptake and it was difficult to explain the complex situation under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch and changeable cotton root density it suggested that the partitioning of evapotranspiration needed further improvement and the calculation of root density needed new understanding and approaches from figs 9 14 it can be seen that the modified model can describe the surface soil moisture to a certain extent while the simulation values of deep soil below 40 cm is quite different from the measured values the main roots of cotton are distributed in the 0 40 cm layer which is the main layer for roots to absorb water the root system gradually decreases with the increase in soil depth and the water absorption thus decreases from top to bottom that s why the soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer shows a gradual increasing trend but the change range is not obvious around 40 cm when the soil depth is 40 80 cm the observed soil water content is almost constant meanwhile the average depth of groundwater is shallow so that groundwater recharges the upper soil soil water content in other ranges is higher than that below 80 cm which indicates that seepage will occur at 80 cm root seepage should be estimated when calculating water consumption of cotton therefore in the simulation of 80 cm soil moisture there is an overestimation phenomenon which is not considered in the improved model the genetic coefficients of cotton cultivars were corrected with the data of full irrigation and water stress in 2016 as shown in table 4 at the same time the full irrigation field data in 2015 were used to verify the genetic coefficients it can be seen that are between the measured value and the simulated value of the modified model results for phenological period and yield are both less than 2 tables 5 and 6 the model can describe cotton leaf area index and surface soil water content better indicating that the calibration and validation results of cotton genetic coefficients are preferably this indicates that the genetic coefficients of cotton can be used as the coefficients of xinluzhong 55 so as to carry out more simulation calculations the improved csm cropgro cotton model in this paper can adequately reflect the growth and development of cotton under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch which provides a reliable analysis tool for the study of crop water consumption under plastic film mulch and water management of plastic film mulched farmland it should be pointed out that the transport of water and heat of crops and soils under plastic film mulch are very complex processes the model established in this paper has made many necessary simplifications so some parameters themselves need further study and improvement in the future 4 conclusions since the emergence of plastic film mulch technology many countries around the world have carried out extensive research regarding its effect on increasing temperature and preserving moisture as well as its underlying mechanism based on the redistribution of evapotranspiration in cotton fields covered with plastic film mulch the csm cropgro cotton has been improved in accordance with the principle of a one dimensional water balance the potential evapotranspiration was first modified by adding the stics model algorithms for describing the evapotranspiration under plastic mulch condition the extinction coefficients were further changed based on recommended values and the calculation of soil evaporation was improved by the introduction of the plastic film ratio the simulation results of soil water content leaf area index phenological period and cotton yield indicated that the modified csm cropgro cotton model was more accurate than the original model for simulating cotton growth under plastic film mulch in southern xinjiang china although the modified model has greatly improved the simulation of cotton under plastic film mulch compared with the original model the universality and applicability of this model need more data from various years and multi sites and samples for further verification meanwhile the modification of film mulch focused on potential evapotranspiration and soil evaporation but the compensation effect of soil temperature should also be considered in future studies acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the national key research and

11049,cotton is one of the major cash crops in xinjiang an arid region in northwestern china most cotton fields in this region are drip irrigated with plastic film mulch however few studies have tested the performance of the dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer model on cotton under film mulched drip irrigation the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the modified csm cropgro cotton model and determine the genetic coefficients of cotton using data from different irrigation treatments conducted at the irrigation experiment station in bayingol mongolian autonomous prefecture korla china based on the selected genetic coefficients the model was calibrated using field experiment datasets in 2016 and validated using datasets in 2015 the simulation results of soil water content leaf area index phenological period and cotton yield were compared with their corresponding measurements absolute relative error are of seeding emergence date flowing date maturity date and cotton yield simulated by the original model were 5 8 7 3 5 0 and 70 6 respectively while those of the modified model were 1 7 1 1 1 1 and 0 1 respectively simulated leaf area index agreed well with the field observations with the coefficient of determination r2 0 739 the index of agreement d 0 910 and the root mean square error rmse 0 965 simulated soil water content in the 20 40 cm soil layer were generally consistent with the measured values with r2 0 724 d 0 639 and rmse 0 087 cm3 cm3 while the simulated soil water content in the 40 60 cm was slightly worse than the observations with r2 0 708 d 0 519 and rmse 0 109 cm3 cm3 overall the modified csm cropgro cotton model can be used as a practical tool to simulate the cotton growth under film mulched drip irrigation in this region potential opportunities for the model improvement in cotton growth include the influence of various scenarios such as soil types climates and irrigation strategies keywords cotton film mulched drip irrigation csm cropgro cotton model soil water content leaf area index 1 introduction dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer is currently one of the most widely used model systems for crop growth and development process on a daily basis it can respond to many factors including crop genetic characteristics management measures environment nitrogen and water stresses pests and diseases it is also used for agricultural experiment analysis agricultural output prediction agricultural production risk assessment and climate impact assessment on agriculture at present it consists of 26 main crop simulation models including ceres crop environment resource synthesis series cropgro bean crop model substorpotato potato model cropsimcassava cassava model oilcrop sunflower model and the newly added canegro sugarcane model jones et al 2003 however dssat lacked a module for fiber crops and cropgro is usually used as a template module for fiber crops instead of developing a new model thorp et al 2014 dssat 4 6 model integrates all the crop models into the csm cropping system model crop system model based on the modular simulation path dssat 4 6 is divided into data modules model modules analysis modules and tool modules jones et al 2003 after decades of improvement the ceres and cropgro models in the decision support system can better simulate and analyze the impact of many factors such as meteorology soil cultivar water and fertilizer management on the growth development and yield of various crops therefore the best decision for suitable local conditions can be made and has been widely applied successfully around the world mahmood 1998 asadi and clemente 2001 2003 huffman et al 2001 he et al 2011 2012 yang et al 2010 drip irrigation has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants fan et al 2017 yan et al 2019 while plastic film mulch can reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature li et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 drip irrigation under plastic film mulch has been widely used in the arid or semi arid regions such as the tarim river basin in xinjiang uygur autonomous region over the past two decades ayars et al 1999 feipeng et al 2003 ding et al 2013 wang et al 2018a b because it incorporates the advantages of drip irrigation and plastic film mulch in this irrigation system the soil is covered by plastic film to decrease evaporation effectively and cut off the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the soil at the same time and it also reduces soil salinization to some degree cai et al 2002 dong 2003 it can supply enough heat for sowing in the frigid spring sowing season especially for summer crops such as cotton which the largest crop in xinjiang s agricultural production in addition crops can acquire adequate water during the whole growing season in spite of high evaporative demands under this pattern li et al 2001 2004 on the other hand by avoiding water vapor waste and decreasing needless evaporation film mulched drip irrigation proves to be an economic technology to change soil micro climate thermal environment and improve water use efficiency zhang et al 2014b in this context crop evapotranspiration reduced under plastic mulch compared to the bare soil cotton is the most widely cultivated fiber crop in the world and its output directly affects the vital interests of famers yang et al 2016 meanwhile cotton gossypium hirsutum l is widely planted in southern xinjiang based on its favorable heat and sunlight conditions most cotton fields are irrigated using the film mulched drip irrigation system tian et al 2017 many researchers have performed the field experiments to explore the cotton growth and development rule and water requirement rule however the experimental results are difficult to popularize and apply because they are time consuming and laborious and the spatiotemporal environment and irrigation management limit their applications it is an economical and effective research method to establish a numerical simulation model and obtain an optimized scheme by using limited field experiment data wang et al 2012 2016 as for cotton simulation the performance of csm cropgro cotton model has not yet been evaluated under film mulched drip irrigation in the kaidu peacock river basin of xinjiang therefore the study on the simulation of cotton growth under the drip irrigation with plastic film mulch condition is necessary the csm cropgro cotton model cannot simulate the water saving and yield increasing processes under plastic film mulch as there is no mulch module in this model this largely limits the application of the model in drip irrigation fields under plastic film mulch although the csm cropgro cotton model has not yet been reported for simulating the process of crop growth under plastic film mulch this process has been investigated using other crop models for instance han et al 2014 proposed the theory of surface soil warming based on the dndc denitrification decomposition model and established a simulation model for the surface soil warming effect under plastic film mulch ning et al 2015 developed an improved aquacrop model suitable for maize growth under plastic film mulch based on the compensation effect of soil accumulated temperature on air accumulated temperature ai and yang 2016 discussed the parameterization scheme of the surface albedo of the priestley taylor model under film mulch and determined the priestley taylor parameters which accurately described the evapotranspiration under plastic film mulch li et al 2013 quantitatively analyzed the distribution mechanism of evapotranspiration under film mulch from the view of energy balance by means of vorticity observation system and lysimeter and also established the crop coefficients of the corresponding crops pan et al 1996 established the cotgrow explanatory model on cotton growth and development dynamic on the basis of gossym cotton model by introducing the film mulch ratio and influencing degree factors it is difficult to explain the complex interactions between plastic film mulch and soil environment at the site scale only based on field experiments and as noted in the literature review few models address it here we chose the csm cropgro cotton model for our studies which has been proved to simulate various crops at different scenarios the objective of this study was to adjust the csm cropgro cotton model to adapt to the plastic film mulch condition we hypothesize that potential evapotranspiration and soil evaporation are changed under plastic film mulch which further changes the soil moisture and cotton growth process first the estimation processes of surface albedo and potential evapotranspiration were modified by considering the impacts of plastic film mulch scenarios then soil evaporation was revised relying on evapotranspiration partitioning and cotton physiology finally the modified model was calibrated and validated using data from field experiments this study emphasizes the establishment of a modified csm cropgro cotton model under film mulched drip irrigation for the site in the kaidu peacock river basin and maybe elsewhere with similar drip irrigation practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiments were performed at the irrigation experiment station of xinjiang institute of water resources and hydropower research which belongs to the xinjiang bayingol mongolian autonomous prefecture water management office the filed site 86 09 e 42 35 n is located in the suburbs of korla in southern xinjiang an autonomous region in northwestern china which is on the foot of tianshan mountain and northeast edge of taklamakan desert this region has a temperate continental desert climate and belongs to the kaidu peacock river basin a tributary of tarim river the annual rainfall and temperature are about 60 mm and 11 5 respectively the mean annual potential evaporation measured using an evaporation pan with the inside diameter equal to 20 cm reaches 2788 mm according to the soil texture classification of the us department of agriculture the soil textures at this field is mainly composed of silty loam 41 4 sand 54 4 silt and 4 2 clay fig 1 the soil bulk density of the experiment field varies from 1 11 g cm 3 to 1 64 g cm 3 in the 0 1 5 m soil profile and the saturated water content of soil is nearly 0 45 before the experiment the 0 1 0 m soil depth were divided into 5 layers and the soil particle size distribution form each layer was analyzed by a laser particle size analyzer the wilting point field water capacity and saturated water content were determined by high speed centrifugation the bulk density of each layer was measured by the ring knife method the initial soil water content was also measured before planting and determined by the soil drying method other model input data were obtained from the china soil database the soil properties including the saturated water content field capacity and wilting point in the experiment field are listed in table 1 zhang et al 2014a yang et al 2016 tan et al 2018 the average depth of groundwater was about 6 m in 2015 and 2016 the experimental cotton cultivar is xinluzhong 55 one of gossypium hirsutum l 2 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted during the 2015 and 2016 cotton growing seasons under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch the cotton adopted the planting mode of one film two pipes and four rows of cotton arrangement fig 2 that is 15 cm 20 cm 40 cm 20 cm 15 cm with the row spacing of 40 cm 20 cm under the plastic film and 30 cm in the bare soil the plant spacing within a row was 10 cm and the actual planting density was 22 plants m 2 by considering an average emergency rate of 0 77 a polyethylene resin embedded thin walled labyrinth drip tape with an inner diameter of 16 mm was used with an emitter spacing of 30 cm and emitter discharge range of 1 8 l h in this pattern each drip pipe was placed in the middle of the two cotton rows beneath the film mulch so each basic planting unit was divided into three parts wide row narrow row and bare soil fig 2 the irrigation water mainly came from the peacock river with the average irrigation salinity of 0 8 g l in order to provide sufficient water and to leach salt from the soil flood irrigation irrigation amount about 300 mm was carried out every spring before seeding early april when the cotton started to emergence drip irrigation was conducted the conventional irrigation amount in this region was about 500 mm based on annual water requirement for cotton as for the 2015 season we took the conventional irrigation as full irrigation treatment t6 and other treatments t1 t5 were set up in proportion relative to t6 as for the 2016 season only two irrigation treatments t7 t8 were set up i e full and deficit irrigation the full irrigation was based on the results calculated by the water balance method in 2015 the details and irrigation schedules are shown in table 2 cotton was sown after plowing on 25 april in 2015 and 21 april in 2016 basal fertilizers 700 kg ha 1 diammonium phosphate with 18 n and 46 p 75 kg ha 1 urea with 46 n 75 kg ha 1 potassium sulfate with 45 k2o and 600 kg ha 1 compound fertilizer with 25 n 25 k and 25 p were directly applied in the field before sowing following the local agronomic practices additional fertilizers 675 kg ha 1 urea and 150 kg ha 1 potassium dihydrogen phosphate were applied through the drip irrigation system during the two cotton growing seasons the cotton plants were manually topped at the end of july during the two seasons 2 3 data collection and analysis 2 3 1 meteorological data solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature and rainfall are the main driving factors for plant growth and development garcia et al 2008 li et al 2015 fan et al 2018 2019b which are the minimum daily meteorological data required by the csm cropgro cotton model these meteorological data were collected from the davis wireless vantage pro2 weather station davis instruments hayward usa installed in the experimental field the daily meteorological data during the two cotton growing seasons are shown in fig 3 2 3 2 measurement of soil water content soil moisture was determined by the pr2 moisture meter which was calibrated by the oven drying method 105 24 h due to the large number of irrigation events over the whole growth period of cotton the soil samples were only collected before sowing before irrigation at the key growth stages three sampling points were set up in each plot to measure the soil water content in the same section at the wide row below the emitter narrow row and the bare soil middle position between the plastic film the description of soil moisture by dssat model is based on the principle of one dimensional water balance so the area weighted average soil moisture over the mulched and bare areas 0 79 under film 0 21 bare soil was calculated and used for model calibration and validation the soil sample layers were 0 10 10 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively 2 3 3 cotton growth measurement 2 3 3 1 emergence rate emergence counts were observed every three days after sowing at the end of seeding stage the survival rate of emergence per unit area was measured and then the whole area was estimated the emergence rate was calculated as follow 1 emergence rate plant count sowing number 100 2 3 3 2 cotton growth index six representative cotton plants three inside line and three outside line with uniform growth were selected for each plot the leaf area index and effective boll number of cotton were measured at each growth stage of cotton and addition tests were conducted at the flowering and boll formation stages the cotton yield was measured after the experiments leaf area index the length and width of each leaf was measured with a tape the leaf area of the whole individual plant was then calculated and leaf area index was finally calculated as follow 2 lai leaf area ground area where lai leaf area index a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies yield and components at harvest three fields with a uniform and robust area of 6 67 m2 were randomly selected from each treatment the number of bolls larger than 2 cm in diameter was recorded a total of 30 bolls 40 bolls and 30 bolls were picked from the upper middle and lower cotton plant layers of each plot respectively to calculate 100 bolls weight 2 4 model calibration and validation the crop management data was used to set up the test document and input field management data including sowing density sowing date irrigation and fertilization date the experiment data module in csm cropgro cotton was used to input test data experimental observation data were divided into two types one was time dependent observation data such as soil moisture plant height leaf area index and biomass etc and these observations were t files in the model input the other was final observation data such as phenology yield harvest etc and these observations were a files in the model input in the csm cropgro cotton model 18 cotton genetic coefficients debugged are shown in table 3 the method of photoperiod calculation for cotton growth period was used to calibrate the variety parameters phenology soil moisture cotton yield leaf area index and dry matter quality were selected as target variables a necessary prerequisite for model application is to calibrate and validate the model to ensure the accuracy and reliability of simulation because different model parameters will obtain various model output tremblay and wallach 2004 among many model calibration methods we can manually adjust several specific parameters by the trial and error method then compare the simulated values with the measured values to evaluate the accuracy of the model but the result is very subjective the most reliable method is to divide the field measured data into two parts one part is used to calibrate and the other is used to validate thorp et al 2007 in general it is necessary to use the data without water and nitrogen stress to calibrate the parameters of the model according to the previous study of ji et al 2014 the ceres and cropgro series model can accurately simulate the growth and yield of crops under the condition of sufficient water and nitrogen supply while the simulation accuracy is not high under the condition of water and nitrogen deficit according to the data of full irrigation and deficit irrigation experiments in this study the model was calibrated with full irrigation treatment in 2016 and validated with the other treatments this study did not adopt the glue generalized likelihood uncertainly estimation parameter adjustment method provided by csm cropgro cotton but adopted meteorological soil experimental observation data literature review and other methods combined with the photoperiod calculation method to select a set of reasonable parameterization formula the genetic coefficients used in this study are shown in table 4 the purpose of this study was to understand the process of crop growth rather than to derive the best parameterization scheme the selected parameters must ensure that the simulated phenological period is close to the observations because the high accuracy of phenological simulation is the key and foundation for crop models to simulate crop growth and subsequently soil water content leaf area index lai and yield this study is based on the supercomputing platform of northwest a f university microsoft visual studio 2015 professional and parallel studio 2016 for code compilation and computation origin 9 0 was used to create figures in this study the model was validated using the data from the 2016 season the calibration and validation of model parameters were evaluated by absolute relative error are eq 3 and root mean square error rmse eq 4 because they can reflect the relative difference between the simulated and the measured values moriasi et al 2007 fan et al 2019a at the same time are belongs to dimensionless statistics which can be used to compare different variables the smaller the value of the two the higher the accuracy of the simulation as they approach 0 it presents a good match between the simulations and observations the coefficient of determination r2 eq 5 represents the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model the index of agreement d eq 6 is a measure of the degree to which the observed data are approached by the simulated data and overcomes when r2 is close to 1 or d 0 65 it indicates that the performance of simulation is good while the results from simulation are considered acceptable if r2 0 5 van liew et al 2003 wu

al 2019 soil warming is mainly achieved by inhibiting soil evaporation reducing heat loss and blocking heat exchange in the surface layer and increasing net radiation jiye et al 2008 due to the change of soil temperature and water condition the simulation of the phenology soil moisture leaf area and yield have large deviation from fig 4 we can see that the model underestimated the growth process of cotton leaf area index which is due to that the film mulch greatly increased the soil temperature and soil water storage at the seeding stage however this was not considered in the model leading to inaccurate calculation of photoperiod and potential evapotranspiration while grown as an annual cotton is a perennial crop and cotton planted in xinjiang requires manual topping in many places pruning is needed and vegetative branches are removed topping is the traditional management practice for cotton in xinjiang which can stop the growth of the top promote the extension of fruit branches and improve the dry matter distribution most cotton models do not consider the topping phenomenon so they are capped cutout only when the nutrient supply is insufficient therefore when the nutrient supply is sufficient and the environmental conditions permit the plant height the number of main stem nodes and the number of fruit branches are likely to increase this is different from the development of cotton in xinjiang therefore when using the csm cropgro cotton model to simulate the dynamic process of cotton plant height there will have continuous growth condition as shown in fig 4 plastic film mulch can increase the soil surface temperature significantly reduce soil evaporation promote crop transpiration and significantly increase cotton yield and water use efficiency relative to cotton grown without a film mulch in this region the cropgro cotton model only has air temperature parameters and no soil temperature module so the model can not simulate the impact of increased soil temperature on growth processes under plastic film mulch at the same time the calculation of accumulated temperature is based on air temperature rather than soil temperature which determines the calculation of cotton phenology by the model the growth period of cotton under plastic film mulch is earlier than without mulch the main reason is that the accumulated temperature of cotton covered with plastic film compensates the deficiency of effective air accumulated temperature of cotton at the same time the model underestimates soil moisture because the model does not consider the fact that the plastic film mulch reduces soil evaporation and changes soil water storage the lower leaf area index simulated by the original model is mainly due to the turgor factor affecting the leaf development and the stress factors affecting other physiological processes when the seeding stage is subjected to water stress the leaf area growth is slower and the photosynthetic products are due to the influence of turgor factor in this way the growth of photosynthetic products and leaf area is very small after water stress and makes it impossible to restore leaf growth at later growth stages in addition to water nitrogen and phosphorus are also important components of leaves the single factor of water stress is considered in the model and the effect of nutrient content on plant transpiration is not considered therefore the simulation process can not completely reflect the actual growth of cotton leaves in addition the actual photosynthesis process is not considered in the model and the mechanism of physiological and ecological process is lacking water stress is a major factor threatening agricultural production across a wide range of irrigated croplands in china the first water stress factor mainly affects the extensional growth of crops such as elongation of internodes and extension of leaves the growth process of crops is more sensitive to water stress than other physiological processes the second water stress factor may decrease the development rate plastic film mulch can reduce soil water loss by inhibiting evaporation but it can also reduce soil water income the precipitation in this area during cotton growth period can be neglected or plant biomass is relatively large which can also enhance transpiration and soil water content may be reduced generally speaking the water content of cotton field covered with plastic film mulch before bud stage is higher than that after bud stage 2 5 2 improvement of potential evapotranspiration under plastic mulch in the csm cropgro cotton model the crop evapotranspiration etc is calculated by means of potential evapotranspiration pet and simulated crop coefficient kc the calculation of potential evapotranspiration includes the priestley taylor and fao56 penman monteith models the default calculation method of potential evapotranspiration in the csm cropgro cotton model is the priestley taylor model however the fao56 penman monteith method was used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration in this paper the windy and sandy climate in bayingol of xinjiang will have a great impact on the cotton growth process in view of the fao56 penman monteith method the wind speed and relative humidity the input dew point temperature in csm model were considered in the calculation process the fao56 penman monteith method calculated the potential evapotranspiration based on solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature wind speed relative humidity allen and pereiral 1998 fan et al 2016 7 e t 0

potential evapotranspiration at the same time during the simulating process of crop growth and development the first factor to consider was the accuracy of phenological simulation and the crop phenology was largely affected by crop potential evapotranspiration therefore the effect of film mulch on evapotranspiration needs to be considered first in this paper we used the stics model to describe the evapotranspiration under plastic mulch condition to improve the evapotranspiration estimation mary et al 2009 8 r n e t 1 a l b e d o l a i t r g r g l o where rnet net radiation mj m 2

and long wave radiation received by the earth surface will increase the land surface temperature emitting some long wave radiation while reflecting part of the solar radiation and the rest is the net radiation bonan 2015 net radiation is dissipated by potential evapotranspiration convection and conduction the potential evapotranspiration is allocated to soil evaporation and plant transpiration at a certain proportion sau et al 2004 found that among several methods for calculating potential evapotranspiration in the csm cropgro cotton model the priestley taylor model overestimated potential evapotranspiration to a certain extent especially at the early stage of crop growth and the simulation of fao24 penman monteith was the worst it was concluded that the default extinction coefficient in the dssat model was 0 85 while the accuracy of all the methods calculated for the potential evapotranspiration were increased when the extinction coefficient changed to 0 5 therefore the extinction coefficients used in this paper are as follows ktrans 0 85 ksevap 0 5 where ktrans light extinction coefficient used for computation of plant transpiration ksevap light extinction coefficient used for computation of soil evaporation crop models have been used to provide decision making for yield increase under water stress jones et al 2017 however this requires that the model has a precise water balance the csm cropgro cotton model defines whether crops are subjected to water stress by comparing the relationship between potential transpiration or plant water demand and potential root uptake or plant absorbable soil water saseendran et al 2008 therefore accurate allocation of crop potential evapotranspiration is also an important prerequisite for determining soil water status 2 5 4 improvement of soil evaporation under plastic mulch condition in the csm cropgro cotton model soil moisture is simulated by dividing the soil into different layers at first according to the water balance method ritchie 1998 and then using ritchie one dimensional tipping bucket water balance method jones et al 2003 to simulate soil water movement and root water uptake while soil evaporation is carried out by the two stage evaporation model ritchie 1972 which divides evaporation into two stages zheng et al 2016 the evaporation process of the first stage is described by the potential evaporation rate of the soil which is determined by the evaporation capacity of the atmosphere when evaporation reaches the evaporation limit value u at the first stage evaporation enters the second stage from the first stage this process is not affected by rainfall after entering the second stage the evaporation rate is lower than the potential evaporation rate of the soil and the cumulative evaporation in the second stage is a function of the square root of the time the two stages of evaporation are calculated as follows the first stage 11 e s 1 t 1 1 t 1 e s 0 u w h e n t t 1 the second stage 12 e s 2 α t t 1 w h e n t t 1 where es1 cumulative evaporation in the first stage mm d es0 evaporation on that day α soil hydraulic characteristic coefficient empirical parameters depending on different soil conditions mm d0 5 t1 the time of cumulative evaporation in the first stage d es2 cumulative evaporation in the second stage mm d t the total time of evaporation d because plastic film mulch can reduce soil moisture loss by inhibiting evaporation the influence of regional precipitation on soil moisture can be neglected that is the influence of soil infiltration can be neglected at the same time the calculation process of soil evaporation is also improved based on the introduction of the plastic film ratio as follows 13 e p e p 1 c o u v e r m u l c h 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration plastic film mulch can increase surface soil temperature conserve soil moisture and improve radiation status especially it has greater impact for cotton growth at the early stage but less impact after the cotton canopy closure the soil temperature at 5 cm depth covered with plastic film can be increased by 2 5 from mid april to late may 1 3 in early june and not in july the soil temperature at 10 cm depth was increased by 2 6 2 7 in april 2 4 3 7 in may and 2 0 2 9 in june but not after in july with the growth of cotton the shading area of branches and leaves increased and the warming effect decreased after soil warming the increase of accumulated soil temperature can compensate for the deficiency of accumulated air temperature accelerate the growth and development of aboveground parts by promoting root growth and activity every increase of soil temperature at 1 in bud stage can be equivalent to 0 5 in air temperature and 0 2 at the flowering stage china society of plastic film mulching cultivation 1988 pan 2003 the modified model can greatly improve the simulation results of leaf area index and soil water content fig 5 although the modified model has greatly improved the simulation performance of cotton under plastic mulch drip irrigation than the original model its mechanism still needs to be discussed it is also necessary to carry out multi sites and multi sample experiment data to further validate its universality and applicability it can be seen that the cropgro cotton could not accurately describe the phenological phase table 5 yield table 5 leaf area index fig 6 and soil moisture fig 7 of cotton under plastic film mulch first of all it is necessary to simulate the phenological phase precisely because the distribution and accumulation of photosynthates are completely different at various growth stages some field experiments have confirmed that plastic film mulch can advance emergence huang et al 2008 li et al 2010 and li et al 2004 observed that emergence was 8 d earlier for spring wheat under plastic film mulch these previous field studies well matched the simulated results of the present study table 5 soil water is an important factor affecting the phenology of cotton during the vegetative growth stage especially at the seeding stage water stress will postpone the flowering and emergency of cotton at the same time temperature is also an important factor during the reproductive stage especially during the boll opening stage and insufficient accumulated temperature will advance maturity of cotton that s why the simulated growth period is shorter than the actual one 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 leaf area index lai the model was further validated by the field experimental data obtained in 2015 the distribution of leaf area index fig 8 and soil volumetric water content figs 9 14 under the condition of plastic film mulch were simulated and the time interval output data with measured data can be selected it can be seen that the simulated value of lai is in good agreement with the measured value of the observed during the growth period lai showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing over time with the maximum reaching 200 220 days of year this period was in a relatively vigorous period of cotton vegetative growth and photosynthesis was relatively sufficient over time cotton growth gradually changed from vegetative growth to reproductive growth at this stage water and nutrition needed for cotton growth decreased and were gradually transferred from the leaves to the reproductive organs lai growth rate decreased and began to decline the simulated leaf area index fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r2 0 739 the index of agreement d 0 910 and root mean square error rmse 0 965 table 9 the model somewhat overestimated lai in t1 t4 at 200 220 doy it perhaps due to that the plant transpiration in the model was higher than the actual situation and the extent of the positive effect of plastic film mulching should be quantitative analysis we may be able to understand the soil water and heat transfer under mulch conditions through the relationship between plastic film mulch and bare soil temperature in future studies 3 2 2 soil water content the modified model predicted soil water content in the 0 40 cm soil layer during the two growing seasons for data of t1 t8 with r2 of 0 653 d of 0 5370 and rmse of 0 098 cm3 cm3 respectively tables 7 and 8 the model also slightly underestimated soil water content in the deep soil profile below 40 cm especially in the deficit irrigation treatments of t1 t2 and t3 figs 9 11 the simulated soil water content for the five treatments t1 t5 were close to the measured values in the 0 40 cm soil layer during the growing season except for that at late stage 250 300 doy while the model overestimated soil water content in the five treatments for the 0 20 cm layer these overestimations may be due to that the coefficient for plant transpiration was not adjusted in the model similar differences have been found in the studies on the application of other models for cotton hussein et al 2011 meanwhile the csm cropgro cotton model described the root development as an empirical formula related to maximum effective root length and time water stress was determined by potential root uptake and it was difficult to explain the complex situation under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch and changeable cotton root density it suggested that the partitioning of evapotranspiration needed further improvement and the calculation of root density needed new understanding and approaches from figs 9 14 it can be seen that the modified model can describe the surface soil moisture to a certain extent while the simulation values of deep soil below 40 cm is quite different from the measured values the main roots of cotton are distributed in the 0 40 cm layer which is the main layer for roots to absorb water the root system gradually decreases with the increase in soil depth and the water absorption thus decreases from top to bottom that s why the soil water content in the 0 40 cm layer shows a gradual increasing trend but the change range is not obvious around 40 cm when the soil depth is 40 80 cm the observed soil water content is almost constant meanwhile the average depth of groundwater is shallow so that groundwater recharges the upper soil soil water content in other ranges is higher than that below 80 cm which indicates that seepage will occur at 80 cm root seepage should be estimated when calculating water consumption of cotton therefore in the simulation of 80 cm soil moisture there is an overestimation phenomenon which is not considered in the improved model the genetic coefficients of cotton cultivars were corrected with the data of full irrigation and water stress in 2016 as shown in table 4 at the same time the full irrigation field data in 2015 were used to verify the genetic coefficients it can be seen that are between the measured value and the simulated value of the modified model results for phenological period and yield are both less than 2 tables 5 and 6 the model can describe cotton leaf area index and surface soil water content better indicating that the calibration and validation results of cotton genetic coefficients are preferably this indicates that the genetic coefficients of cotton can be used as the coefficients of xinluzhong 55 so as to carry out more simulation calculations the improved csm cropgro cotton model in this paper can adequately reflect the growth and development of cotton under drip irrigation with plastic film mulch which provides a reliable analysis tool for the study of crop water consumption under plastic film mulch and water management of plastic film mulched farmland it should be pointed out that the transport of water and heat of crops and soils under plastic film mulch are very complex processes the model established in this paper has made many necessary simplifications so some parameters themselves need further study and improvement in the future 4 conclusions since the emergence of plastic film mulch technology many countries around the world have carried out extensive research regarding its effect on increasing temperature and preserving moisture as well as its underlying mechanism based on the redistribution of evapotranspiration in cotton fields covered with plastic film mulch the csm cropgro cotton has been improved in accordance with the principle of a one dimensional water balance the potential evapotranspiration was first modified by adding the stics model algorithms for describing the evapotranspiration under plastic mulch condition the extinction coefficients were further changed based on recommended values and the calculation of soil evaporation was improved by the introduction of the plastic film ratio the simulation results of soil water content leaf area index phenological period and cotton yield indicated that the modified csm cropgro cotton model was more accurate than the original model for simulating cotton growth under plastic film mulch in southern xinjiang china although the modified model has greatly improved the simulation of cotton under plastic film mulch compared with the original model the universality and applicability of this model need more data from various years and multi sites and samples for further verification meanwhile the modification of film mulch focused on potential evapotranspiration and soil evaporation but the compensation effect of soil temperature should also be considered in future studies acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the national key research and
