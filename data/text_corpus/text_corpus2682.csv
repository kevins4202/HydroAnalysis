eighteen inches in length were cut near the roots using a sharp blade samples were refrigerated at 2 c while awaiting drying cornstalks were dried in an oven at 105 c for at least 48 h stalk samples for batch tests were prepared by removing the woody outer layer and cutting the spongy stalk interior into 0 5 1 cm length pieces fig 2 below shows the corn field during sampling the whole cross sectional profile of cornstalk and separated interior cornstalk material for column tests whole dried cornstalks trimmed to the column length and an approximate mass of 12 g were inserted into the glass column casings batch biological denitrification tests were performed in sealed 250 ml glass flasks flasks were stoppered and sealed with parafilm to prevent gas exchange and allow anoxic conditions to develop during tests test flasks were covered with opaque tape and capped with aluminum foil to maintain dark conditions within the flasks and prevent the growth of photosynthetic algae batch tests were performed on synthetic groundwater consisting of distilled water buffered with 45 mg l nahpo4 45 g l kh2po4 120 mg l nacl and spiked with 0 1445 g l kno3 to provide no3 n levels of 20 mg l carbon sources were provided by adding appropriate volumes of a 11 7 g l sodium acetate solution or 12 3 g l cellulose suspension or by directly adding weighed masses of dried cornstalk interior each test flask was dosed with 5 mg l of bacterial culture added from stock bacterial solutions acclimated to either acetate or cellulose feedstock for at least three months initial culture samples were acquired from activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and were mixed on a shaker table at 100 rpm with synthetic groundwater containing 20 mg l of no3 n and 290 mg l of sodium acetate or 310 mg l of cellulose to maintain c n ratios of 3 and 10 respectively culture media was replenished every 2 weeks to maintain a viable bacterial population by 1 turning off shaker table to allow bacterial flocs to settle to the bottom of the flasks 2 gently decanting 200 ml of spent culture media 3 re filling the flasks with fresh culture media containing carbon source and nitrate and 4 re capping the stock flasks and returning them to the shaker table test flasks were set on a shaker table shown in fig 2 and mixed at 100 rpm for one week prior to sampling and analysis samples were analyzed for anions cl no2 no3 so4 2 po4 3 do orp and ph column tests were performed in glass filtration columns test water was pumped at a rate of 0 3 to 0 6 ml min by a masterflex peristaltic pump from a glass reservoir replenished every 2 3 days influent test water was introduced to the bottom of the columns and was filtered to waste or collected for sampling from tubing at the top of the columns test water was groundwater from well 6 spiked with kno3 to an approximate no3 n concentration of 20 mg l for acetate tests test water was spiked with 290 mg l of sodium acetate for a c n ratio of approximately 3 and columns were packed with filter media of sand anthracite or recycled crushed glass for 3 days prior to commencing the test synthetic groundwater spiked with acetate conditioned bacteria solution was recirculated through the columns to seed the columns with bacteria for cornstalk tests cornstalk lengths weighing approximately 12 g were inserted in the column filter tubes and used as both support media and carbon source for 3 days prior to cornstalk column tests nitrate spiked groundwater was recirculated through the cornstalk columns to allow endogenous bacteria to begin growing prior to treatment no bacterial solution was added to cornstalk column tests cornstalk used in column test and column test apparatus are shown in fig 3 samples were analyzed at least two times weekly for anions cl no2 no3 so4 2 po4 3 do orp and ph 2 3 2 ion exchange ion exchange tests were performed using purolite 521e nitrate selective anion exchange resin beads at doses of 1 5 3 and 4 5 g l in a 1 l ece engineering jar tester preliminary testing determined that ion exchange beads reached equilibrium with test water within 90 min of testing test water was mixed with resin at 300 rpm for 2 h after which the mixers were turned off and the resin was allowed to settle treated water was decanted for anion analysis resin was left in the jars for subsequent testing in which an additional litre of water was added to the jar for mixing this process was repeated until a sufficient total volume of water had contacted the resin to completely saturate it with nitrate and no further nitrate removal from test water was observed 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling program 3 1 1 physical parameters ph remained relatively constant with an average value of 7 11 0 53 the minimum ph value was 5 53 observed in well 2 during december and the maximum ph value was 8 25 observed in well 4 during august the average temperature in groundwater wells and treatment plant was 11 9 2 3 c and varied considerably during the year with the lowest temperatures observed between december and march and the highest temperatures observed in august fig 3 3 1 2 nitrate fig 4 displays nitrate nitrogen no3 n values for the five groundwater wells water treatment plant inlet and outlet distribution system point and private well and includes the 10 mg l mac value for comparison nitrate levels in well 2 were consistently near or above the mac throughout the study period with an average nitrate concentration of 8 357 4 264 mg l no3 n and 61 of observed no3 n values greater than 9 9 mg l however the other four groundwater wells remained consistently below the 10 mg l mac with average no3 n values in well 1 of 6 716 2 303 mg l in well 4 of 5 250 3 286 mg l in well 5a of 4 524 2 855 mg l and in well 6 of 2 897 1 327 mg l nitrate levels in the treatment plant inlet outlet and distribution system point remained consistently below the mac average outlet values were 4 567 2 482 mg l the current management strategy of blending high nitrate groundwater from well 2 with low nitrate groundwater from well 6 appears to be highly effective in maintaining nitrate levels in distributed water below the mac in contrast groundwater samples from the private well were regularly observed to have nitrate levels above the mac with multiple readings over 20 mg l and average nitrate concentrations of 13 937 9 713 mg l the specific cause for the elevated nitrate levels is unknown however it could be due to the well being located on a farm with excess runoff from manure or fertilizer with a well that may have been shallow or have insufficient casing 19 3 1 3 chloride sulfate and csmr average chloride sulfate and chloride to sulfate mass ratios csmr for each sampling site are displayed in fig 5 these parameters were measured in anticipation of the potential effects on csmr due to nitrate treatment average groundwater chloride concentrations ranged from 16 149 8 198 mg l in well 4 to 100 951 45 594 mg l in well 1 the average csmr from the treatment plant outlet was 3 134 0 351 mg l and at the distribution system sampling point was 3 591 1 414 mg l csmr levels greater than a threshold value of 0 5 0 77 may indicate potential for galvanic corrosion of lead where lead is connected to copper for example lead solder on copper piping in the distribution system or premise plumbing 21 22 the csmr levels observed at all sampling points in this study were well above this threshold however actual lead corrosion depends the type and condition of pipe material and may depend on other water quality factors such as ph and alkalinity 22 3 2 biological denitrification 3 2 1 batch tests fig 6 displays the percent removal of nitrate from batch tests with 20 mg l initial nitrate over a 1 week denitrification period at room temperature acetate cornstalk and pure powdered cellulose were tested as carbon sources at various carbon to nitrogen c n ratios ranging from 3 to 89 depending on carbon source tests using acetate as the carbon source were able to achieve substantial denitrification at much lower carbon source doses than cornstalk tests while cornstalk tests achieved denitrification with lower carbon source doses than powdered cellulose tests denitrification tests with acetate as the carbon source were able to remove 87 of nitrate from test flasks with a c n ratio as low as 3 at a c n ratio of 44 cornstalk test flasks achieved nearly complete removal of nitrate however flasks with powdered cellulose as the carbon source were only able to achieve 80 removal of nitrate with a c n ratio of 89 in general simpler organic molecules such as acetate and methanol tend to be more easily digested by bacteria than more complex molecules such as sucrose and cellulose based materials higher denitrification rates have been observed using acetate and methanol as a substrate as compared to sucrose 10 furthermore certain cellulosic waste products may contain some simple easily digestible organic which wash out near the beginning of testing allowing for more rapid bacterial uptake and denitrification than on a more uniformly complex carbohydrate material 15 this may explain why high removals of nitrate in this study were observed with lower doses of acetate than cornstalk and with lower doses of cornstalk than pure cellulose 3 2 2 column tests fig 7 displays nitrate concentrations in raw water and water treated by acetate denitrification columns at room temperature as an average of the three columns throughout the test period results are from two 3 day column test runs acetate columns removed 95 of nitrate on average treating raw water with an average value of 16 85 1 07 mg l nitrate to 0 13 0 06 mg l in column 1 2 08 3 72 mg l in column 2 and 0 35 0 61 mg l in column 3 fig 8 displays nitrate concentrations in raw water and water treated by cornstalk denitrification columns over 5 weeks at room temperature the first half of the test period consisted of one blank column no cornstalk and three cornstalk columns run separately and displayed as an average value on the graph the second half of the test period consisted of two single columns displayed as an average value and one set of two cornstalk columns in series the average nitrate concentrations in raw water and the blank column were 27 39 6 57 mg l and 29 02 6 97 mg l respectively the average nitrate concentration in water treated by single cornstalk columns was 17 90 4 93 mg l and by two columns in series was 12 13 2 92 mg l representing an average removal rate of 35 and 49 by single columns and two columns in series respectively it is anticipated based on previous studies 30 that these removal rates would decrease by up to 51 due to lower temperatures of the studied groundwater supply in winter months but in warmer climates this method could be effective year round previous research has determined that after pre treatment to introduce specific functional groups cornstalk material may be used for adsorption of metals in water 23 25 wang et al 26 studied adsorption capacity of raw cornstalk and modified cornstalk for nitrate and phosphate the unmodified cornstalk had poor removal rates in initial experiments and the study ceased observation of raw cornstalk for the remainder of the study given these results nitrate removal rates achieved in this study are assumed to be the result of biological denitrification rather than adsorption cornstalk was dried and weighed both before and after use in the columns to determine the change in mass of the cornstalk throughout column operation fig 9 displays the average initial and final masses and loss of mass of cornstalk used in column tests for 3 weeks n 5 or 9 weeks n 2 average mass loss over 3 weeks of operation was 2 0 0 1 g while average mass loss over 9 weeks of operation was 1 8 1 0 g as there were no significant differences in mass loss between 3 and 9 weeks of operation these results may suggest that there was an initial rapid release of organic matter from the columns in the first few weeks of operation followed by slower release in subsequent weeks several researchers working with waste products as carbon sources such as rice stalk and corncobs observed an initial spike in dissolved organics concentrations in the treated water at the beginning of the testing period due to washing out of the water soluble organics from the carbon source 16 17 27 28 however there was a large variation between the two 9 week cornstalk samples so further work was required to support this finding 3 2 3 organic carbon although health canada does not regulate toc guidelines are in place for the maximum acceptable concentrations of disinfectant by products such as trihalomethanes which are formed through the reaction of organic matter with chlorine during drinking water disinfection 29 the cornstalk denitrification column tests were duplicated to obtain toc and doc data due to the possibility of increased carbon availability for by product formation during chlorination cornstalk lengths weighing approximately 9 g were used and all columns tested were single columns the nitrate was measured using the hach dr3900 program 355 n to confirm nitrate removal as the ic was out of commission the average nitrate concentration in the raw water and the blank column were 19 20 2 07 mg l and 17 39 2 29 mg l respectively the average nitrate concentration in water treated by column 1 was 14 31 2 47 mg l by column 2 was 15 03 2 45 mg l and by column 3 was 13 81 1 95 mg l representing an average removal rate of 25 21 and 27 respectively these removal rates were lower than the 35 average removal rate by single columns found in the previous cornstalk column test likely due to the mass reduction of cornstalk in the columns from 12 to 9 g which would result in a loss in surface area and carbon source fig 10 shows doc concentrations in raw water and water treated with cornstalk denitrification columns over the 11 week test period the average doc concentration in the raw water was 3 42 2 55 mg l and the blank column was 1 43 0 97 mg l the doc levels were 3 75 3 20 in column 1 2 85 2 33 mg l in column 2 2 69 1 89 mg l in column 3 the average doc concentration for the 11 week sampling period was below the us epa national primary drinking water regulations stage 2 d dbp rule value of 4 mg l allowing for reduced monitoring for disinfection by products 18 the control column showed significant reduction in doc t 11 2 22 p 0 048 in all but one of the cornstalk columns doc concentrations were lower than that of the raw water the exception being the doc levels in column 1 data indicates that on average 2 09 1 74 mg l 1 76 1 35 mg l and 2 48 1 58 mg l nitrate was converted to nitrogen gas by 1 mg l of doc in column 1 column 2 and column 3 respectively this is much higher than 0 93 mg l nitrate converted by 1 mg l of doc 8 3 3 ion exchange well water was spiked to a no3 n concentration of 20 mg l and treated with a commercial nitrate selective anion exchange resin in a 1 l jar tester fig 11 displays nitrate removal from contaminated groundwater as a function of volume of groundwater treated by the resin removal of nitrate decreased in a fairly linear manner up to 600 bed volumes at which point the resin removed approximately 5 mg l of nitrate n removals of approximately 10 mg l of nitrate from an initial concentration of 20 mg l were achieved near 300 400 bed volumes of groundwater treated chloride addition and nitrate removal were linearly related with approximately 2 876 mg of chloride added for every mg of nitrate n removed this value is close to the ratio of the mass of chloride cl to the mass of nitrogen n i e 2 53 which indicates that the resin was highly selective for nitrate resulting in a nearly one to one ratio of nitrate adsorption and chloride release sulfate concentrations did not change from raw to treated water with initial sulfate concentrations of 14 734 1 757 mg l and final sulfate concentrations of 14 448 2 619 mg l thus the ion exchange resin used in this study increased the csmr of the groundwater through chloride addition in a predictable fashion dependent on nitrate removal but did not cause an additional increase in csmr through removal of sulfate fig 12 displays the increase in csmr of groundwater after ion exchange treatment as a function of nitrate n removed based on these results csmr would be expected to increase by 0 34 for every mg l of no3 n removed by the anion exchange resin used in this study nguyen et al 22 observed increased lead leaching from lead solder copper coupons in controlled bench scale tests due to a change in csmr resulting from a range of process changes including implementation of anion exchange treatment as a result these researchers recommend that utilities conduct corrosion tests if they are considering treatment changes that will increase the csmr if 1 lead copper connections are present in the distribution system or premise plumbing 2 the water has alkalinity 50 mg l as caco3 and 3 the csmr after treatment will be greater than 0 2 as an alternative anion exchange resins with carbonate rather than chloride as the counter ion could also be investigated for nitrate removal 4 conclusions elevated nitrate levels in a rural municipal groundwater source have led to management strategies to reduce concentrations in water supply below the mac this study conducted wide spread monitoring of water quality characteristics to evaluate these strategies and determine potential issues if treatment was required biological nitrate removal was assessed using traditional materials and localized agricultural waste for a carbon source and compared to traditional ion exchange elevated nitrate levels were observed in some sample locations but the management strategy of blending source well water was effective over the course of this study it was found that cornstalk was effective as a carbon feedstock for biological denitrification batch tests although it required substantially higher carbon doses than a traditional soluble feedstock acetate it also performed well in column tests achieving nitrate removals of 35 in single column tests and 49 removal with two cornstalk columns in series in one set of experiments and removals of 25 21 and 27 in single column test in a second set carbon analysis of raw water and the effluent from single columns showed no significant difference in concentration doc concentrations in the raw water and the column effluent were consistently below 4 mg l ion exchange tests with a commercial anion exchange resin were effective in removing nitrate from the groundwater but could be expected to increase csmr by 0 34 per mg l of nitrate n removed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

were acquired from activated sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and were mixed on a shaker table at 100 rpm with synthetic groundwater containing 20 mg l of no3 n and 290 mg l of sodium acetate or 310 mg l of cellulose to maintain c n ratios of 3 and 10 respectively culture media was replenished every 2 weeks to maintain a viable bacterial population by 1 turning off shaker table to allow bacterial flocs to settle to the bottom of the flasks 2 gently decanting 200 ml of spent culture media 3 re filling the flasks with fresh culture media containing carbon source and nitrate and 4 re capping the stock flasks and returning them to the shaker table test flasks were set on a shaker table shown in fig 2 and mixed at 100 rpm for one week prior to sampling and analysis samples were analyzed for anions cl no2 no3 so4 2 po4 3 do orp and ph column tests were performed in glass filtration columns test water was pumped at a rate of 0 3 to 0 6 ml min by a masterflex peristaltic pump from a glass reservoir replenished every 2 3 days influent test water was introduced to the bottom of the columns and was filtered to waste or collected for sampling from tubing at the top of the columns test water was groundwater from well 6 spiked with kno3 to an approximate no3 n concentration of 20 mg l for acetate tests test water was spiked with 290 mg l of sodium acetate for a c n ratio of approximately 3 and columns were packed with filter media of sand anthracite or recycled crushed glass for 3 days prior to commencing the test synthetic groundwater spiked with acetate conditioned bacteria solution was recirculated through the columns to seed the columns with bacteria for cornstalk tests cornstalk lengths weighing approximately 12 g were inserted in the column filter tubes and used as both support media and carbon source for 3 days prior to cornstalk column tests nitrate spiked groundwater was recirculated through the cornstalk columns to allow endogenous bacteria to begin growing prior to treatment no bacterial solution was added to cornstalk column tests cornstalk used in column test and column test apparatus are shown in fig 3 samples were analyzed at least two times weekly for anions cl no2 no3 so4 2 po4 3 do orp and ph 2 3 2 ion exchange ion exchange tests were performed using purolite 521e nitrate selective anion exchange resin beads at doses of 1 5 3 and 4 5 g l in a 1 l ece engineering jar tester preliminary testing determined that ion exchange beads reached equilibrium with test water within 90 min of testing test water was mixed with resin at 300 rpm for 2 h after which the mixers were turned off and the resin was allowed to settle treated water was decanted for anion analysis resin was left in the jars for subsequent testing in which an additional litre of water was added to the jar for mixing this process was repeated until a sufficient total volume of water had contacted the resin to completely saturate it with nitrate and no further nitrate removal from test water was observed 3 results and discussion 3 1 sampling program 3 1 1 physical parameters ph remained relatively constant with an average value of 7 11 0 53 the minimum ph value was 5 53 observed in well 2 during december and the maximum ph value was 8 25 observed in well 4 during august the average temperature in groundwater wells and treatment plant was 11 9 2 3 c and varied considerably during the year with the lowest temperatures observed between december and march and the highest temperatures observed in august fig 3 3 1 2 nitrate fig 4 displays nitrate nitrogen no3 n values for the five groundwater wells water treatment plant inlet and outlet distribution system point and private well and includes the 10 mg l mac value for comparison nitrate levels in well 2 were consistently near or above the mac throughout the study period with an average nitrate concentration of 8 357 4 264 mg l no3 n and 61 of observed no3 n values greater than 9 9 mg l however the other four groundwater wells remained consistently below the 10 mg l mac with average no3 n values in well 1 of 6 716 2 303 mg l in well 4 of 5 250 3 286 mg l in well 5a of 4 524 2 855 mg l and in well 6 of 2 897 1 327 mg l nitrate levels in the treatment plant inlet outlet and distribution system point remained consistently below the mac average outlet values were 4 567 2 482 mg l the current management strategy of blending high nitrate groundwater from well 2 with low nitrate groundwater from well 6 appears to be highly effective in maintaining nitrate levels in distributed water below the mac in contrast groundwater samples from the private well were regularly observed to have nitrate levels above the mac with multiple readings over 20 mg l and average nitrate concentrations of 13 937 9 713 mg l the specific cause for the elevated nitrate levels is unknown however it could be due to the well being located on a farm with excess runoff from manure or fertilizer with a well that may have been shallow or have insufficient casing 19 3 1 3 chloride sulfate and csmr average chloride sulfate and chloride to sulfate mass ratios csmr for each sampling site are displayed in fig 5 these parameters were measured in anticipation of the potential effects on csmr due to nitrate treatment average groundwater chloride concentrations ranged from 16 149 8 198 mg l in well 4 to 100 951 45 594 mg l in well 1 the average csmr from the treatment plant outlet was 3 134 0 351 mg l and at the distribution system sampling point was 3 591 1 414 mg l csmr levels greater than a threshold value of 0 5 0 77 may indicate potential for galvanic corrosion of lead where lead is connected to copper for example lead solder on copper piping in the distribution system or premise plumbing 21 22 the csmr levels observed at all sampling points in this study were well above this threshold however actual lead corrosion depends the type and condition of pipe material and may depend on other water quality factors such as ph and alkalinity 22 3 2 biological denitrification 3 2 1 batch tests fig 6 displays the percent removal of nitrate from batch tests with 20 mg l initial nitrate over a 1 week denitrification period at room temperature acetate cornstalk and pure powdered cellulose were tested as carbon sources at various carbon to nitrogen c n ratios ranging from 3 to 89 depending on carbon source tests using acetate as the carbon source were able to achieve substantial denitrification at much lower carbon source doses than cornstalk tests while cornstalk tests achieved denitrification with lower carbon source doses than powdered cellulose tests denitrification tests with acetate as the carbon source were able to remove 87 of nitrate from test flasks with a c n ratio as low as 3 at a c n ratio of 44 cornstalk test flasks achieved nearly complete removal of nitrate however flasks with powdered cellulose as the carbon source were only able to achieve 80 removal of nitrate with a c n ratio of 89 in general simpler organic molecules such as acetate and methanol tend to be more easily digested by bacteria than more complex molecules such as sucrose and cellulose based materials higher denitrification rates have been observed using acetate and methanol as a substrate as compared to sucrose 10 furthermore certain cellulosic waste products may contain some simple easily digestible organic which wash out near the beginning of testing allowing for more rapid bacterial uptake and denitrification than on a more uniformly complex carbohydrate material 15 this may explain why high removals of nitrate in this study were observed with lower doses of acetate than cornstalk and with lower doses of cornstalk than pure cellulose 3 2 2 column tests fig 7 displays nitrate concentrations in raw water and water treated by acetate denitrification columns at room temperature as an average of the three columns throughout the test period results are from two 3 day column test runs acetate columns removed 95 of nitrate on average treating raw water with an average value of 16 85 1 07 mg l nitrate to 0 13 0 06 mg l in column 1 2 08 3 72 mg l in column 2 and 0 35 0 61 mg l in column 3 fig 8 displays nitrate concentrations in raw water and water treated by cornstalk denitrification columns over 5 weeks at room temperature the first half of the test period consisted of one blank column no cornstalk and three cornstalk columns run separately and displayed as an average value on the graph the second half of the test period consisted of two single columns displayed as an average value and one set of two cornstalk columns in series the average nitrate concentrations in raw water and the blank column were 27 39 6 57 mg l and 29 02 6 97 mg l respectively the average nitrate concentration in water treated by single cornstalk columns was 17 90 4 93 mg l and by two columns in series was 12 13 2 92 mg l representing an average removal rate of 35 and 49 by single columns and two columns in series respectively it is anticipated based on previous studies 30 that these removal rates would decrease by up to 51 due to lower temperatures of the studied groundwater supply in winter months but in warmer climates this method could be effective year round previous research has determined that after pre treatment to introduce specific functional groups cornstalk material may be used for adsorption of metals in water 23 25 wang et al 26 studied adsorption capacity of raw cornstalk and modified cornstalk for nitrate and phosphate the unmodified cornstalk had poor removal rates in initial experiments and the study ceased observation of raw cornstalk for the remainder of the study given these results nitrate removal rates achieved in this study are assumed to be the result of biological denitrification rather than adsorption cornstalk was dried and weighed both before and after use in the columns to determine the change in mass of the cornstalk throughout column operation fig 9 displays the average initial and final masses and loss of mass of cornstalk used in column tests for 3 weeks n 5 or 9 weeks n 2 average mass loss over 3 weeks of operation was 2 0 0 1 g while average mass loss over 9 weeks of operation was 1 8 1 0 g as there were no significant differences in mass loss between 3 and 9 weeks of operation these results may suggest that there was an initial rapid release of organic matter from the columns in the first few weeks of operation followed by slower release in subsequent weeks several researchers working with waste products as carbon sources such as rice stalk and corncobs observed an initial spike in dissolved organics concentrations in the treated water at the beginning of the testing period due to washing out of the water soluble organics from the carbon source 16 17 27 28 however there was a large variation between the two 9 week cornstalk samples so further work was required to support this finding 3 2 3 organic carbon although health canada does not regulate toc guidelines are in place for the maximum acceptable concentrations of disinfectant by products such as trihalomethanes which are formed through the reaction of organic matter with chlorine during drinking water disinfection 29 the cornstalk denitrification column tests were duplicated to obtain toc and doc data due to the possibility of increased carbon availability for by product formation during chlorination cornstalk lengths weighing approximately 9 g were used and all columns tested were single columns the nitrate was measured using the hach dr3900 program 355 n to confirm nitrate removal as the ic was out of commission the average nitrate concentration in the raw water and the blank column were 19 20 2 07 mg l and 17 39 2 29 mg l respectively the average nitrate concentration in water treated by column 1 was 14 31 2 47 mg l by column 2 was 15 03 2 45 mg l and by column 3 was 13 81 1 95 mg l representing an average removal rate of 25 21 and 27 respectively these removal rates were lower than the 35 average removal rate by single columns found in the previous cornstalk column test likely due to the mass reduction of cornstalk in the columns from 12 to 9 g which would result in a loss in surface area and carbon source fig 10 shows doc concentrations in raw water and water treated with cornstalk denitrification columns over the 11 week test period the average doc concentration in the raw water was 3 42 2 55 mg l and the blank column was 1 43 0 97 mg l the doc levels were 3 75 3 20 in column 1 2 85 2 33 mg l in column 2 2 69 1 89 mg l in column 3 the average doc concentration for the 11 week sampling period was below the us epa national primary drinking water regulations stage 2 d dbp rule value of 4 mg l allowing for reduced monitoring for disinfection by products 18 the control column showed significant reduction in doc t 11 2 22 p 0 048 in all but one of the cornstalk columns doc concentrations were lower than that of the raw water the exception being the doc levels in column 1 data indicates that on average 2 09 1 74 mg l 1 76 1 35 mg l and 2 48 1 58 mg l nitrate was converted to nitrogen gas by 1 mg l of doc in column 1 column 2 and column 3 respectively this is much higher than 0 93 mg l nitrate converted by 1 mg l of doc 8 3 3 ion exchange well water was spiked to a no3 n concentration of 20 mg l and treated with a commercial nitrate selective anion exchange resin in a 1 l jar tester fig 11 displays nitrate removal from contaminated groundwater as a function of volume of groundwater treated by the resin removal of nitrate decreased in a fairly linear manner up to 600 bed volumes at which point the resin removed approximately 5 mg l of nitrate n removals of approximately 10 mg l of nitrate from an initial concentration of 20 mg l were achieved near 300 400 bed volumes of groundwater treated chloride addition and nitrate removal were linearly related with approximately 2 876 mg of chloride added for every mg of nitrate n removed this value is close to the ratio of the mass of chloride cl to the mass of nitrogen n i e 2 53 which indicates that the resin was highly selective for nitrate resulting in a nearly one to one ratio of nitrate adsorption and chloride release sulfate concentrations did not change from raw to treated water with initial sulfate concentrations of 14 734 1 757 mg l and final sulfate concentrations of 14 448 2 619 mg l thus the ion exchange resin used in this study increased the csmr of the groundwater through chloride addition in a predictable fashion dependent on nitrate removal but did not cause an additional increase in csmr through removal of sulfate fig 12 displays the increase in csmr of groundwater after ion exchange treatment as a function of nitrate n removed based on these results csmr would be expected to increase by 0 34 for every mg l of no3 n removed by the anion exchange resin used in this study nguyen et al 22 observed increased lead leaching from lead solder copper coupons in controlled bench scale tests due to a change in csmr resulting from a range of process changes including implementation of anion exchange treatment as a result these researchers recommend that utilities conduct corrosion tests if they are considering treatment changes that will increase the csmr if 1 lead copper connections are present in the distribution system or premise plumbing 2 the water has alkalinity 50 mg l as caco3 and 3 the csmr after treatment will be greater than 0 2 as an alternative anion exchange resins with carbonate rather than chloride as the counter ion could also be investigated for nitrate removal 4 conclusions elevated nitrate levels in a rural municipal groundwater source have led to management strategies to reduce concentrations in water supply below the mac this study conducted wide spread monitoring of water quality characteristics to evaluate these strategies and determine potential issues if treatment was required biological nitrate removal was assessed using traditional materials and localized agricultural waste for a carbon source and compared to traditional ion exchange elevated nitrate levels were observed in some sample locations but the management strategy of blending source well water was effective over the course of this study it was found that cornstalk was effective as a carbon feedstock for biological denitrification batch tests although it required substantially higher carbon doses than a traditional soluble feedstock acetate it also performed well in column tests achieving nitrate removals of 35 in single column tests and 49 removal with two cornstalk columns in series in one set of experiments and removals of 25 21 and 27 in single column test in a second set carbon analysis of raw water and the effluent from single columns showed no significant difference in concentration doc concentrations in the raw water and the column effluent were consistently below 4 mg l ion exchange tests with a commercial anion exchange resin were effective in removing nitrate from the groundwater but could be expected to increase csmr by 0 34 per mg l of nitrate n removed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

13411,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to remove organic matter phosphorus and nitrogen but not other pollutants such as pharmaceutical activated compounds phac purpose this study involves the development of an approach based on a fuzzy version of a multi criteria decision making mcdm method called topsis which issues such as technology used in each wwtp atmospheric temperature hydraulic retention time or population equivalent can help in the decisions to design wwtps when the efficiency of phac removal must be considered methodology eleven alternatives wwtps located in the southeast of spain involving two technologies mbr and cas and considering different ways of quantifying each technology in the topsis ranking were studied findings the resolution of the multi criteria problem allowed the most efficient wwtps in the removal of each phac to be classified indicating that the criterion of technology was not overly important however some criteria were more relevant than others novelty the current methodology can also be applied to the design of wwtps to remove different phac considering other criteria with the possibility of reusing wastewater keywords pharmaceutical compounds wastewater treatment plants reclaimed water fuzzy logic topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution 1 introduction the water resources of the european union are increasingly coming under pressure leading to water scarcity and quality deterioration in particular climate change and drought are significantly contributing to the strain on the availability of freshwater demanded by urban development and agriculture water scarcity conditions created by population growth and urbanization predominantly due to tourism have particularly affected mediterranean areas and highly populated areas in recent years although this trend is likely to continue in the coming years water stress hotspots are expected to remain given continued pressures such as urbanization increasing population and climate change according to the european environment agency 1 on water use by sector agricultural irrigation accounts are for about half of the water used annually since the availability of water resources is limited the use of water from wwtps for agriculture is becoming increasingly common 2 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council 2 mentions the reuse of water as one of the supplementary measures member states may implement in order to redress the lack and quality deterioration of water resources in fact not only the european green deal 3 launched a concerted strategy for a resource efficient economy but also the new circular economy action plan 4 encourages circular approaches to water reuse in agriculture however there is a category of pollutants called pharmaceutical activated compounds phac 5 which reach wastewater treatment plants wwtps mainly through excretions and the disposal of unused or expired medicines the amount of phac discharged into the environment is still increasing world wide and the presence of phac in effluent wastewater could result in environmental and human health risks 6 12 in addition the urban wastewater treatment directive includes an obligation to reduce the total suspended solids tss biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod parameters 2 although no legislation exists regarding the control of the emissions of phac through wwtp effluents therefore evaluating the effectiveness of wwtps to remove these compounds is of vital importance for better environmental management to prevent pollution by applying clean technologies to promote the bio circular economy many studies have shown results of analyses of phac in effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants 13 17 some have even discussed the elimination of phac in wwtps with conventional activated sludge treatment cas and in advanced treatment processes such as membrane bioreactors mbr 18 19 the efficiency to eliminate these phac depends on the wwtp technology used during the treatment of urban wastewater for example mbr is a technology in the treatment of wastewater based on the combination of the biological activated sludge process with the physical separation solid liquid by membrane 20 activated sludge degrades the organic compounds by microbial metabolism depending on several operating factors such as temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt longer hrts involve better removal efficiency of phac due to a longer contact time between organic compounds and activated sludge 21 23 the hrt plays a significant role in the transformation of compounds that are slowly biodegradable 24 25 another parameter that can affect the degradation of phac is the temperature although only a few studies have investigated the effects of atmospheric temperature on the performances of wwtps in the case of phac 26 although the removal efficiency of phac through the wwtps is well known very few studies have analyzed phac removal efficiency in wwtps through a set of specific criteria in order to do so quantitative criteria such as temperature hrt tss bod or cod should be taken into consideration and therefore the use of multi criteria decision making mcdm methodologies can prove very appropriate carrying out an analysis of this nature could provide very useful information to the entities for water cleaning and sanitation environmental associations policymarkers and future researchers who are interested in these methodologies mcdm is a procedure which enables a group of alternatives based on a set of criteria to be classified to solve decision problems these methodologies were introduced during the last century and due to their great versatility are still being applied today the literature contains a considerable number of examples of mcdm methods which have been used in several fields of engineering such as materials operation research energy soft computing safety and risk management technology selection for ballast water treatment and sustainable design etc 27 29 some of the most used mcdm approaches include the analytic hierarchy process ahp 30 the multicriteria optimization and compromise solution vikor 31 the family of electre elimination and choice expressing reality methods 32 the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations promethee 33 the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis 34 and the reference ideal method rim 35 in order to analyze the efficiency of wwtps to remove phac criteria of different natures quantitative and qualitative criteria coexist the parameter processes or the applied technologies in each wwtp are clear proof of that fact therefore it becomes appropriate not only to apply multi criteria decision making mcdm hereafter methodologies but also to combine them together with techniques from fuzzy logic which enable the vagueness or uncertainty that these types of criteria present to be managed the main quality of fuzzy logic techniques 36 37 is their ability to integrate the analysis of qualitative and quantitative parameters to provide a suitable language to deal with criteria which at first sight seem imprecise in the case of analyzing the phac removal efficiency parameters such as the type of treatment process of wwtps can be expressed qualitatively through fuzzy numbers again the literature shows numerous studies in which mcdm methodologies have been combined with fuzzy logic 38 43 to cite just a few of them in addition when analyzing a set of parameters according to its influence to remove phac in wwtps many criteria which can present different natures or units should be taken into account as mentioned above there are numerous mcdm approaches in literature which could be applied however the peculiarities of each decision problem tip the scales in favor of some specific methods to the detriment of others 44 fuzzy versions of mcdm methodologies such as the ahp methodology would further increase the inherent subjectivity in decision problems of this nature as a result of taking part group of experts or stakeholders other recent fuzzy mcdm approaches as the rim technique require the existence of an ideal reference alternative to carry out the evaluation process 45 some fuzzy versions of mcdm methodologies such as promethee or topsis allow to take into consideration not only the nature of the criteria coexisting quantitative criteria with qualitative criteria but also that these criteria can be measured in different units 46 for all these reasons the fuzzy topsis method has been chosen to address the proposed decision problem said method enables a large number of alternatives to be evaluated based on a set of criteria through the proximity of these criteria to the ideal and anti ideal reference values 47 to the best of our knowledge no studies have applied fuzzy multi criteria decision making to assess the efficiency of wwtp in the removal of phac for this proposal wwtps alternatives with the two most commonly used technologies mbr and cas in the region of murcia have been evaluated the main objective of this research was to examine the efficiency to remove four phac namely carbamazepine cbz ketoprofen ktp diclofenac dcf and naproxen npx in eleven alternatives using a set of seven specific criteria mcdm has been carried out using the topsis approach to assess all the different alternatives furthermore a combination of the topsis procedure with tools from fuzzy logic has been applied since criteria of both a qualitative and a quantitative nature appear in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 fuzzy sets the beauty of a landscape the difficulty of a project or the seriousness of a disease are concepts which are not easy to quantify through numerical values lotfi zadeh defined the fuzzy set theory 36 37 to address the problem of uncertainty or vagueness present in many real life problems said theory has been broadly used to deal with complex systems which are controlled by human beings but are difficult to define in a precise and exhaustive way due to the inexistence of crisp or real boundaries in the above concepts between those that belong to the classes in question and those which do not there is a smooth transition from membership to non membership 48 therefore a universe of discourse which consists of a set of objects say x possesses a fuzzy set a whose values range within the closed unit interval 0 1 49 and is defined by a membership function μm x although this function can be trapezoidal or pi gaussian etc in the present work functions of triangular membership or lambda functions via sets of fuzzy numbers were used due to their simplicity in this context we can define a triangular fuzzy number as follows 50 51 a fuzzy number m on r constitutes a fuzzy triangular number if its membership function μ m r 0 1 presents the following form μ m x 1 m l x l m l i f x l m 1 m u x l m u i f x m u 0 o t h e r w i s e where l m u and l and u correspond to the lower and upper values of the triangular fuzzy number m respectively while m is its modal value triangular fuzzy numbers and their theory are detailed in 52 2 2 the topsis method the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach was first contributed in 34 and its use has spread widely in the context of mcdm applications 27 this method involves the best alternative which is chosen by calculating the greatest distance to the so called negative ideal solution nis as well as the smallest distance to the positive ideal one pis hence the best solution given by the topsis algorithm becomes a compromise solution between both of them c f fig 1 fig 1 represents a decision making problem of five alternatives a b c d e and two criteria c1 and c2 according to that figure the best alternative is the furthest one from the nis indicated by both b and d alternatives and the nearest one from the pis denoted as c notice that the topsis approach simultaneously considers the minimum distance to the pis and the maximum distance to the nis next all the steps of the topsis algorithm are represented schematically fig 2 in this study all the steps of topsis must be carried out through the basic operations of fuzzy triangular numbers 53 because criteria of different natures coexist quantitative and qualitative criteria furthermore after obtaining the proximity relation to the ideal solution step 6 a defuzzification process to transform fuzzy numbers into real ones must be applied to do so the defuzzification function defined by 54 has been used said function is as follows 1 i 1 3 1 2 r i 1 3 l i 4 m i u i 2 i 1 m where the i1 3 1 2 ri values range within the unit interval and according to such values the best alternatives are ranked in decreasing order the fuzzy version of the topsis approach is applied in this study to analyze a set of criteria according to their influence to remove phac in 11 wwtps 2 3 the decision problem influence of a set of criteria to remove phac in 11 wwtps 2 3 1 description of alternatives wwtps the study area is situated in the mediterranean area specifically in the region of murcia in southeast spain water quality is particularly important in that area due to the scarcity of rainfall with a semi arid climate where rainfall amounts to ca 300 mm rainfall per year and wwtp effluents are sometimes the only source of water in natural streams and thus the effluents are reused as irrigation water the alternatives wwtps selected for this research were chosen as being the most representative in the study area all of them operated with the two most widely used technologies mbr and cas in the region and most of the effluents treated are being reused as irrigation water in agriculture this selection involved the participation of the main stakeholder in that decision making process the entity for water cleaning and sanitation of murcia esamur fig 3 shows the study area with the 11 wwtps 2 3 2 description of pharmaceutical activated compounds phac the phac studied were four pharmaceutical compounds one antiepileptic carbamazepine cbz and three non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid diclofenac dfc ketoprofen ktp and naproxen npx the criteria for selecting these specific pharmaceutical compounds were that they are generally present in the wastewater and in the environment 55 many studies have researched the bioaccumulation and uptake of phac in plants using recycled wastewater 56 62 due to the reuse of effluents from wwtps as irrigation water in the region of murcia esamur considered that these compounds also needed to be studied carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant with log kow 2 5 a neutral charge and intermediate hydrophobicity 95 used to treat psychiatric disorders pain of neurologic origin and partial seizures cbz is among the most commonly detected phac in effluents from wwtps since it is not degraded or retained in wwtps 63 the global water research coalition gwrc defined a high priority level for this substance 64 sources of cbz in effluents from wwtps include excretion by patients pharmaceutical industry effluents or discarded medications 65 and less than 1 of the total dose is excreted in urine as unchanged cbz while several metabolites are excreted in up to 40 times higher concentrations than the parent compound 66 diclofenac is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid a hydrophobic drug with log kow 4 with analgesic and antipyretic properties dcf has been included in the first list of compounds for ue wide monitoring in the water policy 67 dcf is not completely eliminated from wwtps and is found in effluent samples 68 probably due to de conjugation of glucoronidated or sulfated diclofenac and or its desorption from particles 69 therefore dcf is frequently detected in rivers sediments and sludge 70 71 and can interact with organic and inorganic pollutants and with dcf metabolites due to the presence of active groups in metabolites of dcf amino hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups which show the possibility of interaction between these molecules 72 ketoprofen is another nsaid with log kow 3 and is used to treat arthritis and different painful conditions some studies such as that performed by matamoros et al 73 in spain demonstrated the presence of ktp in wwtps and it was efficiently removed due to it being linked to its fast photodegradation kinetics 74 naproxen is a weak acid with log kow 3 used to treat inflammation caused by ankylosing spondylitis arthritis and tendinitis npx is a phac that is commonly detected in wwtp effluents photodegradation and biodegradation play an important role in its elimination 75 2 3 3 description of criteria there is not one ideal or perfect set of criteria to use as the basis to evaluate the efficiency of wwtps in removing phac selection of the criteria presents a subjective nature from a decision analytical perspective the criteria should be perfectly independent of each other yet in practice such independence can rarely be achieved by means of a stakeholder workshop involving academia esamur and the operating companies of wastewater treatments the following seven criteria were chosen hydraulic retention time hrt temperature t treatment capacity technology total suspended solid removal efficiency tss chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency cod and biological oxygen demand removal efficiency bod a brief description of each criterion is provided below 2 3 3 1 criterion 1 hydraulic retention time hydraulic retention time hrt links to the mean residence time of the liquid phase in the biological reactor hrt represents the average time that water molecules stay in the biological reactor this is twice the time that microorganisms require to increase bacterial activity and population size the hydraulic retention time hrt has been proposed as a significant factor affecting the removal of phac 76 while in plants operating at lower hrts compounds cannot even accomplish the degradation of half of their initial concentration which thus means lower removal efficiencies a totally different behavior is observed in plants working at higher hrts 77 moreover longer hrts involve better removal efficiency of phac due to a longer contact time between activated sludge and organic compounds 21 22 2 3 3 2 criterion 2 average annual temperature another parameter that can affect the removal of phac is the atmospheric temperature temperature variations can affect the log kow microbial activity and other physicochemical properties of phac molecules for instance an increase in the effluent temperature can decrease the dissolved oxygen concentration do and promote the increase of specific microorganisms temperature proved to be one of the most determining parameters affecting phac elimination with phac being removed more efficiently at higher temperatures 78 79 although the temperature parameter depends on the geographical location of each wwtp its influence on the removal of the phac mentioned above in such plants has been analyzed 2 3 3 3 criterion 3 treatment capacity treatment capacity m3 year is a parameter closely related to the population equivalent pe pe in wastewater treatment is a unit of measure based on the amount of pollution emitted per person and day 80 the wwtps selected in this study have been designed to treat between 51 021 m3 year and 36 967 000 m3 year although most of them are working at ca 85 of capacity 81 as in criterion c2 the treatment capacity of the plant is a specific parameter dependent on the population of the nearby locations however this parameter has been analyzed in order to determine its influence on the phac elimination process 2 3 3 4 criterion 4 technology wwtps are planned to have different water treatment process mixtures with varied water treatment conveniences depending on the influent water s load and the effluent discharge parameters the wwtps studied consist principally of two different treatments a conventional activated sludge system cas and a membrane bioreactor system mbr the first treatment cas consists mainly of a conventional activated sludge system this system involves a pre treated wastewater technology based on the screening of thick and thin particle matter and primary clarifiers where the primary sludge is acquired the secondary treatment is based on activated sludge processes in a biological reactor where phosphate and nitrogen are removed via nitrification denitrification the wastewater settles in secondary clarifiers where the secondary sludge is produced the secondary and primary sludge are digested and later centrifuged to eliminate excess water tertiary treatment processes are used to remove microbiological pollution in the water to be discharged back into the environment for its subsequent use in irrigation the other system mbr uses a selectively permeable membrane integrated with a biological process a suspended growth bioreactor combining the activated sludge treatment and submerged membranes makes highly concentrated activated sludge treatments possible from the perspective of analyzing the influence on the removal of phac such a criterion is difficult to express quantitatively due to its qualitative nature the technology criterion is defined in this study based on fuzzy logic through linguistic labels associated with the triangular fuzzy numbers described in section 2 1 2 3 3 5 criterion 5 total suspended solid removal efficiency total suspended solids tss is a parameter considered in this study dissolved oxygen do concentration in the effluents depends on the tss removal efficiency the council directive 91 271 eec states that the minimum value of tss removal efficiency must be 90 2 3 3 6 criterion 6 chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency the chemical oxygen demand cod parameter is widely used as an indicator to identify the characteristics of wastewater it is an indicative unit of the amount of oxygen that can be accomplished by reactions in a calculated solution cod is expressed as the mass of chemical oxygen accomplished over the volume of the solution which in si units is milligrams per liter mg l the council directive 91 271 eec states that the minimum value of cod removal efficiency must be 75 2 3 3 7 criterion 7 biological oxygen demand removal efficiency the biological oxygen demand bod is a measure of the amount of do that is used by aerobic microorganisms when putrefying organic material in water although bod depends on the cod in that both determine the amounts of organic matter in water from the point of view of the removal efficiency of these compounds they have been considered totally independent bod is expressed as the mass of biological oxygen accomplished over the volume of the solution which in si units is milligrams per liter mg l the council directive 91 271 eec states that the minimum value of bod removal efficiency must be 70 90 the wwtps characteristic data such as temperature t hydraulic retention time hrt total suspended solids removal efficiency tss biological oxygen demand removal efficiency bod chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency cod and the wwtps technologies considered in our study are summarized in table 1 to analyze this set of criteria according to their influence in phac removal in 11 wwtps all of them should achieve the ideal values from the topsis method perspective 2 3 4 obtaining assessments of the alternatives in this section 11 wwtps have been analyzed with respect to each criterion to enable this analysis two types of criteria were defined there is one qualitative criterion criterion 4 technology whilst the rest of the criteria presented a quantitative nature thus linguistic labels associated with triangular fuzzy numbers were used to symbolize criterion c4 numerically criterion c4 classifies the technology applied to reduce the phac in each wwtp from very low to very high removal capacity where very low refers to the worst capacity for the elimination of these waste waters and very high means the best capacity table 2 nevertheless the same technology may not always be suitable to eliminate different phac the influence of c4 technology based on linguistic labels has been detailed in section 2 3 4 1 the criteria that presented a quantitative nature such as the annual average temperature criterion 2 efficiency in suspended solids criterion 5 chemical oxygen demand cod criterion 6 and biological oxygen demand bod criterion 7 have a common property namely their values are quite close to each other see table 1 in order to obtain greater variation among them we have defined said criteria by means of triangular fuzzy numbers using the following expression 2 x i σ x i x i σ σ i 1 n x i x 2 n where xi represents the numerical value of the criteria mentioned above c 2 c5 c6 and c7 x is their means and σ denotes the standard deviation on the other hand the remaining criteria criterion 1 hydraulic retention time and criterion 3 capacity of wwtp were defined numerically e g 7 through the alternatives but symbolized in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers 7 7 7 in the example above therefore decision matrices in the form of rows and columns provide the information regarding the seven criteria by the 11 wwtps for each phac carbamazepine diclofenac ketoprofen and naproxen considered that information has been extracted for each of the wwtps and the values of criterion c4 represented by linguistic labels in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers table 2 have been defined in light of the above these decision matrices were comprised of a mixture of triangular fuzzy numbers linguistic labels and crisp numerical values since the criteria are of different natures tables a1 and a2 in appendix a 2 3 4 1 influence of c4 technology this study was designed considering different ways of quantifying the technology criterion based on the removal of the phac these evaluations were carried out with the participation of a group of experts composed of the multidisciplinary team made up of members of the academy entity of sanitation and wastewater treatment in the region of murcia esamur operation and water treatment company this group indicated that in view of the results observed in the literature reviewed and mentioned below it could be simple and intuitive to carry out the assessment of the technology criterion through linguistic labels such as those indicated in table 2 many studies showed different phac removal rates for mbr and cas technologies gonzález pérez et al 82 qarni et al 83 and radjenović et al 84 reported that the mbr system showed a low cbz removal rate less than 10 in addition some studies reported a medium removal rate 30 40 of cbz in the cas system 85 86 whilst other studies reported a low removal rate less than 10 of cbz in the cas system 87 in the case of dcf a high elimination rate more than 90 was reported in the mbr system 87 88 while different removal rates were observed in the case of the cas system for instance celiz et al 87 and radjenovic et al 88 showed a low removal rate less than 28 a medium removal rate 50 88 and a high removal rate more than 85 was reported in serrano et al 86 on the other hand high removal rates of npx were reported in other mbr comparative studies more than 90 79 84 88 89 and cas more than 70 84 88 finally a high ktp removal rate was reported in previous mbr studies more than 90 79 88 89 while a medium removal of ktp was previously reported in the cas system 50 84 88 taking all these studies into account a decision tree based on the influence of the technology criterion c4 has been designed fig 4 2 3 4 2 application of the fuzzy topsis method once the set of criteria for each of the decision matrices has been selected the topsis method provides an evaluation of the effect caused by each alternative in all the criteria it is worth mentioning that this mcdm approach becomes especially suitable whenever the values of the criteria for each alternative are not described in terms of the same units as in this case in summary for our case study linguistic labels are used for criterion c4 numerical values for criteria c1 and c3 and triangular fuzzy numbers for criteria c2 c5 c6 and c7 tables a1 and a2 in appendix a due to that fact all the steps of the fuzzy version of the topsis method are applied for each of the decision matrices it is worth mentioning that the topsis methodology allows to assign a weight or coefficient of importance for each criterion such weights can be obtained by applying other mcdm methodologies such as the fuzzy ahp approach through the extraction of knowledge from a group of experts however following the recommendations of the stakeholders and with the aim of analyzing the influence of each of the parameters involved criteria and not adding more subjectivity to the proposed case study we start from the basis that all criteria have an influence in the assessment process of equal importance from the point of view of phac removal in wwtps 3 results and discussion the selection criteria have been evaluated with the aim of increasing food safety as well as considering the challenges currently being worked on such as adaptation to the new european legislation on water reuse which will require major remodeling of facilities and new demands regarding the way of operating the wwtps the relationship with the users of reclaimed water and the costs that such adaptations will entail the results of the multi criteria problem enabled the identification of the most influential criteria for eliminating each phac as well as their importance when designing wwtps the removal efficiencies for the four phac studied are described in the following subsections 3 1 evaluating the removal efficiency for the phac studied two different ways of quantifying of technologies mbr cas have been studied for four phac and according to the ranking topsis and relative closeness i 1 3 1 2 r i of wwtp based on phac removal efficiency 3 1 1 evaluating the removal efficiency for cbz the three most efficient removal cases or wwtps for cbz were 11 9 and 10 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 5 and table a3 of the appendix analyzing the influence of the technology criterion for cbz it is observed that c4 slightly influences the classification of the alternatives fig 5a and b showed an exchange of positions between the alternatives in cases 6 and 8 the order of priority of the criteria according to the topsis score observing the ideal values can be seen in tables a1 and a2 as can be seen the most influential criteria to eliminate cbz were c1 c2 and c3 since they correspond to the three best positioned alternatives wwtp 3 1 2 evaluating the removal efficiency for dcf the topsis score of the ideal values in dcf is of particular interest and complexity as shown in fig 6 and table 3 of the appendix we studied the ranking topsis of wwtps based on dcf removal efficiency in three cases depending on the ways of quantifying the criterion c4 the three most efficient removal cases for dcf in the first and second ways of quantifying the technologies studied a mbr high cas high and b mbr high cas medium were 11 9 and 10 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 6a and b whilst the three most efficient removal cases for dcf in the third way c mbr high cas low were 6 7 and 11 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 6c as can be seen in tables a1 and a2 the most influential criteria to eliminate dcf according to the topsis score in the cases of the first and second ways were c1 c2 and c3 since they correspond to the three best positioned alternatives wwtps however the influential criteria differ when the difference between the technology criterion increases mbr high cas low in that case the technology criterion c4 began to gain relevance and the second factor in order of importance was the temperature criterion c2 see tables a1 and a2 and fig 6b 3 1 3 evaluating the removal efficiency for npx for npx the way of quantifying the criterion c4 is the same as the first way a of the analysis of the removal efficiency of cbz with that the three most efficient removal cases of npx were 11 9 and 10 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 7 and table 3 of the appendix on the other hand case 5 showed the scenario of the wwtps with the worst removal efficiency in npx and the last ranking position likewise the most influential criteria to eliminate npx are c1 c2 and c3 3 1 4 evaluating the removal efficiency for ktp for the alternative of the technology studied mbr high cas medium the information in cases 11 9 and 10 showed the first ranking positions in the removal efficiency of ktp with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 8 however case 5 is the scenario of the wwtps with the worst removal efficiency in ktp with the last ranking position as the behavior shown in the other phac as can be seen in tables a1 and a2 the most influential criteria to eliminate ktp according to the topsis score are c1 c2 and c3 3 2 relevance of the criteria considered in the topsis method in the design of wwtps with low environmental risk this method has characterized and identified the most important criteria for phac removal and enables the utilization of these environmentally friendly wastewaters it has been observed that the criterion c1 hrt is one of the criteria that most influences the elimination of the studied phac most of the wwtps in the region of murcia have controlled the contact time between activated sludge and organic compounds 81 therefore hrt is a relatively straight forward parameter to adapt without requiring major modifications or changes in the design of the wwtp the criterion c2 average annual temperature was also observed to be instrumental its influence in areas where the temperature is higher is typically associated with a water deficit requiring the reuse of the water from the wwtp to compensate for the area s lack of water in uses as varied as agriculture landscaping industry 90 the criterion c3 treatment capacity is another criterion to take into account in the design of wwtps given its influence on phac elimination it is linked to large population settlements where higher concentrations of phac are detected in the influents of wwtps coming from the big cities and the hospitals located therein the criterion c4 wwtp technology has not been categorized as being of great importance in the elimination of the studied phac thus revealing that the technologies studied cas and mbr are efficient in their design for phac elimination so it is not necessary to make significant adaptations or changes in the technologies studied which would represent a high economic cost it is important to highlight that this study has been carried out in accordance with the phac data of effluents from selected wwtps which are working with primary secondary and tertiary treatments although some authors have researched advanced treatments such as through the use of ozone or activated carbon to eliminate organic micropollutants 91 92 none of the wwtps selected for this study were employing those advanced treatment processes finally it should be commented that the criteria c5 tss efficiency c6 cod efficiency and c7 bod efficiency have not shown great relevance in their influence on the extraction of the phac studied with respect to the other criteria studied these results provide useful data to justify decisions by using multiple criteria when designing wwtps and providing end users politicians legislators engineers operators with a tool to explore hypothetical scenarios and examine the response surface to improve coherence and quality of the decisions regarding the removal of phac in wastewater 4 conclusions the design of wwtps to removal phac promote circular bio economy for better environmental management and should not be carried out following a one dimensional approach but according to a multi criteria methodology able to take the complexity of the issue addressed into account in this paper we contribute the first known fuzzy topsis application to analyze two technologies mbr and cas through the assessment of 11 alternatives wwtps based on the removal of four phac and a set of seven criteria the resolution of the multi criteria problem classified the most efficient wwtps cases 11 9 and 10 in the removal of the majority of the phac studied in the evaluation of the removal efficiency of phac the most relevant criteria were criteria c1 hydraulic retention time c2 annual mean temperature and c3 treatment capacity while criteria c4 technology c5 tss efficiency c6 cod efficiency and c7 bod efficiency showed less relevance than c1 c2 and c3 indicating that the criterion technology c4 was not so important for the possibility of reusing wastewater this ranking can be used to provide decision support in the environmental assessment of eco technologies and show how different decision options can be compared in relative terms based on a set of criteria this study demonstrates the compensatory nature and versatility of fuzzy mcdm methods since not only does it allow to combine various criteria which are included in the evaluation but also these criteria can be of different natures with qualitative criteria coexisting with quantitative criteria that on certain occasions are difficult to quantify the results of the multi criteria problem allowed the identification of the most influential criteria to eliminate phac and their importance in the design of the wwtps with clean technologies that promote the circular economy thus ensuring the correct use of wastewater further studies are required to evaluate other phac and technologies to quantify the relevance of the criteria involved in the phac removal efficiency in the scenarios of wwtps moreover to extend this work a further study regarding other mcdm methodologies such as fuzzy promethee or vikor may be carried out declaration of competing

13411,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to remove organic matter phosphorus and nitrogen but not other pollutants such as pharmaceutical activated compounds phac purpose this study involves the development of an approach based on a fuzzy version of a multi criteria decision making mcdm method called topsis which issues such as technology used in each wwtp atmospheric temperature hydraulic retention time or population equivalent can help in the decisions to design wwtps when the efficiency of phac removal must be considered methodology eleven alternatives wwtps located in the southeast of spain involving two technologies mbr and cas and considering different ways of quantifying each technology in the topsis ranking were studied findings the resolution of the multi criteria problem allowed the most efficient wwtps in the removal of each phac to be classified indicating that the criterion of technology was not overly important however some criteria were more relevant than others novelty the current methodology can also be applied to the design of wwtps to remove different phac considering other criteria with the possibility of reusing wastewater keywords pharmaceutical compounds wastewater treatment plants reclaimed water fuzzy logic topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution 1 introduction the water resources of the european union are increasingly coming under pressure leading to water scarcity and quality deterioration in particular climate change and drought are significantly contributing to the strain on the availability of freshwater demanded by urban development and agriculture water scarcity conditions created by population growth and urbanization predominantly due to tourism have particularly affected mediterranean areas and highly populated areas in recent years although this trend is likely to continue in the coming years water stress hotspots are expected to remain given continued pressures such as urbanization increasing population and climate change according to the european environment agency 1 on water use by sector agricultural irrigation accounts are for about half of the water used annually since the availability of water resources is limited the use of water from wwtps for agriculture is becoming increasingly common 2 60 ec of the european parliament and of the council 2 mentions the reuse of water as one of the supplementary measures member states may implement in order to redress the lack and quality deterioration of water resources in fact not only the european green deal 3 launched a concerted strategy for a resource efficient economy but also the new circular economy action plan 4 encourages circular approaches to water reuse in agriculture however there is a category of pollutants called pharmaceutical activated compounds phac 5 which reach wastewater treatment plants wwtps mainly through excretions and the disposal of unused or expired medicines the amount of phac discharged into the environment is still increasing world wide and the presence of phac in effluent wastewater could result in environmental and human health risks 6 12 in addition the urban wastewater treatment directive includes an obligation to reduce the total suspended solids tss biological oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod parameters 2 although no legislation exists regarding the control of the emissions of phac through wwtp effluents therefore evaluating the effectiveness of wwtps to remove these compounds is of vital importance for better environmental management to prevent pollution by applying clean technologies to promote the bio circular economy many studies have shown results of analyses of phac in effluents from urban wastewater treatment plants 13 17 some have even discussed the elimination of phac in wwtps with conventional activated sludge treatment cas and in advanced treatment processes such as membrane bioreactors mbr 18 19 the efficiency to eliminate these phac depends on the wwtp technology used during the treatment of urban wastewater for example mbr is a technology in the treatment of wastewater based on the combination of the biological activated sludge process with the physical separation solid liquid by membrane 20 activated sludge degrades the organic compounds by microbial metabolism depending on several operating factors such as temperature and hydraulic retention time hrt longer hrts involve better removal efficiency of phac due to a longer contact time between organic compounds and activated sludge 21 23 the hrt plays a significant role in the transformation of compounds that are slowly biodegradable 24 25 another parameter that can affect the degradation of phac is the temperature although only a few studies have investigated the effects of atmospheric temperature on the performances of wwtps in the case of phac 26 although the removal efficiency of phac through the wwtps is well known very few studies have analyzed phac removal efficiency in wwtps through a set of specific criteria in order to do so quantitative criteria such as temperature hrt tss bod or cod should be taken into consideration and therefore the use of multi criteria decision making mcdm methodologies can prove very appropriate carrying out an analysis of this nature could provide very useful information to the entities for water cleaning and sanitation environmental associations policymarkers and future researchers who are interested in these methodologies mcdm is a procedure which enables a group of alternatives based on a set of criteria to be classified to solve decision problems these methodologies were introduced during the last century and due to their great versatility are still being applied today the literature contains a considerable number of examples of mcdm methods which have been used in several fields of engineering such as materials operation research energy soft computing safety and risk management technology selection for ballast water treatment and sustainable design etc 27 29 some of the most used mcdm approaches include the analytic hierarchy process ahp 30 the multicriteria optimization and compromise solution vikor 31 the family of electre elimination and choice expressing reality methods 32 the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations promethee 33 the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis 34 and the reference ideal method rim 35 in order to analyze the efficiency of wwtps to remove phac criteria of different natures quantitative and qualitative criteria coexist the parameter processes or the applied technologies in each wwtp are clear proof of that fact therefore it becomes appropriate not only to apply multi criteria decision making mcdm hereafter methodologies but also to combine them together with techniques from fuzzy logic which enable the vagueness or uncertainty that these types of criteria present to be managed the main quality of fuzzy logic techniques 36 37 is their ability to integrate the analysis of qualitative and quantitative parameters to provide a suitable language to deal with criteria which at first sight seem imprecise in the case of analyzing the phac removal efficiency parameters such as the type of treatment process of wwtps can be expressed qualitatively through fuzzy numbers again the literature shows numerous studies in which mcdm methodologies have been combined with fuzzy logic 38 43 to cite just a few of them in addition when analyzing a set of parameters according to its influence to remove phac in wwtps many criteria which can present different natures or units should be taken into account as mentioned above there are numerous mcdm approaches in literature which could be applied however the peculiarities of each decision problem tip the scales in favor of some specific methods to the detriment of others 44 fuzzy versions of mcdm methodologies such as the ahp methodology would further increase the inherent subjectivity in decision problems of this nature as a result of taking part group of experts or stakeholders other recent fuzzy mcdm approaches as the rim technique require the existence of an ideal reference alternative to carry out the evaluation process 45 some fuzzy versions of mcdm methodologies such as promethee or topsis allow to take into consideration not only the nature of the criteria coexisting quantitative criteria with qualitative criteria but also that these criteria can be measured in different units 46 for all these reasons the fuzzy topsis method has been chosen to address the proposed decision problem said method enables a large number of alternatives to be evaluated based on a set of criteria through the proximity of these criteria to the ideal and anti ideal reference values 47 to the best of our knowledge no studies have applied fuzzy multi criteria decision making to assess the efficiency of wwtp in the removal of phac for this proposal wwtps alternatives with the two most commonly used technologies mbr and cas in the region of murcia have been evaluated the main objective of this research was to examine the efficiency to remove four phac namely carbamazepine cbz ketoprofen ktp diclofenac dcf and naproxen npx in eleven alternatives using a set of seven specific criteria mcdm has been carried out using the topsis approach to assess all the different alternatives furthermore a combination of the topsis procedure with tools from fuzzy logic has been applied since criteria of both a qualitative and a quantitative nature appear in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 fuzzy sets the beauty of a landscape the difficulty of a project or the seriousness of a disease are concepts which are not easy to quantify through numerical values lotfi zadeh defined the fuzzy set theory 36 37 to address the problem of uncertainty or vagueness present in many real life problems said theory has been broadly used to deal with complex systems which are controlled by human beings but are difficult to define in a precise and exhaustive way due to the inexistence of crisp or real boundaries in the above concepts between those that belong to the classes in question and those which do not there is a smooth transition from membership to non membership 48 therefore a universe of discourse which consists of a set of objects say x possesses a fuzzy set a whose values range within the closed unit interval 0 1 49 and is defined by a membership function μm x although this function can be trapezoidal or pi gaussian etc in the present work functions of triangular membership or lambda functions via sets of fuzzy numbers were used due to their simplicity in this context we can define a triangular fuzzy number as follows 50 51 a fuzzy number m on r constitutes a fuzzy triangular number if its membership function μ m r 0 1 presents the following form μ m x 1 m l x l m l i f x l m 1 m u x l m u i f x m u 0 o t h e r w i s e where l m u and l and u correspond to the lower and upper values of the triangular fuzzy number m respectively while m is its modal value triangular fuzzy numbers and their theory are detailed in 52 2 2 the topsis method the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution topsis approach was first contributed in 34 and its use has spread widely in the context of mcdm applications 27 this method involves the best alternative which is chosen by calculating the greatest distance to the so called negative ideal solution nis as well as the smallest distance to the positive ideal one pis hence the best solution given by the topsis algorithm becomes a compromise solution between both of them c f fig 1 fig 1 represents a decision making problem of five alternatives a b c d e and two criteria c1 and c2 according to that figure the best alternative is the furthest one from the nis indicated by both b and d alternatives and the nearest one from the pis denoted as c notice that the topsis approach simultaneously considers the minimum distance to the pis and the maximum distance to the nis next all the steps of the topsis algorithm are represented schematically fig 2 in this study all the steps of topsis must be carried out through the basic operations of fuzzy triangular numbers 53 because criteria of different natures coexist quantitative and qualitative criteria furthermore after obtaining the proximity relation to the ideal solution step 6 a defuzzification process to transform fuzzy numbers into real ones must be applied to do so the defuzzification function defined by 54 has been used said function is as follows 1 i 1 3 1 2 r i 1 3 l i 4 m i u i 2 i 1 m where the i1 3 1 2 ri values range within the unit interval and according to such values the best alternatives are ranked in decreasing order the fuzzy version of the topsis approach is applied in this study to analyze a set of criteria according to their influence to remove phac in 11 wwtps 2 3 the decision problem influence of a set of criteria to remove phac in 11 wwtps 2 3 1 description of alternatives wwtps the study area is situated in the mediterranean area specifically in the region of murcia in southeast spain water quality is particularly important in that area due to the scarcity of rainfall with a semi arid climate where rainfall amounts to ca 300 mm rainfall per year and wwtp effluents are sometimes the only source of water in natural streams and thus the effluents are reused as irrigation water the alternatives wwtps selected for this research were chosen as being the most representative in the study area all of them operated with the two most widely used technologies mbr and cas in the region and most of the effluents treated are being reused as irrigation water in agriculture this selection involved the participation of the main stakeholder in that decision making process the entity for water cleaning and sanitation of murcia esamur fig 3 shows the study area with the 11 wwtps 2 3 2 description of pharmaceutical activated compounds phac the phac studied were four pharmaceutical compounds one antiepileptic carbamazepine cbz and three non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaid diclofenac dfc ketoprofen ktp and naproxen npx the criteria for selecting these specific pharmaceutical compounds were that they are generally present in the wastewater and in the environment 55 many studies have researched the bioaccumulation and uptake of phac in plants using recycled wastewater 56 62 due to the reuse of effluents from wwtps as irrigation water in the region of murcia esamur considered that these compounds also needed to be studied carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant with log kow 2 5 a neutral charge and intermediate hydrophobicity 95 used to treat psychiatric disorders pain of neurologic origin and partial seizures cbz is among the most commonly detected phac in effluents from wwtps since it is not degraded or retained in wwtps 63 the global water research coalition gwrc defined a high priority level for this substance 64 sources of cbz in effluents from wwtps include excretion by patients pharmaceutical industry effluents or discarded medications 65 and less than 1 of the total dose is excreted in urine as unchanged cbz while several metabolites are excreted in up to 40 times higher concentrations than the parent compound 66 diclofenac is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid a hydrophobic drug with log kow 4 with analgesic and antipyretic properties dcf has been included in the first list of compounds for ue wide monitoring in the water policy 67 dcf is not completely eliminated from wwtps and is found in effluent samples 68 probably due to de conjugation of glucoronidated or sulfated diclofenac and or its desorption from particles 69 therefore dcf is frequently detected in rivers sediments and sludge 70 71 and can interact with organic and inorganic pollutants and with dcf metabolites due to the presence of active groups in metabolites of dcf amino hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups which show the possibility of interaction between these molecules 72 ketoprofen is another nsaid with log kow 3 and is used to treat arthritis and different painful conditions some studies such as that performed by matamoros et al 73 in spain demonstrated the presence of ktp in wwtps and it was efficiently removed due to it being linked to its fast photodegradation kinetics 74 naproxen is a weak acid with log kow 3 used to treat inflammation caused by ankylosing spondylitis arthritis and tendinitis npx is a phac that is commonly detected in wwtp effluents photodegradation and biodegradation play an important role in its elimination 75 2 3 3 description of criteria there is not one ideal or perfect set of criteria to use as the basis to evaluate the efficiency of wwtps in removing phac selection of the criteria presents a subjective nature from a decision analytical perspective the criteria should be perfectly independent of each other yet in practice such independence can rarely be achieved by means of a stakeholder workshop involving academia esamur and the operating companies of wastewater treatments the following seven criteria were chosen hydraulic retention time hrt temperature t treatment capacity technology total suspended solid removal efficiency tss chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency cod and biological oxygen demand removal efficiency bod a brief description of each criterion is provided below 2 3 3 1 criterion 1 hydraulic retention time hydraulic retention time hrt links to the mean residence time of the liquid phase in the biological reactor hrt represents the average time that water molecules stay in the biological reactor this is twice the time that microorganisms require to increase bacterial activity and population size the hydraulic retention time hrt has been proposed as a significant factor affecting the removal of phac 76 while in plants operating at lower hrts compounds cannot even accomplish the degradation of half of their initial concentration which thus means lower removal efficiencies a totally different behavior is observed in plants working at higher hrts 77 moreover longer hrts involve better removal efficiency of phac due to a longer contact time between activated sludge and organic compounds 21 22 2 3 3 2 criterion 2 average annual temperature another parameter that can affect the removal of phac is the atmospheric temperature temperature variations can affect the log kow microbial activity and other physicochemical properties of phac molecules for instance an increase in the effluent temperature can decrease the dissolved oxygen concentration do and promote the increase of specific microorganisms temperature proved to be one of the most determining parameters affecting phac elimination with phac being removed more efficiently at higher temperatures 78 79 although the temperature parameter depends on the geographical location of each wwtp its influence on the removal of the phac mentioned above in such plants has been analyzed 2 3 3 3 criterion 3 treatment capacity treatment capacity m3 year is a parameter closely related to the population equivalent pe pe in wastewater treatment is a unit of measure based on the amount of pollution emitted per person and day 80 the wwtps selected in this study have been designed to treat between 51 021 m3 year and 36 967 000 m3 year although most of them are working at ca 85 of capacity 81 as in criterion c2 the treatment capacity of the plant is a specific parameter dependent on the population of the nearby locations however this parameter has been analyzed in order to determine its influence on the phac elimination process 2 3 3 4 criterion 4 technology wwtps are planned to have different water treatment process mixtures with varied water treatment conveniences depending on the influent water s load and the effluent discharge parameters the wwtps studied consist principally of two different treatments a conventional activated sludge system cas and a membrane bioreactor system mbr the first treatment cas consists mainly of a conventional activated sludge system this system involves a pre treated wastewater technology based on the screening of thick and thin particle matter and primary clarifiers where the primary sludge is acquired the secondary treatment is based on activated sludge processes in a biological reactor where phosphate and nitrogen are removed via nitrification denitrification the wastewater settles in secondary clarifiers where the secondary sludge is produced the secondary and primary sludge are digested and later centrifuged to eliminate excess water tertiary treatment processes are used to remove microbiological pollution in the water to be discharged back into the environment for its subsequent use in irrigation the other system mbr uses a selectively permeable membrane integrated with a biological process a suspended growth bioreactor combining the activated sludge treatment and submerged membranes makes highly concentrated activated sludge treatments possible from the perspective of analyzing the influence on the removal of phac such a criterion is difficult to express quantitatively due to its qualitative nature the technology criterion is defined in this study based on fuzzy logic through linguistic labels associated with the triangular fuzzy numbers described in section 2 1 2 3 3 5 criterion 5 total suspended solid removal efficiency total suspended solids tss is a parameter considered in this study dissolved oxygen do concentration in the effluents depends on the tss removal efficiency the council directive 91 271 eec states that the minimum value of tss removal efficiency must be 90 2 3 3 6 criterion 6 chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency the chemical oxygen demand cod parameter is widely used as an indicator to identify the characteristics of wastewater it is an indicative unit of the amount of oxygen that can be accomplished by reactions in a calculated solution cod is expressed as the mass of chemical oxygen accomplished over the volume of the solution which in si units is milligrams per liter mg l the council directive 91 271 eec states that the minimum value of cod removal efficiency must be 75 2 3 3 7 criterion 7 biological oxygen demand removal efficiency the biological oxygen demand bod is a measure of the amount of do that is used by aerobic microorganisms when putrefying organic material in water although bod depends on the cod in that both determine the amounts of organic matter in water from the point of view of the removal efficiency of these compounds they have been considered totally independent bod is expressed as the mass of biological oxygen accomplished over the volume of the solution which in si units is milligrams per liter mg l the council directive 91 271 eec states that the minimum value of bod removal efficiency must be 70 90 the wwtps characteristic data such as temperature t hydraulic retention time hrt total suspended solids removal efficiency tss biological oxygen demand removal efficiency bod chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency cod and the wwtps technologies considered in our study are summarized in table 1 to analyze this set of criteria according to their influence in phac removal in 11 wwtps all of them should achieve the ideal values from the topsis method perspective 2 3 4 obtaining assessments of the alternatives in this section 11 wwtps have been analyzed with respect to each criterion to enable this analysis two types of criteria were defined there is one qualitative criterion criterion 4 technology whilst the rest of the criteria presented a quantitative nature thus linguistic labels associated with triangular fuzzy numbers were used to symbolize criterion c4 numerically criterion c4 classifies the technology applied to reduce the phac in each wwtp from very low to very high removal capacity where very low refers to the worst capacity for the elimination of these waste waters and very high means the best capacity table 2 nevertheless the same technology may not always be suitable to eliminate different phac the influence of c4 technology based on linguistic labels has been detailed in section 2 3 4 1 the criteria that presented a quantitative nature such as the annual average temperature criterion 2 efficiency in suspended solids criterion 5 chemical oxygen demand cod criterion 6 and biological oxygen demand bod criterion 7 have a common property namely their values are quite close to each other see table 1 in order to obtain greater variation among them we have defined said criteria by means of triangular fuzzy numbers using the following expression 2 x i σ x i x i σ σ i 1 n x i x 2 n where xi represents the numerical value of the criteria mentioned above c 2 c5 c6 and c7 x is their means and σ denotes the standard deviation on the other hand the remaining criteria criterion 1 hydraulic retention time and criterion 3 capacity of wwtp were defined numerically e g 7 through the alternatives but symbolized in terms of triangular fuzzy numbers 7 7 7 in the example above therefore decision matrices in the form of rows and columns provide the information regarding the seven criteria by the 11 wwtps for each phac carbamazepine diclofenac ketoprofen and naproxen considered that information has been extracted for each of the wwtps and the values of criterion c4 represented by linguistic labels in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers table 2 have been defined in light of the above these decision matrices were comprised of a mixture of triangular fuzzy numbers linguistic labels and crisp numerical values since the criteria are of different natures tables a1 and a2 in appendix a 2 3 4 1 influence of c4 technology this study was designed considering different ways of quantifying the technology criterion based on the removal of the phac these evaluations were carried out with the participation of a group of experts composed of the multidisciplinary team made up of members of the academy entity of sanitation and wastewater treatment in the region of murcia esamur operation and water treatment company this group indicated that in view of the results observed in the literature reviewed and mentioned below it could be simple and intuitive to carry out the assessment of the technology criterion through linguistic labels such as those indicated in table 2 many studies showed different phac removal rates for mbr and cas technologies gonzález pérez et al 82 qarni et al 83 and radjenović et al 84 reported that the mbr system showed a low cbz removal rate less than 10 in addition some studies reported a medium removal rate 30 40 of cbz in the cas system 85 86 whilst other studies reported a low removal rate less than 10 of cbz in the cas system 87 in the case of dcf a high elimination rate more than 90 was reported in the mbr system 87 88 while different removal rates were observed in the case of the cas system for instance celiz et al 87 and radjenovic et al 88 showed a low removal rate less than 28 a medium removal rate 50 88 and a high removal rate more than 85 was reported in serrano et al 86 on the other hand high removal rates of npx were reported in other mbr comparative studies more than 90 79 84 88 89 and cas more than 70 84 88 finally a high ktp removal rate was reported in previous mbr studies more than 90 79 88 89 while a medium removal of ktp was previously reported in the cas system 50 84 88 taking all these studies into account a decision tree based on the influence of the technology criterion c4 has been designed fig 4 2 3 4 2 application of the fuzzy topsis method once the set of criteria for each of the decision matrices has been selected the topsis method provides an evaluation of the effect caused by each alternative in all the criteria it is worth mentioning that this mcdm approach becomes especially suitable whenever the values of the criteria for each alternative are not described in terms of the same units as in this case in summary for our case study linguistic labels are used for criterion c4 numerical values for criteria c1 and c3 and triangular fuzzy numbers for criteria c2 c5 c6 and c7 tables a1 and a2 in appendix a due to that fact all the steps of the fuzzy version of the topsis method are applied for each of the decision matrices it is worth mentioning that the topsis methodology allows to assign a weight or coefficient of importance for each criterion such weights can be obtained by applying other mcdm methodologies such as the fuzzy ahp approach through the extraction of knowledge from a group of experts however following the recommendations of the stakeholders and with the aim of analyzing the influence of each of the parameters involved criteria and not adding more subjectivity to the proposed case study we start from the basis that all criteria have an influence in the assessment process of equal importance from the point of view of phac removal in wwtps 3 results and discussion the selection criteria have been evaluated with the aim of increasing food safety as well as considering the challenges currently being worked on such as adaptation to the new european legislation on water reuse which will require major remodeling of facilities and new demands regarding the way of operating the wwtps the relationship with the users of reclaimed water and the costs that such adaptations will entail the results of the multi criteria problem enabled the identification of the most influential criteria for eliminating each phac as well as their importance when designing wwtps the removal efficiencies for the four phac studied are described in the following subsections 3 1 evaluating the removal efficiency for the phac studied two different ways of quantifying of technologies mbr cas have been studied for four phac and according to the ranking topsis and relative closeness i 1 3 1 2 r i of wwtp based on phac removal efficiency 3 1 1 evaluating the removal efficiency for cbz the three most efficient removal cases or wwtps for cbz were 11 9 and 10 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 5 and table a3 of the appendix analyzing the influence of the technology criterion for cbz it is observed that c4 slightly influences the classification of the alternatives fig 5a and b showed an exchange of positions between the alternatives in cases 6 and 8 the order of priority of the criteria according to the topsis score observing the ideal values can be seen in tables a1 and a2 as can be seen the most influential criteria to eliminate cbz were c1 c2 and c3 since they correspond to the three best positioned alternatives wwtp 3 1 2 evaluating the removal efficiency for dcf the topsis score of the ideal values in dcf is of particular interest and complexity as shown in fig 6 and table 3 of the appendix we studied the ranking topsis of wwtps based on dcf removal efficiency in three cases depending on the ways of quantifying the criterion c4 the three most efficient removal cases for dcf in the first and second ways of quantifying the technologies studied a mbr high cas high and b mbr high cas medium were 11 9 and 10 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 6a and b whilst the three most efficient removal cases for dcf in the third way c mbr high cas low were 6 7 and 11 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 6c as can be seen in tables a1 and a2 the most influential criteria to eliminate dcf according to the topsis score in the cases of the first and second ways were c1 c2 and c3 since they correspond to the three best positioned alternatives wwtps however the influential criteria differ when the difference between the technology criterion increases mbr high cas low in that case the technology criterion c4 began to gain relevance and the second factor in order of importance was the temperature criterion c2 see tables a1 and a2 and fig 6b 3 1 3 evaluating the removal efficiency for npx for npx the way of quantifying the criterion c4 is the same as the first way a of the analysis of the removal efficiency of cbz with that the three most efficient removal cases of npx were 11 9 and 10 with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 7 and table 3 of the appendix on the other hand case 5 showed the scenario of the wwtps with the worst removal efficiency in npx and the last ranking position likewise the most influential criteria to eliminate npx are c1 c2 and c3 3 1 4 evaluating the removal efficiency for ktp for the alternative of the technology studied mbr high cas medium the information in cases 11 9 and 10 showed the first ranking positions in the removal efficiency of ktp with ranking positions 1 2 and 3 respectively fig 8 however case 5 is the scenario of the wwtps with the worst removal efficiency in ktp with the last ranking position as the behavior shown in the other phac as can be seen in tables a1 and a2 the most influential criteria to eliminate ktp according to the topsis score are c1 c2 and c3 3 2 relevance of the criteria considered in the topsis method in the design of wwtps with low environmental risk this method has characterized and identified the most important criteria for phac removal and enables the utilization of these environmentally friendly wastewaters it has been observed that the criterion c1 hrt is one of the criteria that most influences the elimination of the studied phac most of the wwtps in the region of murcia have controlled the contact time between activated sludge and organic compounds 81 therefore hrt is a relatively straight forward parameter to adapt without requiring major modifications or changes in the design of the wwtp the criterion c2 average annual temperature was also observed to be instrumental its influence in areas where the temperature is higher is typically associated with a water deficit requiring the reuse of the water from the wwtp to compensate for the area s lack of water in uses as varied as agriculture landscaping industry 90 the criterion c3 treatment capacity is another criterion to take into account in the design of wwtps given its influence on phac elimination it is linked to large population settlements where higher concentrations of phac are detected in the influents of wwtps coming from the big cities and the hospitals located therein the criterion c4 wwtp technology has not been categorized as being of great importance in the elimination of the studied phac thus revealing that the technologies studied cas and mbr are efficient in their design for phac elimination so it is not necessary to make significant adaptations or changes in the technologies studied which would represent a high economic cost it is important to highlight that this study has been carried out in accordance with the phac data of effluents from selected wwtps which are working with primary secondary and tertiary treatments although some authors have researched advanced treatments such as through the use of ozone or activated carbon to eliminate organic micropollutants 91 92 none of the wwtps selected for this study were employing those advanced treatment processes finally it should be commented that the criteria c5 tss efficiency c6 cod efficiency and c7 bod efficiency have not shown great relevance in their influence on the extraction of the phac studied with respect to the other criteria studied these results provide useful data to justify decisions by using multiple criteria when designing wwtps and providing end users politicians legislators engineers operators with a tool to explore hypothetical scenarios and examine the response surface to improve coherence and quality of the decisions regarding the removal of phac in wastewater 4 conclusions the design of wwtps to removal phac promote circular bio economy for better environmental management and should not be carried out following a one dimensional approach but according to a multi criteria methodology able to take the complexity of the issue addressed into account in this paper we contribute the first known fuzzy topsis application to analyze two technologies mbr and cas through the assessment of 11 alternatives wwtps based on the removal of four phac and a set of seven criteria the resolution of the multi criteria problem classified the most efficient wwtps cases 11 9 and 10 in the removal of the majority of the phac studied in the evaluation of the removal efficiency of phac the most relevant criteria were criteria c1 hydraulic retention time c2 annual mean temperature and c3 treatment capacity while criteria c4 technology c5 tss efficiency c6 cod efficiency and c7 bod efficiency showed less relevance than c1 c2 and c3 indicating that the criterion technology c4 was not so important for the possibility of reusing wastewater this ranking can be used to provide decision support in the environmental assessment of eco technologies and show how different decision options can be compared in relative terms based on a set of criteria this study demonstrates the compensatory nature and versatility of fuzzy mcdm methods since not only does it allow to combine various criteria which are included in the evaluation but also these criteria can be of different natures with qualitative criteria coexisting with quantitative criteria that on certain occasions are difficult to quantify the results of the multi criteria problem allowed the identification of the most influential criteria to eliminate phac and their importance in the design of the wwtps with clean technologies that promote the circular economy thus ensuring the correct use of wastewater further studies are required to evaluate other phac and technologies to quantify the relevance of the criteria involved in the phac removal efficiency in the scenarios of wwtps moreover to extend this work a further study regarding other mcdm methodologies such as fuzzy promethee or vikor may be carried out declaration of competing

13412,to deal with the contamination of the water environment which represents an arena for microorganisms and antibiotics a photocatalytic process has been proposed due to its high efficiency and non toxicity this review discusses and investigates antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb removal and inactivation with their associated genes through photocatalysis technique as an efficient and ecofriendly advanced oxidation process aop photocatalysis the paper summarizes recent studies that dealt with both pollutants and their process parameters optimal operating conditions used semiconductor photocatalysts and their corresponding removal efficiency thus it suggests that photocatalysis can offer impressive treatment efficiencies for both organic and microbial pollutants simultaneously the review also states that both antibiotics and bacteria have a destroying effect against each other where antibiotics have antimicrobial activity and bacteria have microbial degradation this phenomenon creates a hybrid system for each pollutant photocatalysis bacteria photocatalysis antibiotic bacteria antibiotic which accelerates the purification and disinfection of the polluted water caused by pathogens and hazardous pollutants using green and safe technology moreover the reaction mechanism was detailed in order to define the role of reactive oxygen species ros likewise photocatalysis coupling with other aop techniques in this context was discussed to achieve more promising results the main contribution of this review is to explain the relationship between antibiotics microbial contaminants and photocatalysis it also introduces a new area of study and concludes with an outlook on future research topics such as viral disinfection keywords photocatalysis disinfection antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria wastewater 1 context of water pollution water is our planet s most crucial natural resource 1 it is essential for all organisms in our lives it covers about 71 of the earth s surface where 2 5 are classified as freshwater 2 including a rare amount of 0 002 considered as humanly accessible 3 the rarity of this resource is further intensified with the increasing demand related to the natural changes endured by the globe or the consumptions linked to human needs activities 1 4 11 among the highest water consuming sectors industries have grown and developed within much of the world and the emerging chemical industry has synthesized a multitude of previously unknown chemical products 12 within this rapid development in science and technology and with the new industrial processes and synthetic products continuously being developed 13 more and more contaminants are being produced and discharged into the environment 1 the number of these contaminants and their concentrations in the water are growing continuously 14 earth s freshwater is continually polluted with different chemicals such as pharmaceutical compounds 15 adding water to a mixture of drug trace amounts is potentially a crucial emerging problem and is engineered to exhibit potent physiological activity 4 many pharmaceuticals are not substantially absorbed into the subsoil due to their polar structure then contaminants may be transferred from the contaminated watercourses into groundwater aquifers 4 16 urban wastewater is also considered a substantial cause of water pollution 16 it is vulnerable to contamination due to its too high pollution levels and relatively low self purification capacity 17 as a result water pollution in urban rivers in many countries is becoming a major environmental issue the contamination of the water presents potential risks to both human health and the environment it has direct and indirect damage to the health of all organisms 18 19 polluted water is the primary cause of infectious diseases e g malaria and cholera amoebiasis paratyphoid fever dysentery 3 epidemics from contagious agents in potable water have already developed in most countries waterborne pathogens are now well handled using disinfectant agents regrettably the control of occurrence in the wastewater of the potentially hazardous chemicals constitutes a very challenging job from the applied perspective the regulation of water pollution and the improvement of sustainable water purification technologies are therefore necessary solutions the adoption of safe technological processes and the water reuse for various industrial activities are core issues for our society intending to maintain water supplies 1 5 21 this problem has received much attention in recent years and initiated many research efforts political and legal activities 20 and that attention appears to be increasing environmentalists worldwide have named the pharmaceuticals emerging contaminants ecs of the environment 21 moreover antibiotics are a significant concern for researchers worldwide compared to other drug compounds groups as they are toxic and non biodegradable 22 2 antibiotics antibiotics are either natural or human made substances that can destroy or prevent bacteria from developing 23 they are widely used for the sake of the rescue of many lives to avoid and cure infectious diseases and pathogens they have substantial physical and chemical properties which make it hard to remove the aquatic environment as their existence may increase aquatic toxicity 24 25 they are the primary concern and hazards in pharmaceutical products because they are extensively applied and have negative impacts on useful and nontarget microbiota of the biological system 26 27 their association with growing and rapidly growing antibiotic resistance make them one of the three most important threats to the world health organization who 28 30 furthermore antibiotics can cause many genetic effects in humans for example allergic reactions 31 an analytical study of observational data evaluating the antibiotics use over the 15 years in 76 countries showed a 65 rise between 2010 and 2015 32 it can also increase globally and nearly double in south africa russia china brazil and india between 2010 and 2030 33 annual use of about 100 000 200 000 tons of antibiotics worldwide has been recorded 34 hospitals are known as primary antibiotic distribution sources in municipal urban treatment units of wastewater 30 data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc found that 55 7 of patients received antibiotics 34 at the same time they stay in hospitals from 325 hospitals in 2010 and 37 2 of those antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary or could be changed which is consistent with previous literature research on the use of antibiotics in acute care hospitals for that the cdc has initiated many health promotion programs to target antibiotic resistance 35 antibiotics are commonly used in the treatment of bacterial infections in both humans and animals these are used in livestock processing fish farming additives and poultry industries as growth promoters 36 they are also used to improve the quality of feed 37 because of their chemical composition the commonly used antibiotics can be categorized into six kinds β lactams quinolones tetracyclines aminoglycosides macrolides and sulfates 38 41 most of these substances are poorly absorbed mainly 80 90 of the antibiotic is excreted into the water by wastewater effluent 41 as shown in fig 1 the extensive utilization of medical and veterinary antibiotics has resulted in the widespread occurrence of traces of these highly stable compounds in natural aquatic habitats all over the world including rivers 42 44 lakes 40 43 44 groundwater 45 46 49 seawater 40 41 and drinking water 30 47 these traces have been proved difficult to be removed by conventional drainage systems 50 due to the continuous discharge of wastewater antibiotics usually occur in the surface water as mixtures at various concentrations from a few ng l to a high μg l 51 52 3 photocatalytic removal of antibiotics since the late 20th century studies have been published on sources incidents fate and dangers of antibiotics in aquatic environments these papers typically gave a regional viewpoint summed up worldwide studies data and exposed the lack of knowledge regarding antibiotics toxicological effects in ecosystems example 30 47 52 62 however some studies introduced a critical review on removing antibiotics from polluted waters through various treatment methods 63 73 the conventional approaches can not remove antibiotic residues in polluted waters effectively 74 76 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes aops have shown promising results and proved a suitable solution for quick deterioration of recalcitrant and non biodegradable substances in water such as antibiotics the photocatalytic reduction is one of the best approaches it is now widely considered a viable alternative for traditional chemical reduction 77 78 it can efficiently mineralize a significant number of pollutants to comparatively non toxic final products such as water h2o and carbon dioxide co2 79 based on our previous studies 51 52 80 photocatalysis has been used to remove various types of drugs and exactly antibiotics in polluted water table 1 summarizes a list of bibliographical references on photocatalytic processes studies for the removal of antibiotics from water we note from this table that there is a difference between each catalyst in its photocatalytic performance due to the photocatalytic experiment condition first and secondly and the most significantly the bandgap that plays a significant role in the photocatalytic activity the bandgap changes from one catalyst to another because it is related to the color of the catalyst and also to the elements that make it up this difference can be explained through the mechanism where the semiconductor can be quickly excited by light illumination which absorbs photons with energy greater than or equal to its bandgap energy and then be excited to produce electron hole pairs e and h 22 after that the e on the conduction band cb will react with o 2 on the semiconductor s surface to produce o 2 radicals by a reduction process after that by protonation it yields hydroperoxyl radical h 2 o 15 these radicals then merge with the trapped electrons and produce hydrogen peroxide h 2 o 2 and hydroxide radicals o h the o h radicals are strong oxidants and the principals active species oxygen ros in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants which could be generated from both the reaction of the photo generated valence band holes with either water h 2 o or hydroxyl ions o h adsorbed on the catalyst surface 90 under this condition it is possible that h constitutes a percentage of o h radicals so h is an assistant in organic pollutants degradation 86 the following relations can describe the process that leads to the generation of electron hole pairs and active radicle species with the degradation of organic pollutants 1 c a t a l y s t h υ c a t a l y s t e h 2 h 2 o h o h h 3 o 2 e o 2 4 e 2 h h 2 o h 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 e o h e o h 6 o r g a n i c p o l l u t a n t s o 2 o h c o 2 h 2 o o t h e r s m a l l p r o d u c t s fig 2 shows a schematic diagram for the proposed mechanism of antibiotics as organic pollutants it illustrates a possible reaction with ros on a photocatalytic surface with pollutants absorbed 4 bacteria and superbugs there is a direct correlation between an antibiotic distribution and resistance development the ubiquitous spread of antibiotics makes resistance a survival condition for bacteria making resistant bacteria selected for growth and propagation 91 even at low concentrations their presence can improve the resistance to bacteria 32 giving place to antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 92 these microorganisms became more known as multi drug resistant mdr or more commonly superbugs 93 arb can be produced using cell expression of antibiotic resistance genes args synthesizing the corresponding antibiotic resistant protein 94 an example of superbugs the salmonella strain which infects roughly 21 6 million people worldwide 95 it can survive to a large variety of antibiotics including ampicillin and aztreonam cefoxitin ceftriaxone cephalothin chloramphenicol gentamicin kanamycin sulfamethoxazole streptomycin tetracycline and tobramycin 91 92 bacteria mutate more than the production of new antibiotics 98 this phenomenon caused a drastic environmental change a toxic shock to the bacterial world 92 in the case of disease combining antibiotics is used for controlling abr which is the most significant danger that threatens modern medicine 99 both bacteria and viruses are responsible for some of the deadliest diseases in history 100 bacteria that are antibiotic resistant with their genes represent one of the most severe and intense challenges of the twenty first century 101 they are well known easy to get hard to lose pollutants 102 they can easily be transmitted to humans and animals through the horizontal transmission of genes in a water environment that poses a significant risk 103 actually a conservative estimate by the cdc indicates that antibiotic resistance more than two million people in the us get sick from antimicrobial resistant causes 700 000 deaths globally each year 104 a study 105 suggests that the world s foremost cause of death will be antibiotic resistant infections in 2050 the most common disease caused by abr are mycobacterium tuberculosis infections approximately two billion people are infected with the bacterium that causes this disease 97 strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were recently resistant to third generation carbapenems they lead to several untreatable gonorrhoea infections in the uk 106 staphylococcus aureus causes a range of body infections including boils injury infections toxic shock syndrome cellulite abscesses pneumonia and food poisoning 107 bacteria of streptococcal disease cause many different body infections including meningitis ear infections pneumonia and strep throat 93 mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is a gram positive bacteria of the family firmicutes 108 it is the most well known of the superbugs which caused 72 444 invasive infections in the united states and 9194 deaths in 2014 107 superbugs resistance to drugs may also be based on mutation or the development of resistance genes from other bacteria 93 since antibiotics are widely used our bodies no longer rely on our immune systems any longer making us unable to deal with new bacteria 5 photocatalysis inactivation of bacteria in water despite attempts to develop new antibiotics antibacterial resistance is still growing too rapidly to keep up with drug development however advanced oxidation processes aops have provided an acceptable rate of bacterial inactivation aops are safer and natural technology for water disinfection unlike conventional water disinfection methods like chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation 109 they have many disadvantages as they present high investments maintenance costs large consumption of chemical reagents and environmental problems created by disposal of the waste effluent after treatment indeed the chlorination process leads to the development of carcinogenic by products such as trihalomethanes thm 110 for ultraviolet irradiation many microorganisms can resist it for ozonation the cost and security concerns restrict its use in practice 109 using these methods can also lead to developing very undesirable and toxic disinfection by products 111 among the different aops photocatalysis has become a safe and successful green photochemical mechanism 112 it has long been used to combat pathogenic bacteria 113 several papers verified that the bacterial envelope is the primary target of the photocatalysis process leading to membrane permeability modifications and cell death 114 116 the photocatalytic process can also use for the inactivation of viruses 111 112 semiconductors like tio2 are known to generate microbicidal reactive oxygen species in the presence of light 117 in 1985 118 identified the first microbicidal activity study on tio2 photocatalysis over the last two decades there have been many appealing photocatalytic applications for drinking water disinfection 119 in which process lead to the antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivation table 2 summarizes a list of bibliographical references on photocatalytic studies for the inactivation of arb in water we can conclude from the results of the table that the catalysts have a great ability to inactivate bacteria of all kinds in the water this makes them a suitable solution to get rid of those harmful organisms this mechanism can be explained in fig 3 which illustrated a proposed disinfection mechanism of the photocatalyst as already discussed in the photodegradation part that when the light of suitable wavelength is irradiated on the catalyst the conduction band cb and valence band vb of this photocatalyst tend to bend and a depletion layer is formed around the interface making e in the vb excited to move to cb simultaneously produced the same amount of h in the vb the electron hole pairs e and h can interact with h o 2 and o h e to create o h while o 2 generate o 2 by electron accepting with o 2 h to form h 2 o 2 and o h ros o h o 2 h h 2 o 2 and o 2 can produce high oxidative stress and interact strongly with bacterial cells and kill them by degrading the cell wall and several types of bacterial cell contents like protein lipids carbohydrate dna and amino acids 129 moreover photocatalyst molecules can interact with bacterial cells by depositing them on the surface through the mechanism of cellular proliferation and endocytosis resulting in the destruction of membrane proteins or cell membranes through the phenomenon of organ permeability both semiconductor particles and ros can disturb the transport of electrons in the cell loss of protein motive force depletion of intracellular atp production with dna replication disintegration and intracellular outflow resulting in cell death 124 the following relations can describe this process 7 c a t a l y s t h υ c a t a l y s t e h 8 h 2 o h o h h 9 o 2 e o 2 10 e 2 h h

v a t i o n 6 photocatalysis for simultaneous removals of antibiotics and inactivation of antimicrobial resistance based on the above results and the observations which showed that photocatalysis could make different antibiotics oxidized and different bacteria and micro organisms inactive in which the procedure eliminates both biohazard and chemical contaminants simultaneously from wastewater systems this procedure accomplishes two goals through a single green and safe method that uses solar energy and does not contain harmful by products to the environment hence it makes photocatalysis an effective and assertive approach to treating water from the two most toxic types of toxic pollutants antibiotics and microbial biological hazards for that photocatalysis fulfills future desires for water purification with less cost and more minor damage to the environment one of the world s challenges table 3 summarizes a list of bibliographical references on photocatalytic processes for degradation of the antibiotic and inactivating arb simultaneously in water photocatalysis is based on the irradiation of semiconductor particles by photons of energy hν equals or exceeds the semiconductor bandgap promoting an electron transition from the filled valence band vb of the photocatalyst to the empty conducting band cb the effect is that a positive hole is left behind in the valence and a negative electron in the conduction line thus forming electron hole pairs e and h 136 137 the photo generated holes and electrons trapped on the semiconductor surface oxidize the oh or water to initiate highly reactive oxygen species ros the superoxide radical anion o2 hydroperoxide radical ho2 and hydroxyl radical oh they are the primary oxidizing agents that act as extremely powerful potent oxidants of organic pollutants because they can destroy the bonds of stable and unreactive organic molecules to form organic intermediates that can be further degraded into co2 and h2o 132 on the other hand they can damage microorganisms without further adding chemical oxidants by attacking and breaking the cell wall making microorganisms become inactive or dead and denature proteins finally resulting in various end products 119 both mechanism photodegradation of organic pollutants and bacterial inactivation is illustrated in fig 4 furthermore eqs 13 to 17 suggest the

both antibiotics and bacteria arg 34 however the result was insufficient to show the extent of benefiting and explaining this process s advantage the reason is due to the following notes firstly there are not enough studies in this regard just a few research papers are taking this subject however most studies consider escherichia coli to be a model of bacteria leaving the effect of other bacteria unknown secondly most researches deal with antibiotics and microbial contaminants separately to simplify the analytic methods nevertheless the most critical part of the study is neglected which is the interaction between antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria this interaction can cause significant variation in the efficiency of removing hazardous substances because it creates a hybrid system with the photocatalytic process and improves its activity generally it is well known that antibiotic is used as a weapon to treat bacterial infections because they have antimicrobial activity they either stop bacteria from reproducing or destroy them disinfection 138 conversely bacteria that become resistant to different antibiotics play a significant role in the microbial degradation of those antibiotics 139 through developing their mechanism of action they can produce corresponding degradation enzymes which degrades by modification or hydrolysis of the molecular structure of antibiotics 140 that makes the environment an arena for both antibiotics and bacteria to act against each other by entering an assistant to solve the problem which is the photocatalyst or the semiconductor this

13412,to deal with the contamination of the water environment which represents an arena for microorganisms and antibiotics a photocatalytic process has been proposed due to its high efficiency and non toxicity this review discusses and investigates antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria arb removal and inactivation with their associated genes through photocatalysis technique as an efficient and ecofriendly advanced oxidation process aop photocatalysis the paper summarizes recent studies that dealt with both pollutants and their process parameters optimal operating conditions used semiconductor photocatalysts and their corresponding removal efficiency thus it suggests that photocatalysis can offer impressive treatment efficiencies for both organic and microbial pollutants simultaneously the review also states that both antibiotics and bacteria have a destroying effect against each other where antibiotics have antimicrobial activity and bacteria have microbial degradation this phenomenon creates a hybrid system for each pollutant photocatalysis bacteria photocatalysis antibiotic bacteria antibiotic which accelerates the purification and disinfection of the polluted water caused by pathogens and hazardous pollutants using green and safe technology moreover the reaction mechanism was detailed in order to define the role of reactive oxygen species ros likewise photocatalysis coupling with other aop techniques in this context was discussed to achieve more promising results the main contribution of this review is to explain the relationship between antibiotics microbial contaminants and photocatalysis it also introduces a new area of study and concludes with an outlook on future research topics such as viral disinfection keywords photocatalysis disinfection antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria wastewater 1 context of water pollution water is our planet s most crucial natural resource 1 it is essential for all organisms in our lives it covers about 71 of the earth s surface where 2 5 are classified as freshwater 2 including a rare amount of 0 002 considered as humanly accessible 3 the rarity of this resource is further intensified with the increasing demand related to the natural changes endured by the globe or the consumptions linked to human needs activities 1 4 11 among the highest water consuming sectors industries have grown and developed within much of the world and the emerging chemical industry has synthesized a multitude of previously unknown chemical products 12 within this rapid development in science and technology and with the new industrial processes and synthetic products continuously being developed 13 more and more contaminants are being produced and discharged into the environment 1 the number of these contaminants and their concentrations in the water are growing continuously 14 earth s freshwater is continually polluted with different chemicals such as pharmaceutical compounds 15 adding water to a mixture of drug trace amounts is potentially a crucial emerging problem and is engineered to exhibit potent physiological activity 4 many pharmaceuticals are not substantially absorbed into the subsoil due to their polar structure then contaminants may be transferred from the contaminated watercourses into groundwater aquifers 4 16 urban wastewater is also considered a substantial cause of water pollution 16 it is vulnerable to contamination due to its too high pollution levels and relatively low self purification capacity 17 as a result water pollution in urban rivers in many countries is becoming a major environmental issue the contamination of the water presents potential risks to both human health and the environment it has direct and indirect damage to the health of all organisms 18 19 polluted water is the primary cause of infectious diseases e g malaria and cholera amoebiasis paratyphoid fever dysentery 3 epidemics from contagious agents in potable water have already developed in most countries waterborne pathogens are now well handled using disinfectant agents regrettably the control of occurrence in the wastewater of the potentially hazardous chemicals constitutes a very challenging job from the applied perspective the regulation of water pollution and the improvement of sustainable water purification technologies are therefore necessary solutions the adoption of safe technological processes and the water reuse for various industrial activities are core issues for our society intending to maintain water supplies 1 5 21 this problem has received much attention in recent years and initiated many research efforts political and legal activities 20 and that attention appears to be increasing environmentalists worldwide have named the pharmaceuticals emerging contaminants ecs of the environment 21 moreover antibiotics are a significant concern for researchers worldwide compared to other drug compounds groups as they are toxic and non biodegradable 22 2 antibiotics antibiotics are either natural or human made substances that can destroy or prevent bacteria from developing 23 they are widely used for the sake of the rescue of many lives to avoid and cure infectious diseases and pathogens they have substantial physical and chemical properties which make it hard to remove the aquatic environment as their existence may increase aquatic toxicity 24 25 they are the primary concern and hazards in pharmaceutical products because they are extensively applied and have negative impacts on useful and nontarget microbiota of the biological system 26 27 their association with growing and rapidly growing antibiotic resistance make them one of the three most important threats to the world health organization who 28 30 furthermore antibiotics can cause many genetic effects in humans for example allergic reactions 31 an analytical study of observational data evaluating the antibiotics use over the 15 years in 76 countries showed a 65 rise between 2010 and 2015 32 it can also increase globally and nearly double in south africa russia china brazil and india between 2010 and 2030 33 annual use of about 100 000 200 000 tons of antibiotics worldwide has been recorded 34 hospitals are known as primary antibiotic distribution sources in municipal urban treatment units of wastewater 30 data from the centers for disease control and prevention cdc found that 55 7 of patients received antibiotics 34 at the same time they stay in hospitals from 325 hospitals in 2010 and 37 2 of those antibiotic prescriptions were unnecessary or could be changed which is consistent with previous literature research on the use of antibiotics in acute care hospitals for that the cdc has initiated many health promotion programs to target antibiotic resistance 35 antibiotics are commonly used in the treatment of bacterial infections in both humans and animals these are used in livestock processing fish farming additives and poultry industries as growth promoters 36 they are also used to improve the quality of feed 37 because of their chemical composition the commonly used antibiotics can be categorized into six kinds β lactams quinolones tetracyclines aminoglycosides macrolides and sulfates 38 41 most of these substances are poorly absorbed mainly 80 90 of the antibiotic is excreted into the water by wastewater effluent 41 as shown in fig 1 the extensive utilization of medical and veterinary antibiotics has resulted in the widespread occurrence of traces of these highly stable compounds in natural aquatic habitats all over the world including rivers 42 44 lakes 40 43 44 groundwater 45 46 49 seawater 40 41 and drinking water 30 47 these traces have been proved difficult to be removed by conventional drainage systems 50 due to the continuous discharge of wastewater antibiotics usually occur in the surface water as mixtures at various concentrations from a few ng l to a high μg l 51 52 3 photocatalytic removal of antibiotics since the late 20th century studies have been published on sources incidents fate and dangers of antibiotics in aquatic environments these papers typically gave a regional viewpoint summed up worldwide studies data and exposed the lack of knowledge regarding antibiotics toxicological effects in ecosystems example 30 47 52 62 however some studies introduced a critical review on removing antibiotics from polluted waters through various treatment methods 63 73 the conventional approaches can not remove antibiotic residues in polluted waters effectively 74 76 on the other hand advanced oxidation processes aops have shown promising results and proved a suitable solution for quick deterioration of recalcitrant and non biodegradable substances in water such as antibiotics the photocatalytic reduction is one of the best approaches it is now widely considered a viable alternative for traditional chemical reduction 77 78 it can efficiently mineralize a significant number of pollutants to comparatively non toxic final products such as water h2o and carbon dioxide co2 79 based on our previous studies 51 52 80 photocatalysis has been used to remove various types of drugs and exactly antibiotics in polluted water table 1 summarizes a list of bibliographical references on photocatalytic processes studies for the removal of antibiotics from water we note from this table that there is a difference between each catalyst in its photocatalytic performance due to the photocatalytic experiment condition first and secondly and the most significantly the bandgap that plays a significant role in the photocatalytic activity the bandgap changes from one catalyst to another because it is related to the color of the catalyst and also to the elements that make it up this difference can be explained through the mechanism where the semiconductor can be quickly excited by light illumination which absorbs photons with energy greater than or equal to its bandgap energy and then be excited to produce electron hole pairs e and h 22 after that the e on the conduction band cb will react with o 2 on the semiconductor s surface to produce o 2 radicals by a reduction process after that by protonation it yields hydroperoxyl radical h 2 o 15 these radicals then merge with the trapped electrons and produce hydrogen peroxide h 2 o 2 and hydroxide radicals o h the o h radicals are strong oxidants and the principals active species oxygen ros in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants which could be generated from both the reaction of the photo generated valence band holes with either water h 2 o or hydroxyl ions o h adsorbed on the catalyst surface 90 under this condition it is possible that h constitutes a percentage of o h radicals so h is an assistant in organic pollutants degradation 86 the following relations can describe the process that leads to the generation of electron hole pairs and active radicle species with the degradation of organic pollutants 1 c a t a l y s t h υ c a t a l y s t e h 2 h 2 o h o h h 3 o 2 e o 2 4 e 2 h h 2 o h 2 o 2 5 h 2 o 2 e o h e o h 6 o r g a n i c p o l l u t a n t s o 2 o h c o 2 h 2 o o t h e r s m a l l p r o d u c t s fig 2 shows a schematic diagram for the proposed mechanism of antibiotics as organic pollutants it illustrates a possible reaction with ros on a photocatalytic surface with pollutants absorbed 4 bacteria and superbugs there is a direct correlation between an antibiotic distribution and resistance development the ubiquitous spread of antibiotics makes resistance a survival condition for bacteria making resistant bacteria selected for growth and propagation 91 even at low concentrations their presence can improve the resistance to bacteria 32 giving place to antibiotic resistant bacteria arb 92 these microorganisms became more known as multi drug resistant mdr or more commonly superbugs 93 arb can be produced using cell expression of antibiotic resistance genes args synthesizing the corresponding antibiotic resistant protein 94 an example of superbugs the salmonella strain which infects roughly 21 6 million people worldwide 95 it can survive to a large variety of antibiotics including ampicillin and aztreonam cefoxitin ceftriaxone cephalothin chloramphenicol gentamicin kanamycin sulfamethoxazole streptomycin tetracycline and tobramycin 91 92 bacteria mutate more than the production of new antibiotics 98 this phenomenon caused a drastic environmental change a toxic shock to the bacterial world 92 in the case of disease combining antibiotics is used for controlling abr which is the most significant danger that threatens modern medicine 99 both bacteria and viruses are responsible for some of the deadliest diseases in history 100 bacteria that are antibiotic resistant with their genes represent one of the most severe and intense challenges of the twenty first century 101 they are well known easy to get hard to lose pollutants 102 they can easily be transmitted to humans and animals through the horizontal transmission of genes in a water environment that poses a significant risk 103 actually a conservative estimate by the cdc indicates that antibiotic resistance more than two million people in the us get sick from antimicrobial resistant causes 700 000 deaths globally each year 104 a study 105 suggests that the world s foremost cause of death will be antibiotic resistant infections in 2050 the most common disease caused by abr are mycobacterium tuberculosis infections approximately two billion people are infected with the bacterium that causes this disease 97 strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were recently resistant to third generation carbapenems they lead to several untreatable gonorrhoea infections in the uk 106 staphylococcus aureus causes a range of body infections including boils injury infections toxic shock syndrome cellulite abscesses pneumonia and food poisoning 107 bacteria of streptococcal disease cause many different body infections including meningitis ear infections pneumonia and strep throat 93 mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is a gram positive bacteria of the family firmicutes 108 it is the most well known of the superbugs which caused 72 444 invasive infections in the united states and 9194 deaths in 2014 107 superbugs resistance to drugs may also be based on mutation or the development of resistance genes from other bacteria 93 since antibiotics are widely used our bodies no longer rely on our immune systems any longer making us unable to deal with new bacteria 5 photocatalysis inactivation of bacteria in water despite attempts to develop new antibiotics antibacterial resistance is still growing too rapidly to keep up with drug development however advanced oxidation processes aops have provided an acceptable rate of bacterial inactivation aops are safer and natural technology for water disinfection unlike conventional water disinfection methods like chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation 109 they have many disadvantages as they present high investments maintenance costs large consumption of chemical reagents and environmental problems created by disposal of the waste effluent after treatment indeed the chlorination process leads to the development of carcinogenic by products such as trihalomethanes thm 110 for ultraviolet irradiation many microorganisms can resist it for ozonation the cost and security concerns restrict its use in practice 109 using these methods can also lead to developing very undesirable and toxic disinfection by products 111 among the different aops photocatalysis has become a safe and successful green photochemical mechanism 112 it has long been used to combat pathogenic bacteria 113 several papers verified that the bacterial envelope is the primary target of the photocatalysis process leading to membrane permeability modifications and cell death 114 116 the photocatalytic process can also use for the inactivation of viruses 111 112 semiconductors like tio2 are known to generate microbicidal reactive oxygen species in the presence of light 117 in 1985 118 identified the first microbicidal activity study on tio2 photocatalysis over the last two decades there have been many appealing photocatalytic applications for drinking water disinfection 119 in which process lead to the antibiotic resistant bacteria inactivation table 2 summarizes a list of bibliographical references on photocatalytic studies for the inactivation of arb in water we can conclude from the results of the table that the catalysts have a great ability to inactivate bacteria of all kinds in the water this makes them a suitable solution to get rid of those harmful organisms this mechanism can be explained in fig 3 which illustrated a proposed disinfection mechanism of the photocatalyst as already discussed in the photodegradation part that when the light of suitable wavelength is irradiated on the catalyst the conduction band cb and valence band vb of this photocatalyst tend to bend and a depletion layer is formed around the interface making e in the vb excited to move to cb simultaneously produced the same amount of h in the vb the electron hole pairs e and h can interact with h o 2 and o h e to create o h while o 2 generate o 2 by electron accepting with o 2 h to form h 2 o 2 and o h ros o h o 2 h h 2 o 2 and o 2 can produce high oxidative stress and interact strongly with bacterial cells and kill them by degrading the cell wall and several types of bacterial cell contents like protein lipids carbohydrate dna and amino acids 129 moreover photocatalyst molecules can interact with bacterial cells by depositing them on the surface through the mechanism of cellular proliferation and endocytosis resulting in the destruction of membrane proteins or cell membranes through the phenomenon of organ permeability both semiconductor particles and ros can disturb the transport of electrons in the cell loss of protein motive force depletion of intracellular atp production with dna replication disintegration and intracellular outflow resulting in cell death 124 the following relations can describe this process 7 c a t a l y s t h υ c a t a l y s t e h 8 h 2 o h o h h 9 o 2 e o 2 10 e 2 h h

v a t i o n 6 photocatalysis for simultaneous removals of antibiotics and inactivation of antimicrobial resistance based on the above results and the observations which showed that photocatalysis could make different antibiotics oxidized and different bacteria and micro organisms inactive in which the procedure eliminates both biohazard and chemical contaminants simultaneously from wastewater systems this procedure accomplishes two goals through a single green and safe method that uses solar energy and does not contain harmful by products to the environment hence it makes photocatalysis an effective and assertive approach to treating water from the two most toxic types of toxic pollutants antibiotics and microbial biological hazards for that photocatalysis fulfills future desires for water purification with less cost and more minor damage to the environment one of the world s challenges table 3 summarizes a list of bibliographical references on photocatalytic processes for degradation of the antibiotic and inactivating arb simultaneously in water photocatalysis is based on the irradiation of semiconductor particles by photons of energy hν equals or exceeds the semiconductor bandgap promoting an electron transition from the filled valence band vb of the photocatalyst to the empty conducting band cb the effect is that a positive hole is left behind in the valence and a negative electron in the conduction line thus forming electron hole pairs e and h 136 137 the photo generated holes and electrons trapped on the semiconductor surface oxidize the oh or water to initiate highly reactive oxygen species ros the superoxide radical anion o2 hydroperoxide radical ho2 and hydroxyl radical oh they are the primary oxidizing agents that act as extremely powerful potent oxidants of organic pollutants because they can destroy the bonds of stable and unreactive organic molecules to form organic intermediates that can be further degraded into co2 and h2o 132 on the other hand they can damage microorganisms without further adding chemical oxidants by attacking and breaking the cell wall making microorganisms become inactive or dead and denature proteins finally resulting in various end products 119 both mechanism photodegradation of organic pollutants and bacterial inactivation is illustrated in fig 4 furthermore eqs 13 to 17 suggest the

13413,chemical coagulants have been extensively used in wastewater treatment from industrial processes due to their removal efficiencies notwithstanding recent studies have reported concerns over the existence of lingering or incurable diseases resulting from residues of metals from these non degradable chemical coagulants which remain in the water even after treatment the sludge produced from the treatment has also been affirmed to be hazardous and non biodegradable causing harm to the environment the potential application of plant based coagulants as suitable alternatives to chemical coagulants due to their biodegradability economical non toxic and lower sludge volume and treatment cost is being studied in industrial wastewater treatment presented in this review is the state of heart of revolutionary technique for green coagulant preparation their properties and application in wastewater treatment highlighted is the current development on improving and purification techniques of the coagulants and probable use of dual or combine coagulants the review also critically identifies notable research gaps based on the current limitations in previous research to valorizing potential applications keywords coagulation natural coagulant wastewater treatment industrial effluent 1 introduction water is one of the foremost requirements for human survival in this world as it is connected to almost all world activities in 2018 the united nations un provided a statistic that 2 billion people live in countries that encounter high water stress worsening as an increase in population and demand for water is experienced 1 the need for clean water has been one of the goals that are being fought for all over the world because inadequate access to clean water has resulted in a lot of avoidable deaths the quality of clean water encompasses the color turbidity ph nutrients odor turbidity coliform count 2 according to the world health organization who in 2017 about 2 billion people in the world drink water from sources that are likely polluted with grease metals effluents and faeces when this polluted water is disposed into the environment and large water bodies they spread infectious water borne diseases including vomiting diarrhea cholera typhoid fever dysentery gastroenteritis worm infections hepatitis virus and trachoma 3 it is estimated that polluted water causes a death rate of about 485 000 each year thus by 2025 almost half of the world s population will be suffering living in water stressed regions 4 globally the expansion of most industries has occurred due to development and commercialization it was reported that one of the negative impacts of these developments in the industries is the heightened rate at which pollutants are found in the water bodies caused by industrial pollution water is used for numerous activities and purposes in all industries and most of the water up and discharged is termed as industrial wastewater every process undergone in the industries makes use of water raw materials energy and soil which are converted to generate the products other side products and wastewater 5 based on reports by unesco 6 more than 80 of the wastewater generated globally is likely to be discharged into the environment without proper treatment 6 the uncontrolled discharge of industrial wastewater which often consists of waste generated dissolved and fine suspended solids organic and inorganic particles dyes grease oil and other impurities into the environment has increased the turbidity ph cod and bod of water these may lead to both surface and groundwater contamination which may initiate several other hazards that are detrimental to human health 7 the fertilizer industry uses water extensively as a reactant and is reported to consume up to 270 m3 of water ton of product water is used in several activities including the reaction of water with no2 to produce nitrogen fertilizers via oxidation of ammonia gas besides the production of phosphate fertilizers using the wet process also need some volumes of water as a reactant thus the amount of wastewater created is high due to the water used and discharged by every process of production 8 large volumes of wastes containing effluents are generated at regular intervals by the textile industry these effluents are highly complex as they consist of various types of dyes chemical additives suspended solid particles cod bod and high acidity 9 it is estimated that more than 10 000 different synthetic dyes and pigments are used in the textile industry 10 the colored wastewater discharged consists of a large quantity of organic load which if inadequately treated before discharging into the environment would contribute hugely to the existing pollution of the surface water and the seawater 5 due to the high level of toxicity that exhibits mutagenic characteristics it is highly dangerous to consume water contaminated with these dyes the dyes present in the water could cause risk to the human and the environment as they can be potentially mutagenic allergic toxic and carcinogenic and the salts in the wastewater could lead to soil infertility 11 its effect on the aquatic ecosystem cannot be overlooked as it distorts the photosynthesis activity even in low concentrations because the dye reduces light penetration through the water surface 12 on the other hand the agricultural industry requires a high quality of water for the processing of produce an example is the milling process of palm oil water is consumed during washing grinding and sieving processes the untreated effluent abundant waste generated is disposed into the water bodies along with the water used in the processing raw palm oil mill effluent pome is brown colored with high concentrations of tss fat lubricant cod and bod thus changing the properties of the water bodies 13 suspended and dissolved solids introduced into the water through the feeds chemicals in form of medication disinfectants anti fouling and pathogens constitute the aquaculture effluent containing solid wastes nitrogenous wastes nitrate and nitrite and phosphorus organic matter 14 15 dauda et al 15 reported that regardless of the type of fish cultivated a high volume of wastes is produced from the aquaculture industry in japan one ton of fish was estimated to generate about 0 8 kg of nitrogen n and 0 1 kg of phosphorus p which equates to the amount of waste produced by 73 people per day if each person generates 11 g of n per day 15 untreated water discharged into the environment may lead to eutrophication and thus a cost effective treatment is required because of the large volume of water needed in fish cultivation the water is commonly treated using iron chloride fecl3 as a coagulant which increases the meal load in the water recent studies are seeking sustainable and environmentally friendly treatments that will protect the aquatic habitats from harmful contaminants while using the effluent rich in nutrients as soil conditioners to improve plant growth and yield similarly in the winery industry the winemaking process which includes the cleaning crushing and fermentation of grapefruits washing the fermentation tanks and other equipment used generates huge volumes of wastewater that is characterized by high organic and nutrient content acidity and cod thus causing contamination of the environment and waterbody 16 wastewater from the food processing winery and fermentation industries are characterized to be nontoxic as they are less hazardous however the water has a high organic matter content comprising carbohydrate and other sugars these compounds could be removed from the water to use in the production of hydrogen or other useful products 17 the wastewater generated from the pulp and paper processing consists of a high percentage of bod cod chlorinated and suspended solids as they exhaustively require a large volume of water in their processes 18 furthermore in the iron and steel industry producing iron from its ores and processing coke from coal requires a large volume of water for cooling it was reported that the steel industry in an asian country consumed 25 60 m3 water ton of steel which is believed to generate wastewater with a high level of contaminant concentrations 8 this water may be polluted with contaminants such as phenols hydraulic oils ammonia particulate solids cyanide bod cod metals and acids likewise in the mining industry recent studies reported the use of up to 40 m3 of water ton of ore during processing 19 the rock washing and other mining processes generate wastewater contaminated with rock particles metals acids oils hydraulic oils and salts 20 other industries identified to generate wastewater includes petroleum consumes up to 10 300 m3 water ton of product pharmaceutical generates wastewater with high organic contaminants from the medicinal compounds solvent and other substances 21 paint and varnish 22 food and beverage processing 23 cosmetics 24 25 chemical leather and metallurgy industries notable techniques for wastewater treatment includes coagulation 26 adsorption 27 ion exchange 28 membrane separation 29 and cavitation 30 however this paper will be focusing on the coagulation flocculation method of water treatment the separation of the suspended particle requires them to cluster and sediment upon the addition of coagulants coagulation effectively destabilizes the fine particles by neutralizing the electrical repulsion charges between the colloids 31 the coagulants aid the clustering and aggregation of the colloidal particles they carry opposite charges to the particles and neutralize them allowing attraction and clustering to form macroflocs chemical coagulants have been effectively used in coagulation treatment based on their application for a vast range of wastewater the coagulants react in the water and hydrate to produce metal hydrate precipitates acting as a sweep floc mechanism this mechanism backs the coagulant to effectively treat very difficult and almost impossible colloids in water however the chemical coagulants have been referenced to be hazardous due to the residual metals precipitates after the reaction 26 this has been found to cause health social economic and environmental challenges as it was discovered to be related to illness which includes alzheimer s disease abdominal spasms dementia intestinal constipation 32 33 the large amount of hazardous sludge containing metal salts generated after the treatment process may require additional removal techniques before disposal thereby increasing the treatment cost 34 the process flow diagram of a typical effluent treatment plant is shown in fig 1 the first process involves the accumulation of the various waste from the different sections of the industry into the collection tank 35 the effluent is further moved to the storage tank where the wastewater is stored before the treatment process takes place there are various blower pipes present in this unit to create additional airflow and proved enhanced aeration efficiency a paddle mixer is used for mixing and the mixing parameters may be varied the cooling tower is also used to bring down the temperatures 36 the treatment process continues with the neutralization of ph with chemicals that reduce the acidity or alkalinity of the medium the coagulation process begins with the introduction of coagulants in form of natural plant and animal based or chemical coagulants aluminum sulphate alum sodium aluminate ferric sulphate lime 37 after coagulation biological treatment is conducted in the biological oxidation tank the process involves the degradation of the natural organic matter nom contaminants in the wastewater by microorganisms the microorganisms feed on the nom in the presence of oxygen and nutrients which is aided by the establishment of an artificial ecosystem 38 here the bod of the wastewater and other toxic impurities are broken down and converted to carbon dioxide 39 the next process is the sedimentation of the particles and separation of sludge before transferring the residual solution for filtration in the pressure filter which consists of a filtration layer made up of sand rock filters the wet sludge to separate the remnant water from it 40 the final process of the effluent treatment is to check the final load of effluent in the water before discharging it to the environment recently the inclination has shifted towards research and development of natural coagulants for efficient wastewater treatment due to the numerous limitations in the use of synthetic coagulants discovered numerous review papers have been published on the use of natural coagulants for water treatment gautan and saini 41 stated some of the advantages and disadvantages of natural coagulant in industrial effluent treatment but failed to highlight the purification and methods to improve the coagulant efficiency also saleem and bachmaan 42 provided the historical use contemporary review of plant based coagulant chemistry but didn t address the recent techniques that are used in purification and isolation of the active coagulant agents for improved treatment performance this review highlights a critical discussion on the extraction purification applications and evaluation of plant based coagulants for an effective coagulation process hence comparative performance evaluation between green coagulant and chemical coagulants in the treatment of industrial wastewater were discussed furthermore parameter optimization of factors that influence green coagulant performance in industrial wastewater treatment was reviewed several coagulants used in industrial wastewater treatments were compared and their optimum coagulation parameters were highlighted in this review projections and prospects on valorization green coagulant production and application were identified 2 coagulation process the coagulation flocculation process is an indispensable factor in water treatment it is the most used chemical treatment for both water and wastewater as it efficiently reduces the turbidity suspended solids oil organic matter color and chemical oxygen demand cod in the water it requires the introduction of substances that aids the clustering of finer particles in the water into larger flocs for effective removal from the water coagulation and flocculation are inter linked coagulation is the agglomeration of suspended colloidal particles in water it is a chemical process that involves the neutralization of the negative charge of the dispersed materials in the wastewater 43 while flocculation is a physical process it is the formation of flocs or flakes from the suspended colloids in the water it is majorly conducted by high molecular weight compounds aiding the aggregation and settling of the flocs formed during the coagulation process thus coagulation forms the larger flocs and flocculation causes the flocs to aggregate and settle at the bottom of the water body after the coagulation flocculation process the treatment process further undergoes filtration and sedimentation processes to remove the effluent from the water 44 however it was also reported that the process might still require further treatments which include filtration sedimentation oxidation and physical or chemical disinfection for complete treatment 45 this depends on the properties of the fine suspended particles in the water they vary in source compositions density sizes shape it is important to have a complete coagulation process as it would affect ensuing processes incomplete coagulation will lead to incomplete flocculation to further result in an ineffective sedimentation process as shown in fig 2 the untreated water undergoes coagulation when the coagulants are introduced to it a vigorous mixing process is required to aid the floc formed to cluster into larger flocs the swift mixing distributes the coagulant uniformly through the waterbody a slower mixing follows to aid inter particle bridging of the flocs 46 the coagulation process efficiency depends strongly on the coagulant type mixing rate and settling time which determines the quality of the water the dosage coagulant has to be optimum and intensely mixed for proper suspension of the solid particles other characteristics of the coagulants include its quality and lifespan which determines the stability during storage 47 after the coagulation flocculation process the water undergoes sedimentation the larger solid particles sink by gravitation settling to the bottom of the vessel this step is often dependent on the rate of settling of the particles flotation or settling time and time allowed for sedimentation the filtration process takes place after the sedimentation the sediments effluents are separated from the clean water often by passing them through various filters or membranes the bulk of the suspended solids are removed in the top portion of the filter media the particles trapped within the filter bed are usually removed by backwashing the filters 48 the rapid dual media filter is the most commonly used filter type in the conventional wastewater treatment process it is composed of sand and anthracite nevertheless other filtration media which is not limited to the mono media sand only multi media sand anthracite and garnet may also be applied in the filtration process 49 the solid sludge generate is transferred to the sludge bed dried and prepared for disposal or recycling in the form of fertilizers or manures the clean water is then transferred for further disinfection which varies according to the intended application for the water the final process is storage the treated water is often stored before use it is however believed that water that contains more nitrogen phosphorus and potassium elements should not be stored for too long as it aids the production of algae and the growth of other microorganisms 50 2 1 mechanism of coagulation in removing particles from wastewater it is inefficient and discouraged to remove small particles that are suspended in the water or do not settle properly as they might pass through the filters during the filtration process thus a coagulation process is required to clog the fine particles together to form larger flocs which will be easier to separate from the water after settling 51 the suspended particles averagely larger than 1 0 μm in the water also contain colloidal particles which are very small with an extremely large surface area they are generally invisible to the eyes but are larger than atoms with a size ranging from 0 001 to 1 0 μm 52 the coagulant added to the water destabilizes the particles resulting in their entrapment to form larger flocs the four principal mechanisms for destabilizing the colloids during coagulation include sweep flocculation particle entrapment double layer compression charge neuralization and polymer adsorption and interparticle bridging 31 54 the action of the coagulation polymers is based on either destabilization or interparticle bridging the mechanisms could be studied and identified through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses 55 a schematic diagram of coagulation mechanisms is shown in fig 3 the sweep flocculation is involved with the coagulant trapping the suspended particles and causing them to settle at the bottom in the work of okuda et al 56 a coagulant solution extracted from moringa seed using the salt solution 1 m nacl was used in the coagulation of synthetic kaolin water the ca2 and other bivalent cations seemed to have connected with the molecule of the active coagulation component in the moringa extracted solution to form a net like structure based on the formed net like structure it was concluded that the sweep flocculation i e the enmeshment of the kaolin mechanism was predominantly operated on as it was responsible for the coagulation 56 57 while double layer compression is the process that aids the fine particles to overcome the force of repulsion and cluster together when induced by the presence of high concentrations of salt compounds electrolytes in the colloidal suspension the added ions divalent and trivalent ions carrying opposite charges penetrate the diffused double layer that surrounds the colloids causing it to increase in density and smaller volume 58 59 this leads to generating repulsive electrostatic reactions that are affected by attractive van der waals forces resulting in steeper electrostatic potential gradients 60 as the net repulsive energy decreases and reaches elimination the particles approach each other and cluster the charge neutralization mechanism is cited to involve the destabilization of the suspended particles using opposite charged electric ions to attract them the particle charges neutralize and the electrostatic repulsion lessens or reaches complete elimination flocculation then occurs as the suspended colloids cluster to form larger flocs 61 this mechanism is observed to be involved when aloe vera gel was used as a coagulant in treating tannery wastewater the presence of the galacturonic acid ions ionizes to produce h ions which aids charge neutralization of the anionic colloidal particles 62 63 this mechanism was also reported for the active coagulation agent of moringa oleifera seed the protein was found to have high contents of glutamine arginine with positively charged amino acids of nearly low molecular weight 64 furthermore the polymer adsorption and bridging mechanism occur when the long chained coagulant polymers destabilize the colloidal particles as they form bridges that extend between them the polymer molecules attach to the surface of multiple particles by adsorption producing strong clusters of macro flocs as the colloidal particles are tied together via bridging 54 the adsorption and bridging mechanism were hypothesized to be the primary coagulation mechanism for cactus opuntia as well as cassia obtusifolia seed gum which is a non ionic natural polymer and serves as an effective bridging coagulant in acidic solution 55 for cactus notable literature reported the possibility of carbohydrate primarily the galacturonic acid which is a major constituent of pectin existing primarily in polymeric form provides the bridge for the adsorption of the colloidal particles 65 66 nirmali seed extracts were also reported to be anionic polyelectrolytes that use the interparticle bridging mechanism to destabilize the particles in the water 67 the colloidal particles are attached to the polymerlike material mucilage from the cactus the adsorption may occur through hydrogen or dipole interactions the natural electrolytes divalent cations from the cactus pads are believed to be highly crucial to coagulation involving anionic colloidal particles as they aid the coagulation process 59 68 the coagulation mechanisms explain the reactions between the colloidal particles and the coagulant added resulting in the destabilization and neutralization of the ionic charges of the particles and they are reported to be dependent on coagulation dosage 69 during the coagulation process a long chain polymer or polyelectrolyte imported as the coagulant possessed an opposite charge to the suspended particles in the water 53 the coagulant added is intensely mixed to dissolve and evenly distribute throughout the water body while promoting particle collisions incomplete coagulation may occur when there is inadequate mixing also over mixing or aggressive mixing affects coagulation which may break the interparticle bridging and lead to restabilization 31 the suspended particles begin to aggregate together immediately the coagulants successfully neutralizes the charges and flocs are formed the flocculation process promotes the clustering of the flocs in the water medium after the thorough rapid mixing a moderate mixing signifies the beginning of the flocculation process the reduced surface charge of the particles and the increased electrical attraction between them results in the flocculation 44 the particle sizes increase as the particles cluster and aggregate the suspended particles are now more clearly seen as the particles collide and interact together the larger flocs are formed they start to settle at the bottom of the water body in preparation for the sedimentation process most natural coagulants are reported to function based on the charge neutralization mechanism however the zeta potential analysis and electron microscopy images of the flocs produced could give more information on the predominant mechanism exhibited by the coagulant 70 3 classification of coagulants coagulants applied in wastewater treatments are classified majorly into two groups synthetic coagulants and natural coagulants 71 they are introduced into the coagulation system to destabilize the colloidal particles to enhance their aggregation to form larger flocs other types of coagulants include coagulant aids and enhanced coagulants they are applied to enhance the formation of flocs by adding density to the flocs 72 3 1 synthetic coagulants the most frequently applied chemical inorganic coagulants in water treatments are iron and aluminium salts and organic polymers the iron or aluminium based coagulants are economical widely available and can be used for a large array of water and wastewater treatments due to their effectiveness in the removal of most types of solid particles after its addition to the water the chemicals which have high positively charged neutralizes the negatively charged colloids forming aluminium or iron precipitates 43 73 their efficiency in coagulation is a result of their capacity to develop polynuclear complexes which increases the coagulation performance as the ions are effectively absorbed onto the negative surface of the colloids of the particles 31 74 the particles clog together and settle in the process of cleansing the water the chemical coagulants that have been broadly used in the industrial wastewater treatments are not limited to aluminium sulphate alum 75 polyaluminium chloride 76 ferric chloride 77 78 ferrous sulphate 79 and lime 80 however it has been reported that they may alter the ph of water as they deplete alkalinity therefore lime or soda ash is added to maintain the desired water ph 81 other disadvantages and limitations include high volumes of sludge production the presence of residual metals in the sludge 44 82 the effective application of inorganic coagulants is greatly dependent on the dosage an excess of the metals in the effluent will cause harm to human health the environment and the ecosystem because of their corrosive property the treatment process requires using corrosion resistant equipment and apparatus and the solid effluents to be disposed of must be treated and discarded in an appropriate method the sludge produced after coagulation has been reported to be toxic and while being generated in large quantities it was also noted that aluminium based synthetic coagulants leave aluminium salt as a residue which is a neurotoxic product thus continued exposure to water containing this residue leads to alzheimer s disease 33 the advantages and disadvantages of notable chemical coagulants have been highlighted in table 1 organic polymer coagulants pre hydrolyzing metallic salts are widely used coagulants in water treatment they are polymeric coagulants with exceptional characteristics that have been made to be although the coagulants are fitted from the inorganic coagulants they are hydrophilic compounds and have the same characteristics as natural coagulants environmentally friendly and non toxic to the humans and ecosystem a limitation these sets of coagulants have is that they are not effective in all conditions of wastewater treatment thus they are often mixed with inorganic coagulants for effective treatment the polymeric coagulants are majorly polymers that have high molecular weight and are long chained they can be applied as the primary coagulant or used as a coagulant alongside inorganic metal coagulants as it is in the case of negatively charged polymers their basicity is one of the most significant characteristics of polymeric coagulants 104 other advantages over inorganic coagulants include the fact that their application is required in lesser dosages they have little effect on ph as they have lesser alkalinity absorption a cleaner and lesser volume of sludge is formed as the coagulants treat the water without producing additional solids metal hydroxide precipitate 105 106 however some of their limitations include its highly expensive cost when compared with inorganic coagulants also the suitable polymer to be used as to be selected for efficient coagulation process few of these polymeric coagulants pacl pici pfc and pfs are highlighted and discussed in table 1 other synthetic cationic polymers used as chemical coagulants include aminomethyl polyacrylamide 107 polyalkylene 108 polyamine 109 and polyethlenimine 110 overall the applications of the chemical coagulants have been established as they are widely used in wastewater treatment due to their proven performance availability and cost effectiveness their limitations that have been recurrently stated are voluminous sludge generated as a result of their various side reactions which further makes the handling disposal or recycling of the sludge difficult 55 other common disadvantages include the residual metal salts left after the treatment process especially if over dosing occurred the consumption of alkalinity by the coagulants especially the iron based coagulants increases the cost of treatment due to the required substances added to balance the ph 111 3 2 natural coagulants natural green coagulants are commonly used for wastewater treatment to generate and remove sludge they have the benefits of greatly maintain ph as they do not deplete alkalinity unlike the chemical metal based coagulants they do not add metals to the effluents generated a lower volume of sludge is also formed which reduces the cost of disposing of the sludge obtained there are different sources of organic coagulants which include the plant animals and microorganisms which has been illustrated in table 2 2 the plant based coagulants are obtained from the seeds leaves bark of trees fruit wastes and other sources the plant based coagulants have been more researched than the other two sources because of their wide availability numerous natural coagulants previously studied include moringa seed jatropha curcas 112 banana peel 113 cassava peel starch 114 pawpaw 115 watermelon 116 beans 117 okra 118 nirmali seeds 53 the preparation process of producing natural coagulant powder from the seeds is shown in fig 4 examples of coagulants are sourced from animal bone shell extracts the exoskeleton of shellfish extracts chitin and chitosan chitosan is a natural high molecular polymer cellulose like biopolymer derived from the deacetylation of chitin they are obtained from shells of crabs shrimps lobsters diatoms insects fungi marine and freshwater sponges and mollusks the potential of chitosan as a natural coagulant has been researched extensively 122 it is presumed that this type of coagulant has very minimal toxicity which makes it less harmful to be disposed of as residue either along with the sludge or water 96 chitosan has been studied in treating wastewater generated in the textile industry agricultural industry 123 food processing 124 soap and detergent 23 paper mill 125 and other industries 126 127 chitosan is highly favored as a coagulant because when added to an acidic solution it reacts and emits positive charges which interact with the negative charges of the suspended colloids 128 compared to the inorganic coagulant alum green coagulants function better at specific ph conditions alum could function at all ph conditions however it was found that both types of coagulants needed an adjustment to their ph before or after the coagulation process but the green coagulant has a lower probability of producing water with extreme ph because ph alteration does not occur during treatment 129 130 the advantages of using green coagulants are quite numerous and are not limited to their positive impact on the environment and the ecosystem because of their low toxicity levels and high biodegradability which ensures the safety of human health and aquatic life they also do not generate secondary pollution and are environmentally friendly 72 few green coagulants are used in wastewater treatment and their optimum parameters are given in table 3 some of the parameters varied included ph turbidity coagulant dosage reaction time and temperature to obtain the optimum parameters for treatment other coagulants used in wastewater treatment includes psyllium plantago ovata seed 152 okra mucilage 153 peanut arachis hypogaea 154 soybean glycine max 53 cowpea vigna unguiculate 155 156 banana papaya neem leaf powder 157 although various studies on using agricultural based coagulants in wastewater treatment gave satisfying results its inefficiency is exhibited in the treatment of highly turbid wastewater i e 800ntu it was noted that the highly turbid water requires treatment with high coagulant doses which invariably increases the biological and chemical load on water coupled with over dosage which may further stunt turbidity 54 also for its application in the industry the economical aspect must be considered by studying the feasibility of designing large scale treatment plants during studies using synthetic water 4 natural coagulant preparation during coagulation the natural coagulants are usually used directly in powder form or as a stock solution their methods of preparation vary based on their sources and their compositions 42 as shown in fig 4 the seeds or other plant parts are cleansed to remove contaminants that would negatively affect the coagulation process cut chop peeled soaked from other sources dried before grinding or milling after the milling process the powder is then sieved with the desired mesh sizes and re blended if necessary 158 159 sometimes during preparation oil is extracted from the agricultural seeds moringa oleifera seed was reported to have a high oil content of about 30 40 and 35 for jatropha curcas seeds 160 161 the oil present in the material increases the organic matter in the water hence an oil extraction process is required to purify the seed coagulant the oil free cake is then used in the coagulation process or for further purification 162 several studies involving studying the effect of seed oil extraction on the coagulation process have justified the higher performance of oil free seeds on turbidity removal improved ph range and color removal 163 generally the soxhlet extraction methods are used in the extraction process with hexane being the most used solvent including ethanol and acetone oil extraction before crude extract preparation is highly recommended to improve coagulation activities at lower dosages 164 165 results of oil free moringa oleifera mo seed extract gave a better coagulation efficiency of more than 30 when compared to the oil contained extract in the study done by garcia fayos et al 164 soxhlet extraction was observed to give a higher oil extraction yield than the batch method procedure which was used alongside also compared to the other solvents acetone and hexane ethanol oil free extract required significantly lower coagulation dosage which results in its high efficiency 164 in a study of the removal of dye color from the textile wastewater using basil seed mucilage by shamsnejati et al 144 the basil seeds were first cleansed of foreign impurities and immersed in water at a temperature 50 c containing 0 9 nacl solution the contents were mixed for 1 h till the seeds completely swelled a rough plate was used to scrape the gum layer of the seed surface and the mucilage was separated from the seeds with the aid of a 500 micron steel filter it was gathered and used as a coagulant for wastewater treatment 144 coagulant was produced from tamarind indica ti seed by washing the seeds with clean water to rid them of dust and pulp the cleansed seeds were further dried in the shade for 24 h before removing the seed coat by treating it with hydrochloric acid after drying the seeds were ground with a grinding machine to obtain the ti powder which was used as the coagulant 145 chestnut and acorn seeds coagulant used in the removal of turbidity were prepared by dissolving the prepared ground powder in distilled water or nacl to extract the active coagulant element the mixture was stirred for 10 min before filtering with the aid of a filter paper 166 in extracting pectin from orange peel to apply as a coagulant in wastewater treatment the peel was removed from fresh orange fruit obtained and the pith was detached from the peel with the aid of a laboratory knife the pith was dried at room temperature until all moisture is evaporated four spoons of lemon sourced citric acid were added to approximately 227 g of the dried pith it was left in a position for 1 h before the addition of 2 cups of water and left in that position for the next 1 h the combination was heated for 10 min after which it was left to cool and was strained using a muslin cloth the pectin is the filtrate extracted from the pith of the orange peel which could be used directly as a coagulant in the wastewater treatment process 148 for preparing coagulant from jatropha curcas seeds the skin on the seeds was removed manually before selecting the seeds of good quality the kernel obtained was ground using an electric blender to a fine powder 63 500 μm in obtaining the active ingredients the coagulant was prepared by mixing 5 g of the powder with 100 ml of distilled water at room temperature for several minutes before filtering the suspension obtained using a muslin cloth 129 similarly sesamum indicum seeds were washed with de ionized water to remove impurities after separating and confiscating the bad ones the samples were dried at room temperature for 2 weeks to ensure the preservation of the physicochemical characteristics of the seeds it was then ground to a particle size of almost 300 μm in preparing the coagulant oil was extracted from the milled sample using n hexane for the extraction of the coagulant 10 g of the oil free sample was dissolved in 250 ml of salt solution and underwent constant agitation with the aid of a magnetic stirrer for 1 h and heated up to a temperature of 70 c after the reaction the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was dried at room temperature it was reground and deposited in a sealed vessel for future application 134 in the preparation of mo coagulant the seed pods that are matured and dried by natural means to a brown color were collected from the tree the pods were opened to extract the seeds from the pods they undergo sun drying while the external shells were also removed matured seeds showing the absence of discoloration and softening were used after the sun drying process the seed kernel was extracted from the external shell which was milled using a grinder to achieve the seed kernel in the treatment of textile wastewater by ramesh et al 145 mo powder was mixed with distilled water and used directly as a coagulant 4 1 extraction of coagulation solution based on studies it was discovered that using the powdered seed directly as a natural coagulant contributes to the sludge volume generated as well as lowers the turbidity removal efficiency of the coagulant 167 hence to remove unwanted organic components that the natural seed powders contribute to increased organic content in the water additional treatments are applied to isolate the active coagulation agents in the seeds 168 distilled water and saline solution are the commonly used suitable methods to extract the active coagulant agent abidin et al 129 achieved a turbidity removal of 99 using distilled water extracted jatropha curcas seed in treating kaolin synthetic water the coagulant active ingredients were extracted by mixing 5 g of the seed powder with 100 ml of distilled water at room temperature for several minutes the resulting suspension was filtered through the muslin cloth 129 studies have determined that extraction of active coagulation agents from seed powders using salt solutions was more efficient when compared to the distilled water extraction salt solutions generally demonstrated better efficiency over distilled water in wastewater treatment as detected by dalvand et al 169 they act as a polyelectrolyte during the coagulation the most common salts used to prepare the saline solutions are sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl sodium nitrate nano3 potassium nitrate kno3 and ammonium chloride nh4cl 167 170 in the study of coagulation activity zygia cauliflora of seed extract by domingues et al 171 the coagulants were extracted from the seed using distilled water and saline solutions which were prepared at 1 0 m and 5 0 m nacl concentration the most efficient extraction solution was determined to be the coagulant prepared with 1 0 m nacl it showed effectiveness of 30 4 and 74 5 removal of color and turbidity respectively 171 elsayed et al 172 compared the coagulation performance of active coagulants from the natural seeds bean lima bean lentil and fenugreek extracted using different solvents distilled water nacl and naoh the seeds powder 5 g were mixed with 50 ml of the solvents for 1 h at a temperature of 40 c the resulting suspension was then centrifuged with the clear solutions used the coagulant in the water treatment comparing the effects of the different solvents on coagulation activity the coagulant extracted with 0 3 m nacl demonstrated a higher coagulation efficiency above 75 for the coagulants prepared with the saline solutions the increase in the concentration of the salts led to higher extraction of the active coagulation agent which was believed to be protein the coagulation performance continuously increased until a certain point this was supported by the increase in the solubility of the protein in the presence of salt and its precipitation in an excess salt solution 172 birima et al 170 demonstrated the higher performance effectiveness of peanut seed coagulant extracted with nacl pss over the coagulant extracted with distilled water psd the two coagulants were used to treat the turbid water at the same dosage of 20 mg l the pss coagulant effectively removed turbidity by 92 while the psd coagulants exhibited a lower turbidity removal performance of 31 5 at the same dosage 170 another study by de souza et al 82 involving the extraction of cactus mucilage textile effluent treatment supported the effectiveness of nacl and kcl over nano3 in turbidity removal the effects of the three salt solutions on the coagulation activity were studied nacl and kcl achieved maximum turbidity removal of 92 and 94 respectively it was noteworthy that nacl when compared with kcl is more economical with less toxicity and is easily accessible 82 although using the extracted active solution is highly efficient coagulation efficiency might decline due to the microbial decomposition of the organic materials during storage thus it is preferred to prepare and use fresh coagulants directly to evade the aging effects on the solution 172 previous studies have identified a setback in the coagulation activity of natural coagulants due to the presence of other components asides from the active coagulation agents these materials rich in plant tissue tend to increase the organic load in the treated water causing a deficiency to the treatment this can be minimized or prevented by further purifying the coagulant proteins 173 4 2 isolation purification and identification of proteins the lower shelf life of water treated with seed crude extracts has been attributed to the presence of high organic matter loads isolation and purification of the active coagulating agent from the crude extracts reduce the organic loads in the treated water 174 in the removal of cyanobacteria from surface water by camacho et al 32 the dissolved organic matter was discovered to increase irrespective of the extractions done both oil extraction with ethanol and salt solution nacl extraction however salt solution extracted mo was able to remove aromatic organic matter up to 50 32 previous studies have identified the purified natural coagulants extract by protein precipitation chemical solvents isoelectric heavy metal ions dialysis 175 176 ion exchange chromatography 177 178 and membrane filtration ultra micro nanofiltration reverse osmosis 179 181 these techniques are dodged because it adds to the overall cost of water treatment the technologies separate the active coagulants from contaminants by their molecular weights size ph and electric charge using membranes centrifugation and adsorbents table 4 gives some of the advantages and disadvantages of the purification techniques ion exchange techniques use molecular charge to separate the cationic coagulant from anionic and non ionic contaminants the difference in the charges charge density and distribution on the surfaces of the substances causes the different degrees of interaction with the ion exchanger which leads to separation ionic strength and ph are conditions that could be varied to control these interactions 182 a study by taiwo et al 183 discovered a significant reduction in turbidity and organic load resulting in 58 18 total coliform reduction in the study moringa oleifera mo seed purified using the ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography was used in water treatment sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page and gel filtration were used to analyze the subunit and native molecular weight which were determined as 14 2 kda and 30 3 kda respectively the lyophilization technique separates the coagulant from the contaminant by free the crude extract followed by extracting and drying the supernatant at low temperatures through a vacuum the potential of using ultrafiltration as a purification method for natural coagulants was studied by prodanović et al 181 ultrafiltration membranes removed molecules that inhibited high turbidity removal the crude extracts were separated into 4 fractions 5 30 kda the organic load in phaseolus vulgaris seed treated water was minimized up to 50 when the 4th fraction the contents were predominantly protein with molecular weight 50 60 kda was used as a coagulant compared to the organic load 66 of crude extract treated water it also had the highest coagulation activity of 75 similar to the crude extract coagulation activity 181 a combination of one or more purification technique was used by choudhary and neogi 184 in the purification isolation and identification of mo protein for water treatment chemical precipitation using ammonium sulphate was used for isolation of the active coagulant from the contaminants purification of the isolated proteins was done using the dialysis tube dialysis with molecular wight 1 kda to remove the ammonium sulphate lyophilization was finally used to achieve a stable powdered form of the proteins the isolated samples were freeze dried at 80 c and placed in the lyophilizer for 2 days the pure protein powder obtained was 9 of the initial 5 g of the mo seed powder used the proteins had a high turbidity removal efficiency of 88 identification using sds page analysis also showed that isolated proteins with lower molecular weight 36 kda had the highest coagulation properties because of their 100 turbidity removal and without increasing the organic load in the water 184 4 3 composite coagulants reports have mentioned that solely using natural coagulants have a slight possibility of yielding poor performance in wastewater treatment 126 128 the solution to this challenge has been sought by producing composite or hybrid coagulants the coagulants are combined with either natural or chemical coagulants 96 189 several successful applications of composite coagulants in wastewater treatment has shown improved treatment performances a study by ravikumar and udayakumar 190 developed an environmentally friendly composite coagulants by combining bentonite clay bc and moringa oleifera mo seed extract 5 g l dose of the coagulant was able to remove heavy metals cadmium chromium and lead with up to 99 99 efficiency after 40 min of rapid mixing and 15 min of slow mixing characterization of the composites showed that the bc and mo biopolymer physicochemically interacted with each other during the preparation the biopolymer is grafted into the bentonite clay structure thereby introducing functional groups o h c h c o and c n stretches that assist coagulation process to the spectra the biopolymer molecules were captured between the clay structure layers which protects the molecules from enzymatic reactions of microorganism on it thus the challenge of low shell life face by the mo biopolymer is treated as the composite shelf life is increased to more than two years 190 it is irrefutable that composite coagulants have the ability to reduce the chemical coagulant dosage which would lessen its toxic effect and tackle other negative drawbacks when compared with pacl the chitosan based composite coagulant produced by yang et al 191 showed lower dosage wider application ph range better removal efficiency and produced sludge with lower toxicity the coagulant s performance were ascribed to the enhanced positive charges and higher molecular weight 191 the application of composite coagulant was also able to overcome the problem of weak flocs a positive result on the increased floc size growth rate and recoverability of the flocs was achieved 189 the economical advantage of using the composite coagulants while exhibiting excellent performance makes them a good potential for industrialization and commercialization 5 parameters varied to determine the efficacy of the coagulants on the coagulation activity in the evaluation of coagulant and its efficiency in water treatment several parameters are varied to determine the optimum parameter values that will give the highest efficiency these coagulation operating factors have huge impacts on the reactions present during the coagulation processes as they influence the efficiency and effectiveness of the coagulants in the wastewater treatment processes cheng et al 192 implied that total suspended solids tss clear color turbidity total organic carbon toc temperature and ph are parameters that are evaluated to gauge the efficiency of the coagulation process 5 1 effect of coagulation dosage a good coagulant is characterized by having a very high positive charge to neutralize the negative charge exhibited by the fine particles present in the water body a comparatively low molecular weight to aid proper diffusion of the cationic charges around the particles to intensify dispersion of the coagulant in the water bodies the selection of the optimum coagulant dosage is a very essential parameter in coagulation the required coagulant dose will effectively aggregate the suspended particulates in the water coagulation dosage affects the efficiency of the wastewater coagulation process in such a way that a dosage lower to the optimum will inhibit proper removal of the effluent while overdosage results in increased turbidity organic matter and higher slurry volume and thus leading to a high cost of treatment 193 several researchers have studied the effects of varying the coagulation dosages to obtain the optimum for efficient treatment jagaba et al 123 in the treatment of pome to reduce the turbidity and color varied the coagulant dosage from 500 5000 mg l obtaining an optimum coagulation dosage of 2000 mg l which gave turbidity cod tss color and oil grease removals of 88 30 38 60 95 42 90 15 87 05 respectively however lower optimum dosage values of the moringa seed powder have been reported by several other researchers muruganandam et al 54 reduced the turbidity of raw tannery effluent by 59 43 at optimum dosage of 15 mg l a closer value of 20 mg l was also reported by ramesh et al 194 dehghani et al 75 also achieved 70 mg l as the optimal dosage after treating the oil refinery wastewater the dosage removed cod turbidity and tss up to 38 60 63 70 and 62 05 respectively ernest et al 116 reported the optimal dosage of watermelon seed to be 0 6 g l after varying between 0 2 1 0 g l to remove the turbidity and color of river water the optimal dosage had an efficiency of 86 turbidity and 82 7 color removals table 3 gives some of the optimal coagulant dosages as it is common with green coagulants the percentage turbidity reduction increases as the coagulant dosages increase towards the optimum coagulant dosage and beyond which increase in coagulant dosage leads to a decreased turbidity reduction 54 therefore it is important to use the jar test in the laboratory scale to study the effect of varying dosages to determine the optimal 5 2 effect of ph ph is the measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of the water which value is between 1 14 it can be measured with the aid of a ph meter the charge on the amphoteric coagulant molecules is often highly dependent on the ph values in the wastewater undergoing treatment 195 alkalinity is measured to determine the capacity to neutralize an acid in the coagulation process it dominates the efficiency at which the chemicals react with the water and affect the destabilization process most chemical coagulants especially ferric based salts consume a high percentage of alkalinity it is believed that lower alkalinity generates poor floc formation which needs the addition of alkalinity sources some of which include soda ash or lime or caustic soda to the water the ph value outside the range of the optimum ph results in the generation of a mixture of positive and negative charges of the amino acid in the protein which may lead to the reduction of the net cationic efficiency of the coagulant in the coagulation process the ph value of the medium has a huge influence on the protein molecule ionic charges hence it determines the amount of coagulant required for an efficient coagulation process and thus ph adjustment should be done before proceeding with the coagulation process 23 the most commonly used chemicals for lowering and increasing acidity are sodium chloride nacl and h2so4 respectively other chemicals can be used to increase the ph values such as sodium carbonate hydroxides of calcium ammonia and magnesium while hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid also highly effect decreasing the ph of the water however the addition of these chemicals may increase the ph beyond the needed value requiring additional adjustment of the ph to obtain proper floc formation in the case of water with higher alkalinity an extremely higher coagulant dosage could be needed to low the ph to the optimal ph for effective coagulation regrettably the extra addition of coagulant doses could lead to the exorbitant cost of treatment as a result of disposing of the enormous sludge generated the ph was varied between 5 9 when using the mucilage of cactus to remove turbidity and cod of tannery effluent by muruganandam et al 54 51 50 and 59 35 removal were obtained for the turbidity and cod at an optimal ph of 7 the cactus based coagulant was neither denatured by the acidic nor the alkaline conditions and thus the neutral ph is the most effective and more preferred the optimal ph value of 7 7 5 for watermelon seed coagulants is concluded from researches conducted 116 140 141 the amino acid in the moringa oleifera and jatropha curcas protein coagulants are more effective in acidic conditions this is supported by various studies using moringa oleifera sasikala et al 196 revealed that the positive charges on the amino acids that constitute the coagulant are dominating and effectively works as a cationic coagulant it is believed that almost all amino acids present in seed proteins have positive charges at ph values of less than 3 and higher than 11 which was observed in the turbidity removal of about 99 while using moringa oleifera jatropha curcas seed extract as the coagulant they obtained a turbidity removal of 99 at an optimal ph value of 3 after varying from 1 to 12 although exceptions such as boulaadjoul et al 57 reported an optimum ph range of 6 8 after treating wastewater from paper mill reduced the turbidity by 97 which implies that the protein coagulant is still relevant for treating a wide range of ph abidin 197 expected that most of the amino acids present in the jatropha curcas seed protein have isoelectric point values from 3 2 to 11 suggesting that the coagulant works effectively as a positively charged coagulant agent at a ph of relatively 3 another efficient removal of the petroleum industrial waste was studied by khader et al 138 using cicer arietinum seed eggplant seed and radish seeds the ph of the coagulants was varied from 2 to 11 with optimal achieved at 7 the optimal gave turbidity removal of 98 2 98 7 98 2 cod 95 91 8 92 6 and oil removals of 83 80 87 for cicer arietinum seed eggplant seed and radish seeds respectively the ph values below and above 7 caused decreased removal efficiency 138 5 3 effect of initial turbidity turbidity is an essential factor that affects effective wastewater treatment it is a visual property of water due to its close association with the color of the water the presence of suspended solid particles in the water induces turbidity resulting in the absence of clarity abundant microorganisms soil organic matter colored compounds dye decaying matter plankton and algae cause the turbid water to look cloudy murky and undesirable 198 the increasing rate of turbidity is simultaneous to the increase in effluent thus turbidity and solid particles are a challenge in wastewater treatment 199 the effect of initial turbidity on the coagulation performance using jatropha curcas as coagulant was studied by abidin et al 129 the kaolin wastewater samples were set at initial turbidities ranging from 100 to 8000 ntu the turbidity removal for all initial turbidity values was higher than 98 4 it was reported that the maximum turbidity removal was achieved at 500 ntu at 99 5 there was an increase in turbidity removal from 100 up to 500 ntu which was followed by slightly decreased removal performance as the initial turbidity increased up to 8000 ntu it was thus concluded that jatropha curcas is a natural coagulant applicable for wastewater treatment of a wide range of initial turbidity abidin et al 2011 5 4 effect of stirring speed and time adequate stirring speed and time is an essential parameter that contributes to effective coagulation leading to higher performance in wastewater treatment two mixing speeds are used during the conduction of the coagulation flocculation experiment comprising of slow and rapid mixing the rapid mixing is done immediately the coagulation additives are added to aid uniform distribution throughout the medium and to destabilize the colloidal particles while the slow mixing is introduced to enable collision of the particles to cluster aggregate and form macroflocs the efficiency of the coagulation process is highly affected by the adequacy of both mixing times and speed because and inadequate mixing time will hinder proper agglomeration of the colloids leading to decreased efficiency of turbidity the velocity gradient is the parameter used to express the mixing intensity anteneh and sahu 23 examined the effect of mixing time on cod removal food industry wastewater the treatment was done using chitosan as a natural coagulant with the stirring speed varied within the range of 50 200 rpm it was reported that mixing speeds from 50 rpm to 120 rpm had increasing cod and color reductions of up to 58 72 and 63 81 respectively the further increase to 150 rpm gave the best performance at 83 and 90 for cod and color reduction however it was observed that upon further increase of the speeds to 200 rpm a decrease occurred in the performance for cod and color reduction at 74 and 79 23 the coagulation mechanism attributed to the process is also influenced by the stirring speed and time for the particle settling coagulant aids or flocculants are often added together with the coagulant to support the aggregation and settling of the small flocs that settle very slowly logically turbidity reduction in the water increase as the time allowed is lengthened however it gets to maximum when colloids have completely settled 33 most coagulation studies have been reported to set the settling time of the experiment within 15 60 mins 172 a considerably high settling time of about 72 h was required for the removal of dye from dye wastewater using azadirachta indica as natural coagulants even though up to 80 dye removal was achieved by the coagulants this averagely long period for the settling time necessitates the use of a flocculant aid to improve the sedimentation process of the biocoagulants for economic and effective application 200 6 natural coagulant and their applications a shift towards the use of natural coagulants for the purification of water and wastewater treatment has been observed in recent times it is believed that a yield of up to 90 of total suspended solids is removed from wastewater if coagulation was done before gravity settling when compared to treatment without the coagulation process 103 overall the treatment materials are added into the wastewater and thoroughly mixed to destabilize the suspended particles collision occurs between the particles as they begin to cluster and aggregate to form larger and denser flocs enabling the flocs to settle for easier removal 201 the coagulation process is commonly used by industries that apply the sedimentation process in treating their wastewater effluents generated few of these industries are not limited to agriculture aquaculture food processing beverage production paint and varnishes cement adhesives soap and detergent cosmetics leather iron and steel plastics textile and dyeing pulp and paper industries the challenge of selecting the proper coagulant for efficient treatment and the conditions for coagulation places a toll on the industries the effective coagulation process depended largely on the type of coagulant coagulant dosage the coagulant charge the mixing parameters amount and properties of impurities present in the effluent ph of the water 202 6 1 aquaculture industry a typical process flow diagram of an aquaculture wastewater treatment plant is given in fig 5 several coagulants have been applied in the treatment of wastewater generated from the aquaculture industry often the coagulation treatments are done in such a way that the clean water will be obtained for reuse while simultaneously obtaining the nutrient rich sludge for further processing as a raw material for other products e g soil conditioner fertilizer or feed for microalgae the potential of chitosan pawpaw as organic coagulants were investigated in treating the wastewater generated from this industry to encourage sustainability and efficient treatment in the industry a study discovered by yunos et al 127 used an optimum coagulant dosage of 30 mg l which resulted in algae removal efficiency of 98 this study used chitosan as a coagulant with the aim of harvesting microalgae from the catfish aquaculture sample for the treatment a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of the purchased chitosan powder from shrimp shells in 10 ml of 0 1 m hcl before stirring for 10 min till the chitosan powder dissolved completely the stock solution was further diluted with deionized water before use after the experiment the turbidity of the wastewater was also reduced from 60 ntu to 2 2 ntu it was further claimed that the supernatant water discharged could be used as recycled water or released in the water bodies 127 6 2 textile industry large volumes of water are used in every section of the textile industry in processing various types of fabric especially during the scouring bleaching washing dyeing and printing processes 203 204 fig 6 gives the flowchart of a typical textile wastewater treatment process huang et al 205 claimed that the coagulation flocculation process is commonly used in treating this type of wastewater due to its high effectiveness and economic advantages in removing the dyes additives and salts nevertheless the application of inorganic chemical coagulants contributes more to the pollution as numerous unsolicited reactions occur in the water producing huge volumes of sludge and residual chemicals thus researchers sought for the potential of natural coagulants to substitute the chemical coagulants in effectively treating and decolorizing this industrial wastewater 44 82 144 146 206 moringa oleifera lam seeds were compared with aluminium sulphate to evaluate their effectiveness in treating textile wastewater moringa oleifera lam seed of 5 0 g was titrated in 100 ml of kcl 1 0 mol l mkcl as well as 1 0 mol l nacl mnacl to obtain the seed extract the mixture was consistently stirred for 30 min and was further filtered the organic coagulants mkcl and mnacl gave their best results at an acidic ph value of 2 with a coagulation dosage of 20 000 mg l overall the moringa coagulant extracted in kcl mkcl presented the highest efficiency when compared with the other two coagulants with an 82 2 removal for the apparent color removal of 83 05 78 4 89 7 for cod rp he7b dye and op her dye respectively though the potential for using the extract of moringa oleifera seeds as coagulant was confirmed it was however noted that the cost of the treatment process is not economical due to the high coagulation dose required for effective treatment 33 6 3 agriculture industry it is highly important to remove the pollutants generated from several activities washing separating grinding and purification in the agricultural industry before disposing the water which could be potentially harmful to the human environment and aquatic habitats coagulation has been extensively applied in the treatment process some of the natural coagulants used are given in tables 2 and 3 the coagulation performance of some chemical coagulants aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were compared with natural coagulants chitosan moringa oleifera and zeolite in the palm oil milling effluent pome treatment by jagaba et al 123 in preparing the chitosan stock solution 1 5 g of the powder was dissolved in 150 ml of 0 1 m hcl and was stirred till it was dissolved the extraction process of removing the effective components for coagulation from the seed began from cleaning and grinding the seeds into powder before sieving through a mesh size of 0 8 2 5 mm the moringa seed oil was extracted with the aid of a soxhlet apparatus while the oil free cake was dissolved with distilled water after the treatment characterization and comparison were made aluminium sulphate was recognized to require the highest coagulant dose as its optimum was 4000 mg l which was followed by moringa oleifera with an optimum dose of 2000 mg l ferric chloride and zeolite equally had 1000 mg l has their optimum dosage chitosan required the least dosage of 400 mg l overall chitosan was proved to be the best as it gave the best result in removal tss at 98 95 turbidity and cod removal at 98 35 and 68 31 respectively 123 other studies also reported the efficient treatment of pome using natural coagulant the wheat germ was used as a coagulant had turbidity tss and cod reduction performance of 99 1 95 6 and 61 7 respectively 208 peanut seed coagulant which was extracted with 1 m nacl solution also achieved 93 6 and 67 0 for the tss and cod reduction respectively 209 6 4 efficiency of the wastewater treatment process parameters during wastewater treatment the efficiency of the coagulation process is judged based on its percentage removal of turbidity total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod chemical phosphorus natural organic matter nom color heavy metals and other pollutants the nature and properties of the wastewater determine the coagulants to be used and the parameters to be removed during treatment the coagulation flocculation process revolves around the destabilization of the suspended particles and clustering them to form macroflocs to enable sedimentation and filtration some properties which influence adequate coagulation activities include turbidity ph and others 6 4 1 total suspended solids tss total suspended solids tss signifies the quality of water it is the overall amount of solid material organic and inorganic matter suspended and settleable particles that can be filtered in the wastewater 210 the tss consist of an extensive variety that is not limited to industrial wastes and effluents mud animal carcass and rotting plants the suspended particles support the adhesion of metals and various harmful compounds a high concentration of suspended solids results in high turbid water which poses a challenge to the environment and the aquatic ecosystem it can reduce the penetration of sunlight into the water negatively affecting the photosynthesis process the tss is measured by filtering a water sample drying and accurately weighing the solids obtained the quantity of tss is recorded in a unit of mg l the tss reduction percentage was calculated using eq 1 1 t s s r e d u c t i o n t s s 0 t s s t s s 0 100 where tss0 is the value before treatment and tss is the value after the treatment process tamarind indica seed powder as a coagulant achieved a 24 32 removal of tss from a traditional gold mine wastewater 168 many other studies on the removal of tss from palm oil mill effluent pome includes treatment with cassia obtusifolia seed gum removed 93 22 55 treatment with moringa oleifera and chitosan removed 95 42 and 98 9 respectively 123 84 1 removal achieved after treatment with rice starch 131 other reported studies of tss removal in various industrial wastewaters can be found in table 3 6 4 2 turbidity high turbid water exhibits a cloudy appearance as a result of the impurities present it negatively affects the ecosystem environment and aquatic habitation 211 turbidity experienced in aquaculture habitat inhibits sunlight penetration and distribution of which could affect photosynthesis and the fish breeding process asides from the lowered oxygen concentration in the water which leads to stunted respiration the suspended particles could also clog the gills of the fish 212 turbidity is measured as an indicator of water quality based on its clearness and overall suspended solids in the water it is believed that higher turbidity of water lowers its quality a turbidimeter or a nephelometer is used to measure turbidity with a unit of nephelometric turbidity units ntu 213 the turbidity reduction percentage is calculated using standard method 2130b and eq 2 2 t u r b i d i t y r e m o v a l i n i t i a l t u r b i d i t y f i n a l t u r b i d i t y i n i t i a l t u r b i d i t y 100 coagulation is a principal process for treating and reducing turbidity as a result of the low concentration of stable particles water with lower turbidity is believed to be difficult to coagulate and thus to improve coagulation artificial turbidity is introduced into the water to aid the formation of denser flocs which would readily settle asrafuzzaman et al 214 studied and compared the influences of natural coagulants extracts of moringa oleifera cicer arietinum and dolichos lablab on turbidity high medium and low of synthetic water it was found that the biocoagulants gave better results with higher turbid water and a turbidity reduction efficiency of 95 89 214 khader et al 138 treated petroleum industry water with extracted solutions of radish eggplant and chickpea seed powders achieving turbidity removal of 98 785 99 42 and 95 2 respectively 138 few other natural coagulants that removed turbidity from industrial water have been highlighted in table 3 6 4 3 biochemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand bod is a principal environmental index that analyses the dissolved oxygen required by aerobic biological organisms bacteria and other microorganisms for the oxidation of organic matter present in the water body it is especially used in characterizing the concentration of natural organic matter nom in aquatic industrial wastewater treatment agricultural industries poultry animal farming and other industries that apply organic materials in their processes 215 the organic materials released into the water body results in the generation and growth of microorganisms thereby depleting the oxygen necessary for other aquatic habitats bod is analyzed by calculating the oxygen depleted in a diluted aqueous specimen incubated with microorganisms it is expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of the sample used for the incubation period 216 firstly the oxygen of the sample collected from the waterbody is measured at the beginning of the reaction the temperature is then set within 20 25 c and left in the dark for 5 days for incubation the oxygen is remeasured after the prescribed period of incubation the limitation of the bod test is a result of the 5 day incubation period which hinders its usage in making operational decisions the bod reduction percentage can be calculated using eq 3 3 b o d r e d u c t i o n b o d 0 b o d b o d 0 100 where bod0 is the value before treatment and bod the value after the treatment process bod of 91 5 was removed after the treatment of municipal wastewater with watermelon seed the watermelon seed was used as the organic coagulant and microbial filter manyuchi et al 2016 6 4 4 chemical oxygen demand cod chemical oxygen demand cod is the measurement of oxygen that is consumed by reactions in a measured sample solution the cod test can be efficiently used in measuring the number of organics in the waterbody it is an alternative test to bod as it was established due to inefficient analysis of bod which required 5 days of incubation for completion the 5220 b open reflux titrimetric method is used to determine the chemical oxygen demand cod measurement using the method usepa method 8000 it is expressed in the mass of oxygen milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of the sample mg l the cod reduction percentage was calculated using eq 4 4 c o d r e d u c t i o n c o d 0 c o d c o d 0 100 where cod0 is the value before treatment and cod the value after the treatment process the laundry wastewater treated by al gheethi et al 149 using moringa oleifera seed powder were found to initially contain high cod concentrations of 423 450 mg l this was reported to possibly be as a result of the detergent compounds present increasing the chemical reactivity between the organic substances a coagulant dosage of 90 mg l was able to reduce the cod by 42 72 the proteins existing in the moringa seed encourages its ability to degrade organic compounds which aid the degradation of organic matter and thus causing the cod removal with the aid of hydrolyses enzymes the microorganisms consume the organic compounds binded to the proteins as carbon sources it was observed that the degradation process requires a long period to allow for substantial cod removal 149 a maximum cod removal of 68 82 and 74 11 from textile industry wastewater was achieved by treatment with maize and surjana seed powders respectively 143 6 4 5 natural organic matter nom removal coagulation has been used in wastewater treatment to remove natural organic material nom from the water nom is the comprehensive name for mixtures of organic compounds contaminating the water they are substances generated from the aqueous discharges and solutions derived from rotting plant fertilizers dead organisms and animal waste 217 nom contaminates water by contributing repugnant color odor and taste to the clear water body they are also believed to serve as a means of conveying harmful materials such as organic pollutants and heavy metals they also react with chlorine resulting in the production of carcinogenic by products these substances function as a food source for bacteria thus enhancing biofilm production in the water 94 218 one of the most common and economically practicable treatment processes of removing these nom is the coagulation flocculation process the extent to which coagulation removes nom is largely dependent on the properties of organic materials existing in the water the type and dosage of coagulant and ph 34 219 during the coagulation process the natural organic materials are removed simultaneously with efficient turbidity removal coagulants aluminates ferric and their polymeric versions have been effectively used as almost all types of nom can be removed by coagulation 106 however the hydrophobic fraction humic and fulvic acid tannic acid hydrocarbons tannins and resorcinol and higher molar mass compounds of nom are more effectively removed than the hydrophilic fractions carboxylic acids carbohydrates and proteins and low molar mass compounds 220 221 analyzing the functional and structural characterization of nom present in water is a problem due to the complex properties and their differing sources measuring the total organic carbon toc is the most commonly and reliably used technique to analyze the quantity of the organic material the nom removal process during coagulation involves the mixture of neutralizing the charges entrapping adsorption and complexation of the particles with the coagulant ions to form insoluble particulate aggregate 34 few studies have been done in taking advantage of the biodegradability and other positive attributes of natural coagulants in nom removal a recent review article highlighted the use of chemically modifying chitosan as a coagulant in nom removal chitosan has been reported to effectively remove nom but its application is restricted due to its insolubility at ph values below 6 5 chitosan modification could be done to provide functional groups easily done due to the abundant free amino and hydroxyl groups present along the chain backbone that would aid synergic interaction with nom to be removed to enhance chitosan solubility for a broader ph range and to increase the molecular weight for effective bridging with nom modified chitosan has showing promising characteristics as a natural coagulant in nom removal from wastewater 106 6 4 6 phosphorus capture removal domestic industrial and urban wastewater discharged into the environment without treatment has caused a disastrous challenge to the environment and human health the accumulation of phosphorus in the soil and water is a result of the actions of these industries processes 222 223 a high percentage of phosphorus in the soil and water could lead to eutrophication which is potentially harmful to aquatic habitats polyphosphate organic phosphorus and orthophosphate are the different forms in which phosphorus appears in the surrounding 224 the detergent and their ingredients present in untreated car wash wastewater is a potential cause for environmental problems because of their toxicity to the aquatic habitat 225 also the phosphates and other elements existing in the detergents could result in the growth of excess algae in the drainage or other waterways and thus the impurities should be removed before discharge radin mohamed et al 226 examined the coagulation efficiency of using moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum as natural coagulants in the treatment of car wash wastewater moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum seeds were able to achieve a phosphorus removal of 75 and 65 respectively 226 6 4 7 color removal colorants are materials that can transfer or impart their color to the substance they are used in various industries which are not limited to textile food soap cosmetic printing painting photography plastics leather shoe and bags and paper industries 203 their primary application is to alter the color of material to make it more attractive appealing food beautiful and creative the wastewater generated from these industries consists of a high percentage of various dyes and pigments while most dyes used are soluble in water as they diffuse into the material to impart their color on the substrate pigments are water insoluble compounds and do not interact with the substrate 206 the dye is a major pollutant and its presence in water negatively affects the environment and ecosystem 227 therefore the industries must effectively treat the wastewater produced to rid it of dye additives and other pollutants before discharging into the water bodies 228 the effective decolorization and decontamination of wastewater generated from these industries using the coagulation flocculation treatment process have been reportedly studied and researched the treatment process is an important phase in removing suspended particles colorants and natural organic matter in the wastewater 139 chitosan is a biopolymer that has served as a good color removal in the work of jagaba et al 123 it had the highest color removal efficiency of 96 44 which was closely followed by moringa oleifera coagulants 123 dotto et al 33 demonstrated that the application of moringa coagulants extracted in saline solutions kcl and nacl removed the color with a high performance of 82 8 and 72 8 respectively 33 7 limitations and potential study in the use of natural coagulants although the advantages of natural coagulants are numerous they have some disadvantages one of its major limitations is that it is less effective in the coagulation process as a result of the lack of flexibility in regulating their characteristics in the production of chemical synthetic coagulants characteristics which is not limited to molecular weight charge type can be adjusted to desired property 44 studies and researches should emerge on the characteristics and behavior of the natural coagulant and the coagulation process to proffer in depth solutions to the challenge inflexibility of the natural coagulants to improve their efficiency another limitation is that they significantly increase the organic load in the water after treatment which may aid microbial activities leading to undesired implications and increasing microbial activities 166 the residual organic matter could alter the odor taste and color of the treated water thus the use of a disinfectant such as chlorine is required 126 a high microbial activity will require additional chlorine usage for disinfection purposes which further increases the cost of treatment indirectly defeating the economic advantage of using natural coagulants 229 the formation of trihalomethane generated from interactions with disinfectant chlorine is a potential hazard therefore more research should be considered on evaluating the relationship between natural coagulants and the influence on chlorine lastly compared to the chemical coagulant the green coagulant has a shorter storage life as a result of its biodegradability 44 152 as eloquently described by mohd salleh et al 128 this drawback in using natural coagulant causes extreme difficulty during coagulation and thus stimulate more intense and insightful researches that will aid the natural coagulants to effectively substitute the chemical coagulants and have a longer storage life while still maintaining the biodegradability property 128 although the numerous advantages and efficacy of applying natural coagulants has been reported by several researchers conducted in the laboratory its inability to be applied in the industry has inhibited their evolution on an industrial scale of treatment 230 8 conclusion and further works the review of the past and current use of natural coagulants has been critically analyzed in this study the coagulants have great efficiency in wastewater treatment plant based coagulants go through numerous processes before they could be used as coagulants beginning with the primary process which includes cleaning drying and sieving of the seeds and other plant parts before further treatment or application the secondary processes comprising of oil extraction and solvent distilled water salt solution extraction of the active coagulation agent however salt solution extraction was determined to be the most effective technique reduction of organic matter loading in the treated water led to further purification of the coagulant ion exchange lyophilization and membrane filtration techniques have been successfully used in purifying and isolating the coagulation protein the discharge of industrial wastewater is a great challenge to man the aquatic habitat environment and ecosystem the complexity of their treatment further arises from the varying properties of these wastes based on the type of materials used in the various industries the use of chemical coagulant for the treatment has been widely used due to its economical and effective advantages but due to its several limitations which is based on its artificial nature residual metal salts and non degradability has brought up concerns over health and the environmental risks attributed in the continual application of the synthetic coagulants the dire need for the substitution of chemical coagulant has been described as a necessity in this review thus green coagulants which are degradable natural environmentally friendly and economical have been developed as a sustainable alternative potential in the coagulation process these coagulants which are not limited to pawpaw seeds cassava moringa jatropha curcas chitosan algae tannin and others have displayed effectiveness in treating industrial generated wastewaters the application of the green coagulants denotes development in the sustainability of the industries without disruption in the quality of water human health and the environment the extraction purification applications and evaluation of plant based coagulants for an effective coagulation process was discussed comparative performance between natural and chemical coagulants in the treatment of industrial wastewater were evaluated also the influential coagulation parameters the current development on improving and purification techniques of the coagulants and probable use of dual or combine coagulants were addressed overall green coagulants effectively remove the odor ph cod bod tss and color in wastewater as a result of their non corrosive biodegradability long polymer chains ecologically beneficial properties other characteristics such as reduced generated sludge quantity high positive charge ability to upsurge floc size promote their efficacy in the treatment of wastewater which leads to reduced cost of production and treatment of wastewater generated in the industries however notable challenges identified in the use of natural coagulant has encouraged further research to develop effective green coagulants to be used in large scale industrial wastewater treatment applications some of the potential future research has also been highlighted for the possible valorization of the natural coagulants in wastewater treatment further research works are required to combat the various limitations of natural coagulants the research should focus on improving the properties of the coagulants to efficiently and optimally cleanse the wastewater additionally very limited studies have been developed on the industrial scale application of natural coagulants proper testing and optimization should be evaluated for this purpose future research should also investigate the reduction of residual organic matter cost of disinfection and storage time

13413,chemical coagulants have been extensively used in wastewater treatment from industrial processes due to their removal efficiencies notwithstanding recent studies have reported concerns over the existence of lingering or incurable diseases resulting from residues of metals from these non degradable chemical coagulants which remain in the water even after treatment the sludge produced from the treatment has also been affirmed to be hazardous and non biodegradable causing harm to the environment the potential application of plant based coagulants as suitable alternatives to chemical coagulants due to their biodegradability economical non toxic and lower sludge volume and treatment cost is being studied in industrial wastewater treatment presented in this review is the state of heart of revolutionary technique for green coagulant preparation their properties and application in wastewater treatment highlighted is the current development on improving and purification techniques of the coagulants and probable use of dual or combine coagulants the review also critically identifies notable research gaps based on the current limitations in previous research to valorizing potential applications keywords coagulation natural coagulant wastewater treatment industrial effluent 1 introduction water is one of the foremost requirements for human survival in this world as it is connected to almost all world activities in 2018 the united nations un provided a statistic that 2 billion people live in countries that encounter high water stress worsening as an increase in population and demand for water is experienced 1 the need for clean water has been one of the goals that are being fought for all over the world because inadequate access to clean water has resulted in a lot of avoidable deaths the quality of clean water encompasses the color turbidity ph nutrients odor turbidity coliform count 2 according to the world health organization who in 2017 about 2 billion people in the world drink water from sources that are likely polluted with grease metals effluents and faeces when this polluted water is disposed into the environment and large water bodies they spread infectious water borne diseases including vomiting diarrhea cholera typhoid fever dysentery gastroenteritis worm infections hepatitis virus and trachoma 3 it is estimated that polluted water causes a death rate of about 485 000 each year thus by 2025 almost half of the world s population will be suffering living in water stressed regions 4 globally the expansion of most industries has occurred due to development and commercialization it was reported that one of the negative impacts of these developments in the industries is the heightened rate at which pollutants are found in the water bodies caused by industrial pollution water is used for numerous activities and purposes in all industries and most of the water up and discharged is termed as industrial wastewater every process undergone in the industries makes use of water raw materials energy and soil which are converted to generate the products other side products and wastewater 5 based on reports by unesco 6 more than 80 of the wastewater generated globally is likely to be discharged into the environment without proper treatment 6 the uncontrolled discharge of industrial wastewater which often consists of waste generated dissolved and fine suspended solids organic and inorganic particles dyes grease oil and other impurities into the environment has increased the turbidity ph cod and bod of water these may lead to both surface and groundwater contamination which may initiate several other hazards that are detrimental to human health 7 the fertilizer industry uses water extensively as a reactant and is reported to consume up to 270 m3 of water ton of product water is used in several activities including the reaction of water with no2 to produce nitrogen fertilizers via oxidation of ammonia gas besides the production of phosphate fertilizers using the wet process also need some volumes of water as a reactant thus the amount of wastewater created is high due to the water used and discharged by every process of production 8 large volumes of wastes containing effluents are generated at regular intervals by the textile industry these effluents are highly complex as they consist of various types of dyes chemical additives suspended solid particles cod bod and high acidity 9 it is estimated that more than 10 000 different synthetic dyes and pigments are used in the textile industry 10 the colored wastewater discharged consists of a large quantity of organic load which if inadequately treated before discharging into the environment would contribute hugely to the existing pollution of the surface water and the seawater 5 due to the high level of toxicity that exhibits mutagenic characteristics it is highly dangerous to consume water contaminated with these dyes the dyes present in the water could cause risk to the human and the environment as they can be potentially mutagenic allergic toxic and carcinogenic and the salts in the wastewater could lead to soil infertility 11 its effect on the aquatic ecosystem cannot be overlooked as it distorts the photosynthesis activity even in low concentrations because the dye reduces light penetration through the water surface 12 on the other hand the agricultural industry requires a high quality of water for the processing of produce an example is the milling process of palm oil water is consumed during washing grinding and sieving processes the untreated effluent abundant waste generated is disposed into the water bodies along with the water used in the processing raw palm oil mill effluent pome is brown colored with high concentrations of tss fat lubricant cod and bod thus changing the properties of the water bodies 13 suspended and dissolved solids introduced into the water through the feeds chemicals in form of medication disinfectants anti fouling and pathogens constitute the aquaculture effluent containing solid wastes nitrogenous wastes nitrate and nitrite and phosphorus organic matter 14 15 dauda et al 15 reported that regardless of the type of fish cultivated a high volume of wastes is produced from the aquaculture industry in japan one ton of fish was estimated to generate about 0 8 kg of nitrogen n and 0 1 kg of phosphorus p which equates to the amount of waste produced by 73 people per day if each person generates 11 g of n per day 15 untreated water discharged into the environment may lead to eutrophication and thus a cost effective treatment is required because of the large volume of water needed in fish cultivation the water is commonly treated using iron chloride fecl3 as a coagulant which increases the meal load in the water recent studies are seeking sustainable and environmentally friendly treatments that will protect the aquatic habitats from harmful contaminants while using the effluent rich in nutrients as soil conditioners to improve plant growth and yield similarly in the winery industry the winemaking process which includes the cleaning crushing and fermentation of grapefruits washing the fermentation tanks and other equipment used generates huge volumes of wastewater that is characterized by high organic and nutrient content acidity and cod thus causing contamination of the environment and waterbody 16 wastewater from the food processing winery and fermentation industries are characterized to be nontoxic as they are less hazardous however the water has a high organic matter content comprising carbohydrate and other sugars these compounds could be removed from the water to use in the production of hydrogen or other useful products 17 the wastewater generated from the pulp and paper processing consists of a high percentage of bod cod chlorinated and suspended solids as they exhaustively require a large volume of water in their processes 18 furthermore in the iron and steel industry producing iron from its ores and processing coke from coal requires a large volume of water for cooling it was reported that the steel industry in an asian country consumed 25 60 m3 water ton of steel which is believed to generate wastewater with a high level of contaminant concentrations 8 this water may be polluted with contaminants such as phenols hydraulic oils ammonia particulate solids cyanide bod cod metals and acids likewise in the mining industry recent studies reported the use of up to 40 m3 of water ton of ore during processing 19 the rock washing and other mining processes generate wastewater contaminated with rock particles metals acids oils hydraulic oils and salts 20 other industries identified to generate wastewater includes petroleum consumes up to 10 300 m3 water ton of product pharmaceutical generates wastewater with high organic contaminants from the medicinal compounds solvent and other substances 21 paint and varnish 22 food and beverage processing 23 cosmetics 24 25 chemical leather and metallurgy industries notable techniques for wastewater treatment includes coagulation 26 adsorption 27 ion exchange 28 membrane separation 29 and cavitation 30 however this paper will be focusing on the coagulation flocculation method of water treatment the separation of the suspended particle requires them to cluster and sediment upon the addition of coagulants coagulation effectively destabilizes the fine particles by neutralizing the electrical repulsion charges between the colloids 31 the coagulants aid the clustering and aggregation of the colloidal particles they carry opposite charges to the particles and neutralize them allowing attraction and clustering to form macroflocs chemical coagulants have been effectively used in coagulation treatment based on their application for a vast range of wastewater the coagulants react in the water and hydrate to produce metal hydrate precipitates acting as a sweep floc mechanism this mechanism backs the coagulant to effectively treat very difficult and almost impossible colloids in water however the chemical coagulants have been referenced to be hazardous due to the residual metals precipitates after the reaction 26 this has been found to cause health social economic and environmental challenges as it was discovered to be related to illness which includes alzheimer s disease abdominal spasms dementia intestinal constipation 32 33 the large amount of hazardous sludge containing metal salts generated after the treatment process may require additional removal techniques before disposal thereby increasing the treatment cost 34 the process flow diagram of a typical effluent treatment plant is shown in fig 1 the first process involves the accumulation of the various waste from the different sections of the industry into the collection tank 35 the effluent is further moved to the storage tank where the wastewater is stored before the treatment process takes place there are various blower pipes present in this unit to create additional airflow and proved enhanced aeration efficiency a paddle mixer is used for mixing and the mixing parameters may be varied the cooling tower is also used to bring down the temperatures 36 the treatment process continues with the neutralization of ph with chemicals that reduce the acidity or alkalinity of the medium the coagulation process begins with the introduction of coagulants in form of natural plant and animal based or chemical coagulants aluminum sulphate alum sodium aluminate ferric sulphate lime 37 after coagulation biological treatment is conducted in the biological oxidation tank the process involves the degradation of the natural organic matter nom contaminants in the wastewater by microorganisms the microorganisms feed on the nom in the presence of oxygen and nutrients which is aided by the establishment of an artificial ecosystem 38 here the bod of the wastewater and other toxic impurities are broken down and converted to carbon dioxide 39 the next process is the sedimentation of the particles and separation of sludge before transferring the residual solution for filtration in the pressure filter which consists of a filtration layer made up of sand rock filters the wet sludge to separate the remnant water from it 40 the final process of the effluent treatment is to check the final load of effluent in the water before discharging it to the environment recently the inclination has shifted towards research and development of natural coagulants for efficient wastewater treatment due to the numerous limitations in the use of synthetic coagulants discovered numerous review papers have been published on the use of natural coagulants for water treatment gautan and saini 41 stated some of the advantages and disadvantages of natural coagulant in industrial effluent treatment but failed to highlight the purification and methods to improve the coagulant efficiency also saleem and bachmaan 42 provided the historical use contemporary review of plant based coagulant chemistry but didn t address the recent techniques that are used in purification and isolation of the active coagulant agents for improved treatment performance this review highlights a critical discussion on the extraction purification applications and evaluation of plant based coagulants for an effective coagulation process hence comparative performance evaluation between green coagulant and chemical coagulants in the treatment of industrial wastewater were discussed furthermore parameter optimization of factors that influence green coagulant performance in industrial wastewater treatment was reviewed several coagulants used in industrial wastewater treatments were compared and their optimum coagulation parameters were highlighted in this review projections and prospects on valorization green coagulant production and application were identified 2 coagulation process the coagulation flocculation process is an indispensable factor in water treatment it is the most used chemical treatment for both water and wastewater as it efficiently reduces the turbidity suspended solids oil organic matter color and chemical oxygen demand cod in the water it requires the introduction of substances that aids the clustering of finer particles in the water into larger flocs for effective removal from the water coagulation and flocculation are inter linked coagulation is the agglomeration of suspended colloidal particles in water it is a chemical process that involves the neutralization of the negative charge of the dispersed materials in the wastewater 43 while flocculation is a physical process it is the formation of flocs or flakes from the suspended colloids in the water it is majorly conducted by high molecular weight compounds aiding the aggregation and settling of the flocs formed during the coagulation process thus coagulation forms the larger flocs and flocculation causes the flocs to aggregate and settle at the bottom of the water body after the coagulation flocculation process the treatment process further undergoes filtration and sedimentation processes to remove the effluent from the water 44 however it was also reported that the process might still require further treatments which include filtration sedimentation oxidation and physical or chemical disinfection for complete treatment 45 this depends on the properties of the fine suspended particles in the water they vary in source compositions density sizes shape it is important to have a complete coagulation process as it would affect ensuing processes incomplete coagulation will lead to incomplete flocculation to further result in an ineffective sedimentation process as shown in fig 2 the untreated water undergoes coagulation when the coagulants are introduced to it a vigorous mixing process is required to aid the floc formed to cluster into larger flocs the swift mixing distributes the coagulant uniformly through the waterbody a slower mixing follows to aid inter particle bridging of the flocs 46 the coagulation process efficiency depends strongly on the coagulant type mixing rate and settling time which determines the quality of the water the dosage coagulant has to be optimum and intensely mixed for proper suspension of the solid particles other characteristics of the coagulants include its quality and lifespan which determines the stability during storage 47 after the coagulation flocculation process the water undergoes sedimentation the larger solid particles sink by gravitation settling to the bottom of the vessel this step is often dependent on the rate of settling of the particles flotation or settling time and time allowed for sedimentation the filtration process takes place after the sedimentation the sediments effluents are separated from the clean water often by passing them through various filters or membranes the bulk of the suspended solids are removed in the top portion of the filter media the particles trapped within the filter bed are usually removed by backwashing the filters 48 the rapid dual media filter is the most commonly used filter type in the conventional wastewater treatment process it is composed of sand and anthracite nevertheless other filtration media which is not limited to the mono media sand only multi media sand anthracite and garnet may also be applied in the filtration process 49 the solid sludge generate is transferred to the sludge bed dried and prepared for disposal or recycling in the form of fertilizers or manures the clean water is then transferred for further disinfection which varies according to the intended application for the water the final process is storage the treated water is often stored before use it is however believed that water that contains more nitrogen phosphorus and potassium elements should not be stored for too long as it aids the production of algae and the growth of other microorganisms 50 2 1 mechanism of coagulation in removing particles from wastewater it is inefficient and discouraged to remove small particles that are suspended in the water or do not settle properly as they might pass through the filters during the filtration process thus a coagulation process is required to clog the fine particles together to form larger flocs which will be easier to separate from the water after settling 51 the suspended particles averagely larger than 1 0 μm in the water also contain colloidal particles which are very small with an extremely large surface area they are generally invisible to the eyes but are larger than atoms with a size ranging from 0 001 to 1 0 μm 52 the coagulant added to the water destabilizes the particles resulting in their entrapment to form larger flocs the four principal mechanisms for destabilizing the colloids during coagulation include sweep flocculation particle entrapment double layer compression charge neuralization and polymer adsorption and interparticle bridging 31 54 the action of the coagulation polymers is based on either destabilization or interparticle bridging the mechanisms could be studied and identified through fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses 55 a schematic diagram of coagulation mechanisms is shown in fig 3 the sweep flocculation is involved with the coagulant trapping the suspended particles and causing them to settle at the bottom in the work of okuda et al 56 a coagulant solution extracted from moringa seed using the salt solution 1 m nacl was used in the coagulation of synthetic kaolin water the ca2 and other bivalent cations seemed to have connected with the molecule of the active coagulation component in the moringa extracted solution to form a net like structure based on the formed net like structure it was concluded that the sweep flocculation i e the enmeshment of the kaolin mechanism was predominantly operated on as it was responsible for the coagulation 56 57 while double layer compression is the process that aids the fine particles to overcome the force of repulsion and cluster together when induced by the presence of high concentrations of salt compounds electrolytes in the colloidal suspension the added ions divalent and trivalent ions carrying opposite charges penetrate the diffused double layer that surrounds the colloids causing it to increase in density and smaller volume 58 59 this leads to generating repulsive electrostatic reactions that are affected by attractive van der waals forces resulting in steeper electrostatic potential gradients 60 as the net repulsive energy decreases and reaches elimination the particles approach each other and cluster the charge neutralization mechanism is cited to involve the destabilization of the suspended particles using opposite charged electric ions to attract them the particle charges neutralize and the electrostatic repulsion lessens or reaches complete elimination flocculation then occurs as the suspended colloids cluster to form larger flocs 61 this mechanism is observed to be involved when aloe vera gel was used as a coagulant in treating tannery wastewater the presence of the galacturonic acid ions ionizes to produce h ions which aids charge neutralization of the anionic colloidal particles 62 63 this mechanism was also reported for the active coagulation agent of moringa oleifera seed the protein was found to have high contents of glutamine arginine with positively charged amino acids of nearly low molecular weight 64 furthermore the polymer adsorption and bridging mechanism occur when the long chained coagulant polymers destabilize the colloidal particles as they form bridges that extend between them the polymer molecules attach to the surface of multiple particles by adsorption producing strong clusters of macro flocs as the colloidal particles are tied together via bridging 54 the adsorption and bridging mechanism were hypothesized to be the primary coagulation mechanism for cactus opuntia as well as cassia obtusifolia seed gum which is a non ionic natural polymer and serves as an effective bridging coagulant in acidic solution 55 for cactus notable literature reported the possibility of carbohydrate primarily the galacturonic acid which is a major constituent of pectin existing primarily in polymeric form provides the bridge for the adsorption of the colloidal particles 65 66 nirmali seed extracts were also reported to be anionic polyelectrolytes that use the interparticle bridging mechanism to destabilize the particles in the water 67 the colloidal particles are attached to the polymerlike material mucilage from the cactus the adsorption may occur through hydrogen or dipole interactions the natural electrolytes divalent cations from the cactus pads are believed to be highly crucial to coagulation involving anionic colloidal particles as they aid the coagulation process 59 68 the coagulation mechanisms explain the reactions between the colloidal particles and the coagulant added resulting in the destabilization and neutralization of the ionic charges of the particles and they are reported to be dependent on coagulation dosage 69 during the coagulation process a long chain polymer or polyelectrolyte imported as the coagulant possessed an opposite charge to the suspended particles in the water 53 the coagulant added is intensely mixed to dissolve and evenly distribute throughout the water body while promoting particle collisions incomplete coagulation may occur when there is inadequate mixing also over mixing or aggressive mixing affects coagulation which may break the interparticle bridging and lead to restabilization 31 the suspended particles begin to aggregate together immediately the coagulants successfully neutralizes the charges and flocs are formed the flocculation process promotes the clustering of the flocs in the water medium after the thorough rapid mixing a moderate mixing signifies the beginning of the flocculation process the reduced surface charge of the particles and the increased electrical attraction between them results in the flocculation 44 the particle sizes increase as the particles cluster and aggregate the suspended particles are now more clearly seen as the particles collide and interact together the larger flocs are formed they start to settle at the bottom of the water body in preparation for the sedimentation process most natural coagulants are reported to function based on the charge neutralization mechanism however the zeta potential analysis and electron microscopy images of the flocs produced could give more information on the predominant mechanism exhibited by the coagulant 70 3 classification of coagulants coagulants applied in wastewater treatments are classified majorly into two groups synthetic coagulants and natural coagulants 71 they are introduced into the coagulation system to destabilize the colloidal particles to enhance their aggregation to form larger flocs other types of coagulants include coagulant aids and enhanced coagulants they are applied to enhance the formation of flocs by adding density to the flocs 72 3 1 synthetic coagulants the most frequently applied chemical inorganic coagulants in water treatments are iron and aluminium salts and organic polymers the iron or aluminium based coagulants are economical widely available and can be used for a large array of water and wastewater treatments due to their effectiveness in the removal of most types of solid particles after its addition to the water the chemicals which have high positively charged neutralizes the negatively charged colloids forming aluminium or iron precipitates 43 73 their efficiency in coagulation is a result of their capacity to develop polynuclear complexes which increases the coagulation performance as the ions are effectively absorbed onto the negative surface of the colloids of the particles 31 74 the particles clog together and settle in the process of cleansing the water the chemical coagulants that have been broadly used in the industrial wastewater treatments are not limited to aluminium sulphate alum 75 polyaluminium chloride 76 ferric chloride 77 78 ferrous sulphate 79 and lime 80 however it has been reported that they may alter the ph of water as they deplete alkalinity therefore lime or soda ash is added to maintain the desired water ph 81 other disadvantages and limitations include high volumes of sludge production the presence of residual metals in the sludge 44 82 the effective application of inorganic coagulants is greatly dependent on the dosage an excess of the metals in the effluent will cause harm to human health the environment and the ecosystem because of their corrosive property the treatment process requires using corrosion resistant equipment and apparatus and the solid effluents to be disposed of must be treated and discarded in an appropriate method the sludge produced after coagulation has been reported to be toxic and while being generated in large quantities it was also noted that aluminium based synthetic coagulants leave aluminium salt as a residue which is a neurotoxic product thus continued exposure to water containing this residue leads to alzheimer s disease 33 the advantages and disadvantages of notable chemical coagulants have been highlighted in table 1 organic polymer coagulants pre hydrolyzing metallic salts are widely used coagulants in water treatment they are polymeric coagulants with exceptional characteristics that have been made to be although the coagulants are fitted from the inorganic coagulants they are hydrophilic compounds and have the same characteristics as natural coagulants environmentally friendly and non toxic to the humans and ecosystem a limitation these sets of coagulants have is that they are not effective in all conditions of wastewater treatment thus they are often mixed with inorganic coagulants for effective treatment the polymeric coagulants are majorly polymers that have high molecular weight and are long chained they can be applied as the primary coagulant or used as a coagulant alongside inorganic metal coagulants as it is in the case of negatively charged polymers their basicity is one of the most significant characteristics of polymeric coagulants 104 other advantages over inorganic coagulants include the fact that their application is required in lesser dosages they have little effect on ph as they have lesser alkalinity absorption a cleaner and lesser volume of sludge is formed as the coagulants treat the water without producing additional solids metal hydroxide precipitate 105 106 however some of their limitations include its highly expensive cost when compared with inorganic coagulants also the suitable polymer to be used as to be selected for efficient coagulation process few of these polymeric coagulants pacl pici pfc and pfs are highlighted and discussed in table 1 other synthetic cationic polymers used as chemical coagulants include aminomethyl polyacrylamide 107 polyalkylene 108 polyamine 109 and polyethlenimine 110 overall the applications of the chemical coagulants have been established as they are widely used in wastewater treatment due to their proven performance availability and cost effectiveness their limitations that have been recurrently stated are voluminous sludge generated as a result of their various side reactions which further makes the handling disposal or recycling of the sludge difficult 55 other common disadvantages include the residual metal salts left after the treatment process especially if over dosing occurred the consumption of alkalinity by the coagulants especially the iron based coagulants increases the cost of treatment due to the required substances added to balance the ph 111 3 2 natural coagulants natural green coagulants are commonly used for wastewater treatment to generate and remove sludge they have the benefits of greatly maintain ph as they do not deplete alkalinity unlike the chemical metal based coagulants they do not add metals to the effluents generated a lower volume of sludge is also formed which reduces the cost of disposing of the sludge obtained there are different sources of organic coagulants which include the plant animals and microorganisms which has been illustrated in table 2 2 the plant based coagulants are obtained from the seeds leaves bark of trees fruit wastes and other sources the plant based coagulants have been more researched than the other two sources because of their wide availability numerous natural coagulants previously studied include moringa seed jatropha curcas 112 banana peel 113 cassava peel starch 114 pawpaw 115 watermelon 116 beans 117 okra 118 nirmali seeds 53 the preparation process of producing natural coagulant powder from the seeds is shown in fig 4 examples of coagulants are sourced from animal bone shell extracts the exoskeleton of shellfish extracts chitin and chitosan chitosan is a natural high molecular polymer cellulose like biopolymer derived from the deacetylation of chitin they are obtained from shells of crabs shrimps lobsters diatoms insects fungi marine and freshwater sponges and mollusks the potential of chitosan as a natural coagulant has been researched extensively 122 it is presumed that this type of coagulant has very minimal toxicity which makes it less harmful to be disposed of as residue either along with the sludge or water 96 chitosan has been studied in treating wastewater generated in the textile industry agricultural industry 123 food processing 124 soap and detergent 23 paper mill 125 and other industries 126 127 chitosan is highly favored as a coagulant because when added to an acidic solution it reacts and emits positive charges which interact with the negative charges of the suspended colloids 128 compared to the inorganic coagulant alum green coagulants function better at specific ph conditions alum could function at all ph conditions however it was found that both types of coagulants needed an adjustment to their ph before or after the coagulation process but the green coagulant has a lower probability of producing water with extreme ph because ph alteration does not occur during treatment 129 130 the advantages of using green coagulants are quite numerous and are not limited to their positive impact on the environment and the ecosystem because of their low toxicity levels and high biodegradability which ensures the safety of human health and aquatic life they also do not generate secondary pollution and are environmentally friendly 72 few green coagulants are used in wastewater treatment and their optimum parameters are given in table 3 some of the parameters varied included ph turbidity coagulant dosage reaction time and temperature to obtain the optimum parameters for treatment other coagulants used in wastewater treatment includes psyllium plantago ovata seed 152 okra mucilage 153 peanut arachis hypogaea 154 soybean glycine max 53 cowpea vigna unguiculate 155 156 banana papaya neem leaf powder 157 although various studies on using agricultural based coagulants in wastewater treatment gave satisfying results its inefficiency is exhibited in the treatment of highly turbid wastewater i e 800ntu it was noted that the highly turbid water requires treatment with high coagulant doses which invariably increases the biological and chemical load on water coupled with over dosage which may further stunt turbidity 54 also for its application in the industry the economical aspect must be considered by studying the feasibility of designing large scale treatment plants during studies using synthetic water 4 natural coagulant preparation during coagulation the natural coagulants are usually used directly in powder form or as a stock solution their methods of preparation vary based on their sources and their compositions 42 as shown in fig 4 the seeds or other plant parts are cleansed to remove contaminants that would negatively affect the coagulation process cut chop peeled soaked from other sources dried before grinding or milling after the milling process the powder is then sieved with the desired mesh sizes and re blended if necessary 158 159 sometimes during preparation oil is extracted from the agricultural seeds moringa oleifera seed was reported to have a high oil content of about 30 40 and 35 for jatropha curcas seeds 160 161 the oil present in the material increases the organic matter in the water hence an oil extraction process is required to purify the seed coagulant the oil free cake is then used in the coagulation process or for further purification 162 several studies involving studying the effect of seed oil extraction on the coagulation process have justified the higher performance of oil free seeds on turbidity removal improved ph range and color removal 163 generally the soxhlet extraction methods are used in the extraction process with hexane being the most used solvent including ethanol and acetone oil extraction before crude extract preparation is highly recommended to improve coagulation activities at lower dosages 164 165 results of oil free moringa oleifera mo seed extract gave a better coagulation efficiency of more than 30 when compared to the oil contained extract in the study done by garcia fayos et al 164 soxhlet extraction was observed to give a higher oil extraction yield than the batch method procedure which was used alongside also compared to the other solvents acetone and hexane ethanol oil free extract required significantly lower coagulation dosage which results in its high efficiency 164 in a study of the removal of dye color from the textile wastewater using basil seed mucilage by shamsnejati et al 144 the basil seeds were first cleansed of foreign impurities and immersed in water at a temperature 50 c containing 0 9 nacl solution the contents were mixed for 1 h till the seeds completely swelled a rough plate was used to scrape the gum layer of the seed surface and the mucilage was separated from the seeds with the aid of a 500 micron steel filter it was gathered and used as a coagulant for wastewater treatment 144 coagulant was produced from tamarind indica ti seed by washing the seeds with clean water to rid them of dust and pulp the cleansed seeds were further dried in the shade for 24 h before removing the seed coat by treating it with hydrochloric acid after drying the seeds were ground with a grinding machine to obtain the ti powder which was used as the coagulant 145 chestnut and acorn seeds coagulant used in the removal of turbidity were prepared by dissolving the prepared ground powder in distilled water or nacl to extract the active coagulant element the mixture was stirred for 10 min before filtering with the aid of a filter paper 166 in extracting pectin from orange peel to apply as a coagulant in wastewater treatment the peel was removed from fresh orange fruit obtained and the pith was detached from the peel with the aid of a laboratory knife the pith was dried at room temperature until all moisture is evaporated four spoons of lemon sourced citric acid were added to approximately 227 g of the dried pith it was left in a position for 1 h before the addition of 2 cups of water and left in that position for the next 1 h the combination was heated for 10 min after which it was left to cool and was strained using a muslin cloth the pectin is the filtrate extracted from the pith of the orange peel which could be used directly as a coagulant in the wastewater treatment process 148 for preparing coagulant from jatropha curcas seeds the skin on the seeds was removed manually before selecting the seeds of good quality the kernel obtained was ground using an electric blender to a fine powder 63 500 μm in obtaining the active ingredients the coagulant was prepared by mixing 5 g of the powder with 100 ml of distilled water at room temperature for several minutes before filtering the suspension obtained using a muslin cloth 129 similarly sesamum indicum seeds were washed with de ionized water to remove impurities after separating and confiscating the bad ones the samples were dried at room temperature for 2 weeks to ensure the preservation of the physicochemical characteristics of the seeds it was then ground to a particle size of almost 300 μm in preparing the coagulant oil was extracted from the milled sample using n hexane for the extraction of the coagulant 10 g of the oil free sample was dissolved in 250 ml of salt solution and underwent constant agitation with the aid of a magnetic stirrer for 1 h and heated up to a temperature of 70 c after the reaction the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was dried at room temperature it was reground and deposited in a sealed vessel for future application 134 in the preparation of mo coagulant the seed pods that are matured and dried by natural means to a brown color were collected from the tree the pods were opened to extract the seeds from the pods they undergo sun drying while the external shells were also removed matured seeds showing the absence of discoloration and softening were used after the sun drying process the seed kernel was extracted from the external shell which was milled using a grinder to achieve the seed kernel in the treatment of textile wastewater by ramesh et al 145 mo powder was mixed with distilled water and used directly as a coagulant 4 1 extraction of coagulation solution based on studies it was discovered that using the powdered seed directly as a natural coagulant contributes to the sludge volume generated as well as lowers the turbidity removal efficiency of the coagulant 167 hence to remove unwanted organic components that the natural seed powders contribute to increased organic content in the water additional treatments are applied to isolate the active coagulation agents in the seeds 168 distilled water and saline solution are the commonly used suitable methods to extract the active coagulant agent abidin et al 129 achieved a turbidity removal of 99 using distilled water extracted jatropha curcas seed in treating kaolin synthetic water the coagulant active ingredients were extracted by mixing 5 g of the seed powder with 100 ml of distilled water at room temperature for several minutes the resulting suspension was filtered through the muslin cloth 129 studies have determined that extraction of active coagulation agents from seed powders using salt solutions was more efficient when compared to the distilled water extraction salt solutions generally demonstrated better efficiency over distilled water in wastewater treatment as detected by dalvand et al 169 they act as a polyelectrolyte during the coagulation the most common salts used to prepare the saline solutions are sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl sodium nitrate nano3 potassium nitrate kno3 and ammonium chloride nh4cl 167 170 in the study of coagulation activity zygia cauliflora of seed extract by domingues et al 171 the coagulants were extracted from the seed using distilled water and saline solutions which were prepared at 1 0 m and 5 0 m nacl concentration the most efficient extraction solution was determined to be the coagulant prepared with 1 0 m nacl it showed effectiveness of 30 4 and 74 5 removal of color and turbidity respectively 171 elsayed et al 172 compared the coagulation performance of active coagulants from the natural seeds bean lima bean lentil and fenugreek extracted using different solvents distilled water nacl and naoh the seeds powder 5 g were mixed with 50 ml of the solvents for 1 h at a temperature of 40 c the resulting suspension was then centrifuged with the clear solutions used the coagulant in the water treatment comparing the effects of the different solvents on coagulation activity the coagulant extracted with 0 3 m nacl demonstrated a higher coagulation efficiency above 75 for the coagulants prepared with the saline solutions the increase in the concentration of the salts led to higher extraction of the active coagulation agent which was believed to be protein the coagulation performance continuously increased until a certain point this was supported by the increase in the solubility of the protein in the presence of salt and its precipitation in an excess salt solution 172 birima et al 170 demonstrated the higher performance effectiveness of peanut seed coagulant extracted with nacl pss over the coagulant extracted with distilled water psd the two coagulants were used to treat the turbid water at the same dosage of 20 mg l the pss coagulant effectively removed turbidity by 92 while the psd coagulants exhibited a lower turbidity removal performance of 31 5 at the same dosage 170 another study by de souza et al 82 involving the extraction of cactus mucilage textile effluent treatment supported the effectiveness of nacl and kcl over nano3 in turbidity removal the effects of the three salt solutions on the coagulation activity were studied nacl and kcl achieved maximum turbidity removal of 92 and 94 respectively it was noteworthy that nacl when compared with kcl is more economical with less toxicity and is easily accessible 82 although using the extracted active solution is highly efficient coagulation efficiency might decline due to the microbial decomposition of the organic materials during storage thus it is preferred to prepare and use fresh coagulants directly to evade the aging effects on the solution 172 previous studies have identified a setback in the coagulation activity of natural coagulants due to the presence of other components asides from the active coagulation agents these materials rich in plant tissue tend to increase the organic load in the treated water causing a deficiency to the treatment this can be minimized or prevented by further purifying the coagulant proteins 173 4 2 isolation purification and identification of proteins the lower shelf life of water treated with seed crude extracts has been attributed to the presence of high organic matter loads isolation and purification of the active coagulating agent from the crude extracts reduce the organic loads in the treated water 174 in the removal of cyanobacteria from surface water by camacho et al 32 the dissolved organic matter was discovered to increase irrespective of the extractions done both oil extraction with ethanol and salt solution nacl extraction however salt solution extracted mo was able to remove aromatic organic matter up to 50 32 previous studies have identified the purified natural coagulants extract by protein precipitation chemical solvents isoelectric heavy metal ions dialysis 175 176 ion exchange chromatography 177 178 and membrane filtration ultra micro nanofiltration reverse osmosis 179 181 these techniques are dodged because it adds to the overall cost of water treatment the technologies separate the active coagulants from contaminants by their molecular weights size ph and electric charge using membranes centrifugation and adsorbents table 4 gives some of the advantages and disadvantages of the purification techniques ion exchange techniques use molecular charge to separate the cationic coagulant from anionic and non ionic contaminants the difference in the charges charge density and distribution on the surfaces of the substances causes the different degrees of interaction with the ion exchanger which leads to separation ionic strength and ph are conditions that could be varied to control these interactions 182 a study by taiwo et al 183 discovered a significant reduction in turbidity and organic load resulting in 58 18 total coliform reduction in the study moringa oleifera mo seed purified using the ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography was used in water treatment sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds page and gel filtration were used to analyze the subunit and native molecular weight which were determined as 14 2 kda and 30 3 kda respectively the lyophilization technique separates the coagulant from the contaminant by free the crude extract followed by extracting and drying the supernatant at low temperatures through a vacuum the potential of using ultrafiltration as a purification method for natural coagulants was studied by prodanović et al 181 ultrafiltration membranes removed molecules that inhibited high turbidity removal the crude extracts were separated into 4 fractions 5 30 kda the organic load in phaseolus vulgaris seed treated water was minimized up to 50 when the 4th fraction the contents were predominantly protein with molecular weight 50 60 kda was used as a coagulant compared to the organic load 66 of crude extract treated water it also had the highest coagulation activity of 75 similar to the crude extract coagulation activity 181 a combination of one or more purification technique was used by choudhary and neogi 184 in the purification isolation and identification of mo protein for water treatment chemical precipitation using ammonium sulphate was used for isolation of the active coagulant from the contaminants purification of the isolated proteins was done using the dialysis tube dialysis with molecular wight 1 kda to remove the ammonium sulphate lyophilization was finally used to achieve a stable powdered form of the proteins the isolated samples were freeze dried at 80 c and placed in the lyophilizer for 2 days the pure protein powder obtained was 9 of the initial 5 g of the mo seed powder used the proteins had a high turbidity removal efficiency of 88 identification using sds page analysis also showed that isolated proteins with lower molecular weight 36 kda had the highest coagulation properties because of their 100 turbidity removal and without increasing the organic load in the water 184 4 3 composite coagulants reports have mentioned that solely using natural coagulants have a slight possibility of yielding poor performance in wastewater treatment 126 128 the solution to this challenge has been sought by producing composite or hybrid coagulants the coagulants are combined with either natural or chemical coagulants 96 189 several successful applications of composite coagulants in wastewater treatment has shown improved treatment performances a study by ravikumar and udayakumar 190 developed an environmentally friendly composite coagulants by combining bentonite clay bc and moringa oleifera mo seed extract 5 g l dose of the coagulant was able to remove heavy metals cadmium chromium and lead with up to 99 99 efficiency after 40 min of rapid mixing and 15 min of slow mixing characterization of the composites showed that the bc and mo biopolymer physicochemically interacted with each other during the preparation the biopolymer is grafted into the bentonite clay structure thereby introducing functional groups o h c h c o and c n stretches that assist coagulation process to the spectra the biopolymer molecules were captured between the clay structure layers which protects the molecules from enzymatic reactions of microorganism on it thus the challenge of low shell life face by the mo biopolymer is treated as the composite shelf life is increased to more than two years 190 it is irrefutable that composite coagulants have the ability to reduce the chemical coagulant dosage which would lessen its toxic effect and tackle other negative drawbacks when compared with pacl the chitosan based composite coagulant produced by yang et al 191 showed lower dosage wider application ph range better removal efficiency and produced sludge with lower toxicity the coagulant s performance were ascribed to the enhanced positive charges and higher molecular weight 191 the application of composite coagulant was also able to overcome the problem of weak flocs a positive result on the increased floc size growth rate and recoverability of the flocs was achieved 189 the economical advantage of using the composite coagulants while exhibiting excellent performance makes them a good potential for industrialization and commercialization 5 parameters varied to determine the efficacy of the coagulants on the coagulation activity in the evaluation of coagulant and its efficiency in water treatment several parameters are varied to determine the optimum parameter values that will give the highest efficiency these coagulation operating factors have huge impacts on the reactions present during the coagulation processes as they influence the efficiency and effectiveness of the coagulants in the wastewater treatment processes cheng et al 192 implied that total suspended solids tss clear color turbidity total organic carbon toc temperature and ph are parameters that are evaluated to gauge the efficiency of the coagulation process 5 1 effect of coagulation dosage a good coagulant is characterized by having a very high positive charge to neutralize the negative charge exhibited by the fine particles present in the water body a comparatively low molecular weight to aid proper diffusion of the cationic charges around the particles to intensify dispersion of the coagulant in the water bodies the selection of the optimum coagulant dosage is a very essential parameter in coagulation the required coagulant dose will effectively aggregate the suspended particulates in the water coagulation dosage affects the efficiency of the wastewater coagulation process in such a way that a dosage lower to the optimum will inhibit proper removal of the effluent while overdosage results in increased turbidity organic matter and higher slurry volume and thus leading to a high cost of treatment 193 several researchers have studied the effects of varying the coagulation dosages to obtain the optimum for efficient treatment jagaba et al 123 in the treatment of pome to reduce the turbidity and color varied the coagulant dosage from 500 5000 mg l obtaining an optimum coagulation dosage of 2000 mg l which gave turbidity cod tss color and oil grease removals of 88 30 38 60 95 42 90 15 87 05 respectively however lower optimum dosage values of the moringa seed powder have been reported by several other researchers muruganandam et al 54 reduced the turbidity of raw tannery effluent by 59 43 at optimum dosage of 15 mg l a closer value of 20 mg l was also reported by ramesh et al 194 dehghani et al 75 also achieved 70 mg l as the optimal dosage after treating the oil refinery wastewater the dosage removed cod turbidity and tss up to 38 60 63 70 and 62 05 respectively ernest et al 116 reported the optimal dosage of watermelon seed to be 0 6 g l after varying between 0 2 1 0 g l to remove the turbidity and color of river water the optimal dosage had an efficiency of 86 turbidity and 82 7 color removals table 3 gives some of the optimal coagulant dosages as it is common with green coagulants the percentage turbidity reduction increases as the coagulant dosages increase towards the optimum coagulant dosage and beyond which increase in coagulant dosage leads to a decreased turbidity reduction 54 therefore it is important to use the jar test in the laboratory scale to study the effect of varying dosages to determine the optimal 5 2 effect of ph ph is the measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of the water which value is between 1 14 it can be measured with the aid of a ph meter the charge on the amphoteric coagulant molecules is often highly dependent on the ph values in the wastewater undergoing treatment 195 alkalinity is measured to determine the capacity to neutralize an acid in the coagulation process it dominates the efficiency at which the chemicals react with the water and affect the destabilization process most chemical coagulants especially ferric based salts consume a high percentage of alkalinity it is believed that lower alkalinity generates poor floc formation which needs the addition of alkalinity sources some of which include soda ash or lime or caustic soda to the water the ph value outside the range of the optimum ph results in the generation of a mixture of positive and negative charges of the amino acid in the protein which may lead to the reduction of the net cationic efficiency of the coagulant in the coagulation process the ph value of the medium has a huge influence on the protein molecule ionic charges hence it determines the amount of coagulant required for an efficient coagulation process and thus ph adjustment should be done before proceeding with the coagulation process 23 the most commonly used chemicals for lowering and increasing acidity are sodium chloride nacl and h2so4 respectively other chemicals can be used to increase the ph values such as sodium carbonate hydroxides of calcium ammonia and magnesium while hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid also highly effect decreasing the ph of the water however the addition of these chemicals may increase the ph beyond the needed value requiring additional adjustment of the ph to obtain proper floc formation in the case of water with higher alkalinity an extremely higher coagulant dosage could be needed to low the ph to the optimal ph for effective coagulation regrettably the extra addition of coagulant doses could lead to the exorbitant cost of treatment as a result of disposing of the enormous sludge generated the ph was varied between 5 9 when using the mucilage of cactus to remove turbidity and cod of tannery effluent by muruganandam et al 54 51 50 and 59 35 removal were obtained for the turbidity and cod at an optimal ph of 7 the cactus based coagulant was neither denatured by the acidic nor the alkaline conditions and thus the neutral ph is the most effective and more preferred the optimal ph value of 7 7 5 for watermelon seed coagulants is concluded from researches conducted 116 140 141 the amino acid in the moringa oleifera and jatropha curcas protein coagulants are more effective in acidic conditions this is supported by various studies using moringa oleifera sasikala et al 196 revealed that the positive charges on the amino acids that constitute the coagulant are dominating and effectively works as a cationic coagulant it is believed that almost all amino acids present in seed proteins have positive charges at ph values of less than 3 and higher than 11 which was observed in the turbidity removal of about 99 while using moringa oleifera jatropha curcas seed extract as the coagulant they obtained a turbidity removal of 99 at an optimal ph value of 3 after varying from 1 to 12 although exceptions such as boulaadjoul et al 57 reported an optimum ph range of 6 8 after treating wastewater from paper mill reduced the turbidity by 97 which implies that the protein coagulant is still relevant for treating a wide range of ph abidin 197 expected that most of the amino acids present in the jatropha curcas seed protein have isoelectric point values from 3 2 to 11 suggesting that the coagulant works effectively as a positively charged coagulant agent at a ph of relatively 3 another efficient removal of the petroleum industrial waste was studied by khader et al 138 using cicer arietinum seed eggplant seed and radish seeds the ph of the coagulants was varied from 2 to 11 with optimal achieved at 7 the optimal gave turbidity removal of 98 2 98 7 98 2 cod 95 91 8 92 6 and oil removals of 83 80 87 for cicer arietinum seed eggplant seed and radish seeds respectively the ph values below and above 7 caused decreased removal efficiency 138 5 3 effect of initial turbidity turbidity is an essential factor that affects effective wastewater treatment it is a visual property of water due to its close association with the color of the water the presence of suspended solid particles in the water induces turbidity resulting in the absence of clarity abundant microorganisms soil organic matter colored compounds dye decaying matter plankton and algae cause the turbid water to look cloudy murky and undesirable 198 the increasing rate of turbidity is simultaneous to the increase in effluent thus turbidity and solid particles are a challenge in wastewater treatment 199 the effect of initial turbidity on the coagulation performance using jatropha curcas as coagulant was studied by abidin et al 129 the kaolin wastewater samples were set at initial turbidities ranging from 100 to 8000 ntu the turbidity removal for all initial turbidity values was higher than 98 4 it was reported that the maximum turbidity removal was achieved at 500 ntu at 99 5 there was an increase in turbidity removal from 100 up to 500 ntu which was followed by slightly decreased removal performance as the initial turbidity increased up to 8000 ntu it was thus concluded that jatropha curcas is a natural coagulant applicable for wastewater treatment of a wide range of initial turbidity abidin et al 2011 5 4 effect of stirring speed and time adequate stirring speed and time is an essential parameter that contributes to effective coagulation leading to higher performance in wastewater treatment two mixing speeds are used during the conduction of the coagulation flocculation experiment comprising of slow and rapid mixing the rapid mixing is done immediately the coagulation additives are added to aid uniform distribution throughout the medium and to destabilize the colloidal particles while the slow mixing is introduced to enable collision of the particles to cluster aggregate and form macroflocs the efficiency of the coagulation process is highly affected by the adequacy of both mixing times and speed because and inadequate mixing time will hinder proper agglomeration of the colloids leading to decreased efficiency of turbidity the velocity gradient is the parameter used to express the mixing intensity anteneh and sahu 23 examined the effect of mixing time on cod removal food industry wastewater the treatment was done using chitosan as a natural coagulant with the stirring speed varied within the range of 50 200 rpm it was reported that mixing speeds from 50 rpm to 120 rpm had increasing cod and color reductions of up to 58 72 and 63 81 respectively the further increase to 150 rpm gave the best performance at 83 and 90 for cod and color reduction however it was observed that upon further increase of the speeds to 200 rpm a decrease occurred in the performance for cod and color reduction at 74 and 79 23 the coagulation mechanism attributed to the process is also influenced by the stirring speed and time for the particle settling coagulant aids or flocculants are often added together with the coagulant to support the aggregation and settling of the small flocs that settle very slowly logically turbidity reduction in the water increase as the time allowed is lengthened however it gets to maximum when colloids have completely settled 33 most coagulation studies have been reported to set the settling time of the experiment within 15 60 mins 172 a considerably high settling time of about 72 h was required for the removal of dye from dye wastewater using azadirachta indica as natural coagulants even though up to 80 dye removal was achieved by the coagulants this averagely long period for the settling time necessitates the use of a flocculant aid to improve the sedimentation process of the biocoagulants for economic and effective application 200 6 natural coagulant and their applications a shift towards the use of natural coagulants for the purification of water and wastewater treatment has been observed in recent times it is believed that a yield of up to 90 of total suspended solids is removed from wastewater if coagulation was done before gravity settling when compared to treatment without the coagulation process 103 overall the treatment materials are added into the wastewater and thoroughly mixed to destabilize the suspended particles collision occurs between the particles as they begin to cluster and aggregate to form larger and denser flocs enabling the flocs to settle for easier removal 201 the coagulation process is commonly used by industries that apply the sedimentation process in treating their wastewater effluents generated few of these industries are not limited to agriculture aquaculture food processing beverage production paint and varnishes cement adhesives soap and detergent cosmetics leather iron and steel plastics textile and dyeing pulp and paper industries the challenge of selecting the proper coagulant for efficient treatment and the conditions for coagulation places a toll on the industries the effective coagulation process depended largely on the type of coagulant coagulant dosage the coagulant charge the mixing parameters amount and properties of impurities present in the effluent ph of the water 202 6 1 aquaculture industry a typical process flow diagram of an aquaculture wastewater treatment plant is given in fig 5 several coagulants have been applied in the treatment of wastewater generated from the aquaculture industry often the coagulation treatments are done in such a way that the clean water will be obtained for reuse while simultaneously obtaining the nutrient rich sludge for further processing as a raw material for other products e g soil conditioner fertilizer or feed for microalgae the potential of chitosan pawpaw as organic coagulants were investigated in treating the wastewater generated from this industry to encourage sustainability and efficient treatment in the industry a study discovered by yunos et al 127 used an optimum coagulant dosage of 30 mg l which resulted in algae removal efficiency of 98 this study used chitosan as a coagulant with the aim of harvesting microalgae from the catfish aquaculture sample for the treatment a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of the purchased chitosan powder from shrimp shells in 10 ml of 0 1 m hcl before stirring for 10 min till the chitosan powder dissolved completely the stock solution was further diluted with deionized water before use after the experiment the turbidity of the wastewater was also reduced from 60 ntu to 2 2 ntu it was further claimed that the supernatant water discharged could be used as recycled water or released in the water bodies 127 6 2 textile industry large volumes of water are used in every section of the textile industry in processing various types of fabric especially during the scouring bleaching washing dyeing and printing processes 203 204 fig 6 gives the flowchart of a typical textile wastewater treatment process huang et al 205 claimed that the coagulation flocculation process is commonly used in treating this type of wastewater due to its high effectiveness and economic advantages in removing the dyes additives and salts nevertheless the application of inorganic chemical coagulants contributes more to the pollution as numerous unsolicited reactions occur in the water producing huge volumes of sludge and residual chemicals thus researchers sought for the potential of natural coagulants to substitute the chemical coagulants in effectively treating and decolorizing this industrial wastewater 44 82 144 146 206 moringa oleifera lam seeds were compared with aluminium sulphate to evaluate their effectiveness in treating textile wastewater moringa oleifera lam seed of 5 0 g was titrated in 100 ml of kcl 1 0 mol l mkcl as well as 1 0 mol l nacl mnacl to obtain the seed extract the mixture was consistently stirred for 30 min and was further filtered the organic coagulants mkcl and mnacl gave their best results at an acidic ph value of 2 with a coagulation dosage of 20 000 mg l overall the moringa coagulant extracted in kcl mkcl presented the highest efficiency when compared with the other two coagulants with an 82 2 removal for the apparent color removal of 83 05 78 4 89 7 for cod rp he7b dye and op her dye respectively though the potential for using the extract of moringa oleifera seeds as coagulant was confirmed it was however noted that the cost of the treatment process is not economical due to the high coagulation dose required for effective treatment 33 6 3 agriculture industry it is highly important to remove the pollutants generated from several activities washing separating grinding and purification in the agricultural industry before disposing the water which could be potentially harmful to the human environment and aquatic habitats coagulation has been extensively applied in the treatment process some of the natural coagulants used are given in tables 2 and 3 the coagulation performance of some chemical coagulants aluminium sulphate and ferric chloride were compared with natural coagulants chitosan moringa oleifera and zeolite in the palm oil milling effluent pome treatment by jagaba et al 123 in preparing the chitosan stock solution 1 5 g of the powder was dissolved in 150 ml of 0 1 m hcl and was stirred till it was dissolved the extraction process of removing the effective components for coagulation from the seed began from cleaning and grinding the seeds into powder before sieving through a mesh size of 0 8 2 5 mm the moringa seed oil was extracted with the aid of a soxhlet apparatus while the oil free cake was dissolved with distilled water after the treatment characterization and comparison were made aluminium sulphate was recognized to require the highest coagulant dose as its optimum was 4000 mg l which was followed by moringa oleifera with an optimum dose of 2000 mg l ferric chloride and zeolite equally had 1000 mg l has their optimum dosage chitosan required the least dosage of 400 mg l overall chitosan was proved to be the best as it gave the best result in removal tss at 98 95 turbidity and cod removal at 98 35 and 68 31 respectively 123 other studies also reported the efficient treatment of pome using natural coagulant the wheat germ was used as a coagulant had turbidity tss and cod reduction performance of 99 1 95 6 and 61 7 respectively 208 peanut seed coagulant which was extracted with 1 m nacl solution also achieved 93 6 and 67 0 for the tss and cod reduction respectively 209 6 4 efficiency of the wastewater treatment process parameters during wastewater treatment the efficiency of the coagulation process is judged based on its percentage removal of turbidity total suspended solids tss chemical oxygen demand cod chemical phosphorus natural organic matter nom color heavy metals and other pollutants the nature and properties of the wastewater determine the coagulants to be used and the parameters to be removed during treatment the coagulation flocculation process revolves around the destabilization of the suspended particles and clustering them to form macroflocs to enable sedimentation and filtration some properties which influence adequate coagulation activities include turbidity ph and others 6 4 1 total suspended solids tss total suspended solids tss signifies the quality of water it is the overall amount of solid material organic and inorganic matter suspended and settleable particles that can be filtered in the wastewater 210 the tss consist of an extensive variety that is not limited to industrial wastes and effluents mud animal carcass and rotting plants the suspended particles support the adhesion of metals and various harmful compounds a high concentration of suspended solids results in high turbid water which poses a challenge to the environment and the aquatic ecosystem it can reduce the penetration of sunlight into the water negatively affecting the photosynthesis process the tss is measured by filtering a water sample drying and accurately weighing the solids obtained the quantity of tss is recorded in a unit of mg l the tss reduction percentage was calculated using eq 1 1 t s s r e d u c t i o n t s s 0 t s s t s s 0 100 where tss0 is the value before treatment and tss is the value after the treatment process tamarind indica seed powder as a coagulant achieved a 24 32 removal of tss from a traditional gold mine wastewater 168 many other studies on the removal of tss from palm oil mill effluent pome includes treatment with cassia obtusifolia seed gum removed 93 22 55 treatment with moringa oleifera and chitosan removed 95 42 and 98 9 respectively 123 84 1 removal achieved after treatment with rice starch 131 other reported studies of tss removal in various industrial wastewaters can be found in table 3 6 4 2 turbidity high turbid water exhibits a cloudy appearance as a result of the impurities present it negatively affects the ecosystem environment and aquatic habitation 211 turbidity experienced in aquaculture habitat inhibits sunlight penetration and distribution of which could affect photosynthesis and the fish breeding process asides from the lowered oxygen concentration in the water which leads to stunted respiration the suspended particles could also clog the gills of the fish 212 turbidity is measured as an indicator of water quality based on its clearness and overall suspended solids in the water it is believed that higher turbidity of water lowers its quality a turbidimeter or a nephelometer is used to measure turbidity with a unit of nephelometric turbidity units ntu 213 the turbidity reduction percentage is calculated using standard method 2130b and eq 2 2 t u r b i d i t y r e m o v a l i n i t i a l t u r b i d i t y f i n a l t u r b i d i t y i n i t i a l t u r b i d i t y 100 coagulation is a principal process for treating and reducing turbidity as a result of the low concentration of stable particles water with lower turbidity is believed to be difficult to coagulate and thus to improve coagulation artificial turbidity is introduced into the water to aid the formation of denser flocs which would readily settle asrafuzzaman et al 214 studied and compared the influences of natural coagulants extracts of moringa oleifera cicer arietinum and dolichos lablab on turbidity high medium and low of synthetic water it was found that the biocoagulants gave better results with higher turbid water and a turbidity reduction efficiency of 95 89 214 khader et al 138 treated petroleum industry water with extracted solutions of radish eggplant and chickpea seed powders achieving turbidity removal of 98 785 99 42 and 95 2 respectively 138 few other natural coagulants that removed turbidity from industrial water have been highlighted in table 3 6 4 3 biochemical oxygen demand bod biochemical oxygen demand bod is a principal environmental index that analyses the dissolved oxygen required by aerobic biological organisms bacteria and other microorganisms for the oxidation of organic matter present in the water body it is especially used in characterizing the concentration of natural organic matter nom in aquatic industrial wastewater treatment agricultural industries poultry animal farming and other industries that apply organic materials in their processes 215 the organic materials released into the water body results in the generation and growth of microorganisms thereby depleting the oxygen necessary for other aquatic habitats bod is analyzed by calculating the oxygen depleted in a diluted aqueous specimen incubated with microorganisms it is expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of the sample used for the incubation period 216 firstly the oxygen of the sample collected from the waterbody is measured at the beginning of the reaction the temperature is then set within 20 25 c and left in the dark for 5 days for incubation the oxygen is remeasured after the prescribed period of incubation the limitation of the bod test is a result of the 5 day incubation period which hinders its usage in making operational decisions the bod reduction percentage can be calculated using eq 3 3 b o d r e d u c t i o n b o d 0 b o d b o d 0 100 where bod0 is the value before treatment and bod the value after the treatment process bod of 91 5 was removed after the treatment of municipal wastewater with watermelon seed the watermelon seed was used as the organic coagulant and microbial filter manyuchi et al 2016 6 4 4 chemical oxygen demand cod chemical oxygen demand cod is the measurement of oxygen that is consumed by reactions in a measured sample solution the cod test can be efficiently used in measuring the number of organics in the waterbody it is an alternative test to bod as it was established due to inefficient analysis of bod which required 5 days of incubation for completion the 5220 b open reflux titrimetric method is used to determine the chemical oxygen demand cod measurement using the method usepa method 8000 it is expressed in the mass of oxygen milligrams of oxygen consumed per liter of the sample mg l the cod reduction percentage was calculated using eq 4 4 c o d r e d u c t i o n c o d 0 c o d c o d 0 100 where cod0 is the value before treatment and cod the value after the treatment process the laundry wastewater treated by al gheethi et al 149 using moringa oleifera seed powder were found to initially contain high cod concentrations of 423 450 mg l this was reported to possibly be as a result of the detergent compounds present increasing the chemical reactivity between the organic substances a coagulant dosage of 90 mg l was able to reduce the cod by 42 72 the proteins existing in the moringa seed encourages its ability to degrade organic compounds which aid the degradation of organic matter and thus causing the cod removal with the aid of hydrolyses enzymes the microorganisms consume the organic compounds binded to the proteins as carbon sources it was observed that the degradation process requires a long period to allow for substantial cod removal 149 a maximum cod removal of 68 82 and 74 11 from textile industry wastewater was achieved by treatment with maize and surjana seed powders respectively 143 6 4 5 natural organic matter nom removal coagulation has been used in wastewater treatment to remove natural organic material nom from the water nom is the comprehensive name for mixtures of organic compounds contaminating the water they are substances generated from the aqueous discharges and solutions derived from rotting plant fertilizers dead organisms and animal waste 217 nom contaminates water by contributing repugnant color odor and taste to the clear water body they are also believed to serve as a means of conveying harmful materials such as organic pollutants and heavy metals they also react with chlorine resulting in the production of carcinogenic by products these substances function as a food source for bacteria thus enhancing biofilm production in the water 94 218 one of the most common and economically practicable treatment processes of removing these nom is the coagulation flocculation process the extent to which coagulation removes nom is largely dependent on the properties of organic materials existing in the water the type and dosage of coagulant and ph 34 219 during the coagulation process the natural organic materials are removed simultaneously with efficient turbidity removal coagulants aluminates ferric and their polymeric versions have been effectively used as almost all types of nom can be removed by coagulation 106 however the hydrophobic fraction humic and fulvic acid tannic acid hydrocarbons tannins and resorcinol and higher molar mass compounds of nom are more effectively removed than the hydrophilic fractions carboxylic acids carbohydrates and proteins and low molar mass compounds 220 221 analyzing the functional and structural characterization of nom present in water is a problem due to the complex properties and their differing sources measuring the total organic carbon toc is the most commonly and reliably used technique to analyze the quantity of the organic material the nom removal process during coagulation involves the mixture of neutralizing the charges entrapping adsorption and complexation of the particles with the coagulant ions to form insoluble particulate aggregate 34 few studies have been done in taking advantage of the biodegradability and other positive attributes of natural coagulants in nom removal a recent review article highlighted the use of chemically modifying chitosan as a coagulant in nom removal chitosan has been reported to effectively remove nom but its application is restricted due to its insolubility at ph values below 6 5 chitosan modification could be done to provide functional groups easily done due to the abundant free amino and hydroxyl groups present along the chain backbone that would aid synergic interaction with nom to be removed to enhance chitosan solubility for a broader ph range and to increase the molecular weight for effective bridging with nom modified chitosan has showing promising characteristics as a natural coagulant in nom removal from wastewater 106 6 4 6 phosphorus capture removal domestic industrial and urban wastewater discharged into the environment without treatment has caused a disastrous challenge to the environment and human health the accumulation of phosphorus in the soil and water is a result of the actions of these industries processes 222 223 a high percentage of phosphorus in the soil and water could lead to eutrophication which is potentially harmful to aquatic habitats polyphosphate organic phosphorus and orthophosphate are the different forms in which phosphorus appears in the surrounding 224 the detergent and their ingredients present in untreated car wash wastewater is a potential cause for environmental problems because of their toxicity to the aquatic habitat 225 also the phosphates and other elements existing in the detergents could result in the growth of excess algae in the drainage or other waterways and thus the impurities should be removed before discharge radin mohamed et al 226 examined the coagulation efficiency of using moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum as natural coagulants in the treatment of car wash wastewater moringa oleifera and strychnos potatorum seeds were able to achieve a phosphorus removal of 75 and 65 respectively 226 6 4 7 color removal colorants are materials that can transfer or impart their color to the substance they are used in various industries which are not limited to textile food soap cosmetic printing painting photography plastics leather shoe and bags and paper industries 203 their primary application is to alter the color of material to make it more attractive appealing food beautiful and creative the wastewater generated from these industries consists of a high percentage of various dyes and pigments while most dyes used are soluble in water as they diffuse into the material to impart their color on the substrate pigments are water insoluble compounds and do not interact with the substrate 206 the dye is a major pollutant and its presence in water negatively affects the environment and ecosystem 227 therefore the industries must effectively treat the wastewater produced to rid it of dye additives and other pollutants before discharging into the water bodies 228 the effective decolorization and decontamination of wastewater generated from these industries using the coagulation flocculation treatment process have been reportedly studied and researched the treatment process is an important phase in removing suspended particles colorants and natural organic matter in the wastewater 139 chitosan is a biopolymer that has served as a good color removal in the work of jagaba et al 123 it had the highest color removal efficiency of 96 44 which was closely followed by moringa oleifera coagulants 123 dotto et al 33 demonstrated that the application of moringa coagulants extracted in saline solutions kcl and nacl removed the color with a high performance of 82 8 and 72 8 respectively 33 7 limitations and potential study in the use of natural coagulants although the advantages of natural coagulants are numerous they have some disadvantages one of its major limitations is that it is less effective in the coagulation process as a result of the lack of flexibility in regulating their characteristics in the production of chemical synthetic coagulants characteristics which is not limited to molecular weight charge type can be adjusted to desired property 44 studies and researches should emerge on the characteristics and behavior of the natural coagulant and the coagulation process to proffer in depth solutions to the challenge inflexibility of the natural coagulants to improve their efficiency another limitation is that they significantly increase the organic load in the water after treatment which may aid microbial activities leading to undesired implications and increasing microbial activities 166 the residual organic matter could alter the odor taste and color of the treated water thus the use of a disinfectant such as chlorine is required 126 a high microbial activity will require additional chlorine usage for disinfection purposes which further increases the cost of treatment indirectly defeating the economic advantage of using natural coagulants 229 the formation of trihalomethane generated from interactions with disinfectant chlorine is a potential hazard therefore more research should be considered on evaluating the relationship between natural coagulants and the influence on chlorine lastly compared to the chemical coagulant the green coagulant has a shorter storage life as a result of its biodegradability 44 152 as eloquently described by mohd salleh et al 128 this drawback in using natural coagulant causes extreme difficulty during coagulation and thus stimulate more intense and insightful researches that will aid the natural coagulants to effectively substitute the chemical coagulants and have a longer storage life while still maintaining the biodegradability property 128 although the numerous advantages and efficacy of applying natural coagulants has been reported by several researchers conducted in the laboratory its inability to be applied in the industry has inhibited their evolution on an industrial scale of treatment 230 8 conclusion and further works the review of the past and current use of natural coagulants has been critically analyzed in this study the coagulants have great efficiency in wastewater treatment plant based coagulants go through numerous processes before they could be used as coagulants beginning with the primary process which includes cleaning drying and sieving of the seeds and other plant parts before further treatment or application the secondary processes comprising of oil extraction and solvent distilled water salt solution extraction of the active coagulation agent however salt solution extraction was determined to be the most effective technique reduction of organic matter loading in the treated water led to further purification of the coagulant ion exchange lyophilization and membrane filtration techniques have been successfully used in purifying and isolating the coagulation protein the discharge of industrial wastewater is a great challenge to man the aquatic habitat environment and ecosystem the complexity of their treatment further arises from the varying properties of these wastes based on the type of materials used in the various industries the use of chemical coagulant for the treatment has been widely used due to its economical and effective advantages but due to its several limitations which is based on its artificial nature residual metal salts and non degradability has brought up concerns over health and the environmental risks attributed in the continual application of the synthetic coagulants the dire need for the substitution of chemical coagulant has been described as a necessity in this review thus green coagulants which are degradable natural environmentally friendly and economical have been developed as a sustainable alternative potential in the coagulation process these coagulants which are not limited to pawpaw seeds cassava moringa jatropha curcas chitosan algae tannin and others have displayed effectiveness in treating industrial generated wastewaters the application of the green coagulants denotes development in the sustainability of the industries without disruption in the quality of water human health and the environment the extraction purification applications and evaluation of plant based coagulants for an effective coagulation process was discussed comparative performance between natural and chemical coagulants in the treatment of industrial wastewater were evaluated also the influential coagulation parameters the current development on improving and purification techniques of the coagulants and probable use of dual or combine coagulants were addressed overall green coagulants effectively remove the odor ph cod bod tss and color in wastewater as a result of their non corrosive biodegradability long polymer chains ecologically beneficial properties other characteristics such as reduced generated sludge quantity high positive charge ability to upsurge floc size promote their efficacy in the treatment of wastewater which leads to reduced cost of production and treatment of wastewater generated in the industries however notable challenges identified in the use of natural coagulant has encouraged further research to develop effective green coagulants to be used in large scale industrial wastewater treatment applications some of the potential future research has also been highlighted for the possible valorization of the natural coagulants in wastewater treatment further research works are required to combat the various limitations of natural coagulants the research should focus on improving the properties of the coagulants to efficiently and optimally cleanse the wastewater additionally very limited studies have been developed on the industrial scale application of natural coagulants proper testing and optimization should be evaluated for this purpose future research should also investigate the reduction of residual organic matter cost of disinfection and storage time

table 1s of the membranes showed that surface morphology of the polymeric nf tfc membranes altered by addition of tio2 nanoparticles polymeric nf tfn membranes had rougher surface due to spherical

permeability of the polymeric nf tfn membranes mpd residence time and heat treatment temperature differences made difficult to compare reinforced nf tfc and reinforced nf aqpz tfc membranes however it can be said both membranes have lower contact angle values surface roughness is higher which have a positive impact on permeability and highly negatively charged than polymeric nf tfc and tfn
