23690,this paper introduces a practical formula for added resistance in short waves particularly the formulation introduced by faltinsen et al 1980 is modified to consider the three aspects the finite draught of ships the local steady velocity and the shape above still water level swl first an additional term due to the finite draught of ships is derived by subtracting the integration of velocity square terms along the vertical control surface from the ships draught to the negative infinite second a new local steady velocity is proposed which includes the variation of sectional area third the bow shape above swl is considered by introducing the ratio of bluntness coefficients at the mean level of steady waves and swl the mean level of steady waves is approximately calculated based on the steady wave elevation of an advancing wedge shaped body in calm water the effect of each modification has been investigated and compared to experimental results and other empirical formulae of added resistance in short waves finally a practical approach to combine the modified formula and the existing computation method for the added resistance in an overall wavelength range is presented keywords added resistance short wave approximation eedi weather factor bow design 1 introduction it is well known that a ship experiences additional resistances in real sea conditions compared to the resistance in calm water the added resistance of ships due to waves is one of the additional resistances of increasing importance in seakeeping and ship resistance communities as the international maritime organization imo created a regulation for evaluating an energy efficiency design index eedi for newly built ships to restrict greenhouse gas emissions the weather factor which is the ratio of ship speed in a real sea condition to that in calm water is one of the critical parameters for the correct estimation of eedi thus an accurate and efficient method to predict the added resistance in waves is required for early stage ship design a significant amount of research has been performed on this issue over the last several decades based on experimental numerical and simplified approaches seo et al 2013 references are therein because modern merchant ships are much larger than in the past the waves encountered are of relatively short wavelength the asymptotic formula faltinsen et al 1980 and empirical formulae tsujimoto et al 2008 sea trial analysis jip 2006 see also international standard organization 2015 of added resistance in waves are fundamental tools for predicting the added resistance of ships in short waves recently liu and papanikolaou 2016 presented a handy calculation method based on empirical correction terms and the further improved formula considering the effects of the ship draft trim and forward speed was developed by liu and papanikolaou 2017 even though the empirical formulae provide reasonable results compared to experimental data the effects of each physical parameter have been merged into a simple parameter the asymptotic formula of added resistance in short waves shows fair agreement with experimental data for blunt ships at low forward speeds whereas underestimation of results can be observed for slender ships at relatively high forward speeds the modification was made in the original asymptotic formula introducing refraction of incident waves near the ship bow based on the conservation of wave action ohkusu 1984 however ohkusu s method tends to overestimate the added resistance in short waves for blunt ships at low speed moreover it provided the underestimation of added resistance in short waves for slender ships the following two reasons for underestimation were reported in the literature shape above still water level swl seo et al 2014 and local steady velocity guo and steen 2011 as noted in the previous studies ohkusu 1984 sakamoto and baba 1986 the interactions between steady flow and diffraction or even incident waves are important processes in determining the added resistance in waves from a practical point of view to minimize the added resistance in waves the designer can only rely on the change of bow shape above swl for example ax bow and leadge type bow shapes were originally proposed by matsumoto et al 2000 and those concepts were also applied for kriso s very large crude oil carrier kvlcc2 lee et al 2017 the reduction of added resistance in short waves could be achieved by reducing the reflection wave toward the front of the ships bow however the existing asymptotic analyses of added resistance in short waves are not able to consider changes in bow shape above swl kuroda et al 2012 presented a practical method to take into account the effect of shape above swl they measured the steady wave elevation around a ship bow in experiments and the water line curve was obtained by projecting the steady wave elevation into swl the water line integration was then performed along this projected profile from this method the change of bow shape along the vertical direction is partially considered in this study the original asymptotic formula developed by faltinsen et al 1980 is modified by introducing the following three effects finite draught of ships local steady velocity and shape above swl the effect of each parameter has been investigated and compared to experimental results and other empirical formulae of added resistance in short waves the correction due to the finite draught of ships reduces the suction force below swl and consequently increases the added resistance in short waves a new local steady velocity is proposed which includes the variation of sectional area as opposed to the infinitely long vertical cylinder model assumed in the original asymptotic formula furthermore the shape above swl is considered by introducing the ratio of bluntness coefficients at mean steady elevation which is approximately calculated based on steady elevation for an advancing wedge shaped body in calm water validating the newly proposed formula of added resistance in short waves a practical approach to combine the existing added resistance in an overall wavelength range is presented 2 mathematical backgrounds 2 1 original asymptotic formula faltinsen et al 1980 derived the asymptotic formula of added resistance of ships in short waves in this formulation it is assumed that a ship has vertical sides at the water plane and that the wavelength is small compared to the draught of the ship in short waves the ship motion can be neglected and the diffraction wave will be affected only by the part of the ship close to the water plane thus the ship is considered as a stationary vertically long cylinder which has the same cross section to the water plane area as the ship the coordinate system x y z is defined at the center of the cylinder and x and z directions indicate the backward or aft direction and vertically upward direction of the ship respectively the ship is moving forward with a constant speed u and the incident wave is approaching with wave amplitude ζ a and circular frequency ω 0 as shown in fig 1 a only the regular head wave case is considered in this paper the local coordinate system n s along the water plane area curve can be defined where n and s are orthogonal and tangential to the water plane area curve respectively stretching the coordinate by the scale of the wavelength the cylinder can be considered a vertical wall which has angle θ with an x direction if the ship speed is small there is a horizontal steady velocity v parallel to the wall as shown in fig 1 b the flow is assumed as ideal flow and the velocity potential can be introduced using boundary conditions and the fictitious problem where the fictitious incident wave is assumed to be totally reflected the total velocity potential φ in many wavelengths away from the wall can be obtained as follows 1 φ ϕ v s ϕ i ϕ d v s g ζ

k 2 sin θ here ϕ i and ϕ d are the incident and diffraction wave potentials g the acceleration of gravity k 0 the wave number x 0 y 0 the x y coordinates of the origin of the local coordinate system n s ω e the circular frequency of encounter and t the time variable based on the conservation of momentum the sectional average force normal to the wall can be obtained as follows 5 δ r n ζ p ρ v n 2 n d z 1 2 ρ g ζ 2 1 2 ρ 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 k 1 k 0 1 2 cos 2 θ 1 2 k 2 k 0 sin θ where the upper bar indicates the time average p is the dynamic pressure and v n the normal velocity of fluid at the control surface the free surface elevation at n is given by 6 ζ 1 g t v s ϕ z 0 based on the assumption of local steady velocity v u cosθ and low advancing speed the added resistance in short waves r asw can be finally obtained as follows 7 δ r n 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 ω 0 u g sin 2 θ 8 r a s w w l δ r n n 1 d l where n 1 is the sectional normal vector in the x direction the integration is performed over the non shaded part wl of the water plane curve faltinsen et al 1980 2 2 empirical formulae the empirical formulae iso 2015 of added resistance in short waves are briefly summarized in this section for comparison purposes the national maritime research institute nmri in japan proposed a method in which the added resistance in regular waves is calculated from the added resistance r awm based on maruo s theory maruo 1963 and the correction term r awr that is effective in short waves the correction term is an improved expression based on the method of fujii and takahashi 1975 by modifying complement coefficients tsujimoto et al 2008 kuroda et al 2008 it can be expressed as follows 9 r a w r n m r i 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b b f α t 1 c u f r where 10 α t π 2 i 1 2 k e

the ships breadth fr the froude number i 1 and k 1 modified bessel functions of the first and second kind of order 1 respectively the integration is performed over the non shaded part l of the water plane curve the ships draught is t deep or the deepest draught for a trim condition another empirical method called stawave 2 has been developed to approximate the transfer function of the added resistance in regular head waves using the main parameters sea trial analysis jip 2006 it is assumed that the added resistance in waves can be decomposed into a wave reflection component r awrl and a motion induced component r awml the wave reflection component can be written as follows 14 r a w r l s t a 2 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b α 1 ω 0 15 α 1 ω 0 π 2 i 1 2 1 5 k 0 t m π 2 i 1 2 1 5 k 0 t m k 1 2 1 5 k

and the s175 container ship with fr 0 2 in short waves using the asymptotic formula dash dot line the nmri formula dashed line and stawave 2 dash dot dot line the experimental data for kvlcc2 lee et al 2017 and the s175 container ship fujii and takahashi 1975 nakamura and naito 1977 are also plotted as different symbols all methods provide quite similar values for the kvlcc2 case which has a relatively blunt bow and slow ship speed because the reflection coefficients see eqs 10 and 15 in both empirical formulae become unity in very short waves λ l 0 4 these methods provide a constant value in the very short wave region on the contrary the normalized value becomes large using the asymptotic formula as wavelengths decrease the dimensional added resistance in this case does not diverge because the wave slope is limited in linear wave theory and the incident wave amplitude also becomes small in very short waves the asymptotic formula tends to underestimate the added resistance in short waves for the s175 container ship which has large flare and is relatively faster than kvlcc2 in table 1 the reflection and advance speed coefficients are summarized for the asymptotic and nmri formulae the reflection coefficient becomes unity in the short wave region for both methods whereas the advance speed coefficients differ from each other as shown in fig 3 computational fluid dynamics cfd results conducted by yang et al 2015 for kvlcc2 and the s175 container ship are also plotted in fig 3 in the asymptotic formula the advance speed coefficient will be the same even for different hulls if the ship speed and incident wavelengths are fixed on the other hand the advance speed coefficient of the nmri formula is a function of the bluntness coefficient b f as given in eq 13 this relation was derived from towing tank tests for several hull forms and it included different physical effects simply as a function of the bluntness coefficient thus it is difficult to determine which parameters affect the added resistance in short waves 3 enhanced asymptotic formula 3 1 influence of finite draught in the original asymptotic formula the ship was replaced with a vertical and infinitely long cylinder which has the same sectional area of water plane of the ship based on the assumption that the ship draught is much longer than the incident wave length however the wavelength even in short waves is longer than the draught of the ship as shown in table 2 it is known that the wave drift force on the vertical wall is composed of the pressure integration over the surf zone and the integration of the pressure drop due to velocity square terms below swl the pressure integral to infinite water depth in the original asymptotic formula will overestimate the second component if the draught of a ship is smaller than half of the incident wavelength in general it is difficult to calculate the diffraction wave potential for a ship with finite draught because there will be transmitted waves unlike the total reflection as assumed in the original derivation to derive the practical modification term due to the finite draught of the ship the horizontal control surface far below the free surface is assumed to be located at the level of ship draught while the velocity potentials are the same as those given in the original derivation thus the sectional force can be calculated based on the momentum conservation as follows 17 δ r n t x 0 ζ p ρ v n 2 n d z 1 2 ρ g ζ 2 1 2 ρ t x 0 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z here t x 0 is the sectional draught of the ship and it will be equal to ship draught for even keel conditions the additional term is included in the original asymptotic formula due to the integration of velocity square terms along the vertical control surface from the negative infinite to the ship draught as follows 18 δ r n 1 2 ρ g ζ 2 1 2 ρ 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z 1 2 ρ t x 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z substituting the velocity potentials given in eq 1 the sectional average force normal to the wall can be written as follows 19 δ r n 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 k 1 k 0 1 2 c o s 2 θ 1 2 k 2 k 0 s i n θ 1 2 e 2 k 0 t x 0 b 1 2 k 0 k 1 e 2 k 1 t x 0 cos 2 θ e k 1 k 0 t x 0 k 0 cos 2 θ k 2 sin θ k 1 k 2 k 0 sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 using the waterline integration given in eq 8 the total added resistance in short waves denoted by r asw can be obtained and can be decomposed into three components as follows 20 r a s w w l δ r n n 1 d l r ζ r v r v t r ζ 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 k 1 k 0 1 b 1 2 k 0 k 1 k 2 k sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 r v 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 b 1 2 k 0 2 k 1 cos 2 θ 1 2 k 0 cos 2 θ k 2 sin θ k 1 k 2 k 0 sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 r v t 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 e 2 k 0 t x 0 b 1 2 k 0 k 1 e 2 k 1 t x 0 cos 2 θ e k 1 k 0 t x 0 k 0 cos 2 θ k 2 sin θ k 1 k 2 k 0 sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 where r ζ r v and r vt correspond to the integration of each term in eq 18 and the summation of r v and r vt is the suction force due to quadratic velocity below swl r vt is due to the modification of the finite draught of the ship and the suction force will be adjusted for the magnitude of this term the contribution of finite draught effects is exponentially decaying with factors of 2k 0 2k 1 and k 0 k 1 as given in eq 20 those terms are derived from the quadratic terms in the bernoulli s equation and the magnitude of quadratic pressure decays exponentially in the same factor thus it decreases faster in depth direction than the incident wave does the magnitude of quadratic pressure is less than 1 of the maximum quadratic pressure at z 0 if the vertical position is less than one third of the incident wavelength for the present test cases it should be noted that the importance of finite draught correction depends on the wavelength of incident wave and the draught of a ship which will be discussed below the comparison of each component is shown in fig 4 for kvlcc2 with fr 0 142 and the s175 container ship with fr 0 2 in both cases the correction term due to finite draught is negligible for very short wavelengths λ l 0 2 whereas the contribution of this term increases in the region of λ l 0 2 thus it provides almost the same result as the original asymptotic formula for very short wavelengths as shown in fig 5 the results of the original asymptotic formula and the correction method due to finite draught indicated by present r vt in the legend lie within the range of experimental data for the kvlcc2 case in addition the modified method provides similar results to those of the nmri formula on the other hand the results are improved only for λ l 0 5 and the underestimation of added resistance in short waves is still obtained for s175 container ship in this case r v has almost the same magnitude with r ζ in the original asymptotic formula whereas the correction due to finite draught reduces the suction force and consequently the added resistance increases the influence of finite draught correction however is limited for λ l 0 5 and further improvements will be proposed in subsequent sections 3 2 influence of local steady velocity it is reasonable to assume that the diffracted wave is dominantly influenced by the ship geometry only near swl if the incident wave is short enough relative to the ship length and draught however the steady flow may vary with the bow shape below swl in addition to the ships geometry near swl furthermore the sectional area curve is one of the important parameters in designing the hull form with optimized resistance in calm water this indicates that changes in the sectional area will change the steady flow around the ship the proposed local steady velocity in the original derivation faltinsen et al 1980 reflects only the geometrical characteristics at swl and does not consider changes in shape below swl as stated in that paper it is complicated to find the local steady velocity for general ship geometries therefore a simple way to calculate the local steady velocity is required even when considering changes in bow shape below swl the characteristics of steady flow around the bow of wedge shaped bodies with flare and rake angles were studied in noblesse et al 2009 in that paper the ship flare parameter was defined as follows 21 φ tan α e 0 tan α e b tan α e 0 tan α e b where α e0 and α eb are the half of entrance angles at swl and the bottom of the body respectively a conclusion from this study is that the maximum steady wave elevation is approximately proportional to the flare parameter from bernoulli s equation it can be deduced that the local velocity is proportional to the square root of 1 φ in a similar way the local steady velocity v is proposed in the following form keeping it as simple as possible 22 v α a x 0 u cos θ where 23 α a x 0 min 1 0 1 0 a 0 x 0 a x 0 a 0 x 0 a x 0 min 1 0 2 a x 0 a 0 x 0 a x 0 24 a x 0 t x 0 0 y d z 25 a 0 x 0 y 0 t x 0 the correction factor α a x is the parameter related to the sectional area under swl and the area of the rectangle in which the width is the beam at swl denoted by y 0 and the height is the sectional draught t x 0 if the ship is a cylindrical shape with the same sectional area along the vertical direction α a becomes unity and eventually the local steady velocity of the original asymptotic formula is reproduced the local steady velocities along the water plane curve of kvlcc2 and the s175 container ship with fr 0 142 and 0 2 respectively are shown in fig 6 the newly proposed velocity is slightly less than that of the original formula for the kvlcc2 case for the s175 container ship the original local steady flow is almost uniform with the same magnitude of ship speed whereas the modified velocity is approximately 80 of the ship speed the modification of local steady velocity which includes the variation of sectional area provides the increased added resistance of the s175 container ship especially for very short wavelengths λ l 0 2 whereas almost the same results can be obtained for kvlcc2 as shown in fig 7 here the inclusion of the newly proposed local steady velocity is denoted by v in the legend combining the corrections of finite draught and local steady velocity gives improved results of added resistance in the wavelength range considered in this paper the sectional added resistance in wave conditions of λ l 0 2 is shown in fig 8 most of the added resistance is due to the front part of the bow for the kvlcc2 case whereas the sectional added resistance is distributed around the whole bow region for the s175 case the overall magnitude of the sectional added resistance increases if the modification of local steady velocity is used in the s175 case if the local velocity v decreases the reflected wave elevation at many wavelengths away from the ship increases thus the sectional added resistance increases on the other hand if v increases the wave number in normal direction to the sectional ship surface k 2 sometimes becomes imaginary which means that there is no outgoing or reflected wave from that section 3 3 influence of hull shape above still water level as mentioned in the previous section the original asymptotic formula cannot reflect changes of bow shape above swl in this section two different methods are investigated to take into account the variation of bow shape above swl first the baseline level above swl is introduced based on the steady wave elevation the maximum steady wave elevation η 0 for wedge shaped bodies can be obtained as follows noblesse et al 2008 26 η 0 g u 2 min 2 2 1 f t tan α e cos α e 0 5 where 27 f t u g t here α e is half of the entrance angle and it can be approximately calculated for an arbitrary ship geometry as follows 28 tan α e 3 l c 3 f p f p l c x 0 y 0 d x 0 y o x 0 l c l c 29 l c t 2 f t 2 1 f t in the first method the waterline integration is performed along the water plane curve at z η 0 or z η 0 2 in the second method the bluntness coefficients are initially calculated at z 0 and z η 0 2 then the ratio of bluntness coefficients at a different level α b defined in the following form is multiplied by the added resistance in short waves calculated from the previous modified formula 30 α b b f z η 0 2 b f z 0 31 r a s w α b w l δ r n n 1 d l the water plane curves at different levels are compared in fig 9 the original kvlcc2 case has almost the same water plane area at z 0 and z η 0 whereas the modified kvlcc2 with ax bow shape lee et al 2017 shows a sharp edge at z η 0 the water plane area of the s175 container ship slightly increases above swl but the difference is not significant even for the higher speed case fr 0 25 if the water line integration is calculated along the water plane curve at z η 0 or z η 0 2 they show almost identical results as the original kvlcc2 case whereas the difference can be found in ax bow type hull as shown in fig 10 the ax bow type has a relatively sharp bow edge above swl and it provides smaller added resistance than that of the original kvlcc2 this tendency can be observed using the proposed methods however if the waterline integration is performed along the water plane curve at z η 0 the reduction of added resistance due to the ax bow seems to be exaggerated furthermore the second method of simply multiplying the ratio of bluntness coefficients provides almost the same results as direct water line integration along a different level thus the second correction method with z η 0 2 as a baseline level for calculating the bluntness coefficient is applied in the subsequent results for the s175 container ship α b becomes larger than 1 0 because of the flare angle and consequently the added resistance increases if the second method is applied as shown in fig 11 moreover α b also depends on ship speed because the maximum steady elevation depends on the ship speed thus the increase in added resistance due to α b is larger in the faster case fr 0 25 due to the positive flare angle of the s175 container ship 3 4 added resistance in overall wavelengths in the previous sections the added resistance in short waves was the main topic of discussion it is important to note that the previous method is valid only for short waves however the added resistance over a whole range of wavelengths is also a main concern in calculating the weather factor in eedi in the stawave 2 method the total added resistance is decomposed into a motion induced component and a wave reflection component while the correction term due to wave reflection is simply added to the added resistance calculated by maruo s formula in the nmri method in the latter method the diffraction component is double counted even though the added resistance in short waves from maruo s formula is small the wave reflection term in the stawave 2 method and the correction term in the nmri method include reflection parameters see eqs 10 and 15 which are functions of wave frequency thus those terms gradually become zero as the wavelengths increase although the added resistance due to wave diffraction is not zero even in the long wave region kashiwagi 2013 on the contrary guo and steen 2011 suggested a combination method based on the so called r function in this method the r function is defined in a similar way as the nmri and stawave 2 methods whereas 1 r is multiplied to the added resistance of the overall wavelengths calculated by the radiated energy method the present asymptotic formula is valid only for short wavelength cases and it is not applicable in the long wave region thus a method similar to guo and steen 2011 is adapted in this study and a tangent hyperbolic function is used as a blending function instead of complicated bessel functions the tangent hyperbolic function is simple to use in practical applications the added resistance of ships in an overall range of wavelengths then can be estimated as follows 32 r w a v e 1 r λ l r a w r λ l r a s w where r aw is the added resistance in the overall range of wavelengths and the blending function is proposed as follows 33 r λ l 1 2 1 tanh c 1 c 2 λ l here c 1 controls the slope of the tangent hyperbolic function and c 2 determines the mid point position where the blending function becomes 0 5 values of 5 0 and 0 8 for c 1 and c 2 respectively are used in the subsequent results as shown in fig 12 the blending function gradually decreases from λ l 0 3 and it becomes 0 5 when λ l 0 8 as shown in fig 12 the other graphs are reflection coefficients with different parameters of wave number k and ship draught t that is eq 10 applies 1 5 kt eq 15 applies k e t and kt is used for the equation of fujii and takahashi 1975 the added resistance in short waves r asw can be obtained using the present method and the existing method can be applied to calculate the added resistance in moderate and long wave regions in between short and moderate waves the blended value of the two methods will be calculated fig 13 shows the combined results of the present method and existing methods including the strip method park et al 2016 iso 2015 and the time domain rankine panel method rpm seo et al 2014 obviously the results are the same in the short wave region regardless of the existing method and the difference in the other ranges of wavelength solely depend on the accuracy of the existing methods the results of combining the strip method and the nmri formula as summarized in iso 2015 are also presented in some regions e g around λ l 0 8 for kvlcc2 and λ l 1 0 for s175 the nmri method shows overestimated values because the diffraction component is double counted 4 summary of snu formula and procedure from the present enhancement of asymptotic formula developed by faltinsen et al 1980 the following enhanced formula for short waves named to snu formula is proposed as summarized in table 3 the summarized prediction procedure for added resistance in waves is shown in fig 14 from given cp curves and waterline profiles at z 0 the correction factor for local steady velocity α a is obtained using eq 23 the sectional added resistance including the finite draught correction can be calculated using eq 19 the added resistance short waves r asw are then obtained by waterline integration of the sectional added resistance and multiplication of the correction factor of shape above swl α b here α b is calculated using eq 30 where the waterline curve at z η 0 2 is obtained from eq 26 the total added resistance in waves is obtained by adding the added resistance in short waves r asw to the existing added resistance r aw based on the blending function given in eqs 32 and 33 based on the above procedure the added resistances for different ships are calculated the main details of the targeted ships and the parameters used in the present calculation are summarized in table 4 the non dimensional maximum steady wave elevation denoted by η ˆ is 0 5 for blunt ships and slow ship speed cases whereas it becomes around 0 2 for relatively fast ship speed cases the maximum value before a breaking wave occurs is 0 5 noblesse et al 2008 the correction factor due to shape change above swl denoted by α b is larger than 1 0 and it becomes around 1 3 for relatively fast ship speeds with large flare only the ax bow type shows a value less than one the added resistances of the ships discussed above in waves are plotted in fig 15 the strip method is used as an existing method to calculate the added resistance in an overall range of wavelengths because it is efficient to apply in the early stage ship design the results can be interpreted for two distinct regions if the wavelength to ship length ratio is less than 1 2 the combination of the strip method and the nmri formula provides overestimated results this tendency can be clearly observed in the kcs case from an experiment conducted by simonsen et al 2014 this is because the correction term in the nmri formula is simply added to the added resistance of the strip method whereas the factor 1 r is multiplied by the results of the strip method in the present method on the other hand similar results can be observed in the long wave region regardless of the combination method because the correction term in the nmri formula and the blending function in the present method become zero as wavelengths increase the added resistance of the duisburg test case dtc container ship in short waves which has a relatively complicated bow shape is shown in fig 16 this ship was used as a benchmark test model in the shopera project sprenger et al 2016 the present method shows improved results compared to the original asymptotic formula and similar results to other empirical formulae 5 conclusions in this study practical correction methods have been incorporated into faltinsen s asymptotic formula of added resistance in short waves in terms of these three aspects finite draught local steady velocity and shape above swl furthermore a blending function has been proposed to combine the added resistances in short waves and in an overall range of wavelengths from this study the following conclusions can be made the correction due to the finite draught of ships reduces the suction force and eventually the added resistance in short waves increases especially when the wavelength to ship length ratio is larger than 0 3 in the present test cases as local steady velocity decreases the added resistance in short waves increases the newly proposed velocity which includes changes of bow shape below swl provides the increased added resistance value for slender ships to consider the variation of bow shape above swl a baseline level was calculated from the steady wave elevation of a wedge shaped approximated body and the ratio of bluntness coefficients between the swl and the baseline level this was multiplied to the added resistance in short waves using this approach the effect of the change of bow shape above swl on added resistance in short waves can be determined the added resistance in the overall range of wavelengths is calculated by the combination of added resistance in short waves from the proposed method and the existing computational results based on a blending function the new blending function model was based on using a tangent hyperbolic function and the combined results show reasonable agreement with experimental data in short wave regions while the accuracy in other wavelength regions depends on the characteristics of existing computations acknowledgments this study was funded by the office of naval research

maritime organization imo created a regulation for evaluating an energy efficiency design index eedi for newly built ships to restrict greenhouse gas emissions the weather factor which is the ratio of ship speed in a real sea condition to that in calm water is one of the critical parameters for the correct estimation of eedi thus an accurate and efficient method to predict the added resistance in waves is required for early stage ship design a significant amount of research has been performed on this issue over the last several decades based on experimental numerical and simplified approaches seo et al 2013 references are therein because modern merchant ships are much larger than in the past the waves encountered are of relatively short wavelength the asymptotic formula faltinsen et al 1980 and empirical formulae tsujimoto et al 2008 sea trial analysis jip 2006 see also international standard organization 2015 of added resistance in waves are fundamental tools for predicting the added resistance of ships in short waves recently liu and papanikolaou 2016 presented a handy calculation method based on empirical correction terms and the further improved formula considering the effects of the ship draft trim and forward speed was developed by liu and papanikolaou 2017 even though the empirical formulae provide reasonable results compared to experimental data the effects of each physical parameter have been merged into a simple parameter the asymptotic formula of added resistance in short waves shows fair agreement with experimental data for blunt ships at low forward speeds whereas underestimation of results can be observed for slender ships at relatively high forward speeds the modification was made in the original asymptotic formula introducing refraction of incident waves near the ship bow based on the conservation of wave action ohkusu 1984 however ohkusu s method tends to overestimate the added resistance in short waves for blunt ships at low speed moreover it provided the underestimation of added resistance in short waves for slender ships the following two reasons for underestimation were reported in the literature shape above still water level swl seo et al 2014 and local steady velocity guo and steen 2011 as noted in the previous studies ohkusu 1984 sakamoto and baba 1986 the interactions between steady flow and diffraction or even incident waves are important processes in determining the added resistance in waves from a practical point of view to minimize the added resistance in waves the designer can only rely on the change of bow shape above swl for example ax bow and leadge type bow shapes were originally proposed by matsumoto et al 2000 and those concepts were also applied for kriso s very large crude oil carrier kvlcc2 lee et al 2017 the reduction of added resistance in short waves could be achieved by reducing the reflection wave toward the front of the ships bow however the existing asymptotic analyses of added resistance in short waves are not able to consider changes in bow shape above swl kuroda et al 2012 presented a practical method to take into account the effect of shape above swl they measured the steady wave elevation around a ship bow in experiments and the water line curve was obtained by projecting the steady wave elevation into swl the water line integration was then performed along this projected profile from this method the change of bow shape along the vertical direction is partially considered in this study the original asymptotic formula developed by faltinsen et al 1980 is modified by introducing the following three effects finite draught of ships local steady velocity and shape above swl the effect of each parameter has been investigated and compared to experimental results and other empirical formulae of added resistance in short waves the correction due to the finite draught of ships reduces the suction force below swl and consequently increases the added resistance in short waves a new local steady velocity is proposed which includes the variation of sectional area as opposed to the infinitely long vertical cylinder model assumed in the original asymptotic formula furthermore the shape above swl is considered by introducing the ratio of bluntness coefficients at mean steady elevation which is approximately calculated based on steady elevation for an advancing wedge shaped body in calm water validating the newly proposed formula of added resistance in short waves a practical approach to combine the existing added resistance in an overall wavelength range is presented 2 mathematical backgrounds 2 1 original asymptotic formula faltinsen et al 1980 derived the asymptotic formula of added resistance of ships in short waves in this formulation it is assumed that a ship has vertical sides at the water plane and that the wavelength is small compared to the draught of the ship in short waves the ship motion can be neglected and the diffraction wave will be affected only by the part of the ship close to the water plane thus the ship is considered as a stationary vertically long cylinder which has the same cross section to the water plane area as the ship the coordinate system x y z is defined at the center of the cylinder and x and z directions indicate the backward or aft direction and vertically upward direction of the ship respectively the ship is moving forward with a constant speed u and the incident wave is approaching with wave amplitude ζ a and circular frequency ω 0 as shown in fig 1 a only the regular head wave case is considered in this paper the local coordinate system n s along the water plane area curve can be defined where n and s are orthogonal and tangential to the water plane area curve respectively stretching the coordinate by the scale of the wavelength the cylinder can be considered a vertical wall which has angle θ with an x direction if the ship speed is small there is a horizontal steady velocity v parallel to the wall as shown in fig 1 b the flow is assumed as ideal flow and the velocity potential can be introduced using boundary conditions and the fictitious problem where the fictitious incident wave is assumed to be totally reflected the total velocity potential φ in many wavelengths away from the wall can be obtained as follows 1 φ ϕ v s ϕ i ϕ d v s g ζ

s ω e the circular frequency of encounter and t the time variable based on the conservation of momentum the sectional average force normal to the wall can be obtained as follows 5 δ r n ζ p ρ v n 2 n

velocity of fluid at the control surface the free surface elevation at n is given by 6 ζ 1 g t v s ϕ z 0 based on the assumption of local steady velocity v u cosθ and low advancing speed the added resistance in short waves r asw can be finally obtained as follows 7 δ r n 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 ω 0 u g sin 2 θ 8 r a s w w l δ r n n 1 d l where n 1 is the sectional normal vector in the x direction the integration is performed over the non shaded part wl of the water plane curve faltinsen et al 1980 2 2 empirical formulae the empirical formulae iso 2015 of added resistance in short waves are briefly summarized in this section for comparison purposes the national maritime research institute nmri in japan proposed a method in which the added resistance in regular waves is calculated from the added resistance r awm based on maruo s theory maruo 1963 and the correction term r awr that is effective in short waves the correction term is an improved expression based on the method of fujii and takahashi 1975 by modifying complement coefficients tsujimoto et al 2008 kuroda et al 2008 it can be expressed as follows 9 r a w r n m r i 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b b f α t 1 c u f r where 10 α t π 2 i 1 2 k e

the ships breadth fr the froude number i 1 and k 1 modified bessel functions of the first and second kind of order 1 respectively the integration is performed over the non shaded part l of the water plane curve the ships draught is t deep or the deepest draught for a trim condition another empirical method called stawave 2 has been developed to approximate the transfer function of the added resistance in regular head waves using the main parameters sea trial analysis jip 2006 it is assumed that the added resistance in waves can be decomposed into a wave reflection component r awrl and a motion induced component r awml the wave reflection component can be written as follows 14 r a w r l s t a 2 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 b α 1 ω 0 15 α 1 ω 0 π 2 i 1 2 1 5 k 0 t m π 2 i 1 2 1 5 k 0 t m k 1 2 1 5 k

and the s175 container ship with fr 0 2 in short waves using the asymptotic formula dash dot line the nmri formula dashed line and stawave 2 dash dot dot line the experimental data for kvlcc2 lee et al 2017 and the s175 container ship fujii and takahashi 1975 nakamura and naito 1977 are also plotted as different symbols all methods provide quite similar values for the kvlcc2 case which has a relatively blunt bow and slow ship speed because the reflection coefficients see eqs 10 and 15 in both empirical formulae become unity in very short waves λ l 0 4 these methods provide a constant value in the very short wave region on the contrary the normalized value becomes large using the asymptotic formula as wavelengths decrease the dimensional added resistance in this case does not diverge because the wave slope is limited in linear wave theory and the incident wave amplitude also becomes small in very short waves the asymptotic formula tends to underestimate the added resistance in short waves for the s175 container ship which has large flare and is relatively faster than kvlcc2 in table 1 the reflection and advance speed coefficients are summarized for the asymptotic and nmri formulae the reflection coefficient becomes unity in the short wave region for both methods whereas the advance speed coefficients differ from each other as shown in fig 3 computational fluid dynamics cfd results conducted by yang et al 2015 for kvlcc2 and the s175 container ship are also plotted in fig 3 in the asymptotic formula the advance speed coefficient will be the same even for different hulls if the ship speed and incident wavelengths are fixed on the other hand the advance speed coefficient of the nmri formula is a function of the bluntness coefficient b f as given in eq 13 this relation was derived from towing tank tests for several hull forms and it included different physical effects simply as a function of the bluntness coefficient thus it is difficult to determine which parameters affect the added resistance in short waves 3 enhanced asymptotic formula 3 1 influence of finite draught in the original asymptotic formula the ship was replaced with a vertical and infinitely long cylinder which has the same sectional area of water plane of the ship based on the assumption that the ship draught is much longer than the incident wave length however the wavelength even in short waves is longer than the draught of the ship as shown in table 2 it is known that the wave drift force on the vertical wall is composed of the pressure integration over the surf zone and the integration of the pressure drop due to velocity square terms below swl the pressure integral to infinite water depth in the original asymptotic formula will overestimate the second component if the draught of a ship is smaller than half of the incident wavelength in general it is difficult to calculate the diffraction wave potential for a ship with finite draught because there will be transmitted waves unlike the total reflection as assumed in the original derivation to derive the practical modification term due to the finite draught of the ship the horizontal control surface far below the free surface is assumed to be located at the level of ship draught while the velocity potentials are the same as those given in the original derivation thus the sectional force can be calculated based on the momentum conservation as follows 17 δ r n t x 0 ζ p ρ v n 2 n d z 1 2 ρ g ζ 2 1 2 ρ t x 0 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z here t x 0 is the sectional draught of the ship and it will be equal to ship draught for even keel conditions the additional term is included in the original asymptotic formula due to the integration of velocity square terms along the vertical control surface from the negative infinite to the ship draught as follows 18 δ r n 1 2 ρ g ζ 2 1 2 ρ 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z 1 2 ρ t x 0 ϕ s 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ n 2 d z substituting the velocity potentials given in eq 1 the sectional average force normal to the wall can be written as follows 19 δ r n 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 k 1 k 0 1 2 c o s 2 θ 1 2 k 2 k 0 s i n θ 1 2 e 2 k 0 t x 0 b 1 2 k 0 k 1 e 2 k 1 t x 0 cos 2 θ e k 1 k 0 t x 0 k 0 cos 2 θ k 2 sin θ k 1 k 2 k 0 sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 using the waterline integration given in eq 8 the total added resistance in short waves denoted by r asw can be obtained and can be decomposed into three components as follows 20 r a s w w l δ r n n 1 d l r ζ r v r v t r ζ 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 k 1 k 0 1 b 1 2 k 0 k 1 k 2 k sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 r v 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 b 1 2 k 0 2 k 1 cos 2 θ 1 2 k 0 cos 2 θ k 2 sin θ k 1 k 2 k 0 sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 r v t 1 2 ρ g ζ a 2 1 2 e 2 k 0 t x 0 b 1 2 k 0 k 1 e 2 k 1 t x 0 cos 2 θ e k 1 k 0 t x 0 k 0 cos 2 θ k 2 sin θ k 1 k 2 k 0 sin θ sin θ b 1 2 k 2 k 1 where r ζ r v and r vt correspond to the integration of each term in eq 18 and the summation of r v and r vt is the suction force due to quadratic velocity below swl r vt is due to the modification of the finite draught of the ship and the suction force will be adjusted for the magnitude of this term the contribution of finite draught effects is exponentially decaying with factors of 2k 0 2k 1 and k 0 k 1 as given in eq 20 those terms are derived from the quadratic terms in the bernoulli s equation and the magnitude of quadratic pressure decays exponentially in the same factor thus it decreases faster in depth direction than the incident wave does the magnitude of quadratic pressure is less than 1 of the maximum quadratic pressure at z 0 if the vertical position is less than one third of the incident wavelength for the present test cases it should be noted that the importance of finite draught correction depends on the wavelength of incident wave and the draught of a ship which will be discussed below the comparison of each component is shown in fig 4 for kvlcc2 with fr 0 142 and the s175 container ship with fr 0 2 in both cases the correction term due to finite draught is negligible for very short wavelengths λ l 0 2 whereas the contribution of this term increases in the region of λ l 0 2 thus it provides almost the same result as the original asymptotic formula for very short wavelengths as shown in fig 5 the results of the original asymptotic formula and the correction method due to finite draught indicated by present r vt in the legend lie within the range of experimental data for the kvlcc2 case in addition the modified method provides similar results to those of the nmri formula on the other hand the results are improved only for λ l 0 5 and the underestimation of added resistance in short waves is still obtained for s175 container ship in this case r v has almost the same magnitude with r ζ in the original asymptotic formula whereas the correction due to finite draught reduces the suction force and consequently the added resistance increases the influence of finite draught correction however is limited for λ l 0 5 and further improvements will be proposed in subsequent sections 3 2 influence of local steady velocity it is reasonable to assume that the diffracted wave is dominantly influenced by the ship geometry only near swl if the incident wave is short enough relative to the ship length and draught however the steady flow may vary with the bow shape below swl in addition to the ships geometry near swl furthermore the sectional area curve is one of the important parameters in designing the hull form with optimized resistance in calm water this indicates that changes in the sectional area will change the steady flow around the ship the proposed local steady velocity in the original derivation faltinsen et al 1980 reflects only the geometrical characteristics at swl and does not consider changes in shape below swl as stated in that paper it is complicated to find the local steady velocity for general ship geometries therefore a simple way to calculate the local steady velocity is required even when considering changes in bow shape below swl the characteristics of steady flow around the bow of wedge shaped bodies with flare and rake angles were studied in noblesse et al 2009 in that paper the ship flare parameter was defined as follows 21 φ tan α e 0 tan α e b tan α e 0 tan α e b where α e0 and α eb are the half of entrance angles at swl and the bottom of the body respectively a conclusion from this study is that the maximum steady wave elevation is approximately proportional to the flare parameter from bernoulli s equation it can be deduced that the local velocity is proportional to the square root of 1 φ in a similar way the local steady velocity v is proposed in the following form keeping it as simple as possible 22 v α a x 0 u cos θ where 23 α a x 0 min 1 0 1 0 a 0 x 0 a x 0 a 0 x 0 a x 0 min 1 0 2 a x 0 a 0 x 0 a x 0 24 a x 0 t x 0 0 y d z 25 a 0 x 0 y 0 t x 0 the correction factor α a x is the parameter related to the sectional area under swl and the area of the rectangle in which the width is the beam at swl denoted by y 0 and the height is the sectional draught t x 0 if the ship is a cylindrical shape with the same sectional area along the vertical direction α a becomes unity and eventually the local steady velocity of the original asymptotic formula is reproduced the local steady velocities along the water plane curve of kvlcc2 and the s175 container ship with fr 0 142 and 0 2 respectively are shown in fig 6 the newly proposed velocity is slightly less than that of the original formula for the kvlcc2 case for the s175 container ship the original local steady flow is almost uniform with the same magnitude of ship speed whereas the modified velocity is approximately 80 of the ship speed the modification of local steady velocity which includes the variation of sectional area provides the increased added resistance of the s175 container ship especially for very short wavelengths λ l 0 2 whereas almost the same results can be obtained for kvlcc2 as shown in fig 7 here the inclusion of the newly proposed local steady velocity is denoted by v in the legend combining the corrections of finite draught and local steady velocity gives improved results of added resistance in the wavelength range considered in this paper the sectional added resistance in wave conditions of λ l 0 2 is shown in fig 8 most of the added resistance is due to the front part of the bow for the kvlcc2 case whereas the sectional added resistance is distributed around the whole bow region for the s175 case the overall magnitude of the sectional added resistance increases if the modification of local steady velocity is used in the s175 case if the local velocity v decreases the reflected wave elevation at many wavelengths away from the ship increases thus the sectional added resistance increases on the other hand if v increases the wave number in normal direction to the sectional ship surface k 2 sometimes becomes imaginary which means that there is no outgoing or reflected wave from that section 3 3 influence of hull shape above still water level as mentioned in the previous section the original asymptotic formula cannot reflect changes of bow shape above swl in this section two different methods are investigated to take into account the variation of bow shape above swl first the baseline level above swl is introduced based on the steady wave elevation the maximum steady wave elevation η 0 for wedge shaped bodies can be obtained as follows noblesse et al 2008 26 η 0 g u 2 min 2 2 1 f t tan α e cos α e 0 5 where 27 f t u g t here α e is half of the entrance angle and it can be approximately calculated for an arbitrary ship geometry as follows 28 tan α e 3 l c 3 f p f p l c x 0 y 0 d x 0 y o x 0 l c l c 29 l c t 2 f t 2 1 f t in the first method the waterline integration is performed along the water plane curve at z η 0 or z η 0 2 in the second method the bluntness coefficients are initially calculated at z 0 and z η 0 2 then the ratio of bluntness coefficients at a different level α b defined in the following form is multiplied by the added resistance in short waves calculated from the previous modified formula 30 α b b f z η 0 2 b f z 0 31 r a s w α b w l δ r n n 1 d l the water plane curves at different levels are compared in fig 9 the original kvlcc2 case has almost the same water plane area at z 0 and z η 0 whereas the modified kvlcc2 with ax bow shape lee et al 2017 shows a sharp edge at z η 0 the water plane area of the s175 container ship slightly increases above swl but the difference is not significant even for the higher speed case fr 0 25 if the water line integration is calculated along the water plane curve at z η 0 or z η 0 2 they show almost identical results as the original kvlcc2 case whereas the difference can be found in ax bow type hull as shown in fig 10 the ax bow type has a relatively sharp bow edge above swl and it provides smaller added resistance than that of the original kvlcc2 this tendency can be observed using the proposed methods however if the waterline integration is performed along the water plane curve at z η 0 the reduction of added resistance due to the ax bow seems to be exaggerated furthermore the second method of simply multiplying the ratio of bluntness coefficients provides almost the same results as direct water line integration along a different level thus the second correction method with z η 0 2 as a baseline level for calculating the bluntness coefficient is applied in the subsequent results for the s175 container ship α b becomes larger than 1 0 because of the flare angle and consequently the added resistance increases if the second method is applied as shown in fig 11 moreover α b also depends on ship speed because the maximum steady elevation depends on the ship speed thus the increase in added resistance due to α b is larger in the faster case fr 0 25 due to the positive flare angle of the s175 container ship 3 4 added resistance in overall wavelengths in the previous sections the added resistance in short waves was the main topic of discussion it is important to note that the previous method is valid only for short waves however the added resistance over a whole range of wavelengths is also a main concern in calculating the weather factor in eedi in the stawave 2 method the total added resistance is decomposed into a motion induced component and a wave reflection component while the correction term due to wave reflection is simply added to the added resistance calculated by maruo s formula in the nmri method in the latter method the diffraction component is double counted even though the added resistance in short waves from maruo s formula is small the wave reflection term in the stawave 2 method and the correction term in the nmri method include reflection parameters see eqs 10 and 15 which are functions of wave frequency thus those terms gradually become zero as the wavelengths increase although the added resistance due to wave diffraction is not zero even in the long wave region kashiwagi 2013 on the contrary guo and steen 2011 suggested a combination method based on the so called r function in this method the r function is defined in a similar way as the nmri and stawave 2 methods whereas 1 r is multiplied to the added resistance of the overall wavelengths calculated by the radiated energy method the present asymptotic formula is valid only for short wavelength cases and it is not applicable in the long wave region thus a method similar to guo and steen 2011 is adapted in this study and a tangent hyperbolic function is used as a blending function instead of complicated bessel functions the tangent hyperbolic function is simple to use in practical applications the added resistance of ships in an overall range of wavelengths then can be estimated as follows 32 r w a v e 1 r λ l r a w r λ l r a s w where r aw is the added resistance in the overall range of wavelengths and the blending function is proposed as follows 33 r λ l 1 2 1 tanh c 1 c 2 λ l here c 1 controls the slope of the tangent hyperbolic function and c 2 determines the mid point position where the blending function becomes 0 5 values of 5 0 and 0 8 for c 1 and c 2 respectively are used in the subsequent results as shown in fig 12 the blending function gradually decreases from λ l 0 3 and it becomes 0 5 when λ l 0 8 as shown in fig 12 the other graphs are reflection coefficients with different parameters of wave number k and ship draught t that is eq 10 applies 1 5 kt eq 15 applies k e t and kt is used for the equation of fujii and takahashi 1975 the added resistance in short waves r asw can be obtained using the present method and the existing method can be applied to calculate the added resistance in moderate and long wave regions in between short and moderate waves the blended value of the two methods will be calculated fig 13 shows the combined results of the present method and existing methods including the strip method park et al 2016 iso 2015 and the time domain rankine panel method rpm seo et al 2014 obviously the results are the same in the short wave region regardless of the existing method and the difference in the other ranges of wavelength solely depend on the accuracy of the existing methods the results of combining the strip method and the nmri formula as summarized in iso 2015 are also presented in some regions e g around λ l 0 8 for kvlcc2 and λ l 1 0 for s175 the nmri method shows overestimated values because the diffraction component is double counted 4 summary of snu formula and procedure from the present enhancement of asymptotic formula developed by faltinsen et al 1980 the following enhanced formula for short waves named to snu formula is proposed as summarized in table 3 the summarized prediction procedure for added resistance in waves is shown in fig 14 from given cp curves and waterline profiles at z 0 the correction factor for local steady velocity α a is obtained using eq 23 the sectional added resistance including the finite draught correction can be calculated using eq 19 the added resistance short waves r asw are then obtained by waterline integration of the sectional added resistance and multiplication of the correction factor of shape above swl α b here α b is calculated using eq 30 where the waterline curve at z η 0 2 is obtained from eq 26 the total added resistance in waves is obtained by adding the added resistance in short waves r asw to the existing added resistance r aw based on the blending function given in eqs 32 and 33 based on the above procedure the added resistances for different ships are calculated the main details of the targeted ships and the parameters used in the present calculation are summarized in table 4 the non dimensional maximum steady wave elevation denoted by η ˆ is 0 5 for blunt ships and slow ship speed cases whereas it becomes around 0 2 for relatively fast ship speed cases the maximum value before a breaking wave occurs is 0 5 noblesse et al 2008 the correction factor due to shape change above swl denoted by α b is larger than 1 0 and it becomes around 1 3 for relatively fast ship speeds with large flare only the ax bow type shows a value less than one the added resistances of the ships discussed above in waves are plotted in fig 15 the strip method is used as an existing method to calculate the added resistance in an overall range of wavelengths because it is efficient to apply in the early stage ship design the results can be interpreted for two distinct regions if the wavelength to ship length ratio is less than 1 2 the combination of the strip method and the nmri formula provides overestimated results this tendency can be clearly observed in the kcs case from an experiment conducted by simonsen et al 2014 this is because the correction term in the nmri formula is simply added to the added resistance of the strip method whereas the factor 1 r is multiplied by the results of the strip method in the present method on the other hand similar results can be observed in the long wave region regardless of the combination method because the correction term in the nmri formula and the blending function in the present method become zero as wavelengths increase the added resistance of the duisburg test case dtc container ship in short waves which has a relatively complicated bow shape is shown in fig 16 this ship was used as a benchmark test model in the shopera project sprenger et al 2016 the present method shows improved results compared to the original asymptotic formula and similar results to other empirical formulae 5 conclusions in this study practical correction methods have been incorporated into faltinsen s asymptotic formula of added resistance in short waves in terms of these three aspects finite draught local steady velocity and shape above swl furthermore a blending function has been proposed to combine the added resistances in short waves and in an overall range of wavelengths from this study the following conclusions can be made the correction due to the finite draught of ships reduces the suction force and eventually the added resistance in short waves increases especially when the wavelength to ship length ratio is larger than 0 3 in the present test cases as local steady velocity decreases the added resistance in short waves increases the newly proposed velocity which includes changes of bow shape below swl provides the increased added resistance value for slender ships to consider the variation of bow shape above swl a baseline level was calculated from the steady wave elevation of a wedge shaped approximated body and the ratio of bluntness coefficients between the swl and the baseline level this was multiplied to the added resistance in short waves using this approach the effect of the change of bow shape above swl on added resistance in short waves can be determined the added resistance in the overall range of wavelengths is calculated by the combination of added resistance in short waves from the proposed method and the existing computational results based on a blending function the new blending function model was based on using a tangent hyperbolic function and the combined results show reasonable agreement with experimental data in short wave regions while the accuracy in other wavelength regions depends on the characteristics of existing computations acknowledgments this study was funded by the office of naval research

23691,to investigate the effect of the deep sea condition on the corrosion behavior cathodic protection and electric field of underwater vehicles potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out under a simulated deep sea condition a 3 d boundary element method bem was used for an underwater vehicle with and without sacrificial anode cathodic protection sacp the simulated deep sea condition influenced the cathodic polarization curves due to the difference between the cathodic reactions under the deep sea condition the cathodic protection potential criterion was more easily satisfied as the protection current density of sacp was decreased the electric field underneath the underwater vehicle showed that the deep sea condition decreased the electric field due to the lower current density and the shape of the electric field distribution changed from one dipole to two dipoles keywords deep sea condition cathodic protection electric field underwater vehicle boundary element method 1 introduction the corrosion of ships underwater vehicles and offshore structures in the seawater environment is an important consideration for the corresponding usages and applications and has led to the development and application of a variety of real field methods one of the common prevention methods is cathodic protection baeckmann et al 1997 in principle it can reduce or prevent the corrosion of exposed structures in seawater the corrosion can be reduced to almost zero and a properly maintained system will provide protection indefinitely jones 1996 the common cathodic protection methods for marine structures are as follows sacrificial anode cathodic protection sacp and impressed current cathodic protection iccp however an improper cathodic protection design causes various problems such as an acceleration of the coating breakdown hydrogen embrittlement the stray current corrosion and the formation of an electric field hartt 2012 wu et al 2011 metwally et al 2008 a proper cathodic protection design is therefore needed to avoid the problems that can arise from the application of an inadequate cathodic protection for underwater vehicles and other naval vessels a minimal underwater signature is important for the provision of a protection against mines and to avoid the detection of underwater barriers and sensors schafer et al 2011 especially the propagated electric field that is caused by the current from corrosion and the cathodic protection covers considerable distances through seawater and it can be easily detected by a sensitive electric field sensor consequently such detections of the electric field signal can jeopardize a ship s safety donati and cadre 2002 guibert et al 2009 so it is important to be able to predict the electric field signal before operation the boundary element method bem was applied to the design of cathodic protection systems in the early 1980s lan et al 2012 bem modelling was applied to various structures and corrosion problems such as the galvanic corrosion region of offshore structures and ships danson and warne 1983 aoki and kishimoto 1991 aoki et al 1988 zamani 1988 in bem based cathodic protection design various tasks such as the modelling procedures regarding the structure environment cathodic protection criteria and the corrosion property of the materials are carried out the design aspects of the cathodic protection system such as the number and the location of the anode for protected structures are of absolute importance because of the numerous uncertainties that depend on the corrosion engineer however the corrosion property that is the polarization curves in the bem simulation must be preferentially considered because the various calculation factors such as the potential and the current of corrosion related electric field are based on the polarization curve thus the achievement of polarization curves that are similar to the real condition is important and consideration of the various environmental factors like the temperature calcareous conductivity flow velocity and ph requires a great amount of effort degiorgi et al 1998 kim et al 2016 according to the seawater depth the corrosion rate is changed due to the influence of various corrosion factors venkatesan et al 2002 schumacher 1979 wan et al 2016 in fact the complex conditions of the deep sea include the following examples local hydrostatic pressure values a low temperature of approximately 4 c and low dissolved oxygen furthermore in terms of their influence of the corrosive behavior result these conditions are in addition to other factors such as the seawater current suspended slit marine biota decaying organic material and dissolved sulfides and carbonates dexter and culberson 1980 it is not possible however to duplicate all of the deep sea variables and changes reinhart 1976 therefore the dissolved oxygen and the temperature exert major effects on the corrosion rate and the corrosive behavior however the consideration of these factors has not been applied due to the difficulty and the complexity of the corrosion tests for the deep sea condition most cathodic protected structures have been designed by rule of thumb and engineering judgement and this may lead to the various side effects that are caused by an improper cathodic protection thus for objects that are located or operated under the submerged seawater condition the corrosion factors of the deep sea must be considered for the cathodic protection design in this study to investigate the influences of surface and deep sea conditions on the cathodic protection design sacp and the electric field of an underwater vehicle consisting of a carbon steel hull hy80 and a nickel aluminium bronze nab alloy propeller potentiodynamic tests and bem simulation were conducted in the case of a small underwater vehicle the sacp is applied due to the limitation of the space and the power supply then the potential and electric field distributions of the underwater vehicle operating at 20 m surface sea condition and 150 m deep sea condition were evaluated using the bem based simulation program that is based on the boundary element method 2 experimental 2 1 materials and test condition hy 80 is one of the common steels that are utilized for the hull and the rudder of underwater vehicles and the mass of the chemical composition is as follows carbon c 0 17 silicon si 0 21 manganese mn 0 29 phosphorous p 0 016 sulfur s 0 03 nickel ni 2 38 chromium cr 1 34 molybdenum mo 0 38 copper cu 0 014 and an iron fe balance the chemical composition of the nab that was used for the propeller is as follows mass aluminum al 10 5 ni 4 92 fe 2 51 mn 1 34 si 0 21 and a cu balance for the potentiodynamic tests the specimens were abraded using 220 to 600 grit sic silicon carbide paper rinsed with acetone and ethanol and then dried with pure nitrogen gas n2 synthetic seawater of the astm d 1141 98 standard astm international u s a was used and the chemical composition of the synthetic seawater is listed in table 1 to adjust the ph to 8 2 a 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh was used the deep sea condition operation at 150 m was simulated through an elimination of the dissolved oxygen with a 99 99 purity nitrogen and the use of an ice chamber to set the temperature as 4 1 c wan et al 2016 oxygen was eliminated in this study to observe the significant effect of cathodic reaction difference between oxygen and hydrogen reduction reactions the tests of the surface sea condition operation at 20 m were carried out at 19 1 c and without the n2 purging 2 2 potentiodynamic polarization test to obtain the cathodic polarization curves of the hy 80 and nab under the surface and deep sea conditions the potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out the cathodic polarization curves were measured using the vsp 300 potentiostat bio logic science instruments france after 1 h immersion in the seawater a conventional three electrode cell consisting of hy80 and nab specimens served as the working electrode two graphite rods served as the counter electrodes and a saturated calomel electrode sce served as the reference electrode was employed the anodic and cathodic curves were measured separately to minimize the effect of each of the part reactions the anodic and cathodic polarization curves were achieved from the open circuit potentials of 200 mvsce vs ocp and 2400 mvsce vs ocp respectively 2 3 modelling and boundary condition the modelling of the bem model of the arbitrary underwater vehicle of a length of 65 3 m width of 6 3 m and height of 13 m is shown in fig 1 bare nab was applied to the propeller surfaces while for the hull and the rudders a 2 breakdown of coated carbon steel was applied for the simulation of the initial condition according to the rule dnv rp b401 2010 therefore the 2 breakdown factor was applied for the carbon steel polarization curves under the surface and deep sea conditions that were set as the boundary conditions of the hull and the rudder while the bare nab polarization curve under the surface and deep sea conditions was set as the propeller boundary condition the sacp system of the present study consists of zinc zn sacrificial anodes brick shape and round shape and the anodes were arranged on the hull and rudder surfaces the sacp system has been previously evaluated in terms of the influences of different cathodic protection systems on the cathodic protection design and the electric field under the deep sea condition only for this paper both the surface and deep sea conditions were investigated thus the different conditions were considered according to a simulation process depending on the seawater depth a cube with the dimensions of 1500 m 1500 m 300 m was created as the seawater boundary and the underwater vehicle was located in the 20 m and 150 m depth regions the seawater conductivity was set as 5 s m additionally to interpret the electric field signatures an interesting signature plane 150 m 80 m and a line from 75 m 0 m 30 m and 160 m to 75 m 0 m 30 m and 160 m were simulated along the underwater vehicle below the 10 m regions the schematic illustrations of the modelling for the different environments the internal plane and the line for the interpretation of the electric field signature are shown in fig 2 3 result and discussion 3 1 cathodic polarization curves fig 3 shows the polarization curves of the a carbon steel b nab and c zn sacrificial anode under the simulated surface and deep sea environments in the case of the carbon steel the cathodic polarization curves under surface and deep sea conditions showed different shapes from the open circuit potential to 1 0 vsce which influences the value of the open circuit potential and current density the shape of cathodic polarization curves of the carbon steel is different in the environment condition the diffusion limiting current region which is the vertical line in the cathodic curve is disappeared under the deep sea condition in the case of the nab the shapes of the cathodic polarization curves are similar but the overall polarization curves under the deep sea condition are shifted toward the direction of current density and potential that are lower than those of the polarization curves under the surface water condition it indicates that the change of the environmental condition influenced the polarization curves of both carbon steel and nab which can affect the cathodic protection and the electric field signature zn also shows the change of the cathodic polarization curves according to the environment conditions and the anodic polarization curve of zn had the lower open circuit potential and current density under the simulated deep sea condition anodic region in the polarization curve of the sacrificial anode is the main consideration because the sacrificial anode always acts as an anode in the cathodic protection system the change of the anodic polarization curve can affect the potential distribution and underwater electric field thus it is important to consider the polarization curve of zn under deep seawater condition for the increase of simulation accuracy to interpret the cathodic reaction on the polarization curves of the carbon steel and nab the schematic representation of the polarization curves under surface and deep sea conditions is shown in fig 4 interpretation of the cathodic polarization curve of the sacrificial anode is excluded because the anodic polarization curve of sacrificial anode is mainly considered as mentioned above generally the cathodic polarization curves can be composed of three reduction reactions oxygen reduction hydrogen reduction and a direct water reduction as follows jones 1996 1 o2 2h2o 4e 4oh 2 2h 2e h2 3 2h2o 2e h2 2oh under an aerated condition like surface seawater all three of these reduction reactions can occur however under a deaerated condition like the deep sea it is not possible for the oxygen reduction reaction to occur due to the absence of dissolved oxygen stansbury and buchanan 2000 moreover the hydrogen reduction reaction is limited regarding the neutral and alkaline electrolytes due to the low dissolved hydrogen amount and this then influences the current density decrease shift of the curves to the left direction of the hydrogen reduction reaction these cathodic reactions which are indicated in the measured polarization curves changed the behavior of the polarization curves 3 2 potential and current distribution fig 5 shows the potential and current distributions of the underwater vehicle operating at 20 and 150 m without the application of the cathodic protection the units of the current density and the potential are a m2 and vsce respectively as the distance from the propeller was decreased the current density was increased under both conditions which is caused by the galvanic corrosion of the hull and the propeller galvanic corrosion is an electrochemical process in which one metal corrodes preferentially when dissimilar metals are in electrical contact in the presence of a solution in this case the propeller which has a more positive potential than the hull acted as a cathode while the hull acted as an anode the current and potential distributions were caused by certain factors which include the followings baeckmann et al 1997 1 due to the differing distances to the nearest anode surface the current from the finite anode location is variably accessed on the cathode surface 2 the potential and the current density of the surface are nonuniform because the attenuation effect of the environmental resistivity results in different potential and current density values depending on the path length to a surface on the structure 3 the geometrical complexity can influence the distributions and this creates difficulty for the current access from the anode to the cathode the degree of the current density and the distribution range of the potential differ depending on the operating depth the lower current density of the polarization curve under the deep sea condition leads to a lower galvanic effect because the cathodic and anodic reactions must be equal according to the mixed potential theory power and ritchie 1981 consequently the degree of the current density and the range of the potential distributions under the deep sea condition are lower than those under the surface sea condition the current density and the potential distributions of the underwater vehicles operating at 20 and 150 m after the sacp application are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively to clarify the effect of the sacrificial anode on the current density and the potential of the underwater vehicle the results were divided into two cases from the current density result for which the sacrificial anode is shown the operational current density of the sacrificial anodes is higher at 20 m maximum value 31 564 a m2 than that of the sacrificial anodes at 150 m maximum value 11 337 a m2 when the sacrificial anode is hidden the value of current density is significantly different that is the ranges of the operational current density at the depth of 20 m and 150 m are 0 070 to 0 672 a m2 and 0 010 to 0 093 a m2 respectively the results indicate that the current that was applied to the hull for the cathodic protection under the surface sea condition is greater than that of the deep sea condition however even though the higher operational current density was applied at 20 m compared with 150 m the potential distribution at 20 m indicated an insufficient protection the ranges of the operational potential at 20 and 150 m are 0 648 to 1 00 vsce and 0 894 to 0 990 vsce respectively this means that under the 150 m operating condition the cathodic protection criterion less than approximately 800 mvsce can be easily satisfied with an applied current density that is lower than that under the 20 m operating condition based on the evan s diagram kim et al 2016 fig 8 is a schematic representation of the polarization curves in relation to the potential and the applied current density at 20 m surface sea and 150 m deep sea for the cathodic protection the original potential the potential without the cathodic protection must be lowered and the applied current density needs to be from an external source through this process the applied current density for the cathodic protection potential was changed according to the polarization curves subramaniam and bi 2010 for this study the polarization curves of the hy 80 and the nab under the surface and deep sea conditions were shifted toward the direction of the lower current density due to this change of the polarization curves the applied current density for the cathodic protection under the 150 m operating condition is lower than that under the 20 m operating condition as shown in fig 8 in brief the operation depth should be considered for the cathodic protection design of underwater vehicles that operate in the ocean environment 3 3 electric field signature the signature planes of the electric field from the underwater vehicle according to the component e x e y e z and e ave below 10 m with and without the cathodic protection at the depth of 20 m and 150 m are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively all of the electric field values have been normalized the electric field distributions without the cathodic protection at 20 and 150 m are similar as shown in fig 9 the electric dipole between the propeller and the hull was generated due to the galvanic corrosion and the electric field distribution is only slightly influenced by the environments surface and deep sea conditions however the intensity of the electric field under the 20 m operating condition is almost 10 times higher than that under the 150 m operating condition the electric field in the seawater a semi infinite conducting medium is expressed as follows varney et al 1999 2000 chung et al 2011 4 e i σ ν b where σ is the electric conductivity of the environment i is the electric current density flowing through the environment ν is the water current velocity and b is the earth s geomagnetic field the electric field by the movement of water through the earth s magnetic field ν b is ignored because the electric field that is caused by the current from the corrosion and the cathodic protection is the main component of the underwater vehicle therefore eq 4 is rearranged as follows 5 σ e i according to eq 5 the electric field is proportional to the current density at a fixed σ as mentioned in section 3 2 the current density without the cathodic protection under the 20 m operating condition is significantly higher than that under the 150 m operating condition consequently the electric field under the 20 m operating condition is higher than that under the 150 m operating condition also the electric field is proportional to the potential difference on the surface the potential difference is larger under the surface sea condition than that under the deep sea condition consequently it affects the intensity of the electric field under these conditions the magnitude of the electric field was increased after the application of the sacp as shown in fig 10 which is induced by the additional current from the sacrificial anodes also the electric field under the 150 m operating condition is much smaller than that under the 20 m operating condition due to the lower current density and the potential difference which is similar to the case of the underwater vehicle without cathodic protection in the case of the surface sea condition with the sacp the electric field distribution indicates the dipole situation between the propeller and the hull which is similar to the case without cathodic protection implying that the influence of the sacrificial anodes on the electric field distribution is limited under the 20 m operating condition under the 20 m operating condition the current flowing is dominantly formed by the galvanic corrosion between the propeller and hull because the current density is larger as mentioned in section 3 1 therefore the current from the sacrificial anode under the 20 m operating condition is so feeble that the electric field is almost neglected in the case of the 150 m operating condition with the sacp however the electric field distribution was significantly changed which may be due to the additional dipole generation between the hull and the sacrificial anode at the bow of underwater vehicle the current flowing by the galvanic corrosion under the 150 m operating condition is decreased due to the decrease of the current density and the corrosion potential difference between the polarization curves of propeller and hull it means that the dipole that was generated by the propeller and the hull is decreased due to the diminishment of the dipole in the stern region of the underwater vehicle the dipole generated by the hull and the sacrificial anodes in the bow region of the underwater vehicle is conspicuous consequently the fluctuation of the electric field distribution in the bow region is indicated the line profiles of the electric field along the underwater vehicle that are based on the environment and the application of the cathodic protection are indicated in fig 11 the e y is almost zero in all of the results due to the symmetry along the y axis under the 20 m operating condition the absolute maximum normalized values of e x and e z were increased from 0 39 to 0 54 38 increase and from 0 63 to 0 91 44 increase respectively and only slight fluctuations are evident at the 45 m wide stern and 90 m wide middle region of the hull regions after the application of the sacp under the 150 m operating condition the absolute maximum value of e x and e z were increased from 0 04 to 0 09 125 increase and from 0 07 to 0 12 71 increase respectively after application of the sacp however the distribution shape with the sacp is largely changed at the 45 m and 90 m wide locations stern and middle region of the hull respectively although the increased amount of electric field is larger under the 150 m operating condition the absolute value is very smaller it indicated that the influence of the protection current density from the sacrificial anode is significant under the 150 m operating condition but the total current density from the underwater vehicle and sacrificial anode is bigger under the 20 m operating condition consequently this study has confirmed that the sacrificial anodes influence the generation of the electric fields as a dipole in brief the intensity of the electric fields was increased after the application of the sacp in both cases but the shape of distribution was changed due to the influence of the current density according to the environments 4 conclusion in this study the influences of simulated deep sea environments temperature and dissolved oxygen regarding the corrosion behavior of steel and nab and the underwater electric field signature for an underwater vehicle were investigated using polarization tests and bem simulations in the potentiodynamic polarization tests the measured current density was decreased and the shapes of the polarization curves were changed under the simulated deep sea condition for both steel and nab due to the different cathodic reactions in the bem simulations the intensity of the current density and the potential distribution ranges o were increased under the 20 m operating condition also the cathodic protection potential criterion was only satisfied under the150 m operating condition despite the application of the same sacp the magnitude of the electric field was decreased under the 150 m operating condition due to the decrease of the current density in the polarization curve the shape of the distribution under the 20 m operating condition was not significantly changed after the application of the sacp however it was changed from one dipole to two dipoles condition under the 150 m operating condition which may be due to the influence of the protection current density from the sacrificial anodes acknowledgments this work was supported by the agency for defense development no ud150010dd 
23691,to investigate the effect of the deep sea condition on the corrosion behavior cathodic protection and electric field of underwater vehicles potentiodynamic polarization tests were carried out under a simulated deep sea condition a 3 d boundary element method bem was used for an underwater vehicle with and without sacrificial anode cathodic protection sacp the simulated deep sea condition influenced the cathodic polarization curves due to the difference between the cathodic reactions under the deep sea condition the cathodic protection potential criterion was more easily satisfied as the protection current density of sacp was decreased the electric field underneath the underwater vehicle showed that the deep sea condition decreased the electric field due to the lower current density and the shape of the electric field distribution changed from one dipole to two dipoles keywords deep sea condition cathodic protection electric field underwater vehicle boundary element method 1 introduction the corrosion of ships underwater vehicles and offshore structures in the seawater environment is an important consideration for the corresponding usages and applications and has led to the development and application of a variety of real field methods one of the common prevention methods is cathodic protection baeckmann et al 1997 in principle it can reduce or prevent the corrosion of exposed structures in seawater the corrosion can be reduced to almost zero and a properly maintained system will provide protection indefinitely jones 1996 the common cathodic protection methods for marine structures are as follows sacrificial anode cathodic protection sacp and impressed current cathodic protection iccp however an improper cathodic protection design causes various problems such as an acceleration of the coating breakdown hydrogen embrittlement the stray current corrosion and the formation of an electric field hartt 2012 wu et al 2011 metwally et al 2008 a proper cathodic protection design is therefore needed to avoid the problems that can arise from the application of an inadequate cathodic protection for underwater vehicles and other naval vessels a minimal underwater signature is important for the provision of a protection against mines and to avoid the detection of underwater barriers and sensors schafer et al 2011 especially the propagated electric field that is caused by the current from corrosion and the cathodic protection covers considerable distances through seawater and it can be easily detected by a sensitive electric field sensor consequently such detections of the electric field signal can jeopardize a ship s safety donati and cadre 2002 guibert et al 2009 so it is important to be able to predict the electric field

with 150 m the potential distribution at 20 m indicated an insufficient protection the ranges of the operational potential at 20 and 150 m are 0 648 to 1 00 vsce and 0 894 to 0 990 vsce respectively this means that under the 150 m operating condition the cathodic protection criterion less than approximately 800 mvsce can be easily satisfied with an applied current density that is lower than that under the 20 m operating condition based on the evan s diagram kim et al 2016 fig 8 is a schematic representation of the polarization curves in relation to the potential and the applied current density at 20 m surface sea and 150 m deep sea for the cathodic protection the original potential the potential without the cathodic protection must be lowered and the applied current density needs to be from an external source through this process the applied current density for the cathodic protection potential was changed according to the polarization curves subramaniam and bi 2010 for this study the polarization curves of the hy 80 and the nab under the surface and deep sea conditions were shifted toward the direction of the lower current density due to this change of the polarization curves the applied current density for the cathodic protection under the 150 m operating condition is lower than that under the 20 m operating condition as shown in fig 8 in brief the operation depth should be considered for the cathodic protection design of underwater vehicles that operate in the ocean environment 3 3 electric field signature the signature planes of the electric field from the underwater vehicle according to the component e x e y e z and e ave below 10 m with and without the cathodic protection at the depth of 20 m and 150 m are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively all of the electric field values have been normalized the electric field distributions without the cathodic protection at 20 and 150 m are similar as shown in fig 9 the electric dipole between the propeller and the hull was generated due to the galvanic corrosion and the electric field distribution is only slightly influenced by the environments surface and deep sea conditions however the intensity of the electric field under the 20 m operating condition is almost 10 times higher than that under the 150 m operating condition the electric field in the seawater a semi infinite conducting medium is expressed as follows varney et al 1999 2000 chung et al 2011 4 e i σ ν b where σ is the electric conductivity of the environment i is the electric current density flowing through the environment ν is the water current velocity and b is the earth s geomagnetic field the electric field by the movement of water through the earth s magnetic field ν b is ignored because the electric field that is caused by the current from the corrosion and the cathodic protection is the main component of the underwater vehicle therefore eq 4 is rearranged as follows 5 σ e i according to eq 5 the electric field is proportional to the current density at a fixed σ as mentioned in section 3 2 the current density without the cathodic protection under the 20 m operating condition is significantly higher than that under the 150 m operating condition consequently the electric field under the 20 m operating condition is higher than that under the 150 m operating condition also the electric field is proportional to the potential difference on the surface the potential difference is larger under the surface sea condition than that under the deep sea condition consequently it affects the intensity of the electric field under these conditions the magnitude of the electric field was increased after the application of the sacp as shown in fig 10 which is induced by the additional current from the sacrificial anodes also the electric field under the 150 m operating condition is much smaller than that under the 20 m operating condition due to the lower current density and the potential difference which is similar to the case of the underwater vehicle without cathodic protection in the case of the surface sea condition with the sacp the electric field distribution indicates the dipole situation between the propeller and the hull which is similar to the case without cathodic protection implying that the influence of the sacrificial anodes on the electric field distribution is limited under the 20 m operating condition under the 20 m operating condition the current flowing is dominantly formed by the galvanic corrosion between the propeller and hull because the current density is larger as mentioned in section 3 1 therefore the current from the sacrificial anode under the 20 m operating condition is so feeble that the electric field is almost neglected in the case of the 150 m operating condition with the sacp however the electric field distribution was significantly changed which may be due to the additional dipole generation between the hull and the sacrificial anode at the bow of underwater vehicle the current flowing by the galvanic corrosion under the 150 m operating condition is decreased due to the decrease of the current density and the corrosion potential difference between the polarization curves of propeller and hull it means that the dipole that was generated by the propeller and the hull is decreased due to the diminishment of the dipole in the stern region of the underwater vehicle the dipole generated by the hull and the sacrificial anodes in the bow region of the underwater vehicle is conspicuous consequently the fluctuation of the electric field distribution in the bow region is indicated the line profiles of the electric field along the underwater vehicle that are based on the environment and the application of the cathodic protection are indicated in fig 11 the e y is almost zero in all of the results due to the symmetry along the y axis under the 20 m operating condition the absolute maximum normalized values of e x and e z were increased from 0 39 to 0 54 38 increase and from 0 63 to 0 91 44 increase respectively and only slight fluctuations are evident at the 45 m wide stern and 90 m wide middle region of the hull regions after the application of the sacp under the 150 m operating condition the absolute maximum value of e x and e z were increased from 0 04 to 0 09 125 increase and from 0 07 to 0 12 71 increase respectively after application of the sacp however the distribution shape with the sacp is largely changed at the 45 m and 90 m wide locations stern and middle region of the hull respectively although the increased amount of electric field is larger under the 150 m operating condition the absolute value is very smaller it indicated that the influence of the protection current density from the sacrificial anode is significant under the 150 m operating condition but the total current density from the underwater vehicle and sacrificial anode is bigger under the 20 m operating condition consequently this study has confirmed that the sacrificial anodes influence the generation of the electric fields as a dipole in brief the intensity of the electric fields was increased after the application of the sacp in both cases but the shape of distribution was changed due to the influence of the current density according to the environments 4 conclusion in this study the influences of simulated deep sea environments temperature and dissolved oxygen regarding the corrosion behavior of steel and nab and the underwater electric field signature for an underwater vehicle were investigated using polarization tests and bem simulations in the potentiodynamic polarization tests the measured current density was decreased and the shapes of the polarization curves were changed under the simulated deep sea condition for both steel and nab due to the different cathodic reactions in the bem simulations the intensity of the current density and the potential distribution ranges o were increased under the 20 m operating condition also the cathodic protection potential criterion was only satisfied under the150 m operating condition despite the application of the same sacp the magnitude of the electric field was decreased under the 150 m operating condition due to the decrease of the current density in the polarization curve the shape of the distribution under the 20 m operating condition was not significantly changed after the application of the sacp however it was changed from one dipole to two dipoles condition under the 150 m operating condition which may be due to the influence of the protection current density from the sacrificial anodes acknowledgments this work was supported by the agency for defense development no ud150010dd 
23692,a numerical method has been developed for predicting ship squat with the goal of providing guidance to ship operators for avoidance of grounding in shallow water the method assumes potential flow and computations are sufficiently fast to allow evaluation for large numbers of conditions within practical time scales boundary conditions on the hull free surface and canal walls are satisfied using planar rankine sources on solid boundaries and point rankine sources placed a nominal distance above the calm waterline or free surface four different models of the free surface boundary condition have been implemented ranging from a nominally flat free surface to fully nonlinear for ships with a transom stern the influence of flow separation is modelled using a virtual stern which extends afterward from the transom to a location with zero width the numerical method is generally robust except for in the vicinity of critical flow conditions validation with model tests has been used to develop an envelope for over prediction of bottom clearance which can be considered when developing guidance for ship operators keywords heave pitch rankine method sinkage squat trim 1 introduction a ship moving at speed in shallow water is subjected to squat a reduction in clearance from the water bottom due to hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship briggs et al 2010 give a comprehensive description of squat and its prediction squat increases the risk of grounding and is thus of significant concern to ship operators ideally a ship operator should have a good understanding of squat for combinations of ship loading condition water depth and ship speed that might be encountered increasingly complex methods are available for predicting squat in both open and confined waters various simple methods are available including those described by dand and ferguson 1973 millward 1990 and lataire et al 2012 beck et al 1975 and gourlay 2008 used slender body approaches for predicting squat yao and zou 2010 developed a potential flow panel method and compared it with results from model tests for a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 computational fluid dynamics using reynolds averaged navier stokes modelling rans cfd can provide high fidelity modelling of ship steady flow including squat jachowski 2008 toxopeus et al 2013 the present work was motivated by the requirement to predict squat for operational vessels each operating with various loading conditions water conditions and ship speeds it was decided that a potential flow rankine panel method similar to that used by yao and zou 2010 would provided a suitable balance of accuracy and computational time furthermore potential flow seakeeping software was already available mctaggart 2015 that could be used as the foundation for developing the steady flow method some exploratory work was done using rans cfd however computational times were very large typically exceeding one day for each combination of ship loading condition water depth and speed 2 solution of flow surrounding ship and resulting sinkage and trim the solution of ship squat uses an iterative process to determine the ship sinkage and trim that results in zero net forces acting on the ship the flow surrounding the ship and resulting ship forces must be solved during each iteration the flow surrounding the ship is solved using a boundary element method for which bertram 2012 presents an overview the axis system has its origin on the calm waterlane and is aligned vertically with the ship centre of gravity the x axis is forward the y axis is port and the z axis is upward the flow potential in the vicinity of the hull and free surface is modelled as 1 φ x u x ϕ x where φ is the total steady potential x is a location in the fluid domain u is the steady ship speed and ϕ is the scattered potential due to the presence of the hull the discretized scattered potential on the hull and free surface can be expressed based on source strengths σ x on the hull and free surface as follows 2 ϕ e σ where e is the influence matrix giving scattered velocity potentials from source strengths for a ship in deep water the elements of the influence matrix e are given by 3 e i j 1 4 π a j 1 r x i x s d a where a j is the area of source panel j and r is the distance from a source at x s to a field point at x i the source strengths must be set such that boundary conditions at the hull and free surface are satisfied the zero normal flow boundary condition on the hull is 4 ϕ n u n x on s h u l l the free surface s f r e e is denoted by z ζ x y at which the following kinematic boundary condition must be satisfied 5 ϕ z u ϕ x ζ x ϕ y ζ y at z ζ the pressure at a point in the fluid domain is given by 6 p ρ g z 1 2 u 2 u ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 given that the pressure must be zero at the free surface the free surface elevation ζ is given by 7 ζ 1 2 g u 2 u ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 the associated x and y derivatives of water elevation are 8 ζ x 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ x z ϕ z 9 ζ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z for a ship in shallow water the following boundary condition at the water bottom must be satisfied 10 ϕ z 0 on s b o t t o m the present work considers only cases with constant water depth allowing the influence of the water bottom to be solved using image sources garrison 1978 the elements of the influence matrix e are then given by 11 e i j 1 4 π a j 1 r x i x s 1 r i m a g e x i x s d a where r i m a g e is the distance to the image source reflected about the ocean bottom vertical walls from a canal or other stationary body can also be modelled in such cases the vertical wall must be panelled and the following boundary condition must be satisfied on each panel 12 ϕ y 0 on s w a l l the ability of the solution to satisfy the boundary condition at each free surface point can be evaluated using the following error term based on bertram 2012 13 ε f 1 u g a 1 ϕ x u a 2 ϕ y a 3 g ϕ z where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are given by 14 a 1 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ x y ϕ z 2 ϕ x z 15 a 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ y z 16 a 3 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x z ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z 2 ϕ z 2 a nonlinear solution with successful convergence of wave elevation gives boundary condition errors that are effectively zero 2 1 double body solution the simplest approach for modelling the free surface assumes that it is nominally flat satisfying the following boundary condition 17 ϕ z 0 0 on z 0 0 where ϕ is referred to as the double body potential solution of the resulting flow field can be done without panelling of the free surface by using image sources of the hull reflected about z 0 0 garrison 1978 the double body solution can give good results at low ship speeds which can be useful because free surface wavelengths are very small at such speeds thus requiring large numbers of panels for solutions using a panelled free surface the double body solution is very robust garrison 1978 describes evaluation of the double body solution for both deep water and water of finite depth 2 2 uniform linearized free surface solution a linearized solution based on the uniform incident flow provides a simple approach to evaluate the free surface as shown by tarafder and khalil 2006 the scattered velocity components are assumed to be small relative to the ship speed and the flow kinematic terms at z 0 0 are assumed to be representative of the free surface the free surface kinematic condition of equation 5 is then simplified to 18 2 ϕ x 2 g u 2 ϕ z 0 0 on z 0 0 the free surface elevation is given by 19 ζ u g ϕ x the uniform linearized solution can give excellent results for submerged bodies and for surface piercing bodies that are slender at the free surface 2 3 double body linearized free surface solution to improve upon the accuracy provided by the uniform linearized solution the free surface can be linearized with respect to the double body flow similar to the method developed by dawson 1977 the scattered velocity potential is expressed in terms of the double body velocity potential for the hull ϕ and the perturbation potential ϕ ˆ that accounts for the free surface 20 ϕ ϕ ϕ ˆ it is assumed that the z derivatives of flow velocities are small near the free surface allowing the kinematic boundary condition of equation 5 to be satisfied at the mean free surface 21 ϕ z u ϕ x ζ x ϕ y ζ y at z 0 0 combining equation 21 with equations 8 and 9 for the wave slope the boundary condition for the mean free surface is 22 ϕ z u ϕ x 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ x z ϕ z ϕ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z at z 0 0 the solution method proceeds by first solving the double body potential ϕ and then solving the total scattered potential ϕ noting that the double potential derivatives ϕ z 2 ϕ x z and 2 ϕ y z are all equal to zero at z 0 0 the double body linearized equation for the total scattered potential ϕ satisfying the free surface boundary condition is 23 ϕ z u ϕ x 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y ϕ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y ϕ x u 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x ϕ x 2 ϕ x y 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ x y ϕ y ϕ y ϕ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ x ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y ϕ y at z 0 0 2 4 nonlinear free surface solution for a given ship orientation speed and water depth the nonlinear free surface boundary condition can be solved to very high accuracy using an iterative approach jensen et al 1986 bertram 2012 during each iteration the free surface elevations and velocity potentials on the free surface from the previous iteration must be used and these are denoted ϕ and ζ respectively the solution of equations to be solved can be written as follows 24 h h u l l h u l l h h u l l f r e e h f r e e h u l l h f r e e f r e e σ h u l l σ f r e e p h u l l p f r e e where h is the influence matrix giving boundary condition values from source strengths and p is the vector of boundary condition values to be satisfied the influence matrix h and boundary condition vector p have been partitioned into portions based on the hull and free surface the boundary condition on the hull is satisfied by 25 p i u n x x i for 0 i n h u l l 26 h i j e i j n for 0 i n h u l l note that panels on the hull are numbered from 0 to n h u l l 1 the boundary condition on the free surface is much more complex because it includes the influence of potential derivatives up to third order the terms a 1 a 2 and a 3 are evaluated using equations 14 16 and the potential from the previous iteration ϕ in addition the following term is introduced 27 b 1 g a 3 ϕ x u 2 3 ϕ x 2 z ϕ y 2 3 ϕ y 2 z ϕ z 2 3 ϕ z 3 g 2 ϕ z 2 2 ϕ x u ϕ y 3 ϕ x y z ϕ x u ϕ z 3 ϕ x z 2 ϕ y ϕ z 3 ϕ y z 2 2 ϕ x z a 1 2 ϕ y z a 2 2 ϕ z 2 a 3 the boundary condition terms to be satisfied on the previous guess of the free surface ζ are 28 p i 2 a 1 ϕ x 2 a 2 ϕ y 2 a 3 ϕ z b 1 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 u 2 g ζ u ϕ x u for n h u l l i n h u l l n f r e e the influence matrix terms giving the free surface boundary values from source strengths are 29 h i j 2 a 1 e i j x a 2 e i j y a 3 e i j z ϕ x u ϕ y 2 e i j x y ϕ x u ϕ z 2 e i j x z ϕ y ϕ z 2 e i j y z ϕ x u 2 2 e i j x 2 ϕ y 2 2 e i j y 2 ϕ z 2 2 e i j z 2 g e i j z b ϕ x u e i j x ϕ y e i j y ϕ z e i j z for n h u l l i n h u l l n f r e e the solution proceeds by solving for the source strengths σ then new flow potentials ϕ and associated derivatives at the previous guess ζ of the free surface the new free surface ζ is then evaluated using the previous guess of the free surface ζ and the previous and newly solved potentials ϕ ζ and ϕ ζ at the old free surface 30 ζ ζ ζ n ζ d 31 ζ n ϕ x u ϕ x u ϕ y ϕ y ϕ z ϕ z 1 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 u 2 g ζ 32 ζ d g ϕ x u 2 ϕ x z ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z 2 ϕ z 2 once the location of the new free surface ζ has been solved the flow potentials and their derivatives can be evaluated on the new free surface during each iteration the quality of the solution can be evaluated by examining the free surface boundary condition errors from equation 13 to obtain successful convergence of the nonlinear free surface solution the most important factor is the quality of the initial guess the double body linearized solution provides a suitably accurate initial guess for most cases 2 5 modelling of sources fig 1 shows an example computational source mesh for a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 the shown view is a close up in the vicinity of the ship and includes only a portion of the free surface the hull is modelled by planar panels which also serve as source panels the free surface is also modelled by planar panels however a point source with vertical offset above the free surface is used for each free surface panel avoiding singularities during evaluation of 1 r for linearized free surface computations the point sources can be located at a constant elevation above the calm free surface for nonlinear free surface computations good results are obtained when the point source associated with each free surface panel is located at a specified distance above the centroid elevation of that panel although using raised sources for the free surface provides advantages it introduces the complexity of requiring additional panelling between the hull and the raised sources for the free surface fig 1 shows the usage of a virtual hull wall green between the actual hull yellow and raised free surface sources blue the virtual hull wall has vertical panels extending from the ship waterline to the raised free surface sources 2 6 evaluation of potential derivatives and radiation condition the evaluation of potential derivatives and the radiation at the fore boundary of the domain are closely related solution of the free surface flow requires evaluation of flow potential derivatives up to third order dawson 1977 and raven 1996 used a backward difference method to evaluate derivatives of flow potentials a backward difference method can easily satisfy the radiation of the flow velocity being undisturbed at the fore boundary furthermore the usage of a finite difference method such as backward difference reduces the order of derivatives that must be evaluated for the term 1 r and its associated integrals over source panels the present work evaluates potential derivatives directly including second and third order derivatives the radiation boundary condition at the fore boundary of the domain is satisfied by shifting sources associated with the foremost part of the domain to immediately aft of the domain as described by bertram 2012 in comparison with finite difference methods this method has the advantage of requiring many fewer panels for resolution of the flow field 2 7 modelling of transom sterns the current potential flow solution does not include modelling of flow separation for ships with transom sterns a potential flow solution can give unrealistically high velocity gradients in the vicinity of the transom the present method can use a virtual stern on a ship to approximate the influence of flow separation fig 2 shows a dtmb 5512 destroyer model irvine et al 2013 with a transom stern and with a virtual narrow stern the narrow stern extends aft 1 10 of the length of the ship and is a vertical line at its aftmost location the virtual transom stern is not included when integrating vertical forces acting on the ship it is postulated that the influence of a virtual transom stern will have only a very minor influence on squat predictions which are dominated by vertical forces 2 8 solution of sinkage and trim the sinkage and trim are solved in an iterative manner using the following equation 33 δ η 3 δ η 5 c 33 c 35 c 53 c 55 f 3 g f 5 where η 3 and η 5 are heave and pitch displacements c i j is hydrostatic stiffness η 3 and η 5 are heave and pitch displacements and is ship mass displacement the flow solution is re evaluated for each iteration of sinkage and trim forces on the hull are integrated using the actual wetted surface for each iteration relaxation methods are applied to prevent changes in heave or pitch from being excessively large between iterations when solving sinkage and trim using linearized free surface methods the calm free surface is repanelled for each iteration because the ship waterplane will vary with sinkage and trim for solution of sinkage and trim using the nonlinear free surface method the sinkage and trim are typically solved initially using the double body linearized method this initial solution of sinkage and trim increases the likelihood of successful convergence for the nonlinear free surface 3 software implementation the required software for solution of the free surface and resulting sinkage and trim was obtained by extending the shipmo3d ship motion library mctaggart 2010 2015 shipmo3d is written in c michaelis and lippert 2016 which facilitates efficient software development and includes a numerical capability for complex numbers linear systems of equations are solved utilizing the intel mkl library wang et al 2014 the majority of the software was written in c which runs in the net runtime some portions of the software were written in native c with the goal of improving computational performance recent experience suggests that software written in c is now giving very similar performance to native c code parallel processing was achieved with only modest development efforts required the solution of linear systems with the intel mkl library includes parallel processing solution influence terms involving 1 r and its derivatives are solved in parallel 4 computational experience computational experience with the solution of squat for a variety of ships and operating conditions has provided guidance for application of the developed method froude numbers based on ship length and water depth are defined respectively by 34 f l u g l 35 f h u g h most of the present work has been for ship length froude numbers up to 0 4 comments below regarding numbers of panels apply to half the total domain because lateral symmetry applies 4 1 ship in open deep water a ship in open deep water is among the simpler cases and is further simplified if the ship is fully submerged below the water surface the free surface panelling can extend in the x direction from 2 5 l to 1 0 l and in the y direction to 1 2 l the ship can usually be represented sufficiently accurately with 1000 panels on the wet portion selection of panel size is of critical importance for achieving an appropriate balance between accuracy and computation time furthermore satisfaction of the radiation condition has been found to be dependent on panel size likely due to the approach of moving sources from the foremost location of the domain to aft of the domain in practice the current method works well when using a constant panel x length in an inner region surrounding the ship and then increasing panel x length gradually to the outer boundaries of the domain an inner region of 2 0 l x 0 7 l has proven to work well it has been found that a suitable maximum x panel length in the outer region is 2 0 times the x panel length in the inner region very good results are obtained when the free surface sources are located 1 0 times the maximum x panel length above the calm water level for linear computations and above the computed wave elevation for nonlinear computations an inner x panel length of 0 026 l gives excellent nonlinear convergence for froude numbers of 0 16 and greater corresponding to having 6 or more panels in the x direction per wavelength at lower froude numbers the free surface in deep water is effectively flat and the double body solution can be used requiring no panelling of the free surface it is suggested that the y panel length be approximately equal to the x panel length however it has been found that it is sometimes necessary to increase the panel length in the y direction to obtain nonlinear solution convergence likely due to numerical instabilities associated with wave breaking immediately adjacent to the hull for a surface piercing ship panelling must include the virtual hull wall between the free surface and its raised sources it has been found that having 4 panels in the vertical direction works well various checks can be performed to verify that a numerical solution is valid the free surface should be flat at the foremost portion of the fluid domain in deep water the scattered flow velocity components should have magnitudes less than 0 01 u the condition number for the influence matrix to solve source strengths should not be excessively large also the non dimensional boundary condition errors on the free surface from equation 13 should be small linearized solutions should typically provide rms ε f errors less than 0 01 based on sampling of all free surface panels when iteratively solving the nonlinear free surface the implemented software has demonstrated very good convergence for cases in open deep water during successive iterations both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the free surface are repanelled with the change of horizontal dimensions dependent on how much the ship hull walls vary from being vertical a relaxation factor of 0 6 is typically applied to successive iterations of the free surface 4 2 ship in restricted water the above comments regarding deep water provide useful guidance for ships in restricted water however successful solution of cases in restricted water is more challenging wave elevations are often higher in shallow water for subcritical flow water depth froude number f h 1 0 waves will propagate upstream from the ship introducing challenges for modelling flow at the fore boundary of the free surface it has been found that solutions are very difficult to obtain in the transcritical region 0 8 f h 1 2 likely due to very steep flows flow solutions in restricted water are more sensitive to panelling than solutions for open water for linear solutions often more than one panel size must be tried for the free surface the presence of the ship can significantly affect flow at the fore boundary of the domain thus free surface elevation slopes at the fore boundary of the domain should be checked to verify that they are acceptably small convergence for nonlinear free surface solutions is more difficult in restricted water than for open deep water likely due to increased wave slopes convergence has been achieved for cases with subcritical depth froude numbers 4 3 initial solution for nonlinear free surface iteration the nonlinear free surface method requires an initial guess for the free surface the double body linearized solution can be used to improve the likelihood of a convergent nonlinear solution the sinkage and trim for the double body linearized solution can be determined before proceeding with the nonlinear solution if multiple ship speeds are being evaluated a very efficient nonlinear solution for a given ship speed can be obtained by using the nonlinear solution for the previous ship speed as the initial solution this approach has proven to work very well for increments in ship length froude number of 0 01 4 4 visualization of ship and free surface visualization of the ship and free surface are important for verification and interpretation of numerical predictions fig 3 shows a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 travelling through the channel used by jiang 1998 for model tests and computations the color axis ranges from blue to red the minimum and maximum values of the color axis are usually set to have the same absolute values which then gives green for zero elevation panels on the free surface are plotted as nonplanar surfaces the local elevations for each panel are determined using the elevation and its first and second x and y derivatives at the centroid thus no smoothing is performed using data from adjacent panels smooth variation of free surface elevations is a positive indicator of acceptable results small variation of wave elevation at the foremost part of the domain indicates appropriate modelling of the radiation condition 5 validation of numerical predictions the numerical predictions were validated using experimental data published in the open literature for 3 different ships 5 1 dtmb 5515 destroyer in deep water validation was performed using experimental data from irvine et al 2013 for model dtmb 5515 a geosim of the widely used dtmb 5415 model of a naval destroyer fig 4 shows experimental measurements and numerical predictions from the present method the sinkage s is given at midships and is positive down the trim angle τ is positive for trim by stern the double body method gives good results for ship length froude numbers of 0 20 and less the double body linearized and nonlinear methods give very similar results which are very close to experimental values the uniform linearized method exhibits noticeable deviation from the more accurate methods for froude numbers greater than 0 25 5 2 series 60 hull with 0 60 block coefficient in deep and restricted water validation was performed for a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 in both deep and restricted water the computations were performed at full scale with a ship length of 121 92 m beam of 16 255 m and draft of 6 501 m the wetted hull was modelled using approximately 1500 panels the ship has a narrow stern thus approximate modelling of a transom stern was not required fig 5 shows comparisons of predictions in deep water with experimental results from takeshi et al 1987 the results for sinkage are very good with accuracy generally improving as the sophistication of the numerical method increases the trim results show greater variation which can be partly explained by the small magnitude of the trim relative to the sinkage the significant differences between the double body linearized and nonlinear results at higher froude numbers indicate that free surface nonlinearities have a significant effect on trim a possible explanation for the trim sensitivity is the narrowness of the stern giving lower pitch hydrostatic stiffness computations in shallow water were performed for the experimental conditions reported by jiang 1998 the water depth was 2 0 t 13 002 m and the channel width was 2 09 l 254 8 m fig 6 gives sinkage and trim for the series 60 hull in shallow water the uniform linearized double body linearized and nonlinear methods give excellent results for ship length froude numbers up to 0 25 corresponding to a water depth froude number of 0 80 the uniform linearized and double body linearized methods were unable to provide solutions in the vicinity of critical flow the uniform linearized and double body linearized methods give good predictions at high froude numbers the nonlinear free surface was only able to achieve convergence for froude numbers up to 0 255 with excellent agreement of predicted sinkage and trim with experiments 5 3 kvlcc2 very large crude carrier in restricted water computations were performed for the kvlcc2 very large crude carrier for experimental conditions described by lataire et al 2012 with a channel width of 5 times the ship breadth and channel depths of 1 1 1 35 and 1 5 relative to the draft of the ship the ship has a full scale length of 320 0 m with full scale ship speeds ranging from 6 to 16 knots and corresponding ship length froude numbers between 0 05 and 0 15 when panelling the free surface attention was given to the transverse wavenumber k t in shallow water given by 36 u 2 g h tanh k t h k t h double body computations were performed for the full range of experimental ship speeds uniform linearized and double body linearized methods were performed for ship speeds of 9 knots and greater for which full scale wave lengths were greater than 18 m at the experimental water depths inner x panel lengths of 3 m were used for ship speeds of 9 11 knots with greater inner x panel lengths of 6 m used for ship speeds of 12 16 knots figs 7 9 show predicted and experimental values the numerical predictions consistently underpredict the sinkage but give very good agreement for trim the quality of numerical predictions generally improves with the level of fidelity in modelling the free surface 5 4 error in predicted bottom clearance if the current method is going to be utilized to provide guidance to ship operators then it is essential to consider errors in predicted bottom clearance fig 10 gives over prediction of bottom clearance non dimensionalized by ship draft when the double body linearized method is used to model the free surface it was assumed that the bottom of the ship was at the ship baseline when evaluating bottom clearance at the bow and stern the greater over prediction occurs in the transcritical flow region where bottom clearance using the present method is evaluated by interpolation of available predictions at subcritical and supercritical ship speeds 6 discussion comparisons with model tests indicate that the modelling of flow separation effects from a transom stern by using a narrowing virtual stern has minimal influence on the accuracy of squat predictions this result is not surprising given that squat is dominated by vertical forces the double body method nominally flat free surface provides robust and efficient predictions of squat at lower ship length froude numbers with validation results suggesting a suitable maximum value of f l 0 1 this result is very useful from a practical perspective because it avoids the requirement for using large numbers of free surface panels caused by small wavelengths at low ship speeds for detailed modelling of the free surface uniform flow linearized double body linearized and nonlinear methods the current approach using direct evaluation of higher order flow potential derivatives allows for much larger free surface panels than approaches that use finite difference methods it is recommended that 6 or more panels per wavelength be used when evaluating squat using the current approach finer panelling of the free surface would be required to capture finer details of the ship wake modelling of the forward boundary radiation condition is satisfactorily achieved by shifting foremost sources to immediately aft of the domain the uniform flow linearized and double body linearized methods were able to model shallow water squat in subcritical and supercritical flow regions but were unable to provide solutions at depth froude numbers approaching 1 0 the nonlinear method only achieved solutions in subcritical flow previous work by jiang 1998 assuming a slender ship suggests that the current work should perhaps be extended using a time domain approach for solution at depth froude numbers near 1 0 among the free surface models presented here the double body linearized method is recommended for most squat predictions for forward speed froude numbers above 0 1 it provides a suitable balance of fidelity and robustness 7 conclusions a potential flow method has been developed for predicting ship squat the four different approaches for modelling the free surface are double body uniform flow linearized double body linearized and nonlinear given in order of increasing fidelity direct evaluation of higher order derivatives of flow potential allows the free surface to be modelled using a moderate number of panels flow separation from a transom stern can be modelled using a narrowing virtual transom the method gives robust and efficient prediction of ship squat with the exception of near critical flow conditions f h 1 0 fast computational times make the method suitable for developing operator guidance for which many different combinations of ship load condition speed and water depth must often be evaluated comparisons

23692,a numerical method has been developed for predicting ship squat with the goal of providing guidance to ship operators for avoidance of grounding in shallow water the method assumes potential flow and computations are sufficiently fast to allow evaluation for large numbers of conditions within practical time scales boundary conditions on the hull free surface and canal walls are satisfied using planar rankine sources on solid boundaries and point rankine sources placed a nominal distance above the calm waterline or free surface four different models of the free surface boundary condition have been implemented ranging from a nominally flat free surface to fully nonlinear for ships with a transom stern the influence of flow separation is modelled using a virtual stern which extends afterward from the transom to a location with zero width the numerical method is generally robust except for in the vicinity of critical flow conditions validation with model tests has been used to develop an envelope for over prediction of bottom clearance which can be considered when developing guidance for ship operators keywords heave pitch rankine method sinkage squat trim 1 introduction a ship moving at speed in shallow water is subjected to squat a reduction in clearance from the water bottom due to hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship briggs et al 2010 give a comprehensive description of squat and its prediction squat increases the risk of grounding and is thus of significant concern to ship operators ideally a ship operator should have a good understanding of squat for combinations of ship loading condition water depth and ship speed that might be encountered increasingly complex methods are available for predicting squat in both open and confined waters various simple methods are available including those described by dand and ferguson 1973 millward 1990 and lataire et al 2012 beck et al 1975 and gourlay 2008 used slender body approaches for predicting squat yao and zou 2010 developed a potential flow panel method and compared it with results from model tests for a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 computational fluid dynamics using reynolds averaged navier stokes modelling rans cfd can provide high fidelity modelling of ship steady flow including squat jachowski 2008 toxopeus et al 2013 the present work was motivated by the requirement to predict squat for operational vessels each operating with various loading conditions water conditions and ship speeds it was decided that a potential flow rankine panel method similar to that used by yao and zou 2010 would provided a suitable balance of accuracy and computational time furthermore potential flow seakeeping software was already available mctaggart 2015 that could be used as the foundation for developing the steady flow method some exploratory work was done using rans cfd however computational times were very large typically exceeding one day for each combination of ship loading condition water depth and speed 2 solution of flow surrounding ship and resulting sinkage and trim the solution of ship squat uses an iterative process to determine the ship sinkage and trim that results in zero net forces acting on the ship the flow surrounding the ship and resulting ship forces must be solved during each iteration the flow surrounding the ship is solved using a boundary element method for which bertram 2012 presents an overview the axis system has its origin on the calm waterlane and is aligned vertically with the ship centre of gravity the x axis is forward the y axis is port and the z axis is upward the flow potential in the vicinity of the hull and free surface is modelled as 1 φ x u x ϕ x where φ is the total steady potential x is a location in the fluid domain u is the steady ship speed and ϕ is the scattered potential due to the presence of the hull the discretized scattered potential on the hull and free surface can be expressed based on source strengths σ x on the hull and free surface as follows 2 ϕ e σ where e is the influence matrix giving scattered velocity potentials from source strengths for a ship in deep water the elements of the influence matrix e are given by 3 e i j 1 4 π a j 1 r x i x s d a where a j is the area of source panel j and r is the distance from a source at x s to a field point at x i the source strengths must be set such that boundary conditions at the hull and free surface are satisfied the zero normal flow boundary condition on the hull is 4 ϕ n u n x on s h u l l the free surface s f r e e is denoted by z ζ x y at which the following kinematic boundary condition must be satisfied 5 ϕ z u ϕ x ζ x ϕ y ζ y at z ζ the pressure at a point in the fluid domain is given by 6 p ρ g z 1 2 u 2 u ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 given that the pressure must be zero at the free surface the free surface elevation ζ is given by 7 ζ 1 2 g u 2 u ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 the associated x and y derivatives of water elevation are 8 ζ x 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ x z ϕ z 9 ζ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z for a ship in shallow water the following boundary condition at the water bottom must be satisfied 10 ϕ z 0 on s b o t t o m the present work considers only cases with constant water depth allowing the influence of the water bottom to be solved using image sources garrison 1978 the elements of the influence matrix e are then given by 11 e i j 1 4 π a j 1 r x i x s 1 r i m a g e x i x s d a where r i m a g e is the distance to the image source reflected about the ocean bottom vertical walls from a canal or other stationary body can also be modelled in such cases the vertical wall must be panelled and the following boundary condition must be satisfied on each panel 12 ϕ y 0 on s w a l l the ability of the solution to satisfy the boundary condition at each free surface point can be evaluated using the following error term based on bertram 2012 13 ε f 1 u g a 1 ϕ x u a 2 ϕ y a 3 g ϕ z where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are given by 14 a 1 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ x y ϕ z 2 ϕ x z 15 a 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 ϕ y z 16 a 3 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x z ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z 2 ϕ z 2 a nonlinear solution with successful convergence of wave elevation gives boundary condition errors that are effectively zero 2 1 double body solution the simplest approach for modelling the free surface assumes that it is nominally flat satisfying the following boundary condition 17 ϕ z 0 0 on z 0 0 where ϕ is referred to as the double body potential solution of the resulting flow field can be done without panelling of the free surface by using image sources of the hull reflected about z 0 0 garrison 1978 the double body solution can give good results at low ship speeds which can be useful because free surface wavelengths are very small at such speeds thus requiring large numbers of panels for solutions using a panelled free surface the double body solution is very robust garrison 1978 describes evaluation of the double body solution for both deep water and water of finite depth 2 2 uniform linearized free surface solution a linearized solution based on the uniform incident flow provides a simple approach to evaluate the free surface as shown by tarafder and khalil 2006 the scattered velocity components are assumed to be small relative to the ship speed and the flow kinematic terms at z 0 0 are assumed to be representative of the free surface the free surface kinematic condition of equation 5 is then simplified to 18 2 ϕ x 2 g u 2 ϕ z 0 0 on z 0 0 the free surface elevation is given by 19 ζ u g ϕ x the uniform linearized solution can give excellent results for submerged bodies and for surface piercing bodies that are slender at the free surface 2 3 double body linearized free surface solution to improve upon the accuracy provided by the uniform linearized solution the free surface can be linearized with respect to the double body flow similar to the method developed by dawson 1977 the scattered velocity potential is expressed in terms of the double body velocity potential for the hull ϕ and the perturbation potential ϕ ˆ that accounts for the free surface 20 ϕ ϕ ϕ ˆ it is assumed that the z derivatives of flow velocities are small near the free surface allowing the kinematic boundary condition of equation 5 to be satisfied at the mean free surface 21 ϕ z u ϕ x ζ x ϕ y ζ y at z 0 0 combining equation 21 with equations 8 and 9 for the wave slope the boundary condition for the mean free surface is 22 ϕ z u ϕ x 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ x z ϕ z ϕ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z at z 0 0 the solution method proceeds by first solving the double body potential ϕ and then solving the total scattered potential ϕ noting that the double potential derivatives ϕ z 2 ϕ x z and 2 ϕ y z are all equal to zero at z 0 0 the double body linearized equation for the total scattered potential ϕ satisfying the free surface boundary condition is 23 ϕ z u ϕ x 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ y ϕ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y ϕ x u 1 g 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ x ϕ x 2 ϕ x y 2 ϕ x y ϕ y 2 ϕ x y ϕ y ϕ y ϕ y 1 g 2 ϕ x y 2 ϕ x y ϕ x u 2 ϕ x y ϕ x ϕ x 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ y ϕ y at z 0 0 2 4 nonlinear free surface solution for a given ship orientation speed and water depth the nonlinear free surface boundary condition can be solved to very high accuracy using an iterative approach jensen et al 1986 bertram 2012 during each iteration the free surface elevations and velocity potentials on the free surface from the previous iteration must be used and these are denoted ϕ and ζ respectively the solution of equations to be solved can be written as follows 24 h h u l l h u l l h h u l l f r e e h f r e e h u l l h f r e e f r e e σ h u l l σ f r e e p h u l l p f r e e where h is the influence matrix giving boundary condition values from source strengths and p is the vector of boundary condition values to be satisfied the influence matrix h and boundary condition vector p have been partitioned into portions based on the hull and free surface the boundary condition on the hull is satisfied by 25 p i u n x x i for 0 i n h u l l 26 h i j e i j n for 0 i n h u l l note that panels on the hull are numbered from 0 to n h u l l 1 the boundary condition on the free surface is much more complex because it includes the influence of potential derivatives up to third order the terms a 1 a 2 and a 3 are evaluated using equations 14 16 and the potential from the previous iteration ϕ in addition the following term is introduced 27 b 1 g a 3 ϕ x u 2 3 ϕ x 2 z ϕ y 2 3 ϕ y 2 z ϕ z 2 3 ϕ z 3 g 2 ϕ z 2 2 ϕ x u ϕ y 3 ϕ x y z ϕ x u ϕ z 3 ϕ x z 2 ϕ y ϕ z 3 ϕ y z 2 2 ϕ x z a 1 2 ϕ y z a 2 2 ϕ z 2 a 3 the boundary condition terms to be satisfied on the previous guess of the free surface ζ are 28 p i 2 a 1 ϕ x 2 a 2 ϕ y 2 a 3 ϕ z b 1 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 u 2 g ζ u ϕ x u for n h u l l i n h u l l n f r e e the influence matrix terms giving the free surface boundary values from source strengths are 29 h i j 2 a 1 e i j x a 2 e i j y a 3 e i j z ϕ x u ϕ y 2 e i j x y ϕ x u ϕ z 2 e i j x z ϕ y ϕ z 2 e i j y z ϕ x u 2 2 e i j x 2 ϕ y 2 2 e i j y 2 ϕ z 2 2 e i j z 2 g e i j z b ϕ x u e i j x ϕ y e i j y ϕ z e i j z for n h u l l i n h u l l n f r e e the solution proceeds by solving for the source strengths σ then new flow potentials ϕ and associated derivatives at the previous guess ζ of the free surface the new free surface ζ is then evaluated using the previous guess of the free surface ζ and the previous and newly solved potentials ϕ ζ and ϕ ζ at the old free surface 30 ζ ζ ζ n ζ d 31 ζ n ϕ x u ϕ x u ϕ y ϕ y ϕ z ϕ z 1 2 ϕ x u 2 ϕ y 2 ϕ z 2 u 2 g ζ 32 ζ d g ϕ x u 2 ϕ x z ϕ y 2 ϕ y z ϕ z 2 ϕ z 2 once the location of the new free surface ζ has been solved the flow potentials and their derivatives can be evaluated on the new free surface during each iteration the quality of the solution can be evaluated by examining the free surface boundary condition errors from equation 13 to obtain successful convergence of the nonlinear free surface solution the most important factor is the quality of the initial guess the double body linearized solution provides a suitably accurate initial guess for most cases 2 5 modelling of sources fig 1 shows an example computational source mesh for a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 the shown view is a close up in the vicinity of the ship and includes only a portion of the free surface the hull is modelled by planar panels which also serve as source panels the free surface is also modelled by planar panels however a point source with vertical offset above the free surface is used for each free surface panel avoiding singularities during evaluation of 1 r for linearized free surface computations the point sources can be located at a constant elevation above the calm free surface for nonlinear free surface computations good results are obtained when the point source associated with each free surface panel is located at a specified distance above the centroid elevation of that panel although using raised sources for the free surface provides advantages it introduces the complexity of requiring additional panelling between the hull and the raised sources for the free surface fig 1 shows the usage of a virtual hull wall green between the actual hull yellow and raised free surface sources blue the virtual hull wall has vertical panels extending from the ship waterline to the raised free surface sources 2 6 evaluation of potential derivatives and radiation condition the evaluation of potential derivatives and the radiation at the fore boundary of the domain are closely related solution of the free surface flow requires evaluation of flow potential derivatives up to third order dawson 1977 and raven 1996 used a backward difference method to evaluate derivatives of flow potentials a backward difference method can easily satisfy the radiation of the flow velocity being undisturbed at the fore boundary furthermore the usage of a finite difference method such as backward difference reduces the order of derivatives that must be evaluated for the term 1 r and its associated integrals over source panels the present work evaluates potential derivatives directly including second and third order derivatives the radiation boundary condition at the fore boundary of the domain is satisfied by shifting sources associated with the foremost part of the domain to immediately aft of the domain as described by bertram 2012 in comparison with finite difference methods this method has the advantage of requiring many fewer panels for resolution of the flow field 2 7 modelling of transom sterns the current potential flow solution does not include modelling of flow separation for ships with transom sterns a potential flow solution can give unrealistically high velocity gradients in the vicinity of the transom the present method can use a virtual stern on a ship to approximate the influence of flow separation fig 2 shows a dtmb 5512 destroyer model irvine et al 2013 with a transom stern and with a virtual narrow stern the narrow stern extends aft 1 10 of the length of the ship and is a vertical line at its aftmost location the virtual transom stern is not included when integrating vertical forces acting on the ship it is postulated that the influence of a virtual transom stern will have only a very minor influence on squat predictions which are dominated by vertical forces 2 8 solution of sinkage and trim the sinkage and trim are solved in an iterative manner using the following equation 33 δ η 3 δ η 5 c 33 c 35 c 53 c 55 f 3 g f 5 where η 3 and η 5 are heave and pitch displacements c i j is hydrostatic stiffness η 3 and η 5 are heave and pitch displacements and is ship mass displacement the flow solution is re evaluated for each iteration of sinkage and trim forces on the hull are integrated using the actual wetted surface for each iteration relaxation methods are applied to prevent changes in heave or pitch from being excessively large between iterations when solving sinkage and trim using linearized free surface methods the calm free surface is repanelled for each iteration because the ship waterplane will vary with sinkage and trim for solution of sinkage and trim using the nonlinear free surface method the sinkage and trim are typically solved initially using the double body linearized method this initial solution of sinkage and trim increases the likelihood of successful convergence for the nonlinear free surface 3 software implementation the required software for solution of the free surface and resulting sinkage and trim was obtained by extending the shipmo3d ship motion library mctaggart 2010 2015 shipmo3d is written in c michaelis and lippert 2016 which facilitates efficient software development and includes a numerical capability for complex numbers linear systems of equations are solved utilizing the intel mkl library wang et al 2014 the majority of the software was written in c which runs in the net runtime some portions of the software were written in native c with the goal of improving computational performance recent experience suggests that software written in c is now giving very similar performance to native c code parallel processing was achieved with only modest development efforts required the solution of linear systems with the intel mkl library includes parallel processing solution influence terms involving 1 r and its derivatives are solved in parallel 4 computational experience computational experience with the solution of squat for a variety of ships and operating conditions has provided guidance for application of the developed method froude numbers based on ship length and water depth are defined respectively by 34 f l u g l 35 f h u g h most of the present work has been for ship length froude numbers up to 0 4 comments below regarding numbers of panels apply to half the total domain because lateral symmetry applies 4 1 ship in open deep water a ship in open deep water is among the simpler cases and is further simplified if the ship is fully submerged below the water surface the free surface panelling can extend in the x direction from 2 5 l to 1 0 l and in the y direction to 1 2 l the ship can usually be represented sufficiently accurately with 1000 panels on the wet portion selection of panel size is of critical importance for achieving an appropriate balance between accuracy and computation time furthermore satisfaction of the radiation condition has been found to be dependent on panel size likely due to the approach of moving sources from the foremost location of the domain to aft of the domain in practice the current method works well when using a constant panel x length in an inner region surrounding the ship and then increasing panel x length gradually to the outer boundaries of the domain an inner region of 2 0 l x 0 7 l has proven to work well it has been found that a suitable maximum x panel length in the outer region is 2 0 times the x panel length in the inner region very good results are obtained when the free surface sources are located 1 0 times the maximum x panel length above the calm water level for linear computations and above the computed wave elevation for nonlinear computations an inner x panel length of 0 026 l gives excellent nonlinear convergence for froude numbers of 0 16 and greater corresponding to having 6 or more panels in the x direction per wavelength at lower froude numbers the free surface in deep water is effectively flat and the double body solution can be used requiring no panelling of the free surface it is suggested that the y panel length be approximately equal to the x panel length however it has been found that it is sometimes necessary to increase the panel length in the y direction to obtain nonlinear solution convergence likely due to numerical instabilities associated with wave breaking immediately adjacent to the hull for a surface piercing ship panelling must include the virtual hull wall between the free surface and its raised sources it has been found that having 4 panels in the vertical direction works well various checks can be performed to verify that a numerical solution is valid the free surface should be flat at the foremost portion of the fluid domain in deep water the scattered flow velocity components should have magnitudes less than 0 01 u the condition number for the influence matrix to solve source strengths should not be excessively large also the non dimensional boundary condition errors on the free surface from equation 13 should be small linearized solutions should typically provide rms ε f errors less than 0 01 based on sampling of all free surface panels when iteratively solving the nonlinear free surface the implemented software has demonstrated very good convergence for cases in open deep water during successive iterations both the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the free surface are repanelled with the change of horizontal dimensions dependent on how much the ship hull walls vary from being vertical a relaxation factor of 0 6 is typically applied to successive iterations of the free surface 4 2 ship in restricted water the above comments regarding deep water provide useful guidance for ships in restricted water however successful solution of cases in restricted water is more challenging wave elevations are often higher in shallow water for subcritical flow water depth froude number f h 1 0 waves will propagate upstream from the ship introducing challenges for modelling flow at the fore boundary of the free surface it has been found that solutions are very difficult to obtain in the transcritical region 0 8 f h 1 2 likely due to very steep flows flow solutions in restricted water are more sensitive to panelling than solutions for open water for linear solutions often more than one panel size must be tried for the free surface the presence of the ship can significantly affect flow at the fore boundary of the domain thus free surface elevation slopes at the fore boundary of the domain should be checked to verify that they are acceptably small convergence for nonlinear free surface solutions is more difficult in restricted water than for open deep water likely due to increased wave slopes convergence has been achieved for cases with subcritical depth froude numbers 4 3 initial solution for nonlinear free surface iteration the nonlinear free surface method requires an initial guess for the free surface the double body linearized solution can be used to improve the likelihood of a convergent nonlinear solution the sinkage and trim for the double body linearized solution can be determined before proceeding with the nonlinear solution if multiple ship speeds are being evaluated a very efficient nonlinear solution for a given ship speed can be obtained by using the nonlinear solution for the previous ship speed as the initial solution this approach has proven to work very well for increments in ship length froude number of 0 01 4 4 visualization of ship and free surface visualization of the ship and free surface are important for verification and interpretation of numerical predictions fig 3 shows a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 travelling through the channel used by jiang 1998 for model tests and computations the color axis ranges from blue to red the minimum and maximum values of the color axis are usually set to have the same absolute values which then gives green for zero elevation panels on the free surface are plotted as nonplanar surfaces the local elevations for each panel are determined using the elevation and its first and second x and y derivatives at the centroid thus no smoothing is performed using data from adjacent panels smooth variation of free surface elevations is a positive indicator of acceptable results small variation of wave elevation at the foremost part of the domain indicates appropriate modelling of the radiation condition 5 validation of numerical predictions the numerical predictions were validated using experimental data published in the open literature for 3 different ships 5 1 dtmb 5515 destroyer in deep water validation was performed using experimental data from irvine et al 2013 for model dtmb 5515 a geosim of the widely used dtmb 5415 model of a naval destroyer fig 4 shows experimental measurements and numerical predictions from the present method the sinkage s is given at midships and is positive down the trim angle τ is positive for trim by stern the double body method gives good results for ship length froude numbers of 0 20 and less the double body linearized and nonlinear methods give very similar results which are very close to experimental values the uniform linearized method exhibits noticeable deviation from the more accurate methods for froude numbers greater than 0 25 5 2 series 60 hull with 0 60 block coefficient in deep and restricted water validation was performed for a series 60 hull with block coefficient of 0 60 in both deep and restricted water the computations were performed at full scale with a ship length of 121 92 m beam of 16 255 m and draft of 6 501 m the wetted hull was modelled using approximately 1500 panels the ship has a narrow stern thus approximate modelling of a transom stern was not required fig 5 shows comparisons of predictions in deep water with experimental results from takeshi et al 1987 the results for sinkage are very good with accuracy generally improving as the sophistication of the numerical method increases the trim results show greater variation which can be partly explained by the small magnitude of the trim relative to the sinkage the significant differences between the double body linearized and nonlinear results at higher froude numbers indicate that free surface nonlinearities have a significant effect on trim a possible explanation for the trim sensitivity is the narrowness of the stern giving lower pitch hydrostatic stiffness computations in shallow water were performed for the experimental conditions reported by jiang 1998 the water depth was 2 0 t 13 002 m and the channel width was 2 09 l 254 8 m fig 6 gives sinkage and trim for the series 60 hull in shallow water the uniform linearized double body linearized and nonlinear methods give excellent results for ship length froude numbers up to 0 25 corresponding to a water depth froude number of 0 80 the uniform linearized and double body linearized methods were unable to provide solutions in the vicinity of critical flow the uniform linearized and double body linearized methods give good predictions at high froude numbers the nonlinear free surface was only able to achieve convergence for froude numbers up to 0 255 with excellent agreement of predicted sinkage and trim with experiments 5 3 kvlcc2 very large crude carrier in restricted water computations were performed for the kvlcc2 very large crude carrier for experimental conditions described by lataire et al 2012 with a channel width of 5 times the ship breadth and channel depths of 1 1 1 35 and 1 5 relative to the draft of the ship the ship has a full scale length of 320 0 m with full scale ship speeds ranging from 6 to 16 knots and corresponding ship length froude numbers between 0 05 and 0 15 when panelling the free surface attention was given to the transverse wavenumber k t in shallow water given by 36 u 2 g h tanh k t h k t h double body computations were performed for the full range of experimental ship speeds uniform linearized and double body linearized methods were performed for ship speeds of 9 knots and greater for which full scale wave lengths were greater than 18 m at the experimental water depths inner x panel lengths of 3 m were used for ship speeds of 9 11 knots with greater inner x panel lengths of 6 m used for ship speeds of 12 16 knots figs 7 9 show predicted and experimental values the numerical predictions consistently underpredict the sinkage but give very good agreement for trim the quality of numerical predictions generally improves with the level of fidelity in modelling the free surface 5 4 error in predicted bottom clearance if the current method is going to be utilized to provide guidance to ship operators then it is essential to consider errors in predicted bottom clearance fig 10 gives over prediction of bottom clearance non dimensionalized by ship draft when the double body linearized method is used to model the free surface it was assumed that the bottom of the ship was at the ship baseline when evaluating bottom clearance at the bow and stern the greater over prediction occurs in the transcritical flow region where bottom clearance using the present method is evaluated by interpolation of available predictions at subcritical and supercritical ship speeds 6 discussion comparisons with model tests indicate that the modelling of flow separation effects from a transom stern by using a narrowing virtual stern has minimal influence on the accuracy of squat predictions this result is not surprising given that squat is dominated by vertical forces the double body method nominally flat free surface provides robust and efficient predictions of squat at lower ship length froude numbers with validation results suggesting a suitable maximum value of f l 0 1 this result is very useful from a practical perspective because it avoids the requirement for using large numbers of free surface panels caused by small wavelengths at low ship speeds for detailed modelling of the free surface uniform flow linearized double body linearized and nonlinear methods the current approach using direct evaluation of higher order flow potential derivatives allows for much larger free surface panels than approaches that use finite difference methods it is recommended that 6 or more panels per wavelength be used when evaluating squat using the current approach finer panelling of the free surface would be required to capture finer details of the ship wake modelling of the forward boundary radiation condition is satisfactorily achieved by shifting foremost sources to immediately aft of the domain the uniform flow linearized and double body linearized methods were able to model shallow water squat in subcritical and supercritical flow regions but were unable to provide solutions at depth froude numbers approaching 1 0 the nonlinear method only achieved solutions in subcritical flow previous work by jiang 1998 assuming a slender ship suggests that the current work should perhaps be extended using a time domain approach for solution at depth froude numbers near 1 0 among the free surface models presented here the double body linearized method is recommended for most squat predictions for forward speed froude numbers above 0 1 it provides a suitable balance of fidelity and robustness 7 conclusions a potential flow method has been developed for predicting ship squat the four different approaches for modelling the free surface are double body uniform flow linearized double body linearized and nonlinear given in order of increasing fidelity direct evaluation of higher order derivatives of flow potential allows the free surface to be modelled using a moderate number of panels flow separation from a transom stern can be modelled using a narrowing virtual transom the method gives robust and efficient prediction of ship squat with the exception of near critical flow conditions f h 1 0 fast computational times make the method suitable for developing operator guidance for which many different combinations of ship load condition speed and water depth must often be evaluated comparisons with experimental data have been used to estimate over prediction of bottom clearance acknowledgement the author acknowledges insightful input and initial proof reading of this article by dr david

23693,a modular floating concept for oil storage is proposed the concept is composed of several modular floating tanks and barges the floating tanks are self stable and designed for storage of oil and hydrocarbon material the barges provide platforms for equipment and workers quarters and enclose the floating tanks through mooring fender systems the whole concept is then moored by mooring dolphins this concept is designed for finite water depth application however potential application for deep water condition is also investigated in this study only single floating tank is investigated with both empty and full tank conditions considered different mooring fender configuration designs are the focus it is assumed that the barges are fixed in the study of single tank dynamic properties and multi body hydrodynamic is neglected different regular wave conditions are used for the study of the dynamic performance of the tank under various fender mooring system parameters irregular wave together with wind and current for 100 year return period are also applied for the study of the tank dynamic performance at last sensitivity study of the viscous effects is performed keywords dynamic response analysis floating storage tank mooring fender design sensitivity study 1 introduction with the densification of populations in coastal cities such as singapore and osaka land becomes very scarce and expensive the conventional approach of land reclamation is becoming time consuming environmentally unfriendly and expensive as the water depth gets larger in these circumstances very large floating structures vlfss watanabe et al 2004 ohmatsu 2005 are more suitable for offshore space exploitation the advantages of vlfss include low impact to the sea bed and environmental conditions and flexible deployment in terms of offshore positions there are different types of vlfss including floating bridges wan et al 2017 lwin 2000 floating entertainment facilities floating storage facilities floating city floating fish farm huguenin and ansuini 1978 shainee et al 2013 etc each application has its own scale and design principles and the sizing of the floating structure and its mooring system depends on its function and also on the environmental conditions in terms of waves current and wind in this study a vlfs concept for storing crude oil or hydrocarbon in the sea is the focus this concept is proposed for singapore coastal waters with a potential application and deployment also in other coastal regions until now there are only two floating fuel storage facilities in the world and both are located in japan one is kamigoto oil storage base and the other is shirashima oil storage base ueda 2015 which are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively the proposed floating storage facility consists of several modular floating tanks assembled together with barges that provide space for the associated equipment and workers quarters which are shown in fig 1c the operation facility modules to be implemented onto the barges are listed in table 1 each tank in this concept is moored by mooring fenders around its periphery in this study only one tank system with the surrounding mooring fenders is the focus the treatment of the multi tank system as well as tanks and barge system are outside the scope of this paper but is only touched upon fender system is broadly used in the ship berthing problems at a jetty fenders for large vessels can be categorized into three types eskenazi and wang 2015 rubber fenders foam fenders and pneumatic fenders sakakibara and kubo 2007 and these are suitable for rigid berth which can be applied to the system in this paper examples of these fender types are shown in fig 2 website 2017 the fender can dissipate energy from ship or tank impact and can also provide stiffness which affects the tank dynamic properties analysis principles of fender system for ship berthing is addressed by pianc in 2002 pianc 2002 fenders in contact with structures can induce friction forces when there are relative motions roller type of fender system can attenuate the friction forces in addition fenders can also induce local stress due to relatively small contact area wan et al 2016 and this should be taken into consideration from structural point of view in this paper the tank dynamic motions coupled with fender system is investigated assuming that fender system provides different stiffness parameters to the tank system the detailed fender system configuration is not touched upon the oil storage tank is subjected to offshore wind current and wave loads the combined loads under offshore environment include both static and dynamic components the static component such as mean wind current and wave drift load will cause a static deviation or tilting of the tank location from its original equilibrium position while the dynamic component excites wave frequency or low frequency dynamic response the change of the incoming environmental load directions will also directly affect the fender reactions in a significant way since all the environmental loading will be resisted by the marine fenders installed on the barges the appropriate design of the marine fenders become crucial for the safety of the system frequency domain methods are widely used in the hydrodynamic responses of the coupled system for designing floating structures however in many applications such as floating wind turbine floating wave energy converters etc the viscous effect transient loading events and nonlinear features may be important and in these cases a time domain model is more applicable wan et al 2015 in the tank fender system nonlinear features such as friction forces tank fender gaps viscous effects from wind wave and current are included and nonlinear fender properties can also be considered hydrodynamic properties of the tank are firstly calculated in frequency domain and then nonlinear features are included in time domain model when there is liquid in the tank free surface effects may also influence the tank dynamic motions under partially filled condition an engineering approach of considering this free surface effect in time domain model is proposed in jin et al 2017 however it is not considered further in this study 2 tank system description the tank is a cylindrical tank enclosed by rectangular shape walls with rounded corners and dome roof and each tank is surrounded by a fender system as shown in fig 3 the fluid is stored inside the cylindrical tank while the rectangular shape walls provide additional buoyancy to ensure tank stability single bottom and single tank hull configuration is used the main dimensions and mass properties for empty tank and full tank conditions are shown in table 2 the tank dimension is smaller than the dimension of the kamigoto length 245 m breadth 97 m depth 27 6 m and full laden draft 24 5 m and shirashima length 397 m breadth 82 m depth 25 4 m and full laden draft 22 7 m oil storage bases the tank design in this paper is focused on the modular type design which has the advantages of ease of expansion to larger scale system including more modular tanks so that it can fulfill the operators requirement easily and also be more flexible on the mobility feature of each single tank however the fender system for the modular tanks can pose the cost issues depending on the numbers and material for the fender system in addition in the relative shallow water the design of the tank should ensure that no grounding of the tank will occur even under the worst environmental conditions fenders on different sides are marked as 1 2 3 and 4 as shown in fig 3 which represents all the three fenders on each side one ends of the fenders are assumed to be rigidly connected to a large barge which is assumed to be fixed in this analysis for simplification the other ends of the fenders carry loads from the tank the marine fenders add lateral stiffness to the tank motion equation thus the tank will respond to first order wave excitation if the stiffness is large enough to make the surge sway natural frequency close to wave excitation frequency or the lateral motion will have a low frequency and be more sensitive to 2nd order low frequency load surge and sway motion amplitudes are crucial in this case since they determine the deformation and consequently dynamic loading of the marine fenders the gaps between the fender system and the tank may also affect the dynamic tank motion the fenders can be roller fenders or friction fenders which will induce different friction forces when there is relative motions between tank and the fenders this concept is designed to be deployed in coastal region with finite water depth however deep water condition is also investigated viscous effects of the tank due to the tank motions are considered by empirical formula considering nonlinear terms such as fender gaps fender friction forces viscous effects etc time domain model is used in the analysis tank responses under regular wave conditions irregular wave conditions as well as wind and current environmental conditions are investigated in addition tank with empty and full filling conditions are studied in this paper taking fluid inside the tank as solid mass sloshing effects are outside of the scope of this study in this study one tank dynamic analysis was carried out without considering the effect from other bodies however the complete system comprises a group of tanks together with barge system are installed to form the storage tank system in this case the interactions between different bodies should be considered however detailed analysis of the multi body interaction will be considered for the global hydrodynamic analysis with two tanks side by side depending on the relative position of the two tanks and the incoming wave directions interactions will affect the added mass radiation damping excitation forces etc if two tanks have narrow gaps wave elevation between the two tanks would also be amplified to a large extend zhao et al 2016 similar interactions will be found as for the case of two barges side by side will be found in addition due to hydrodynamic interactions waves at zero degree heading will cause hydrodynamic forces on bodies in 90 due to radiation if there are four barges forming a closed water surface area and no tank is installed large wave elevation will be found inside the closed area based on potential flow damping factors need to be applied in this region to simulate viscous effect and future model test will be performed to carry out the validation work after tank installation in this closed region formed by barge system the dynamic performance of the tank and the barges will then be different from the cases without tanks inside the hydrodynamic interactions will influence fender forces to some degree and should be accounted for in the final fender selection 2 1 numerical model for a rigid floating system with zero forward speed in sea waves the equation of motion newman 1977 due to first order second order wave loads and wind loads etc can be described in frequency domain as 1 ω 2 m a ω x ω i ω b ω x ω rx ω f ω where ω is the wave frequency m is the structural mass matrix a ω is the frequency dependent added mass matrix b ω is the radiation damping matrix r is the restoring matrix x ω is the motion vector f ω is the external force vector rx ω is the linear restoring force term considering the buoyancy and gravity all the vectors and matrices are expressed in frequency domain so the linear problem can be solved efficiently however in the analysis of the floating storage tank there are components that should be considered nonlinearly such as wind loads viscous effects from waves current drag forces nonlinear fender mooring system for a single floating rigid body the equation of motion can be written in the time domain as 2 m a x t c x t x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ rx t f t x x in which a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors in time domain respectively c is the quadratic viscous damping coefficients matrix due to wave f t x x is the summation of the external forces in time domain k τ is the retardation function matrix due to the wave memory effects cummins 1962 and is expressed as 3 k τ 2 π 0 b ω b cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 ω a ω a sin ω t d ω where b is the radiation damping matrix at infinite frequency and b 0 for floating structures with zero forward speed allan ross 1991 this is called hybrid time and frequency domain model naess and moan 2013 for simplification the slow drift motions in horizontal plane are calculated based on newman s approximation newman 1974 considering finite water depth condition the dispersion relationship is ω 2 k g tanh k h rather than ω 2 k g and the velocity potential wave excitation forces etc should follow the finite water depth calculations faltinsen 1993 wind and current force calculations are based on empirical formula where quadratic coefficients are used to model the viscous effect the wind and current force formula are shown in the following equations 4 f w i c w i α u w 2 f c i c c i α u c 2 where f w i and f c i are the wind force and current force on the body respectively i represents the ith degree of freedom of the body motion c w i α and c c i α are the wind and current force coefficients respectively α in c w i α is the relative angle between wind velocity and body velocity while α in c c i α is the relative angle between body low frequency velocity and current velocity u w is the relative velocity between wind and body motion while u c is the relative velocity between low frequency body velocity and current velocity marintek 2009 c w i α and c c i α are estimated based on the projection area a α of the tank in the incident wind and current direction with the quadratic coefficient c d 1 2 i e c c w i ρ c d a α 2 in the tank dynamic analysis wave wind and current are all considered the horizontal stiffness of the tank is provided by the fender system two types of fender system are investigated i e point fender and roller fender the point fender can provide tangential friction force while the roller fender cannot provide any tangential friction in heave direction on each side of the tank three fenders were considered in case one fender is not functioning the other two fenders can still work to prevent tank excessive motions the tank numerical model with friction fenders and roller fenders are shown in fig 4 the frequency domain hydrodynamic properties are calculated by wadam dnv 2011 in sesam package the time domain model is established in simo code marintek 2007 which was developed by sintef ocean viscous effects due to wave are considered by quadratic damping terms in the motion equation quadratic damping coefficient of 1 2 is used in surge sway and heave considering flow separation around sharp corners dnv 2010 robert 1984 in roll motions of ships the viscous effects are more important chakrabarti 2001 for this tank configuration the potential damping and nonlinear damping are both important an initial viscous damping value is assumed the viscous effects are based on the empirical estimation sensitivity analysis for a range of damping coefficients is performed below to investigate the sensitivity to this parameter 3 parametric study on empty tank dynamic response analysis under regular wave conditions in the analysis a series of parametric studies is performed by varying fender stiffness fender tank gap fender type as well as water depth these parameters are analyzed in the following respectively it is noted that this part only focus on the empty tank configuration the full tank dynamic performance and the comparison with that for empty tank is analyzed in the following part in this part regular waves with 0 incident direction are applied in the analysis with no wind and current with wave drift forces considered in time domain the dynamic responses of the tank under various wave periods and 1 m wave amplitude are investigated steady state responses are used in the analysis the description of motions and directions follows the coordinate system as depicted in fig 3 large fender stiffness will induce a stiff tank system however high fender stiffness will also make the cost very high due to high reaction loads small fender stiffness will create soft tank restraint in these cases tank horizontal motions will be significant due to the second order wave effects appropriate fender stiffness should be applied and at the same time tank natural periods should not fall within in the common wave frequency region depending on the metocean conditions of the selected site to avoid resonance the fender stiffness effects are firstly investigated the tank fender gap may also influence the dynamic responses of the tank and its effects are studied secondly the water depth used in the analysis is 20 m under such finite water depth conditions the dynamic performance will be different compared with deep water condition to understand the water depth effect on the dynamic responses 300 m water depth were also investigated regarding the fender type design two types of fenders are considered to investigate friction force effects point friction fenders and roller fenders are studied respectively they are all rubber fenders in a point friction fender with friction forces a globally fixed position is defined and a fender plane is defined on the tank when the point and the fender plane are in contact there will be fender forces induced this fender force includes normal and tangential components and the tangential component is the fender friction force roller fenders are another alternative they allow the fenders to roll on the fender planes and don t have tangential components those parameters are investigated in the following parts respectively for realistic marine fenders the stiffness cannot be linear however in this paper the stiffness is assumed to be linear for ease comparison nonlinear stiffness effect should be addressed to verify the global system behavior 3 1 fender stiffness effect under 20 m water depth 0 fender tank gap distance and friction fender type several different fender stiffness values were investigated the investigated single fender stiffness and total stiffness which is three times that of the single fender stiffness are shown in table 3 the single fender stiffness increases from 100 kn m to 400 kn m in this study the fender tank gap is zero which means there will always be contact between fenders on one side of the tank it is noted that fenders only provide stiffness in horizontal direction while provide zero stiffness in the vertical direction all the results below are based on the time domain analysis from hydrodynamic analysis the natural period for heave is 7 4 s with the considered fender system installed on the still water surface the pitch and roll natural periods are not changed the surge sway and yaw natural periods vary with the change of fender stiffness as shown in table 4 with the increase of the fender stiffness the natural periods for surge sway and yaw decrease the mean maximum and minimum for the surge are shown in fig 5 maximum values for pitch and heave motions are shown fig 6 from fig 5 it is noted that mean surge decreases with increasing wave period and for smaller fender stiffness mean surge increases these are as expected because according to maruo s formula mauro 1960 shorter waves are reflected more and transmitted less compared with longer waves in this case the mean drift forces would be larger for shorter waves under the same wave amplitude small mean drift forces induce small mean static surge responses the surge maximum and minimum absolute values get larger with increasing wave periods as the increased wave periods approach surge natural period with the increased fender stiffness the surge natural period decreases from 36 s to around 18 s and induce larger responses for wave periods larger than 12 s the heave and pitch resonant periods are 7 4 s and 10 9 s respectively at these two periods the surge responses are also slightly influenced due to coupling fig 6 shows the maximum heave and pitch responses for different wave periods the heave and pitch show clear peaks at the resonant period it is noted that the motion responses at the heave resonant period which is 7 4 s are located between two calculation periods which is the reason for the peak at 9 s when wave period is larger than 10 s the heave maximum values are close to 1 it is also noted that with the increased fender stiffness the pitch resonant peak is suppressed this is because with large stiffness applied friction forces in tangential directions create significant damping 3 2 tank fender gap effect the tank fender gap effects on the dynamic responses are investigated under 100 kn m single friction fender stiffness and 20 m water depth when the tank fender gap is non zero the tank may not be in contact with fenders all the time in this study 0 m 0 25 m and 0 5 m tank fender gaps gap0 gap0 25 and gap0 5 are investigated respectively under different tank fender gaps the surge mean maximum and minimum values are shown in fig 7 and the mean standard deviation std and maximum forces of fender 1 are plotted in fig 8 larger tank fender gaps will lead to larger surge mean surge max and surge min for wave periods smaller than 13 s and it is noted that the surge motion is always positive which means the tank only has contact with fenders on one side when wave period is larger than 13 s surge motions for different gap cases are not strongly influenced by the gap size for wave period from 3 s to 7 s the surge motion differences under different gaps are the same as the gap differences among different cases i e 0 25 m this means the gap just induces a mean value difference compared with cases with no gap for surge motion this is important from a practical perspective because allowing a small gap eases installation inspection and maintenance of the fenders without unduly influencing the motions in fig 8 it is noted that the fender 1 forces are not changed with different gaps for wave period from 3 s to 7 s for wave periods from 13 s to 17 s the fender 1 forces are linearly affected by different gap cases in terms of mean std and max values these findings are consistent with the results in fig 7 that for wave period between 3 and 7 s the surge motion differences are the same with gap differences because the fender forces are not affected but for wave period between 13 and 17 s the surge motions are similar which means the gap effects on surge motions are directly related to different fender forces based on these it can be concluded that surge motions are large with large tank fender gap and fender forces are not changed for wave period from 3 to 7 s surge motions are not changed with changing gaps while fender forces are small with larger gaps for wave period from 13 to 17 s these conclusions can give guidelines to the fender design if smaller surge motions are expected zero gap is preferred if small fender forces are expected large gaps should be considered 3 3 water depth effect the water depth effects are also investigated as shown in table 5 point friction fender type and 0 fender tank gap are considered two different stiffness values were studied when water depth decreases under the same wave period the wave length is decreased and the wave amplitude is increased faltinsen 2005 in general cases with 20 m water depth tend to have larger responses compared with cases with 300 m water depth the surge pitch and fender 1 force max values under various wave periods are shown in fig 9 the fender 1 force max values follow similar trend with surge max values which is reasonable because the fender 1 forces are directly related to the surge motion of the tank with 400 kn m fender stiffness the fender 1 force max values are generally larger than cases with 100 kn m fender stiffness the water depth effect is more significant for large wave period in general the responses are larger under small water depth 3 4 point fender and roller fender effect the fender friction force effects are investigated with two different fender stiffness of 100 kn and 400 kn considered under 0 fender tank gap and 20 m water depth the motion and force results are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively fig 10 shows the surge and pitch max values for different fender stiffness and fender types under varying wave periods fig 11 shows the fender 1 normal and tangential force max values for different fender stiffness and fender types under varying wave periods fric fd represents cases with point fenders that friction forces are considered roll fd represents cases with roller fenders that no friction forces are considered in the tangential directions the surge max is not strongly affected by the fender friction but the pitch is strongly influenced by the fender friction forces especially when wave period is close to the pitch resonant region the fender 1 normal forces have similar trends as the surge motions the most significant difference occurs in the different fender stiffness cases that causing different fender 1 normal forces in the right plot of fig 11 friction forces were observed for point fender cases while for roller fenders no friction forces were observed for different fender stiffness we have different friction forces and under large friction forces smaller pitch motions were observed it can be concluded that the tangential friction forces are important in reducing the pitch motions however the friction forces will cause wear problem for the fenders which may increase maintenance requirements 4 tank dynamic response analysis under different load components and misalignment effects based on the metocean data the environmental conditions with 100 years return period are as follows the waves follow two parameter jonswap spectrum with hs 2 m tp 7 s mean wind speed is 24 m s and current speed is 2 m s with uniform profile assumed the location for the current force application is on the center of the submerged area facing incident current direction the same also applies for the wind force but on the dry part of the model the wind and wave spectra are shown in fig 12 the analysis in this part is based on 3 h steady state responses under these environmental conditions when current is present constant wave periods are considered rather than encountered period in this part of study the fender stiffness is assumed to be 400 kn m point fender with tangential friction forces were deployed and 20 m water depth is considered 4 1 different load components effect dynamic response analysis for the single storage tank under these separate load component i e wind only wave only or current only conditions are performed to investigate the corresponding load components contributions different wind wave or current travelling directions are considered including 0 30 45 and 60 because current is assumed to be uniform and constant the steady state responses of the tank don t have dynamic components the static motions of the tank under current only condition for different incident current directions are presented in the left plot in fig 13 under wind only or wave only conditions dynamic components include wind frequency wave frequency as well as slow drift motion components in this case the 3 h std values of tank dynamic motions for different wind and wave incoming directions are presented in the middle and right plots in fig 13 under current only conditions the induced static surge and pitch are around 0 45 m and 0 2 respectively with the change of the travelling directions from 0 to 60 both the surge and pitch static motions are decreased linearly while both sway and roll static motions are increased linearly heave motion is zero under wind only and wave only conditions std values are presented under wind only conditions similar trends as current only conditions are observed but the trends are no longer linear because the induced motions includes wind frequency and slow drift motion components under wave only conditions the most significant difference is in the heave motions that are excited by wave loads and heave motions are not sensitive to the incident wave directions while under wind or current only conditions heave motions are not excited in addition the wave induced dynamic motions are much larger than those induced by wind 4 2 load misalignment effect fig 14 shows the 3 h statistical values including mean std and positive maximum values for tank dynamic motions under combined wind wave and current conditions the misalignment effects of wave and current are investigated the incident wind and wave direction is always co linear and is 0 while the incident current direction is changed from 0 to 180 with 30 interval the wind effects are marginally important compared with wave and current effects so we consider the wind effects together with the wave with co linear incident wind wave and current direction of 0 the mean surge and mean pitch are around 0 5 m and 0 02 respectively compared with 0 45 m and 0 2 under current only condition the mean surge is mostly induced by current for this empty tank the current induced pitch and wave induced pitch cancel each other when wave and current are travelling in the same directions while the two induced pitch components synergize each other when wave and current are travelling in the opposite directions the current and wave induced surge components have similar characteristic that is the reason that when changing incident current direction from 0 to 180 the pitch response statistical values are always increased while the surge mean and maximum values are decreased under the present assumptions the surge and heave std do not change significantly with the current direction variation which means the surge and heave std are dominated by wave from fig 14 it can be concluded that one has the largest surge when incident wave wind and current are co linear while the pitch has the largest values when incident current direction is 180 difference with respect to the wave and wind direction heave motion is not sensitive to the misalignment effects the misalignment effects affect the fender design under extreme conditions fig 15 shows the surge and pitch motion spectra under the two cases with incident wind wave and current directions of 0 0 and 0 co linear case and 0 0 and 180 opposing case respectively it is seen that the surge motions are not significantly affected while the pitch motions are strongly affected by the change of incident current direction in both surge and pitch the wave frequency motion 0 8 rad s and resonant motions 0 35 rad s for surge 0 6 rad s for pitch are excited 5 extreme dynamic response analysis under extreme wind wave and current conditions tank dynamic responses under different fender stiffness fender body gap water depth and different fender type configurations are investigated different load cases are shown in table 6 fender body gap of 0 m and 0 5 m fender stiffness with 100 kn m and 400 kn m water depth of 20 m and 300 m and friction and roller fenders were investigated respectively they are represented by case cs a b c d and e more than 3 h simulations are performed the first 10 min transient responses are neglected and the following 3 h steady state responses are used for the analysis to provide more realistic prediction the simulations were repeated for five different realizations to reduce the statistical uncertainties the simulations consider the wind wave and current loads only travelling direction of 0 spectral analyses are performed and response spectra for different parameters are shown in fig 16 it is noted that the wave energy covers from 0 5 rad s to 3 rad s frequency range as indicated in fig 12 surge resonant frequency is 0 17 rad s for 100 kn m fender stiffness cs a and is 0 35 rad s for 400 kn m fender stiffness cs b as indicated in table 4 which are both observed in the surge response spectra these are due to slow drift motions however for cs d with deep water the surge slow drift is not as significant as cases with finite water depth for 100 kn m fender stiffness case surge slow drift motions are dominating while for 400 kn m fender stiffness cases slow drift motions are not so significant in surge due to the relatively larger stiffness heave resonant frequency is 0 85 rad s which occurs in the wave frequency range with significant energy so heave resonance was observed in the responses but with different amplitude due to different vertical friction forces from fender system for cs e where roller fender applies largest heave amplitude was observed smallest heave amplitude were found for cs d where deep water condition applies pitch resonant period is 0 58 rad s which is also located in the wave region so resonance is also observed in fender 1 normal and tangential forces several frequency components exist but wave frequency components are dominant in the tangential force responses larger friction force amplitude corresponds to smaller heave response the tangential force components also show some high frequency components which may influence the fatigue damage of the fenders and the tank the statistical results for surge heave and pitch motion results are shown in fig 17 and the fender 1 force results are shown in fig 18 the statistical results i e mean std max and min are the means of all the results from the five realizations in fig 17 the heave motion statistics are not very sensitive to different parameters the surge motions are strongly influenced by the fender stiffness and the fender body gap induces only a mean difference in surge under this environmental condition deep water condition induces smaller motion responses based on the comparison between cs b and cs d by the comparison between cs b and cs e the surge and heave motions are not strongly influenced by the fender friction force the heave motion has slightly higher maximum motion for roller fender configuration the pitch motion is slightly larger for friction fender configuration this might be due to the slightly smaller normal fender forces on friction fender which provide smaller pitch restoring moment than roller friction configuration which is as shown in fig 18 from fig 18 the most significant difference is in cs d where the water depth effect is the most critical for cs a there is smallest maximum normal fender 1 force as the fender 1 will always be in contact with the tank inducing nonzero minimum force cs b has larger fender forces than cs a but induces smaller surge motions in the initial applications under investigation the deployment of the tank is in finite water depth so cs d indicates that deeper water applications will result in improved motion performance for the given metocean environment with body fender gap considered i e cs c both motions and fender forces are larger but the increase in force is not significant cs a cs b and cs e provide relatively good motion and fender force performance cs a induces larger surge mean and slow drift motions with relatively smaller fender forces the main advantage for cs e is the avoidance of friction force which makes the fenders more durable under cs b the wind wave and current misalignment effects on the statistical values of the responses are investigated here the statistical values presented are the mean response values of the 5 realizations of the extreme sea state the statistical values of motion responses and fender force responses are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively under incident wind wave and current directions of 0 0 0 co linear case and 0 0 180 opposing cases case it is seen that between the two cases the difference in surge motion is the mean values with the corresponding change of surge max and min the difference in pitch motion is the most significantly influenced in the opposing case all the statistical values of pitch are larger than that for co linear case which are similar to fig 14 in fig 20 the fender 1 normal force statistical properties have similar trend as surge motion the fender 1 friction force is much smaller than but is proportional to the fender 1 normal force the fender 2 normal force is larger under the opposing case these two cases i e the co linear and the opposing cases are taken as the worst cases for the single empty tank the results can be used as a reference for the engineering design 6 tank dynamic responses under full filled condition the tank with full filled condition is also studied dynamic motions of partial filled tank with the consideration of fluid free surface effect are out of the scope of this paper in fully filled condition no interior free surface effect is considered and the fluid is taken as solid mass inside the tank friction fender stiffness of 400 kn m is studied for the full tank natural periods are identified and compared with empty tank in table 7 because the mass properties and draft are different in the full tank configuration compared with empty tank configuration the natural periods in the 6 d o fs are also different the full tank is heavier than the empty tank so the surge sway and heave natural periods for the full tank are larger under the same horizontal and vertical stiffness the roll and pitch natural periods are not significantly changed due to the change of both rotational moment of inertia and restoring moment dynamic motions of the full tank under regular wave conditions are presented and compared with that of the empty tank the motion maximum results are shown in fig 21 it is seen that full tank shows much smaller surge motion under relatively larger wave period because the surge natural period for full tank is much larger the heave motion of the full tank is smaller than the empty tank when the wave period is smaller than the full tank heave natural period while is larger than the empty tank under other wave periods in general the pitch motion for the full tank is larger than the empty tank this is because for the empty tank the c o g is approximately 1 5 m above sea level and fenders are installed at the sea level so the wave force and fender force effects counteract with each other while for the full tank the c o g is approximately 7 4 m below sea level the interactions between wave force and fender force effects on the tank will have the opposite effect to that for the empty tank in addition with roller fenders larger pitch motions are observed under extreme environmental conditions the stochastic dynamic responses for full tank and empty tank are compared in terms of stochastic performance in the analysis friction fenders with stiffness of 400 kn m are considered the statistical results of surge heave and pitch for empty and full tank configurations under the co linear and opposing cases as stated above are shown in fig 22 the mean std maximum and minimum values are averaged values based on 5 realizations which are the same as previous analysis the corresponding fender 1 normal and tangential force as well as the fender 2 normal force are shown in fig 23 the spectra of surge and heave motions for empty and full tank configurations under 0 case are shown fig 24 in fig 22 the full tank under the two cases have similar trend to that for empty tank but the mean surge for full tank is larger than empty tank under the co linear case while smaller under the opposing case which is due to the larger induced current force by the deeper draft of the full tank and mean surge is mainly induced by current the heave motion for the full tank is significantly reduced compared with the empty tank one reason is relatively small rao values for the full tank under wave periods from 2 s to 10 s compared with that for the empty tank the other reason is the shift of the heave resonant period of the tank from 7 4 s to 11 4 s where the wave spectral energy has significantly reduced as shown in fig 12 this means the heave resonant motion will be attenuated when the tank is fully filled as the tank is deployed in relatively finite water depth the full tank with larger draft and smaller heave motion has less risk of grounding under extreme environmental conditions the pitch motion for the full tank is larger than the empty tank but the effect to the pitch motion by changing of current direction is not so significant compared with empty tank case as shown in fig 23 fender 1 normal force shows similar characteristics as the surge motion and with the change of current direction fender 1 normal force is reduced while fender 2 normal force is increased fender 1 tangential force is proportional to the normal force it is observed in fig 24 that full tank surge is larger in both wave frequency motion and slow drift motion the frequency domain results also show different slow drift frequency component which is due to different surge natural periods 7 sensitivity analysis on viscous effects in the numerical models the viscous coefficients selection should be based on the model test data or cfd calculations especially for novel geometry in this part the sensitivity of different viscous coefficients is investigated the selection of these parameters also addresses the uncertainty of the numerical analysis model test is generally needed to calibrate the viscous effects the viscous effects include current drag forces wind drag forces and viscous effects due to wave different components are studied separately in the sensitivity study the tank with fully filled condition is investigated extreme environmental conditions are applied and friction fenders with stiffness of 400 kn m are used when studying the uncertainty induced by single component the other load components are kept the same with the models previously mentioned wind and current forces on the tank are calculated in terms of quadratic drag coefficients and the wave viscous effects are also modelled in the body damping matrix in terms of quadratic drag coefficients in the previous analysis cd of 1 2 is used for both wind and current drag as well as wave viscous effect which is denoted as cnominal herein the change of cd is represented by the ratio between cd in the numerical model and cnominal motion dynamic response uncertainties including surge heave and pitch motions induced by all these environmental load components are presented in fig 25 fig 26 and fig 27 respectively and are expressed by the statistical values the surge motion is strongly influenced by the current drag coefficients especially in terms of mean max and min values with increased current drag coefficient from half to two times of cnominal the surge mean maximum and minimum values are linearly increased and the pitch statistical values are also changed in a significant way this conclusion emphasizes the importance of the current force calibration through model test the wind drag coefficient effects on the dynamic motions are negligible in this case the dynamic motions induced by wind load in the present study are accurate enough the change of the quadratic wave viscous coefficient has effects on motions and further the fender forces however the effect is marginally important compared with effects induced by current 8 hydrodynamic interaction between two tanks to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction effect the two tank system aligning with the zero incoming wave direction is investigated here different gaps including 10 m 20 m and 30 m between the two tanks are studies and surge and pitch hydrodynamic excitation force raos on the body facing the incoming wave direction are plotted in fig 28 by the comparisons between single tank case and double tank case it is obvious that due to the existence of the other body the hydrodynamic forces are significantly changed in some wave periods and with the change of the gaps between the two tanks the oscillation peaks are also altered same phenomena occurs also in the added mass wave damping etc however the amplitude of the oscillations need to be tuned due to viscous effects since the estimation is based on the potential flow solver after considering viscous effect the peaks will be reduced there are several ways to account for the viscous effect in the gap resonance problems markeng et al 2017 in this case a conclusion can be made that multi body interaction will have an influence and this should be taken into account when choosing the fenders for the final system however due to the relatively mild wave conditions these are not expected to have a large impact detailed analysis of the interaction effect is out of the scope of this paper 9 conclusions this paper deals with the hydrodynamic response analysis of a floating oil storage tank in empty and full tank conditions the tank studied is one module in a floating storage system which includes barges and floating tanks mooring fender system is used to hold the tank in position with fenders installed on a large floating barge which is considered as rigid in this study different fender stiffness body fender gaps and fender types including friction fenders and roller fenders are considered to investigate the effect on the dynamic motions of the tank in addition deep water and finite water depth conditions are also studied and compared regular wave cases are performed to get the regular motion responses under different wave periods which give rao performance of the tank under wave actions extreme environmental conditions with 100 year return period are selected for the extreme dynamic response analysis statistical and spectral results are presented empty and full tank configurations are studied based on their different resonant period and different configurations different dynamic responses are observed sensitivity analysis in terms of different viscous effects from wind wave and current are performed several conclusions are summarized and can be used as guidelines for design the effect on the motions from gap between tank body and fender system is mainly mean motions in horizontal directions i e surge sway or yaw dynamic responses are not significantly affected by body fender gap however the fender stiffness change the resonant periods in the horizontal directions and then significantly change the dynamic responses deepwater condition 300 m and finite water depth condition 20 m are also applied and it is found that dynamic responses are generally larger in finite water depth especially when wave period is larger than 9 s when wave period is smaller than 9 s the responses are generally the same under these two water depths for the comparison of friction fenders and roller fenders the fender friction forces are effective in reducing tank pitch motions fender friction forces are applied in the tangential direction along the fender plane the friction forces provide a restoring pitch moment that reduces the pitch motions extreme environmental conditions are identified based on the designed location different load components and combined effects on the dynamic responses are studied including also the misalignment effect between wave and current the dynamic responses are mainly due to wave effects wind effects are least important different parameters are investigated under extreme environmental conditions and by the comprehensive comparisons on motions and fender forces the case with zero tank fender gap and 400 kn m friction fender stiffness is selected for further investigation to reduce the statistical uncertainties five extreme wave realizations are performed and averaged statistical results are analyzed it is concluded that the two most severe cases are from conditions with incident wind wave and current directions of 0 0 0 and 0 0 180 for empty tank one has the largest surge under 0 case while the pitch has the largest values under 180 case similar conclusions can be applied for full tank condition full tank condition is also investigated and comparisons are made between full tank and empty tank conditions in general the surge and pitch dynamic motions are larger for full tank than that for empty tank while heave motions are smaller these are due to different tank eigen values in the 6 d o f motions induced by different mass properties and the extreme environmental conditions at last uncertainty analysis regarding viscous effects due to wind wave and current are investigated in detail under extreme environmental condition current quadratic coefficient is found to be critical to the dynamic motions and should be investigated with model tests and cfd while the wind and wave viscous effects are marginally important the present study will provide a design base for the design of the platform s fender system due to the strong current and wind force the fender has to be stiff enough to resist this static force without being damage however this large lateral stiffness added by the fenders will increase the natural frequency of surge and sway motions making the tank sensitive to lateral first order wave excitation a good selection of fender stiffness will be the one which can keep the natural frequencies of surge and sway between the peak frequencies of 1st order and 2nd order wave energy so that both the motion amplitude of the tank and the fender resistance force can be kept in an acceptable range for the overall system the interaction between multiple tanks nonlinearity caused by friction and gap between tank and fenders the wave current interaction etc should be taken into account acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support

23693,a modular floating concept for oil storage is proposed the concept is composed of several modular floating tanks and barges the floating tanks are self stable and designed for storage of oil and hydrocarbon material the barges provide platforms for equipment and workers quarters and enclose the floating tanks through mooring fender systems the whole concept is then moored by mooring dolphins this concept is designed for finite water depth application however potential application for deep water condition is also investigated in this study only single floating tank is investigated with both empty and full tank conditions considered different mooring fender configuration designs are the focus it is assumed that the barges are fixed in the study of single tank dynamic properties and multi body hydrodynamic is neglected different regular wave conditions are used for the study of the dynamic performance of the tank under various fender mooring system parameters irregular wave together with wind and current for 100 year return period are also applied for the study of the tank dynamic performance at last sensitivity study of the viscous effects is performed keywords dynamic response analysis floating storage tank mooring fender design sensitivity study 1 introduction with the densification of populations in coastal cities such as singapore and osaka land becomes very scarce and expensive the conventional approach of land reclamation is becoming time consuming environmentally unfriendly and expensive as the water depth gets larger in these circumstances very large floating structures vlfss watanabe et al 2004 ohmatsu 2005 are more suitable for offshore space exploitation the advantages of vlfss include low impact to the sea bed and environmental conditions and flexible deployment in terms of offshore positions there are different types of vlfss including floating bridges wan et al 2017 lwin 2000 floating entertainment facilities floating storage facilities floating city floating fish farm huguenin and ansuini 1978 shainee et al 2013 etc each application has its own scale and design principles and the sizing of the floating structure and its mooring system depends on its function and also on the environmental conditions in terms of waves current and wind in this study a vlfs concept for storing crude oil or hydrocarbon in the sea is the focus this concept is proposed for singapore coastal waters with a potential application and deployment also in other coastal regions until now there are only two floating fuel storage facilities in the world and both are located in japan one is kamigoto oil storage base and the other is shirashima oil storage base ueda 2015 which are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively the proposed floating storage facility consists of several modular floating tanks assembled together with barges that provide space for the associated equipment and workers quarters which are shown in fig 1c the operation facility modules to be implemented onto the barges are listed in table 1 each tank in this concept is moored by mooring fenders around its periphery in this study only one tank system with the surrounding mooring fenders is the focus the treatment of the multi tank system as well as tanks and barge system are outside the scope of this paper but is only touched upon fender system is broadly used in the ship berthing problems at a jetty fenders for large vessels can be categorized into three types eskenazi and wang 2015 rubber fenders foam fenders and pneumatic fenders sakakibara and kubo 2007 and these are suitable for rigid berth which can be applied to the system in this paper examples of these fender types are shown in fig 2 website 2017 the fender can dissipate energy from ship or tank impact and can also provide stiffness which affects the tank dynamic properties analysis principles of fender system for ship berthing is addressed by pianc in 2002 pianc 2002 fenders in contact with structures can induce friction forces when there are relative motions roller type of fender system can attenuate the friction forces in addition fenders can also induce local stress due to relatively small contact area wan et al 2016 and this should be taken into consideration from structural point of view in this paper the tank dynamic motions coupled with fender system is investigated assuming that fender system provides different stiffness parameters to the tank system the detailed fender system configuration is not touched upon the oil storage tank is subjected to offshore wind current and wave loads the combined loads under offshore environment include both static and dynamic components the static component such as mean wind current and wave drift load will cause a static deviation or tilting of the tank location from its original equilibrium position while the dynamic component excites wave frequency or low frequency dynamic response the change of the incoming environmental load directions will also directly affect the fender reactions in a significant way since all the environmental loading will be resisted by the marine fenders installed on the barges the appropriate design of the marine fenders become crucial for the safety of the system frequency domain methods are widely used in the hydrodynamic responses of the coupled system for designing floating structures however in many applications such as floating wind turbine floating wave energy converters etc the viscous effect transient loading events and nonlinear features may be important and in these cases a time domain model is more applicable wan et al 2015 in the tank fender system nonlinear features such as friction forces tank fender gaps viscous effects from wind wave and current are included and nonlinear fender properties can also be considered hydrodynamic properties of the tank are firstly calculated in frequency domain and then nonlinear features are included in time domain model when there is liquid in the tank free surface effects may also influence the tank dynamic motions under partially filled condition an engineering approach of considering this free surface effect in time domain model is proposed in jin et al 2017 however it is not considered further in this study 2 tank system description the tank is a cylindrical tank enclosed by rectangular shape walls with rounded corners and dome roof and each tank is surrounded by a fender system as shown in fig 3 the fluid is stored inside the cylindrical tank while the rectangular shape walls provide additional buoyancy to ensure tank stability single bottom and single tank hull configuration is used the main dimensions and mass properties for empty tank and full tank conditions are shown in table 2 the tank dimension is smaller than the dimension of the kamigoto length 245 m breadth 97 m depth 27 6 m and full laden draft 24 5 m and shirashima length 397 m breadth 82 m depth 25 4 m and full laden draft 22 7 m oil storage bases the tank design in this paper is focused on the modular type design which has the advantages of ease of expansion to larger scale system including more modular tanks so that it can fulfill the operators requirement easily and also be more flexible on the mobility feature of each single tank however the fender system for the modular tanks can pose the cost issues depending on the numbers and material for the fender system in addition in the relative shallow water the design of the tank should ensure that no grounding of the tank will occur even under the worst environmental conditions fenders on different sides are marked as 1 2 3 and 4 as shown in fig 3 which represents all the three fenders on each side one ends of the fenders are assumed to be rigidly connected to a large barge which is assumed to be fixed in this analysis for simplification the other ends of the fenders carry loads from the tank the marine fenders add lateral stiffness to the tank motion equation thus the tank will respond to first order wave excitation if the stiffness is large enough to make the surge sway natural frequency close to wave excitation frequency or the lateral motion will have a low frequency and be more sensitive to 2nd order low frequency load surge and sway motion amplitudes are crucial in this case since they determine the deformation and consequently dynamic loading of the marine fenders the gaps between the fender system and the tank may also affect the dynamic tank motion the fenders can be roller fenders or friction fenders which will induce different friction forces when there is relative motions between tank and the fenders this concept is designed to be deployed in coastal region with finite water depth however deep water condition is also investigated viscous effects of the tank due to the tank motions are considered by empirical formula considering nonlinear terms such as fender gaps fender friction forces viscous effects etc time domain model is used in the analysis tank responses under regular wave conditions irregular wave conditions as well as wind and current environmental conditions are investigated in addition tank with empty and full filling conditions are studied in this paper taking fluid inside the tank as solid mass sloshing effects are outside of the scope of this study in this study one tank dynamic analysis was carried out without considering the effect from other bodies however the complete system comprises a group of tanks together with barge system are installed to form the storage tank system in this case the interactions between different bodies should be considered however detailed analysis of the multi body interaction will be considered for the global hydrodynamic analysis with two tanks side by side depending on the relative position of the two tanks and the incoming wave directions interactions will affect the added mass radiation damping excitation forces etc if two tanks have narrow gaps wave elevation between the two tanks would also be amplified to a large extend zhao et al 2016 similar interactions will be found as for the case of two barges side by side will be found in addition due to hydrodynamic interactions waves at zero degree heading will cause hydrodynamic forces on bodies in 90 due to radiation if there are four barges forming a closed water surface area and no tank is installed large wave elevation will be found inside the closed area based on potential flow damping factors need to be applied in this region to simulate viscous effect and future model test will be performed to carry out the validation work after tank installation in this closed region formed by barge system the dynamic performance of the tank and the barges will then be different from the cases without tanks inside the hydrodynamic interactions will influence fender forces to some degree and should be accounted for in the final fender selection 2 1 numerical model for a rigid floating system with zero forward speed in sea waves the equation of motion newman 1977 due to first order second order wave loads and wind loads etc can be described in frequency domain as 1 ω 2 m a ω x ω i ω b ω x ω rx ω f ω where ω is the wave frequency m is the structural mass matrix a ω is the frequency dependent added mass matrix b ω is the radiation damping matrix r is the restoring matrix x ω is the motion vector f ω is the external force vector rx ω is the linear restoring force term considering the buoyancy and gravity all the vectors and matrices are expressed in frequency domain so the linear problem can be solved efficiently however in the analysis of the floating storage tank there are components that should be considered nonlinearly such as wind loads viscous effects from waves current drag forces nonlinear fender mooring system for a single floating rigid body the equation of motion can be written in the time domain as 2 m a x t c x t x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ rx t f t x x in which a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors in time domain respectively c is the quadratic viscous damping coefficients matrix due to wave f t x x is the summation of the external forces in time domain k τ is the retardation function matrix due to the wave memory effects cummins 1962 and is expressed as 3 k τ 2 π 0 b ω b cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 ω a ω a sin ω t d ω where b is the radiation damping matrix at infinite frequency and b 0 for floating structures with zero forward speed allan ross 1991 this is called hybrid time and frequency domain model naess and moan 2013 for simplification the slow drift motions in horizontal plane are calculated based on newman s approximation newman 1974 considering finite water depth condition the dispersion relationship is ω 2 k g tanh k h rather than ω 2 k g and the velocity potential wave excitation forces etc should follow the finite water depth calculations faltinsen 1993 wind and current force calculations are based on empirical formula where quadratic coefficients are used to model the viscous effect the wind and current force formula are shown in the following equations 4 f w i c w i α u w 2 f c i c c i α u c 2 where f w i and f c i are the wind force and current force on the body respectively i represents the ith degree of freedom of the body motion c w i α and c c i α are the wind and current force coefficients respectively α in c w i α is the relative angle between wind velocity and body velocity while α in c c i α is the relative angle between body low frequency velocity and current velocity u w is the relative velocity between wind and body motion while u c is the relative velocity between low frequency body velocity and current velocity marintek 2009 c w i α and c c i α are estimated based on the projection area a α of the tank in the incident wind and current direction with the quadratic coefficient c d 1 2 i e c c w i ρ c d a α 2 in the tank dynamic analysis wave wind and current are all considered the horizontal stiffness of the tank is provided by the fender system two types of fender system are investigated i e point fender and roller fender the point fender can provide tangential friction force while the roller fender cannot provide any tangential friction in heave direction on each side of the tank three fenders were considered in case one fender is not functioning the other two fenders can still work to prevent tank excessive motions the tank numerical model with friction fenders and roller fenders are shown in fig 4 the frequency domain hydrodynamic properties are calculated by wadam dnv 2011 in sesam package the time domain model is established in simo code marintek 2007 which was developed by sintef ocean viscous effects due to wave are considered by quadratic damping terms in the motion equation quadratic damping coefficient of 1 2 is used in surge sway and heave considering flow separation around sharp corners dnv 2010 robert 1984 in roll motions of ships the viscous effects are more important chakrabarti 2001 for this tank configuration the potential damping and nonlinear damping are both important an initial viscous damping value is assumed the viscous effects are based on the empirical estimation sensitivity analysis for a range of damping coefficients is performed below to investigate the sensitivity to this parameter 3 parametric study on empty tank dynamic response analysis under regular wave conditions in the analysis a series of parametric studies is performed by varying fender stiffness fender tank gap fender type as well as water depth these parameters are analyzed in the following respectively it is noted that this part only focus on the empty tank configuration the full tank dynamic performance and the comparison with that for empty tank is analyzed in the following part in this part regular waves with 0 incident direction are applied in the analysis with no wind and current with wave drift forces considered in time domain the dynamic responses of the tank under various wave periods and 1 m wave amplitude are investigated steady state responses are used in the analysis the description of motions and directions follows the coordinate system as depicted in fig 3 large fender stiffness will induce a stiff tank system however high fender stiffness will also make the cost very high due to high reaction loads small fender stiffness will create soft tank restraint in these cases tank horizontal motions will be significant due to the second order wave effects appropriate fender stiffness should be applied and at the same time tank natural periods should not fall within in the common wave frequency region depending on the metocean conditions of the selected site to avoid resonance the fender stiffness effects are firstly investigated the tank fender gap may also influence the dynamic responses of the tank and its effects are studied secondly the water depth used in the analysis is 20 m under such finite water depth conditions the dynamic performance will be different compared with deep water condition to understand the water depth effect on the dynamic responses 300 m water depth were also investigated regarding the fender type design two types of fenders are considered to investigate friction force effects point friction fenders and roller fenders are studied respectively they are all rubber fenders in a point friction fender with friction forces a globally fixed position is defined and a fender plane is defined on the tank when the point and the fender plane are in contact there will be fender forces induced this fender force includes normal and tangential components and the tangential component is the fender friction force roller fenders are another alternative they allow the fenders to roll on the fender planes and don t have tangential components those parameters are investigated in the following parts respectively for realistic marine fenders the stiffness cannot be linear however in this paper the stiffness is assumed to be linear for ease comparison nonlinear stiffness effect should be addressed to verify the global system behavior 3 1 fender stiffness effect under 20 m water depth 0 fender tank gap distance and friction fender type several different fender stiffness values were investigated the investigated single fender stiffness and total stiffness which is three times that of the single fender stiffness are shown in table 3 the single fender stiffness increases from 100 kn m to 400 kn m in this study the fender tank gap is zero which means there will always be contact between fenders on one side of the tank it is noted that fenders only provide stiffness in horizontal direction while provide zero stiffness in the vertical direction all the results below are based on the time domain analysis from hydrodynamic analysis the natural period for heave is 7 4 s with the considered fender system installed on the still water surface the pitch and roll natural periods are not changed the surge sway and yaw natural periods vary with the change of fender stiffness as shown in table 4 with the increase of the fender stiffness the natural periods for surge sway and yaw decrease the mean maximum and minimum for the surge are shown in fig 5 maximum values for pitch and heave motions are shown fig 6 from fig 5 it is noted that mean surge decreases with increasing wave period and for smaller fender stiffness mean surge increases these are as expected because according to maruo s formula mauro 1960 shorter waves are reflected more and transmitted less compared with longer waves in this case the mean drift forces would be larger for shorter waves under the same wave amplitude small mean drift forces induce small mean static surge responses the surge maximum and minimum absolute values get larger with increasing wave periods as the increased wave periods approach surge natural period with the increased fender stiffness the surge natural period decreases from 36 s to around 18 s and induce larger responses for wave periods larger than 12 s the heave and pitch resonant periods are 7 4 s and 10 9 s respectively at these two periods the surge responses are also slightly influenced due to coupling fig 6 shows the maximum heave and pitch responses for different wave periods the heave and pitch show clear peaks at the resonant period it is noted that the motion responses at the heave resonant period which is 7 4 s are located between two calculation periods which is the reason for the peak at 9 s when wave period is larger than 10 s the heave maximum values are close to 1 it is also noted that with the increased fender stiffness the pitch resonant peak is suppressed this is because with large stiffness applied friction forces in tangential directions create significant damping 3 2 tank fender gap effect the tank fender gap effects on the dynamic responses are investigated under 100 kn m single friction fender stiffness and 20 m water depth when the tank fender gap is non zero the tank may not be in contact with fenders all the time in this study 0 m 0 25 m and 0 5 m tank fender gaps gap0 gap0 25 and gap0 5 are investigated respectively under different tank fender gaps the surge mean maximum and minimum values are shown in fig 7 and the mean standard deviation std and maximum forces of fender 1 are plotted in fig 8 larger tank fender gaps will lead to larger surge mean surge max and surge min for wave periods smaller than 13 s and it is noted that the surge motion is always positive which means the tank only has contact with fenders on one side when wave period is larger than 13 s surge motions for different gap cases are not strongly influenced by the gap size for wave period from 3 s to 7 s the surge motion differences under different gaps are the same as the gap differences among different cases i e 0 25 m this means the gap just induces a mean value difference compared with cases with no gap for surge motion this is important from a practical perspective because allowing a small gap eases installation inspection and maintenance of the fenders without unduly influencing the motions in fig 8 it is noted that the fender 1 forces are not changed with different gaps for wave period from 3 s to 7 s for wave periods from 13 s to 17 s the fender 1 forces are linearly affected by different gap cases in terms of mean std and max values these findings are consistent with the results in fig 7 that for wave period between 3 and 7 s the surge motion differences are the same with gap differences because the fender forces are not affected but for wave period between 13 and 17 s the surge motions are similar which means the gap effects on surge motions are directly related to different fender forces based on these it can be concluded that surge motions are large with large tank fender gap and fender forces are not changed for wave period from 3 to 7 s surge motions are not changed with changing gaps while fender forces are small with larger gaps for wave period from 13 to 17 s these conclusions can give guidelines to the fender design if smaller surge motions are expected zero gap is preferred if small fender forces are expected large gaps should be considered 3 3 water depth effect the water depth effects are also investigated as shown in table 5 point friction fender type and 0 fender tank gap are considered two different stiffness values were studied when water depth decreases under the same wave period the wave length is decreased and the wave amplitude is increased faltinsen 2005 in general cases with 20 m water depth tend to have larger responses compared with cases with 300 m water depth the surge pitch and fender 1 force max values under various wave periods are shown in fig 9 the fender 1 force max values follow similar trend with surge max values which is reasonable because the fender 1 forces are directly related to the surge motion of the tank with 400 kn m fender stiffness the fender 1 force max values are generally larger than cases with 100 kn m fender stiffness the water depth effect is more significant for large wave period in general the responses are larger under small water depth 3 4 point fender and roller fender effect the fender friction force effects are investigated with two different fender stiffness of 100 kn and 400 kn considered under 0 fender tank gap and 20 m water depth the motion and force results are shown in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively fig 10 shows the surge and pitch max values for different fender stiffness and fender types under varying wave periods fig 11 shows the fender 1 normal and tangential force max values for different fender stiffness and fender types under varying wave periods fric fd represents cases with point fenders that friction forces are considered roll fd represents cases with roller fenders that no friction forces are considered in the tangential directions the surge max is not strongly affected by the fender friction but the pitch is strongly influenced by the fender friction forces especially when wave period is close to the pitch resonant region the fender 1 normal forces have similar trends as the surge motions the most significant difference occurs in the different fender stiffness cases that causing different fender 1 normal forces in the right plot of fig 11 friction forces were observed for point fender cases while for roller fenders no friction forces were observed for different fender stiffness we have different friction forces and under large friction forces smaller pitch motions were observed it can be concluded that the tangential friction forces are important in reducing the pitch motions however the friction forces will cause wear problem for the fenders which may increase maintenance requirements 4 tank dynamic response analysis under different load components and misalignment effects based on the metocean data the environmental conditions with 100 years return period are as follows the waves follow two parameter jonswap spectrum with hs 2 m tp 7 s mean wind speed is 24 m s and current speed is 2 m s with uniform profile assumed the location for the current force application is on the center of the submerged area facing incident current direction the same also applies for the wind force but on the dry part of the model the wind and wave spectra are shown in fig 12 the analysis in this part is based on 3 h steady state responses under these environmental conditions when current is present constant wave periods are considered rather than encountered period in this part of study the fender stiffness is assumed to be 400 kn m point fender with tangential friction forces were deployed and 20 m water depth is considered 4 1 different load components effect dynamic response analysis for the single storage tank under these separate load component i e wind only wave only or current only conditions are performed to investigate the corresponding load components contributions different wind wave or current travelling directions are considered including 0 30 45 and 60 because current is assumed to be uniform and constant the steady state responses of the tank don t have dynamic components the static motions of the tank under current only condition for different incident current directions are presented in the left plot in fig 13 under wind only or wave only conditions dynamic components include wind frequency wave frequency as well as slow drift motion components in this case the 3 h std values of tank dynamic motions for different wind and wave incoming directions are presented in the middle and right plots in fig 13 under current only conditions the induced static surge and pitch are around 0 45 m and 0 2 respectively with the change of the travelling directions from 0 to 60 both the surge and pitch static motions are decreased linearly while both sway and roll static motions are increased linearly heave motion is zero under wind only and wave only conditions std values are presented under wind only conditions similar trends as current only conditions are observed but the trends are no longer linear because the induced motions includes wind frequency and slow drift motion components under wave only conditions the most significant difference is in the heave motions that are excited by wave loads and heave motions are not sensitive to the incident wave directions while under wind or current only conditions heave motions are not excited in addition the wave induced dynamic motions are much larger than those induced by wind 4 2 load misalignment effect fig 14 shows the 3 h statistical values including mean std and positive maximum values for tank dynamic motions under combined wind wave and current conditions the misalignment effects of wave and current are investigated the incident wind and wave direction is always co linear and is 0 while the incident current direction is changed from 0 to 180 with 30 interval the wind effects are marginally important compared with wave and current effects so we consider the wind effects together with the wave with co linear incident wind wave and current direction of 0 the mean surge and mean pitch are around 0 5 m and 0 02 respectively compared with 0 45 m and 0 2 under current only condition the mean surge is mostly induced by current for this empty tank the current induced pitch and wave induced pitch cancel each other when wave and current are travelling in the same directions while the two induced pitch components synergize each other when wave and current are travelling in the opposite directions the current and wave induced surge components have similar characteristic that is the reason that when changing incident current direction from 0 to 180 the pitch response statistical values are always increased while the surge mean and maximum values are decreased under the present assumptions the surge and heave std do not change significantly with the current direction variation which means the surge and heave std are dominated by wave from fig 14 it can be concluded that one has the largest surge when incident wave wind and current are co linear while the pitch has the largest values when incident current direction is 180 difference with respect to the wave and wind direction heave motion is not sensitive to the misalignment effects the misalignment effects affect the fender design under extreme conditions fig 15 shows the surge and pitch motion spectra under the two cases with incident wind wave and current directions of 0 0 and 0 co linear case and 0 0 and 180 opposing case respectively it is seen that the surge motions are not significantly affected while the pitch motions are strongly affected by the change of incident current direction in both surge and pitch the wave frequency motion 0 8 rad s and resonant motions 0 35 rad s for surge 0 6 rad s for pitch are excited 5 extreme dynamic response analysis under extreme wind wave and current conditions tank dynamic responses under different fender stiffness fender body gap water depth and different fender type configurations are investigated different load cases are shown in table 6 fender body gap of 0 m and 0 5 m fender stiffness with 100 kn m and 400 kn m water depth of 20 m and 300 m and friction and roller fenders were investigated respectively they are represented by case cs a b c d and e more than 3 h simulations are performed the first 10 min transient responses are neglected and the following 3 h steady state responses are used for the analysis to provide more realistic prediction the simulations were repeated for five different realizations to reduce the statistical uncertainties the simulations consider the wind wave and current loads only travelling direction of 0 spectral analyses are performed and response spectra for different parameters are shown in fig 16 it is noted that the wave energy covers from 0 5 rad s to 3 rad s frequency range as indicated in fig 12 surge resonant frequency is 0 17 rad s for 100 kn m fender stiffness cs a and is 0 35 rad s for 400 kn m fender stiffness cs b as indicated in table 4 which are both observed in the surge response spectra these are due to slow drift motions however for cs d with deep water the surge slow drift is not as significant as cases with finite water depth for 100 kn m fender stiffness case surge slow drift motions are dominating while for 400 kn m fender stiffness cases slow drift motions are not so significant in surge due to the relatively larger stiffness heave resonant frequency is 0 85 rad s which occurs in the wave frequency range with significant energy so heave resonance was observed in the responses but with different amplitude due to different vertical friction forces from fender system for cs e where roller fender applies largest heave amplitude was observed smallest heave amplitude were found for cs d where deep water condition applies pitch resonant period is 0 58 rad s which is also located in the wave region so resonance is also observed in fender 1 normal and tangential forces several frequency components exist but wave frequency components are dominant in the tangential force responses larger friction force amplitude corresponds to smaller heave response the tangential force components also show some high frequency components which may influence the fatigue damage of the fenders and the tank the statistical results for surge heave and pitch motion results are shown in fig 17 and the fender 1 force results are shown in fig 18 the statistical results i e mean std max and min are the means of all the results from the five realizations in fig 17 the heave motion statistics are not very sensitive to different parameters the surge motions are strongly influenced by the fender stiffness and the fender body gap induces only a mean difference in surge under this environmental condition deep water condition induces smaller motion responses based on the comparison between cs b and cs d by the comparison between cs b and cs e the surge and heave motions are not strongly influenced by the fender friction force the heave motion has slightly higher maximum motion for roller fender configuration the pitch motion is slightly larger for friction fender configuration this might be due to the slightly smaller normal fender forces on friction fender which provide smaller pitch restoring moment than roller friction configuration which is as shown in fig 18 from fig 18 the most significant difference is in cs d where the water depth effect is the most critical for cs a there is smallest maximum normal fender 1 force as the fender 1 will always be in contact with the tank inducing nonzero minimum force cs b has larger fender forces than cs a but induces smaller surge motions in the initial applications under investigation the deployment of the tank is in finite water depth so cs d indicates that deeper water applications will result in improved motion performance for the given metocean environment with body fender gap considered i e cs c both motions and fender forces are larger but the increase in force is not significant cs a cs b and cs e provide relatively good motion and fender force performance cs a induces larger surge mean and slow drift motions with relatively smaller fender forces the main advantage for cs e is the avoidance of friction force which makes the fenders more durable under cs b the wind wave and current misalignment effects on the statistical values of the responses are investigated here the statistical values presented are the mean response values of the 5 realizations of the extreme sea state the statistical values of motion responses and fender force responses are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively under incident wind wave and current directions of 0 0 0 co linear case and 0 0 180 opposing cases case it is seen that between the two cases the difference in surge motion is the mean values with the corresponding change of surge max and min the difference in pitch motion is the most significantly influenced in the opposing case all the statistical values of pitch are larger than that for co linear case which are similar to fig 14 in fig 20 the fender 1 normal force statistical properties have similar trend as surge motion the fender 1 friction force is much smaller than but is proportional to the fender 1 normal force the fender 2 normal force is larger under the opposing case these two cases i e the co linear and the opposing cases are taken as the worst cases for the single empty tank the results can be used as a reference for the engineering design 6 tank dynamic responses under full filled condition the tank with full filled condition is also studied dynamic motions of partial filled tank with the consideration of fluid free surface effect are out of the scope of this paper in fully filled condition no interior free surface effect is considered and the fluid is taken as solid mass inside the tank friction fender stiffness of 400 kn m is studied for the full tank natural periods are identified and compared with empty tank in table 7 because the mass properties and draft are different in the full tank configuration compared with empty tank configuration the natural periods in the 6 d o fs are also different the full tank is heavier than the empty tank so the surge sway and heave natural periods for the full tank are larger under the same horizontal and vertical stiffness the roll and pitch natural periods are not significantly changed due to the change of both rotational moment of inertia and restoring moment dynamic motions of the full tank under regular wave conditions are presented and compared with that of the empty tank the motion maximum results are shown in fig 21 it is seen that full tank shows much smaller surge motion under relatively larger wave period because the surge natural period for full tank is much larger the heave motion of the full tank is smaller than the empty tank when the wave period is smaller than the full tank heave natural period while is larger than the empty tank under other wave periods in general the pitch motion for the full tank is larger than the empty tank this is because for the empty tank the c o g is approximately 1 5 m above sea level and fenders are installed at the sea level so the wave force and fender force effects counteract with each other while for the full tank the c o g is approximately 7 4 m below sea level the interactions between wave force and fender force effects on the tank will have the opposite effect to that for the empty tank in addition with roller fenders larger pitch motions are observed under extreme environmental conditions the stochastic dynamic responses for full tank and empty tank are compared in terms of stochastic performance in the analysis friction fenders with stiffness of 400 kn m are considered the statistical results of surge heave and pitch for empty and full tank configurations under the co linear and opposing cases as stated above are shown in fig 22 the mean std maximum and minimum values are averaged values based on 5 realizations which are the same as previous analysis the corresponding fender 1 normal and tangential force as well as the fender 2 normal force are shown in fig 23 the spectra of surge and heave motions for empty and full tank configurations under 0 case are shown fig 24 in fig 22 the full tank under the two cases have similar trend to that for empty tank but the mean surge for full tank is larger than empty tank under the co linear case while smaller under the opposing case which is due to the larger induced current force by the deeper draft of the full tank and mean surge is mainly induced by current the heave motion for the full tank is significantly reduced compared with the empty tank one reason is relatively small rao values for the full tank under wave periods from 2 s to 10 s compared with that for the empty tank the other reason is the shift of the heave resonant period of the tank from 7 4 s to 11 4 s where the wave spectral energy has significantly reduced as shown in fig 12 this means the heave resonant motion will be attenuated when the tank is fully filled as the tank is deployed in relatively finite water depth the full tank with larger draft and smaller heave motion has less risk of grounding under extreme environmental conditions the pitch motion for the full tank is larger than the empty tank but the effect to the pitch motion by changing of current direction is not so significant compared with empty tank case as shown in fig 23 fender 1 normal force shows similar characteristics as the surge motion and with the change of current direction fender 1 normal force is reduced while fender 2 normal force is increased fender 1 tangential force is proportional to the normal force it is observed in fig 24 that full tank surge is larger in both wave frequency motion and slow drift motion the frequency domain results also show different slow drift frequency component which is due to different surge natural periods 7 sensitivity analysis on viscous effects in the numerical models the viscous coefficients selection should be based on the model test data or cfd calculations especially for novel geometry in this part the sensitivity of different viscous coefficients is investigated the selection of these parameters also addresses the uncertainty of the numerical analysis model test is generally needed to calibrate the viscous effects the viscous effects include current drag forces wind drag forces and viscous effects due to wave different components are studied separately in the sensitivity study the tank with fully filled condition is investigated extreme environmental conditions are applied and friction fenders with stiffness of 400 kn m are used when studying the uncertainty induced by single component the other load components are kept the same with the models previously mentioned wind and current forces on the tank are calculated in terms of quadratic drag coefficients and the wave viscous effects are also modelled in the body damping matrix in terms of quadratic drag coefficients in the previous analysis cd of 1 2 is used for both wind and current drag as well as wave viscous effect which is denoted as cnominal herein the change of cd is represented by the ratio between cd in the numerical model and cnominal motion dynamic response uncertainties including surge heave and pitch motions induced by all these environmental load components are presented in fig 25 fig 26 and fig 27 respectively and are expressed by the statistical values the surge motion is strongly influenced by the current drag coefficients especially in terms of mean max and min values with increased current drag coefficient from half to two times of cnominal the surge mean maximum and minimum values are linearly increased and the pitch statistical values are also changed in a significant way this conclusion emphasizes the importance of the current force calibration through model test the wind drag coefficient effects on the dynamic motions are negligible in this case the dynamic motions induced by wind load in the present study are accurate enough the change of the quadratic wave viscous coefficient has effects on motions and further the fender forces however the effect is marginally important compared with effects induced by current 8 hydrodynamic interaction between two tanks to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction effect the two tank system aligning with the zero incoming wave direction is investigated here different gaps including 10 m 20 m and 30 m between the two tanks are studies and surge and pitch hydrodynamic excitation force raos on the body facing the incoming wave direction are plotted in fig 28 by the comparisons between single tank case and double tank case it is obvious that due to the existence of the other body the hydrodynamic forces are significantly changed in some wave periods and with the change of the gaps between the two tanks the oscillation peaks are also altered same phenomena occurs also in the added mass wave damping etc however the amplitude of the oscillations need to be tuned due to viscous effects since the estimation is based on the potential flow solver after considering viscous effect the peaks will be reduced there are several ways to account for the viscous effect in the gap resonance problems markeng et al 2017 in this case a conclusion can be made that multi body interaction will have an influence and this should be taken into account when choosing the fenders for the final system however due to the relatively mild wave conditions these are not expected to have a large impact detailed analysis of the interaction effect is out of the scope of this paper 9 conclusions this paper deals with the hydrodynamic response analysis of a floating oil storage tank in empty and full tank conditions the tank studied is one module in a floating storage system which includes barges and floating tanks mooring fender system is used to hold the tank in position with fenders installed on a large floating barge which is considered as rigid in this study different fender stiffness body fender gaps and fender types including friction fenders and roller fenders are considered to investigate the effect on the dynamic motions of the tank in addition deep water and finite water depth conditions are also studied and compared regular wave cases are performed to get the regular motion responses under different wave periods which give rao performance of the tank under wave actions extreme environmental conditions with 100 year return period are selected for the extreme dynamic response analysis statistical and spectral results are presented empty and full tank configurations are studied based on their different resonant period and different configurations different dynamic responses are observed sensitivity analysis in terms of different viscous effects from wind wave and current are performed several conclusions are summarized and can be used as guidelines for design the effect on the motions from gap between tank body and fender system is mainly mean motions in horizontal directions i e surge sway or yaw dynamic responses are not significantly affected by body fender gap however the fender stiffness change the resonant periods in the horizontal directions and then significantly change the dynamic responses deepwater condition 300 m and finite water depth condition 20 m are also applied and it is found that dynamic responses are generally larger in finite water depth especially when wave period is larger than 9 s when wave period is smaller than 9 s the responses are generally the same under these two water depths for the comparison of friction fenders and roller fenders the fender friction forces are effective in reducing tank pitch motions fender friction forces are applied in the tangential direction along the fender plane the friction forces provide a restoring pitch moment that reduces the pitch motions extreme environmental conditions are identified based on the designed location different load components and combined effects on the dynamic responses are studied including also the misalignment effect between wave and current the dynamic responses are mainly due to wave effects wind effects are least important different parameters are investigated under extreme environmental conditions and by the comprehensive comparisons on motions and fender forces the case with zero tank fender gap and 400 kn m friction fender stiffness is selected for further investigation to reduce the statistical uncertainties five extreme wave realizations are performed and averaged statistical results are analyzed it is concluded that the two most severe cases are from conditions with incident wind wave and current directions of 0 0 0 and 0 0 180 for empty tank one has the largest surge under 0 case while the pitch has the largest values under 180 case similar conclusions can be applied for full tank condition full tank condition is also investigated and comparisons are made between full tank and empty tank conditions in general the surge and pitch dynamic motions are larger for full tank than that for empty tank while heave motions are smaller these are due to different tank eigen values in the 6 d o f motions induced by different mass properties and the extreme environmental conditions at last uncertainty analysis regarding viscous effects due to wind wave and current are investigated in detail under extreme environmental condition current quadratic coefficient is found to be critical to the dynamic motions and should be investigated with model tests and cfd while the wind and wave viscous effects are marginally important the present study will provide a design base for the design of the platform s fender system due to the strong current and wind force the fender has to be stiff enough to resist this static force without being damage however this large lateral stiffness added by the fenders will increase the natural frequency of surge and sway motions making the tank sensitive to lateral first order wave excitation a good selection of fender stiffness will be the one which can keep the natural frequencies of surge and sway between the peak frequencies of 1st order and 2nd order wave energy so that both the motion amplitude of the tank and the fender resistance force can be kept in an acceptable range for the overall system the interaction between multiple tanks nonlinearity caused by friction and gap between tank and fenders the wave current interaction etc should be taken into account acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support

23694,pipe in pipe pip systems have been increasingly used in offshore applications because of their favourable thermal insulation capacity very recently the conventional pip system was slightly revised by using carefully designed springs and dashpots to connect the inner and outer pipes this revised pip system can be considered as a structure tuned mass damper tmd system it therefore has the potential to mitigate the offshore structural vibrations induced by various sources such as earthquake excitation and or vortex shedding this paper carries out three dimensional 3d numerical simulations to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method the cross flow oscillation of the conventional and optimized pip systems are numerically investigated by developing a two way coupled fluid structure interaction fsi framework for computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis the developed fsi model is validated with the available experimental and numerical benchmark data on a single cylinder this validated model is then extended to the pip system to study its efficiency for vortex induced vibration viv suppression numerical results show that the optimized pip system can noticeably reduce viv keywords pip system viv suppression tmd fsi cfd 1 introduction when a circular cylinder is placed in a fluid flow vortex shedding may result in vibrations to the cylinder and this is known as the vortex induced vibration viv viv has been widely recognized as the cause of the damage of many engineering structures such as subsea pipelines marine risers anchoring lines spar buoys and bridge cables extensive research works have been conducted to address viv due to its significance bearman 2011 oruç 2017 to mitigate the adverse effects of viv several vibration control techniques have been proposed these techniques can be broadly divided into two subgroups the passive and active control methods active control requires external power to operate which imposes challenges in real engineering practices especially in the offshore environment where providing complex actuators as well as excessive power would be problematic and costly passive control devices on the other hand require no external power are relatively less expensive and easier to install hence for marine structures various passive control techniques have been widely introduced to suppress viv rashidi et al 2016 these devices include for example the helical strake holland et al 2017 senga and larsen 2017 fairing assi et al 2014 yu et al 2015 dart like overlay zhu et al 2016 splitter plates and c shaped foil law and jaiman 2017 soumya and prakash 2017 controlling rods song et al 2017 attached plate ozkan et al 2017 screen shroud cicolin and assi 2017 and surface roughness control src techniques bernitsas and raghavan 2014 however it should be noted that although some of these devices have been applied in engineering practices certain drawbacks exist which may considerably affect their performances especially when they are located in the deep and ultra deep waters for example helical strake and splitter plates usually impose an additional hydrodynamic drag force to the structure shrouds and axial slats are expensive to manufacture not easy to install susceptible to marine growth and prone to storm damage it is therefore important to develop more efficient cost effective and practical passive control devices to effectively control viv of offshore cylindrical structures oruç 2017 pipe in pipe pip systems are becoming more and more widely used especially in the deep and ultra deep waters karampour et al 2017 a conventional pip system is comprised of an internal insulated pipe the product pipe and an outer pipe the sleeve pipe the inner pipe is used to carry the product flow and the outer pipe provides mechanical protection against the high external hydrostatic pressure centralizers normally made of hard polymeric rings are clamped on the inner pipe with certain spacing to ensure the concentric positions of the two pipes bai and bai 2012 instead of using the hard polymeric centralizers bi and hao 2016b proposed a modified system by using specially designed connecting devices between the inner and outer pipes the modified pip system then forms a structure tuned mass damper tmd system with the outer pipe acting as the primary structure and the inner pipe performing as the tmd it therefore has the potential to mitigate the pipeline vibrations induced by various sources bi and hao 2016b carried out numerical simulations to investigate the effectiveness of using this concept to mitigate seismic induced vibrations of subesea pipeline with free spans numerical results show that both the vibrations of the inner and outer pipes can be significantly reduced by using this method very recently matin nikoo et al 2017 used this design concept for viv control and analytical studies were carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method by simplifying the system as a two degree of freedom 2 dof system analytical results demonstrate that the modified pip system can significantly suppress the viv of offshore cylindrical structures this paper is an extension of the recent work carried out by the authors matin nikoo et al 2017 in this paper a two way coupled fluid structure interaction fsi framework is developed and detailed three dimensional 3d numerical simulations are carried out to further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system for viv control compared to the analytical study the fluid pipe interaction can be more realistically simulated and the 3d vortices around the cylinder can be readily captured the paper is organized as follows the two way fluid structure interaction fsi method and the governing equations of the fluid and structure are presented in section 2 in section 3 viv response of a single pipe is modelled and validated by a series of experimental and numerical benchmark data in the literature the validated model is then extended to the optimized pip system in section 4 and the effectiveness of the proposed method to control flow induced oscillations is investigated in section 5 and finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 method of solution computational approach and governing equations a set of non dimensional parameters will be used in the analysis of a single cylinder and pip system subjected to viv for readers easy reference these parameters are defined in table 1 in which the mass ratio m is defined as the ratio of the cylinder mass m to the displaced mass of the fluid with kinematic viscosity of v ρ denotes the density of the fluid d the cylinder diameter and l the span wise cylinder length u stands for the fluid flow velocity f and f n are the oscillation and natural frequency of the cylinder in the air respectively f s is the strouhal frequency and y m a x is the maximum transverse displacement of the cylinder m i m o and ω i ω o are the mass and vibrating frequencies of the inner and outer pipes respectively 2 1 two way fluid structure interaction fsi viv phenomenon is a multi physics problem where the responses of the structure and flow field are both time dependent and they interact with each other i e it is in essence a fluid structure interaction fsi problem in this study a coupled fluid structure model is developed through a two way algorithm by coupling the ansys mechanical and fluent finite volume solvers together ansys 2016 in this algorithm in each time step the fluid equations section 2 2 2 are solved and the hydrodynamic loads are transferred to the mechanical model and applied as the input loads on the cylinder within the same time step the structural dynamics equation section 2 3 is then solved and the calculated cylinder motion is transferred back to the fluid which subsequently affects the mesh grids of the fluid to calculate the displacements of the fluid mesh the smoothing dynamic grid motion is used based on the diffusion equation zhao and cheng 2011 1 γ u 0 where is the differential operator u denotes the mesh displacement velocity and γ is the diffusion coefficient which describes how the boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the deforming mesh with a constant γ boundary motion diffuses uniformly throughout the grids domain while with a non uniform coefficient nodes with high diffusivity tend to move together in the present study a non uniform diffusion coefficient is adopted as a function of the normalized cell volume size v as follows 2 γ 1 v α in which α is the diffusion parameter a value between the range of 0 and 2 has been shown to be practical han et al 2015 and it is set as 1 5 in the present study with this value the grids in the immediate vicinity of the cylinder wall moves rigidly with the cylinder i e the uniformity of the near wall mesh resolution is preserved and the outermost grids are kept fixed mesh deformation takes place in the region in between this area is given sufficient space so that fair mesh quality can be ensured even in the case with large viv amplitude 2 2 fluid flow model 2 2 1 turbulent and sub grid scale sgs models various numerical approaches such as the direct numerical simulation dns large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods have been proposed to simulate the fluid field for the viv problem al jamal and dalton 2004 in the dns technique navier stokes equations with entire range of spatial and temporal properties of the turbulence are directly solved without any approximation from the smallest energy dissipative scales to the largest kinetic energy carrying scales dns solution requires extremely fine fully 3d meshes and therefore enormous amount of computational time to save computing resources turbulent fluctuations of flow quantities are not solved in the rans approach this approach is therefore incapable of accurately predicting the boundary layer transition to turbulence les method has received extensive attention recently zhiyin 2015 the rationale behind the les technique is a separation between the large and small scales turbulence motions in this method large scale turbulence motions of the flow containing most of the kinetic energy momentum and scalar transport are solved explicitly whereas the effect of the small scales is modelled using a sub grid scale sgs model thus les has the potential of being more accurate than rans simulations catalano et al 2003 but less time consuming than the dns approach in this study les method is used to model the turbulent flow around the cylinder to get a full solution for les method various sgs models e g the conventional algebraic smagorinsky and dynamic smagorinskly lilly models have been proposed sagaut 2006 previous studies e g breuer 1998 2000 kim et al 2015 revealed that the dynamic smagorinskly lilly model yields better solution the dynamic smagorinsky lilly model is therefore used to model the sub scale turbulent flow in the present study 2 2 2 governing equations some previous studies e g zhao et al 2014 indicated that the 2d navier stokes equations are not able to accurately predict the viv in the turbulent chaotic flow regime to more realistically simulate the viv responses a detailed 3d model is adopted in the present study and the 3d turbulent fluid flow around the cylinder is modelled by solving the incompressible navier stokes equations in conjunction with the les technique and dynamic smigorinsky lilly sgs model applying the filtering process to the incompressible navier stokes using the space dependent volume filter function g g x δ gives the continuity and filtered momentum equations sagaut 2006 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i where δ denotes the grid filter width and it is often taken as the cube root of the grid cell volume i e δ δ i δ j δ k 3 the scale that is larger than δ is retained in the flow and will be solved directly whereas the effects of scale smaller than δ will be modelled by sgs u i and u j i j 1 2 3 denote the filtered velocity components in the streamwise x crossflow y and spanwise z directions respectively p is the filtered pressure and υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the term u i u j can be written as follows 5 u i u j τ i j u i u j where τ i j represents the non resolvable sgs stress which needs to be approximated to represent the effect of the unresolved sgs motion on the resolved grid scale motion therefore eq 4 becomes 6 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i τ i j x j by adopting a turbulent eddy viscosity ν t and boussinesq s approximations sgs stress can be related to the resolved large scale strain rate tensor s i j 7 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 ν t s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in which δ i j denotes the kronecker delta δ i j 1 if i j and δ i j 0 when i j it is to ensure that normal stresses are taken as isotropic unlike the rans modelling where the eddy viscosity represents all turbulent scales the sgs viscosity ν t only represents the small scales in the conventional smagorinsky model the sgs viscosity can be expressed as sagaut 2006 8 ν t c s δ 2 s where s denotes the norm of the strain rate tensor and c s is the smagorinsky constant which normally varies between 0 065 and 0 2 however it should be noted that the smagorinsky coefficient is not a universal constant and this may affect the accuracy of the results sagaut 2006 moreover this model requires a damping function next to the solid wall boundary conditions because fluid viscosity dominates the turbulence as the wall is approached atluri et al 2009 in order to overcome these drawbacks dynamic smagorinsky lilly method was introduced in this method this coefficient is no longer a constant value but is a dynamic local and time dependent variable determined based on the energy content of the smallest resolved scale more detailed information regarding the calculation of the dynamic smagorinsky constant c s can be found in sagaut 2006 2 2 3 computational fluid domain and boundary conditions fig 1 a shows an elastically mounted rigid circular cylinder in a steady flow fluid domain dimension plays a critical role in the accuracy of viv response calculation especially for the case of a moving cylinder to solve the governing equations presented in section 2 2 2 a multi block rectangular domain as illustrated in fig 1 b c and d is adopted in the present study a blockage factor b 2 5 defined as the ratio of the cylinder diameter d to the cross flow dimension of domain is considered prasanth and mittal 2008 a value of l d 5 is adopted for the span wise length of the fluid domain law and jaiman 2017 yeon et al 2016 the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at 20 d and 30 d respectively from the center of the cylinder law and jaiman 2017 zhao et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 b a fine mesh is adopted for an annular sub domain close to the cylinder while larger meshes are generated when they are far away from the cylinder the circular domain surrounding the cylinder fig 1 c is discretised with uniformly spaced grids in the azimuthal coordinate and exponentially stretched in the radial direction the remaining rectangular blocks are meshed with hexahedral elements as shown in fig 1 d a steady uniform flow with a freestream velocity of u u is specified at the inflow boundary in the positive x direction transverse and span wise velocity components are set as zero at the inlet boundary v w 0 for the top bottom and two lateral boundaries of the domain symmetry free slip plane conditions are applied i e the velocity component perpendicular to the boundary is zero the zero gradient condition for velocity is applied at the outlet boundary where the reference pressure is assigned to zero on the test cylinder smooth surface non slip wall condition is specified i e the fluid velocity on this surface is the same with the cylinder s displacement speed 2 3 structural dynamics model in the developed fsi model the cylinder is suspended by the body ground type springs at the two span wise boundary surfaces remote displacement constraints are assigned for these two boundaries which allows cylinder to vibrate only in the cross flow direction y it should be noted that this simplification ignores the flow induced in line oscillations of the cylinder this is a reasonable simplification since as indicated by many researchers e g bearman 1984 the in line oscillations are not excited noticeably when the reynolds number r e is smaller than 1200 in the present study a r e 1000 is adopted in the numerical simulation as will be discussed in section 3 1 this simplification is actually widely adopted by many other researchers e g zhang et al 2017a zhao et al 2014 outer surface of the cylinder is set to be a fsi interface on which required model quantities can transfer during the transient analysis fig 2 shows the generated computational mesh grids for the single pipe to achieve a fully mapped data transfer between two components the solid part cylinder is discretised by the same mesh grids on the fluid solid interface to encourage the maximum amplitude oscillations the structural damping coefficient is assumed as zero zhang et al 2017a zhao et al 2014 the cross flow equation of motion of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder subjected to viv can be expressed as follows 9 m y c y k y f l t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrix respectively y is the cross flow displacement vector and the over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time t f l t represents the total lift force vector in the cross flow direction of the cylinder and can be calculated by integrating the pressure and wall shear forces over the whole cylinder surface 3 fsi model of a single cylinder to verify of the developed fsi model results from previous experiments and 3 d numerical models for a single cylinder are adopted as benchmarks in the present study the numerical results calculated based on the developed fsi model are compared with these benchmark results 3 1 simulation setup in the present study the mass ratio m in table 1 is assumed as 2 as adopted in many previous studies gsell et al 2016 zhao and cheng 2014 a moderate reynolds number r e 1000 is selected in the numerical simulation this value is chosen because i it allows numerical simulations to be conducted at affordable computational time without compromising the accuracy of the results while the three dimensionality of the turbulent fluid flow can develop sufficiently lei et al 2001 and ii this value is in the range of subcritical reynolds numbers 300 r e 1 5 10 5 where the wake flow is in the turbulent regime in which nearly all real life offshore and marine structures lie sumer 2006 semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple is used to derive the pressure velocity coupling on mesh grids and the equation for pressure correction tu et al 2012 a second order central differencing interpolation scheme is used for the convection term this scheme provides improved accuracy for les the time step of all simulations is 0 02 s 8 coupling steps with 30 fluent sub iterations for each coupling step are used to achieve the accurate convergence of the results 3 2 mesh dependency study in order to ensure that the numerical results are independent of the adopted mesh size mesh convergence tests are carried out four different meshes as tabulated in table 2 are investigated in this table the number of division nod stands for the number of nodes seeding on each edge of the domain see fig 1 b figs 3 and 4 show the comparisons of the normalized amplitude time history and associated spectra viv responses of the cylinder under the reduced velocity of u 4 2 with different mesh sizes the calculated strouhal number s t root mean square lift coefficient c l r m s and normalized amplitude a are also tabulated in table 2 it can be seen that coarse 1 and coarse 2 meshes lead to obvious differences in the results while the medium mesh size can result in similar results compared to the dense mesh which means the results obtained from the medium mesh size are converged the medium mesh size is therefore adopted in the numerical simulations in the present study 3 3 model validation to validate the developed numerical model the obtained results are compared with previous experimental and 3 d numerical benchmark measurements results as mentioned above table 3 summarizes the adopted previous studies and the corresponding parameters it is commonly known that three typical amplitude response branches are associated with the viv responses of an elastically mounted cylinder with low mass ratio williamson and govardhan 2004 for the low normalized velocities there exists an initial branch where two single vortices shed per cycle 2s vortex shedding mode and the mean forces and cylinder response are in phase for the intermediate and large normalized velocities there is an upper and a lower branch associated with two pairs of vortices shed per cycle 2p vortex shedding mode fig 5 shows the normalized amplitude and frequency responses at different reduced velocities obtained in the present study and from the literature for fair comparison some efforts are made to convert the reduced velocities based on the natural frequency in the water to those based on the structural natural frequency in the air as adopted by zhao et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 a the maximum normalized amplitude a m a x in the upper branch u around 4 to 6 obtained from the current numerical model 0 79 is slightly lower than the experimental data see a in table 3 this is mainly because of the differences in the mass ratios and reynolds numbers and less significantly the difference in the end conditions of the experimental tests al jamal and dalton 2004 khalak and williamson 1999 lucor et al 2005 and zhao et al 2014 carried out 3 d numerical simulations with the same mass ratio and reynolds number as adopted in the present study fig 5 a and table 3 show that their results 0 78 and 0 72 respectively are in good agreements with that obtained in the present study for the results in the lower branch u 7 the normalized amplitude responses obtained from the experimental studies and numerical simulations show some fluctuations which indicates that vortex induced motions of the bluff body is a highly nonlinear resonant response and different experimental set ups and numerical assumptions can lead to slightly different results fig 5 b shows the normalized frequency responses f with respect to different reduced velocities as shown the results obtained from the present study match well with other studies to further check the accuracy of the fsi model the phase relation between the normalized response a and the lift coefficient c l are studied as shown in fig 6 a at the initial branch with normalized velocity u 3 1 2s wake mode with two dominant single vortices shed alternately per cycle and the cylinder vibration is in phase with the lift coefficient fig 6 b shows that when the reduced velocity reaches u 4 9 in the upper branch the phase relation between vibration and lift coefficient remains the same while the wake mode switches to 2p vortex pattern consisting of two pairs of vortices shed from two sides of the cylinder per cycle as the reduced velocity continues to increase the viv responses of the body transits into the lower branch at this branch fig 6 c the wake mode remains 2p a phase lag between the cross flow displacement and lift coefficient is however obtained these viv response characteristics captured in the present study are in consistent with previous experimental measurements khalak and williamson 1997 1999 which again reflects the accuracy of the fsi model fig 6 also shows that the wake vortex shedding along the span wise of the cylinder are different this variation cannot be captured by the commonly used 2 d models which implies the importance of 3 d numerical modelling for the bluff body fluid dynamics 4 modified pip system the authors proposed the concept of using modified pip system to control viv of offshore cylindrical components and analytical studies were carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method matin nikoo et al 2017 in the modified pip system the hard polymeric centralizers are replaced by various possible connections such as the polyurethane foam puf viscoelastic material or rotational friction hinge device with spring rfhds bi and hao 2016a b by carefully selecting the parameters of these connection devices optimization the system can then be simplified as a structure tmd system and has the potential for viv suppression it should be noted that the mass ratio between the inner and outer pipes in the revised pip system is normally much larger e g it reached 85 3 in bi and hao 2016b than that in the conventional tmd system generally 1 to a few percent the modified pip system can be regarded as a non conventional tmd system for a non conventional tmd system its effectiveness for vibration control becomes less sensitive to the optimized parameters i e the system is still effective for viv suppression though the parameters of the connecting devices stiffness and damping vary obviously from the optimized values this property makes the selection of connecting devices easy in the analytical study matin nikoo et al 2017 the fluid induced vibration of a single pipe fig 7 a was firstly investigated and the equation of motion of the system was solved and validated by the experimental data the single pipe system was then extended to the revised pip system by keeping the total masses of the pip system and single pipe the same the dynamic behavior of the pip system under the excitation of vortex shedding was then simplified as a two degree of freedom 2dof system two connections were considered by matin nikoo et al 2017 the first connection was that the inner and outer pipes are rigidly connected fig 7 b i e a rigid spring with an infinite stiffness is adopted to connect the inner and outer pipes with this connection the two pipes can vibrate together this connection can approximately simulate the behavior of the conventional pip system since in the conventional pip system only a very small gap normally 5 mm is reserved between the centralizer and the external pipe and the two pipes can almost vibrate together bi and hao 2016b in the second scenario the optimized connecting devices were used and they were represented by the optimized springs and dashpots fig 7 c matin nikoo et al 2017 derived the formulas for the optimized parameters 10 f t m d o p t 1 09 0 48 μ 0 06 ζ o 11 ζ i o p t 0 1 l n μ 0 375 in which f t m d o p t is the optimal frequency ratio ζ i o p t is the optimized damping ratio μ m i m o is the mass ratio between the inner pipe and outer pipe and ζ o is the damping ratio of the main system the external pipe which is assumed as zero in the present study as mentioned above the optimal stiffness k o p t and damping coefficient c o p t in fig 7 c therefore can be calculated as 12 k o p t f t m d o p t 2 μ k o 13 c o p t 2 ζ i o p t k o p t m i in the present study the same concept as adopted by matin nikoo et al 2017 is used again i e the single pipe is split into two pipes to make the total masses of the two systems the same and the diameter of the inner pipe is assumed as half of the outer pipe based on a real project in the north sea logstor 1997 as shown in fig 7 fig 8 shows the numerical model of the pip system the outer pipe is modelled exactly the same as that of the single pipe as discussed in section 2 3 the inner pipe is meshed with the same numbers of elements in the circumferential and span wise directions as the outer pipe combin14 elements are used to model the springs and dashpots that connect the inner and outer pipes this element is a uniaxial tension compression element with up to three degrees of freedom at each node and the spring and damping capability of the element can realistically simulate the proposed connection between the inner and outer pipes no mass bending or torsion is considered for these spring damper elements and only the cross flow direction y is set to free the corresponding parameters k o p t and c o p t are calculated based on eq 12 and 13 it should be noted that the inner pipe and outer pipe may contact with each when the relative displacement between the inner and outer pipes is larger than the annulus size to consider the possible contact in the numerical simulation a pair based contact approach is used between the outer surface of the inner pipe and the inner surface of the outer pipe in this method 3d contact elements conta174 are associated with the 3d target segment elements targe170 contact occurs when the contact elements penetrate the associated target surface 5 results and discussion it is widely recognized that the oscillating amplitudes of a cylinder under viv are significant within a certain reduced velocity range this range is normally defined as the upper branch or the synchronization region as shown in fig 5 a this reduced velocity range is about from 4 to 7 in this study in the present study numerical simulations are only carried out near the synchronization region and in particular four reduced velocities with u 3 7 4 2 4 9 and 6 8 are considered the responses of the revised pip system under viv are calculated for comparison the corresponding results for the single pipe are also calculated it should be noted that with the conventional pip design the inner and outer pipes almost vibrate together bi and hao 2016b which means the responses of the single pipe is almost the same as the conventional pip system in the numerical simulation only the transverse motion is considered the mass ratio between the inner pipe and outer pipe is assumed as 0 5 figures 9 and 10 compare the normalized oscillation displacements and the associated power spectral densities psds of the conventional fig 7 b and optimized pip systems fig 7 c the dark curves are the results obtained from the conventional pip model and the red curves are from the modified pip system the results show that the proposed concept is quite effective for the viv suppression the normalized displacements and corresponding psds obtained from the optimized pip are evidently smaller than those obtained from the conventional pip system two main reasons result in this effect i the vortex formation at the wake of the primary cylinder is disorganized through the alteration of the rigid body motion of the outer pipe and i i partial amount of input energy is transferred from the main structure the outer pipe to the tunned absorber the inner pipe and further dissipated by the inner pipe the tmd effect fig 9 also shows that the system seems not quite effective at the beginning this is because at the initial stage of the transient analysis the oscillating responses of the whole system are not fully developed the relative displacement between the inner and outer pipes is therefore small and the function of the tmd cannot be fully developed to more clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed system table 4 summarizes the root mean square rms displacements of the traditional and optimized pip systems during the whole calculation time the corresponding reduction ratios are also shown in the table it can be seen that the reduction is obvious when u 3 7 4 2 and 4 9 with the maximum reduction ratio reaching 56 at u 3 7 when u 6 8 the effectiveness is decreased as compared to the first three reduced velocities as shown in table 4 the reduction ratio of the displacement response at this reduced velocity u 6 8 is 21 this is because as shown in fig 9 the vibration of the system is the smallest when u 6 8 and the tmd function is less developed compared to the first three cases which in turn results in the smallest reduction ratio however it should be noted that these results are obtained during the whole calculation time if the reduction ratio is considered from the more evident development of the tmd function t 30 in the case of u 6 8 the reduction ratio reaches 41 for this case one the other hand the results also indicate that it does not necessarily mean the largest reduction ratio can be achieved when the vibration is the most violent as shown in the table the largest amplitude occurs when u 4 2 0 37 while the reduction ratio is the smallest 47 in these three cases this is mainly due to the fact that viv responses of offshore cylindrical components with low mass ratio depend highly on the frequency of vortex shedding the oscillating frequency of the cylinder and the added mass all these vary in a rather non linear fashion as mentioned in section 4 the inner and outer pipes may contact with each other if the vibration of the system is too violent to address this issue the normalized relative displacements between the outer and inner pipes a r e l a t i v e are calculated and shown in fig 11 for comparison the normalized annulus size 0 25 is also plotted in this figure by the red dash lines the figure clearly shows that the inner pipe can oscillate freely in the outer pipe and no contact occurs in the present study it should be noted that when contacts occurs the control effectiveness can be slightly decreased bi and hao 2016b due to the fact that the tmd function cannot be fully developed to examine the influence of contact on the control effectiveness is an interesting topic but it is out of the scope of the present study in the design of controlling devices for viv suppression it is desirable to reduce the amplitude of structural vibrations by having low lift and drag coefficients dhanak and xiros 2016 fig 12 plots the lift and drag coefficients of the conventional and modified pip systems at the reduced velocities of u 3 7 and 4 2 it can be seen that the optimized pip system can obviously diminish the lift and drag coefficients at the wall of the structures these results again clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for viv suppression fig 12 b and d also show that the drag coefficients of c d 1 can be obtained in the numerical simulations this is because of the beating phenomenon as reported by some other researchers e g kim et al 2014 mittal 2013 as discussed in section 3 3 the phase relationships between the lift force and vibration amplitude are different in the three branches initial upper and lower branches for a single cylinder for the pip system no such investigation has been reported fig 13 shows the phase difference between the lift force coefficient and outer pipe displacement it can be seen from fig 13 a that similar to the single pipe no phase difference is obtained between the displacement and lift force when u 3 7 the initial state of upper branch when u 4 9 the phase relations between the single pipe and pip system however becomes different as shown in fig 6 b no obvious phase difference can be obtained in the single pipe case however in the pip system obvious phase differences are developed as shown in fig 13 c the results indicate that the pip system can alter the phase relationships between the lift force and vibration amplitude compared to the single pipe system especially in higher reduced velocity range this then further alters the structural responses the 3 d vortices around the cylinder can be captured by using the 3 d numerical model developed in the present study fig 14 shows the 3 d wake turbulence structures around the external pipe when u 4 2 and the q iso surfaces obtained based on the q criterion hunt et al 1988 are plotted this criterion is suitable for the identification of vortex in the incompressible fluid zhang et al 2017b it can be seen that the wave flow is totally three dimensional for both systems and the application of the pip can alter the wake vortices street compared to the single pipe at the initial stage e g for t 16 2 there is no significant difference between the wake topology of the conventional and optimized pip systems when time increases e g for t 32 4 and 53 7 the wake patterns of the two systems however vary significantly this is because the tmd effect is not developed at the initial stage while it is activated when time goes by as discussed above which further changes the pipe responses and the vortices street to further identify how pip system alters the mechanism of vortex shedding formation and the vibration of the cylinder the 2d wake topology formation and the transverse vibration of the conventional and optimized pip systems at the middle surface z 2 5 d are plotted in fig 15 it can be seen that the pip system can prevent the development of vortex shedding and cause a reduction in the width of the wake vortices street compared to the conventional pip system which has a direct influence on the drag force as indicated by law and jaiman 2017 and further suppresses the undesired vibrations of the cylinder 6 conclusion this paper carries out 3 d numerical simulations on the effectiveness of using pip system for viv suppression of offshore cylindrical components a coupled cfd fsi framework is developed by coupling the ansys mechanical and fluent finite volume solvers the numerical model is firstly validated by the previous experimental and numerical results on a single cylinder the validated model is then extended to the pip system numerical results reveal that viv can be significantly suppressed by using the optimized pip system the reduction is most evident in the upper reduced velocity range where the vibration of the system is most violent the effectiveness is slightly decreased in the lower branch range moreover comparing to the conventional pip system the optimized pip system can obviously change the wave vortices formation and alter the phase lag between the lift force and vibration amplitude acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the

23694,pipe in pipe pip systems have been increasingly used in offshore applications because of their favourable thermal insulation capacity very recently the conventional pip system was slightly revised by using carefully designed springs and dashpots to connect the inner and outer pipes this revised pip system can be considered as a structure tuned mass damper tmd system it therefore has the potential to mitigate the offshore structural vibrations induced by various sources such as earthquake excitation and or vortex shedding this paper carries out three dimensional 3d numerical simulations to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method the cross flow oscillation of the conventional and optimized pip systems are numerically investigated by developing a two way coupled fluid structure interaction fsi framework for computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis the developed fsi model is validated with the available experimental and numerical benchmark data on a single cylinder this validated model is then extended to the pip system to study its efficiency for vortex induced vibration viv suppression numerical results show that the optimized pip system can noticeably reduce viv keywords pip system viv suppression tmd fsi cfd 1 introduction when a circular cylinder is placed in a fluid flow vortex shedding may result in vibrations to the cylinder and this is known as the vortex induced vibration viv viv has been widely recognized as the cause of the damage of many engineering structures such as subsea pipelines marine risers anchoring lines spar buoys and bridge cables extensive research works have been conducted to address viv due to its significance bearman 2011 oruç 2017 to mitigate the adverse effects of viv several vibration control techniques have been proposed these techniques can be broadly divided into two subgroups the passive and active control methods active control requires external power to operate which imposes challenges in real engineering practices especially in the offshore environment where providing complex actuators as well as excessive power would be problematic and costly passive control devices on the other hand require no external power are relatively less expensive and easier to install hence for marine structures various passive control techniques have been widely introduced to suppress viv rashidi et al 2016 these devices include for example the helical strake holland et al 2017 senga and larsen 2017 fairing assi et al 2014 yu et al 2015 dart like overlay zhu et al 2016 splitter plates and c shaped foil law and jaiman 2017 soumya and prakash 2017 controlling rods song et al 2017 attached plate ozkan et al 2017 screen shroud cicolin and assi 2017 and surface roughness control src techniques bernitsas and raghavan 2014 however it should be noted that although some of these devices have been applied in engineering practices certain drawbacks exist which may considerably affect their performances especially when they are located in the deep and ultra deep waters for example helical strake and splitter plates usually impose an additional hydrodynamic drag force to the structure shrouds and axial slats are expensive to manufacture not easy to install susceptible to marine growth and prone to storm damage it is therefore important to develop more efficient cost effective and practical passive control devices to effectively control viv of offshore cylindrical structures oruç 2017 pipe in pipe pip systems are becoming more and more widely used especially in the deep and ultra deep waters karampour et al 2017 a conventional pip system is comprised of an internal insulated pipe the product pipe and an outer pipe the sleeve pipe the inner pipe is used to carry the product flow and the outer pipe provides mechanical protection against the high external hydrostatic pressure centralizers normally made of hard polymeric rings are clamped on the inner pipe with certain spacing to ensure the concentric positions of the two pipes bai and bai 2012 instead of using the hard polymeric centralizers bi and hao 2016b proposed a modified system by using specially designed connecting devices between the inner and outer pipes the modified pip system then forms a structure tuned mass damper tmd system with the outer pipe acting as the primary structure and the inner pipe performing as the tmd it therefore has the potential to mitigate the pipeline vibrations induced by various sources bi and hao 2016b carried out numerical simulations to investigate the effectiveness of using this concept to mitigate seismic induced vibrations of subesea pipeline with free spans numerical results show that both the vibrations of the inner and outer pipes can be significantly reduced by using this method very recently matin nikoo et al 2017 used this design concept for viv control and analytical studies were carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method by simplifying the system as a two degree of freedom 2 dof system analytical results demonstrate that the modified pip system can significantly suppress the viv of offshore cylindrical structures this paper is an extension of the recent work carried out by the authors matin nikoo et al 2017 in this paper a two way coupled fluid structure interaction fsi framework is developed and detailed three dimensional 3d numerical simulations are carried out to further investigate the effectiveness of the proposed system for viv control compared to the analytical study the fluid pipe interaction can be more realistically simulated and the 3d vortices around the cylinder can be readily captured the paper is organized as follows the two way fluid structure interaction fsi method and the governing equations of the fluid and structure are presented in section 2 in section 3 viv response of a single pipe is modelled and validated by a series of experimental and numerical benchmark data in the literature the validated model is then extended to the optimized pip system in section 4 and the effectiveness of the proposed method to control flow induced oscillations is investigated in section 5 and finally some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 method of solution computational approach and governing equations a set of non dimensional parameters will be used in the analysis of a single cylinder and pip system subjected to viv for readers easy reference these parameters are defined in table 1 in which the mass ratio m is defined as the ratio of the cylinder mass m to the displaced mass of the fluid with kinematic viscosity of v ρ denotes the density of the fluid d the cylinder diameter and l the span wise cylinder length u stands for the fluid flow velocity f and f n are the oscillation and natural frequency of the cylinder in the air respectively f s is the strouhal frequency and y m a x is the maximum transverse displacement of the cylinder m i m o and ω i ω o are the mass and vibrating frequencies of the inner and outer pipes respectively 2 1 two way fluid structure interaction fsi viv phenomenon is a multi physics problem where the responses of the structure and flow field are both time dependent and they interact with each other i e it is in essence a fluid structure interaction fsi problem in this study a coupled fluid structure model is developed through a two way algorithm by coupling the ansys mechanical and fluent finite volume solvers together ansys 2016 in this algorithm in each time step the fluid equations section 2 2 2 are solved and the hydrodynamic loads are transferred to the mechanical model and applied as the input loads on the cylinder within the same time step the structural dynamics equation section 2 3 is then solved and the calculated cylinder motion is transferred back to the fluid which subsequently affects the mesh grids of the fluid to calculate the displacements of the fluid mesh the smoothing dynamic grid motion is used based on the diffusion equation zhao and cheng 2011 1 γ u 0 where is the differential operator u denotes the mesh displacement velocity and γ is the diffusion coefficient which describes how the boundary motion diffuses into the interior of the deforming mesh with a constant γ boundary motion diffuses uniformly throughout the grids domain while with a non uniform coefficient nodes with high diffusivity tend to move together in the present study a non uniform diffusion coefficient is adopted as a function of the normalized cell volume size v as follows 2 γ 1 v α in which α is the diffusion parameter a value between the range of 0 and 2 has been shown to be practical han et al 2015 and it is set as 1 5 in the present study with this value the grids in the immediate vicinity of the cylinder wall moves rigidly with the cylinder i e the uniformity of the near wall mesh resolution is preserved and the outermost grids are kept fixed mesh deformation takes place in the region in between this area is given sufficient space so that fair mesh quality can be ensured even in the case with large viv amplitude 2 2 fluid flow model 2 2 1 turbulent and sub grid scale sgs models various numerical approaches such as the direct numerical simulation dns large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods have been proposed to simulate the fluid field for the viv problem al jamal and dalton 2004 in the dns technique navier stokes equations with entire range of spatial and temporal properties of the turbulence are directly solved without any approximation from the smallest energy dissipative scales to the largest kinetic energy carrying scales dns solution requires extremely fine fully 3d meshes and therefore enormous amount of computational time to save computing resources turbulent fluctuations of flow quantities are not solved in the rans approach this approach is therefore incapable of accurately predicting the boundary layer transition to turbulence les method has received extensive attention recently zhiyin 2015 the rationale behind the les technique is a separation between the large and small scales turbulence motions in this method large scale turbulence motions of the flow containing most of the kinetic energy momentum and scalar transport are solved explicitly whereas the effect of the small scales is modelled using a sub grid scale sgs model thus les has the potential of being more accurate than rans simulations catalano et al 2003 but less time consuming than the dns approach in this study les method is used to model the turbulent flow around the cylinder to get a full solution for les method various sgs models e g the conventional algebraic smagorinsky and dynamic smagorinskly lilly models have been proposed sagaut 2006 previous studies e g breuer 1998 2000 kim et al 2015 revealed that the dynamic smagorinskly lilly model yields better solution the dynamic smagorinsky lilly model is therefore used to model the sub scale turbulent flow in the present study 2 2 2 governing equations some previous studies e g zhao et al 2014 indicated that the 2d navier stokes equations are not able to accurately predict the viv in the turbulent chaotic flow regime to more realistically simulate the viv responses a detailed 3d model is adopted in the present study and the 3d turbulent fluid flow around the cylinder is modelled by solving the incompressible navier stokes equations in conjunction with the les technique and dynamic smigorinsky lilly sgs model applying the filtering process to the incompressible navier stokes using the space dependent volume filter function g g x δ gives the continuity and filtered momentum equations sagaut 2006 3 u i x i 0 4 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i where δ denotes the grid filter width and it is often taken as the cube root of the grid cell volume i e δ δ i δ j δ k 3 the scale that is larger than δ is retained in the flow and will be solved directly whereas the effects of scale smaller than δ will be modelled by sgs u i and u j i j 1 2 3 denote the filtered velocity components in the streamwise x crossflow y and spanwise z directions respectively p is the filtered pressure and υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the term u i u j can be written as follows 5 u i u j τ i j u i u j where τ i j represents the non resolvable sgs stress which needs to be approximated to represent the effect of the unresolved sgs motion on the resolved grid scale motion therefore eq 4 becomes 6 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i τ i j x j by adopting a turbulent eddy viscosity ν t and boussinesq s approximations sgs stress can be related to the resolved large scale strain rate tensor s i j 7 τ i j 1 3 δ i j τ k k 2 ν t s i j s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i in which δ i j denotes the kronecker delta δ i j 1 if i j and δ i j 0 when i j it is to ensure that normal stresses are taken as isotropic unlike the rans modelling where the eddy viscosity represents all turbulent scales the sgs viscosity ν t only represents the small scales in the conventional smagorinsky model the sgs viscosity can be expressed as sagaut 2006 8 ν t c s δ 2 s where s denotes the norm of the strain rate tensor and c s is the smagorinsky constant which normally varies between 0 065 and 0 2 however it should be noted that the smagorinsky coefficient is not a universal constant and this may affect the accuracy of the results sagaut 2006 moreover this model requires a damping function next to the solid wall boundary conditions because fluid viscosity dominates the turbulence as the wall is approached atluri et al 2009 in order to overcome these drawbacks dynamic smagorinsky lilly method was introduced in this method this coefficient is no longer a constant value but is a dynamic local and time dependent variable determined based on the energy content of the smallest resolved scale more detailed information regarding the calculation of the dynamic smagorinsky constant c s can be found in sagaut 2006 2 2 3 computational fluid domain and boundary conditions fig 1 a shows an elastically mounted rigid circular cylinder in a steady flow fluid domain dimension plays a critical role in the accuracy of viv response calculation especially for the case of a moving cylinder to solve the governing equations presented in section 2 2 2 a multi block rectangular domain as illustrated in fig 1 b c and d is adopted in the present study a blockage factor b 2 5 defined as the ratio of the cylinder diameter d to the cross flow dimension of domain is considered prasanth and mittal 2008 a value of l d 5 is adopted for the span wise length of the fluid domain law and jaiman 2017 yeon et al 2016 the upstream and downstream boundaries are located at 20 d and 30 d respectively from the center of the cylinder law and jaiman 2017 zhao et al 2014 as shown in fig 1 b a fine mesh is adopted for an annular sub domain close to the cylinder while larger meshes are generated when they are far away from the cylinder the circular domain surrounding the cylinder fig 1 c is discretised with uniformly spaced grids in the azimuthal coordinate and exponentially stretched in the radial direction the remaining rectangular blocks are meshed with hexahedral elements as shown in fig 1 d a steady uniform flow with a freestream velocity of u u is specified at the inflow boundary in the positive x direction transverse and span wise velocity components are set as zero at the inlet boundary v w 0 for the top bottom and two lateral boundaries of the domain symmetry free slip plane conditions are applied i e the velocity component perpendicular to the boundary is zero the zero gradient condition for velocity is applied at the outlet boundary where the reference pressure is assigned to zero on the test cylinder smooth surface non slip wall condition is specified i e the fluid velocity on this surface is the same with the cylinder s displacement speed 2 3 structural dynamics model in the developed fsi model the cylinder is suspended by the body ground type springs at the two span wise boundary surfaces remote displacement constraints are assigned for these two boundaries which allows cylinder to vibrate only in the cross flow direction y it should be noted that this simplification ignores the flow induced in line oscillations of the cylinder this is a reasonable simplification since as indicated by many researchers e g bearman 1984 the in line oscillations are not excited noticeably when the reynolds number r e is smaller than 1200 in the present study a r e 1000 is adopted in the numerical simulation as will be discussed in section 3 1 this simplification is actually widely adopted by many other researchers e g zhang et al 2017a zhao et al 2014 outer surface of the cylinder is set to be a fsi interface on which required model quantities can transfer during the transient analysis fig 2 shows the generated computational mesh grids for the single pipe to achieve a fully mapped data transfer between two components the solid part cylinder is discretised by the same mesh grids on the fluid solid interface to encourage the maximum amplitude oscillations the structural damping coefficient is assumed as zero zhang et al 2017a zhao et al 2014 the cross flow equation of motion of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder subjected to viv can be expressed as follows 9 m y c y k y f l t where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrix respectively y is the cross flow displacement vector and the over dot denotes differentiation with respect to time t f l t represents the total lift force vector in the cross flow direction of the cylinder and can be calculated by integrating the pressure and wall shear forces over the whole cylinder surface 3 fsi model of a single cylinder to verify of the developed fsi model results from previous experiments and 3 d numerical models for a single cylinder are adopted as benchmarks in the present study the numerical results calculated based on the developed fsi model are compared with these benchmark results 3 1 simulation setup in the present study the mass ratio m in table 1 is assumed as 2 as adopted in many previous studies gsell et al 2016 zhao and cheng 2014 a moderate reynolds number r e 1000 is selected in the numerical simulation this value is chosen because i it allows numerical simulations to be conducted at affordable computational time without compromising the accuracy of the results while the three dimensionality of the turbulent fluid flow can develop sufficiently lei et al 2001 and ii this value is in the range of subcritical reynolds numbers 300 r e 1 5 10 5 where the wake flow is in the turbulent regime in which nearly all real life offshore and marine structures lie sumer 2006 semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple is used to derive the pressure velocity coupling on mesh grids and the equation for pressure correction tu et al 2012 a second order central differencing interpolation scheme is used for the convection term this scheme provides improved accuracy for les the time step of all simulations is 0 02 s 8 coupling steps with 30 fluent sub iterations for each coupling step are used to achieve the accurate convergence of the results 3 2 mesh dependency study in order to ensure that the numerical results are independent of the adopted mesh size mesh convergence tests are carried out four different meshes as tabulated in table 2 are investigated in this table the number of division nod stands for the number of nodes seeding on each edge of the domain see fig 1 b figs 3 and 4 show the comparisons of the normalized amplitude time history and associated spectra viv responses of the cylinder under the reduced velocity of u 4 2 with different mesh sizes the calculated strouhal number s t root mean square lift coefficient c l r m s and normalized amplitude a are also tabulated in table 2 it can be seen that coarse 1 and coarse 2 meshes lead to obvious differences in the results while the medium mesh size can result in similar results compared to the dense mesh which means the results obtained from the medium mesh size are converged the medium mesh size is therefore adopted in the numerical simulations in the present study 3 3 model validation to validate the developed numerical model the obtained results are compared with previous experimental and 3 d numerical benchmark measurements results as mentioned above table 3 summarizes the adopted previous studies and the corresponding parameters it is commonly known that three typical amplitude response branches are associated with the viv responses of an elastically mounted cylinder with low mass ratio williamson and govardhan 2004 for the low normalized velocities there exists an initial branch where two single vortices shed per cycle 2s vortex shedding mode and the mean forces and cylinder response are in phase for the intermediate and large normalized velocities there is an upper and a lower branch associated with two pairs of vortices shed per cycle 2p vortex shedding mode fig 5 shows the normalized amplitude and frequency responses at different reduced velocities obtained in the present study and from the literature for fair comparison some efforts are made to convert the reduced velocities based on the natural frequency in the water to those based on the structural natural frequency in the air as adopted by zhao et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 a the maximum normalized amplitude a m a x in the upper branch u around 4 to 6 obtained from the current numerical model 0 79 is slightly lower than the experimental data see a in table 3 this is mainly because of the differences in the mass ratios and reynolds numbers and less significantly the difference in the end conditions of the experimental tests al jamal and dalton 2004 khalak and williamson 1999 lucor et al 2005 and zhao et al 2014 carried out 3 d numerical simulations with the same mass ratio and reynolds number as adopted in the present study fig 5 a and table 3 show that their results 0 78 and 0 72 respectively are in good agreements with that obtained in the present study for the results in the lower branch u 7 the normalized amplitude responses obtained from the experimental studies and numerical simulations show some fluctuations which indicates that vortex induced motions of the bluff body is a highly nonlinear resonant response and different experimental set ups and numerical assumptions can lead to slightly different results fig 5 b shows the normalized frequency responses f with respect to different reduced velocities as shown the results obtained from the present study match well with other studies to further check the accuracy of the fsi model the phase relation between the normalized response a and the lift coefficient c l are studied as shown in fig 6 a at the initial branch with normalized velocity u 3 1 2s wake mode with two dominant single vortices shed alternately per cycle and the cylinder vibration is in phase with the lift coefficient fig 6 b shows that when the reduced velocity reaches u 4 9 in the upper branch the phase relation between vibration and lift coefficient remains the same while the wake mode switches to 2p vortex pattern consisting of two pairs of vortices shed from two sides of the cylinder per cycle as the reduced velocity continues to increase the viv responses of the body transits into the lower branch at this branch fig 6 c the wake mode remains 2p a phase lag between the cross flow displacement and lift coefficient is however obtained these viv response characteristics captured in the present study are in consistent with previous experimental measurements khalak and williamson 1997 1999 which again reflects the accuracy of the fsi model fig 6 also shows that the wake vortex shedding along the span wise of the cylinder are different this variation cannot be captured by the commonly used 2 d models which implies the importance of 3 d numerical modelling for the bluff body fluid dynamics 4 modified pip system the authors proposed the concept of using modified pip system to control viv of offshore cylindrical components and analytical studies were carried out to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method matin nikoo et al 2017 in the modified pip system the hard polymeric centralizers are replaced by various possible connections such as the polyurethane foam puf viscoelastic material or rotational friction hinge device with spring rfhds bi and hao 2016a b by carefully selecting the parameters of these connection devices optimization the system can then be simplified as a structure tmd system and has the potential for viv suppression it should be noted that the mass ratio between the inner and outer pipes in the revised pip system is normally much larger e g it reached 85 3 in bi and hao 2016b than that in the conventional tmd system generally 1 to a few percent the modified pip system can be regarded as a non conventional tmd system for a non conventional tmd system its effectiveness for vibration control becomes less sensitive to the optimized parameters i e the system is still effective for viv suppression though the parameters of the connecting devices stiffness and damping vary obviously from the optimized values this property makes the selection of connecting devices easy in the analytical study matin nikoo et al 2017 the fluid induced vibration of a single pipe fig 7 a was firstly investigated and the equation of motion of the system was solved and validated by the experimental data the single pipe system was then extended to the revised pip system by keeping the total masses of the pip system and single pipe the same the dynamic behavior of the pip system under the excitation of vortex shedding was then simplified as a two degree of freedom 2dof system two connections were considered by matin nikoo et al 2017 the first connection was that the inner and outer pipes are rigidly connected fig 7 b i e a rigid spring with an infinite stiffness is adopted to connect the inner and outer pipes with this connection the two pipes can vibrate together this connection can approximately simulate the behavior of the conventional pip system since in the conventional pip system only a very small gap normally 5 mm is reserved between the centralizer and the external pipe and the two pipes can almost vibrate together bi and hao 2016b in the second scenario the optimized connecting devices were used and they were represented by the optimized springs and dashpots fig 7 c matin nikoo et al 2017 derived the formulas for the optimized parameters 10 f t m d o p t 1 09 0 48 μ 0 06 ζ o 11 ζ i o p t 0 1 l n μ 0 375 in which f t m d o p t is the optimal frequency ratio ζ i o p t is the optimized damping ratio μ m i m o is the mass ratio between the inner pipe and outer pipe and ζ o is the damping ratio of the main system the external pipe which is assumed as zero in the present study as mentioned above the optimal stiffness k o p t and damping coefficient c o p t in fig 7 c therefore can be calculated as 12 k o p t f t m d o p t 2 μ k o 13 c o p t 2 ζ i o p t k o p t m i in the present study the same concept as adopted by matin nikoo et al 2017 is used again i e the single pipe is split into two pipes to make the total masses of the two systems the same and the diameter of the inner pipe is assumed as half of the outer pipe based on a real project in the north sea logstor 1997 as shown in fig 7 fig 8 shows the numerical model of the pip system the outer pipe is modelled exactly the same as that of the single pipe as discussed in section 2 3 the inner pipe is meshed with the same numbers of elements in the circumferential and span wise directions as the outer pipe combin14 elements are used to model the springs and dashpots that connect the inner and outer pipes this element is a uniaxial tension compression element with up to three degrees of freedom at each node and the spring and damping capability of the element can realistically simulate the proposed connection between the inner and outer pipes no mass bending or torsion is considered for these spring damper elements and only the cross flow direction y is set to free the corresponding parameters k o p t and c o p t are calculated based on eq 12 and 13 it should be noted that the inner pipe and outer pipe may contact with each when the relative displacement between the inner and outer pipes is larger than the annulus size to consider the possible contact in the numerical simulation a pair based contact approach is used between the outer surface of the inner pipe and the inner surface of the outer pipe in this method 3d contact elements conta174 are associated with the 3d target segment elements targe170 contact occurs when the contact elements penetrate the associated target surface 5 results and discussion it is widely recognized that the oscillating amplitudes of a cylinder under viv are significant within a certain reduced velocity range this range is normally defined as the upper branch or the synchronization region as shown in fig 5 a this reduced velocity range is about from 4 to 7 in this study in the present study numerical simulations are only carried out near the synchronization region and in particular four reduced velocities with u 3 7 4 2 4 9 and 6 8 are considered the responses of the revised pip system under viv are calculated for comparison the corresponding results for the single pipe are also calculated it should be noted that with the conventional pip design the inner and outer pipes almost vibrate together bi and hao 2016b which means the responses of the single pipe is almost the same as the conventional pip system in the numerical simulation only the transverse motion is considered the mass ratio between the inner pipe and outer pipe is assumed as 0 5 figures 9 and 10 compare the normalized oscillation displacements and the associated power spectral densities psds of the conventional fig 7 b and optimized pip systems fig 7 c the dark curves are the results obtained from the conventional pip model and the red curves are from the modified pip system the results show that the proposed concept is quite effective for the viv suppression the normalized displacements and corresponding psds obtained from the optimized pip are evidently smaller than those obtained from the conventional pip system two main reasons result in this effect i the vortex formation at the wake of the primary cylinder is disorganized through the alteration of the rigid body motion of the outer pipe and i i partial amount of input energy is transferred from the main structure the outer pipe to the tunned absorber the inner pipe and further dissipated by the inner pipe the tmd effect fig 9 also shows that the system seems not quite effective at the beginning this is because at the initial stage of the transient analysis the oscillating responses of the whole system are not fully developed the relative displacement between the inner and outer pipes is therefore small and the function of the tmd cannot be fully developed to more clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed system table 4 summarizes the root mean square rms displacements of the traditional and optimized pip systems during the whole calculation time the corresponding reduction ratios are also shown in the table it can be seen that the reduction is obvious when u 3 7 4 2 and 4 9 with the maximum reduction ratio reaching 56 at u 3 7 when u 6 8 the effectiveness is decreased as compared to the first three reduced velocities as shown in table 4 the reduction ratio of the displacement response at this reduced velocity u 6 8 is 21 this is because as shown in fig 9 the vibration of the system is the smallest when u 6 8 and the tmd function is less developed compared to the first three cases which in turn results in the smallest reduction ratio however it should be noted that these results are obtained during the whole calculation time if the reduction ratio is considered from the more evident development of the tmd function t 30 in the case of u 6 8 the reduction ratio reaches 41 for this case one the other hand the results also indicate that it does not necessarily mean the largest reduction ratio can be achieved when the vibration is the most violent as shown in the table the largest amplitude occurs when u 4 2 0 37 while the reduction ratio is the smallest 47 in these three cases this is mainly due to the fact that viv responses of offshore cylindrical components with low mass ratio depend highly on the frequency of vortex shedding the oscillating frequency of the cylinder and the added mass all these vary in a rather non linear fashion as mentioned in section 4 the inner and outer pipes may contact with each other if the vibration of the system is too violent to address this issue the normalized relative displacements between the outer and inner pipes a r e l a t i v e are calculated and shown in fig 11 for comparison the normalized annulus size 0 25 is also plotted in this figure by the red dash lines the figure clearly shows that the inner pipe can oscillate freely in the outer pipe and no contact occurs in the present study it should be noted that when contacts occurs the control effectiveness can be slightly decreased bi and hao 2016b due to the fact that the tmd function cannot be fully developed to examine the influence of contact on the control effectiveness is an interesting topic but it is out of the scope of the present study in the design of controlling devices for viv suppression it is desirable to reduce the amplitude of structural vibrations by having low lift and drag coefficients dhanak and xiros 2016 fig 12 plots the lift and drag coefficients of the conventional and modified pip systems at the reduced velocities of u 3 7 and 4 2 it can be seen that the optimized pip system can obviously diminish the lift and drag coefficients at the wall of the structures these results again clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for viv suppression fig 12 b and d also show that the drag coefficients of c d 1 can be obtained in the numerical simulations this is because of the beating phenomenon as reported by some other researchers e g kim et al 2014 mittal 2013 as discussed in section 3 3 the phase relationships between the lift force and vibration amplitude are different in the three branches initial upper and lower branches for a single cylinder for the pip system no such investigation has been reported fig 13 shows the phase difference between the lift force coefficient and outer pipe displacement it can be seen from fig 13 a that similar to the single pipe no phase difference is obtained between the displacement and lift force when u 3 7 the initial state of upper branch when u 4 9 the phase relations between the single pipe and pip system however becomes different as shown in fig 6 b no obvious phase difference can be obtained in the single pipe case however in the pip system obvious phase differences are developed as shown in fig 13 c the results indicate that the pip system can alter the phase relationships between the lift force and vibration amplitude compared to the single pipe system especially in higher reduced velocity range this then further alters the structural responses the 3 d vortices around the cylinder can be captured by using the 3 d numerical model developed in the present study fig 14 shows the 3 d wake turbulence structures around the external pipe when u 4 2 and the q iso surfaces obtained based on the q criterion hunt et al 1988 are plotted this criterion is suitable for the identification of vortex in the incompressible fluid zhang et al 2017b it can be seen that the wave flow is totally three dimensional for both systems and the application of the pip can alter the wake vortices street compared to the single pipe at the initial stage e g for t 16 2 there is no significant difference between the wake topology of the conventional and optimized pip systems when time increases e g for t 32 4 and 53 7 the wake patterns of the two systems however vary significantly this is because the tmd effect is not developed at the initial stage while it is activated when time goes by as discussed above which further changes the pipe responses and the vortices street to further identify how pip system alters the mechanism of vortex shedding formation and the vibration of the cylinder the 2d wake topology formation and the transverse vibration of the conventional and optimized pip systems at the middle surface z 2 5 d are plotted in fig 15 it can be seen that the pip system can prevent the development of vortex shedding and cause a reduction in the width of the wake vortices street compared to the conventional pip system which has a direct influence on the drag force as indicated by law and jaiman 2017 and further suppresses the undesired vibrations of the cylinder 6 conclusion this paper carries out 3 d numerical simulations on the effectiveness of using pip system for viv suppression of offshore cylindrical components a coupled cfd fsi framework is developed by coupling the ansys mechanical and fluent finite volume solvers the numerical model is firstly validated by the previous experimental and numerical results on a single cylinder the validated model is then extended to the pip system numerical results reveal that viv can be significantly suppressed by using the optimized pip system the reduction is most evident in the upper reduced velocity range where the vibration of the system is most violent the effectiveness is slightly decreased in the lower branch range moreover comparing to the conventional pip system the optimized pip system can obviously change the wave vortices formation and alter the phase lag between the lift force and vibration amplitude acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the
