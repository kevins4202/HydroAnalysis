17235,the inhibition of the anaerobic digestion ad process caused by long chain fatty acids lcfas has been considered as an important issue in the wastewater treatment sector proper understanding of mechanisms behind the inhibition is a must for further improvements of the ad process in the presence of lcfas through analyzing recent literature this review extensively describes the mechanism of lcfas degradation during ad further a particular focus was directed to the key parameters which could affect such process besides this review highlights the recent research efforts in mitigating lcfas caused inhibition through the addition of commonly used additives such as cations and natural adsorbents specifically additives such as bentonite cation based adsorbents as well as zeolite and other natural adsorbents for alleviating the lcfas induced inhibition are discussed in detail further panoramic evaluations for characteristics various mechanisms of reaction merits limits recommended doses and preferred conditions for each of the different additives are provided moreover the potential for increasing the methane production via pretreatment using those additives are discussed finally we provide future horizons for the alternative materials that can be utilized more efficiently for both mitigating lcfas based inhibition and boosting methane potential in the subsequent digestion of lcfa related wastes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords long chain fatty acids anaerobic digestion inhibition cations supplementation natural adsorbent 1 introduction high concentrations of lipidic wastes lws cause operational problems in the anaerobic digestion ad reactors due to clogging and hindering mass transfer since the cellular membrane of anaerobes can be covered with lws causing the loss of proper cellular functions furthermore biomass floatation due to adhesion of lws leads to the loss of active biomass because of washout and foaming all these issues can deteriorate the operating efficiency of anaerobic digesters soltan et al 2019 tolba et al 2019 consequently an appropriate management of lws and their hydrolysis products in the corresponding treatment systems is an inevitable issue particularly in the industrial field mostafa et al 2017 lws such as waste frying oil rafieenia et al 2018 slaughterhouse waste yazdani et al 2019 and palm oil mill pome harris and mccabe 2015 are hydrolyzed to form long chain fatty acids lcfas which are also perceived as common lipidic pollutant elsamadony et al 2015a ning et al 2018 noteworthy based on the mccarty equation 94 8 of lipid fractions i e fog can be theoretically converted to methane and only 5 2 utilized for microbial synthesis during the ad process jeganathan et al 2006 accordingly considerable increase in methane yield after lws supplementation was reported compared to the other substrates i e carbohydrate and proteins most likely due to the more carbon reduced to methane in case of lws alqaralleh et al 2019 however the full degradation of lcfas to methane as an end product requires thermodynamically favorable conditions in the ad process i e δgo 0 saha et al 2019 this is because the β oxidation pathway that contains the catabolic reactions where lcfas can be broken down to acetate and hydrogen via acetogenic bacteria is an endergonic nonspontaneous reaction to overcome the thermodynamic unfavourability siphoning off the newly formed products i e acetate and hydrogen is necessary to maintain the concentration gradient in favor of reactants i e lcfas and drive the β oxidation pathway forward duarte et al 2018 therefore syntrophic collaboration between lcfas degrading acetogens and methanogens i e consuming the released acetate and hydrogen is essential to achieve the overall lcfas decomposition into methane and carbon dioxide oh and martin 2010 accumulation of lcfas triggers the inhibition and instability of ad process musa et al 2018 lcfas inhibition is likely initiated by their adsorption to the surface of microbes forming blocking layers kurade et al 2019 and thereby limiting the accessibility of nutrients campanaro et al 2019 soltan et al 2017 moreover the microbes fail to regulate the homeostasis such as intracellular ph due to the lcfas accumulation on the cellular surface amha et al 2017 long et al 2012 the inhibition caused by lcfas can be a reversible process since neither syntrophic acetogenic nor methanogenic activities are irreversibly damaged palatsi et al 2009 however the rate of lcfas accumulation on microbial membranes was found to be higher in the case of unsaturated lcfas compared with saturated types cavaleiro et al 2016 further lcfa caused inhibition is more significant in the thermophilic than mesophilic condition which can be attributed to the increase in lcfas solubility at high temperatures jiang et al 2018 in line with this trend lcfas calcium salt could be spontaneously formed in mesophilic condition leading to the mitigation of lcfa based inhibition in thermophilic condition however salt formation was found to be less and higher amount of calcium addition was required guo et al 2018 while addition of some materials e g cations and clays is likely an effective strategy to overcome the lcfas cased inhibition proper understanding of the mechanisms by which the possible inhibitions are mitigated is necessary for further improvement of biological lcfas treatment in this review based on several recent publications that handled the impact of lcfas on the ad performance and associated methane production the detailed mechanisms of lcfas cased inhibition as well as the possible strategies for the efficient methane production are discussed more specifically we provide insights into lcfas degradation pathways factors affecting ad system performance and microorganisms involved in the ad process as well as the relations among these perspectives this review also covers the recent strategies utilized for alleviating the adverse inhibitory impact of lcfas on the ad process such as treatment using cations and natural adsorbents the mechanisms of reaction impacts effect of conditions pros and cons of each additive are also discussed 2 classification of long chain fatty acids lcfas lcfas are classified into saturated mono unsaturated and poly unsaturated as presented at fig 1 these fatty acids are composed of carbon chains exceeding twelve carbon atoms verma and sharma 2016 the term of saturation represents that the carbon chain is bound to the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms on the other hand lcfas with one double bond c c are called mono unsaturated while those with multiple double bonds are named as poly unsaturated cavaleiro et al 2016 one of the main characteristics of the unsaturated fatty acids is the stretched intramolecular interaction due to the presence of double bonds causing the bended structure which leads to higher solubility for unsaturated compared to saturated fatty acids of similar molecular weight saturated fatty acids consequently remain in solid state at room temperature shin et al 2003 unsaturated lcfas have two configurations i e cis and trans as illustrated in fig 1 in which trans configuration has higher toxicity than cis chatgilialoglu et al 2014 in general lcfas are not completely soluble in water because their long hydrocarbon chains have hydrophobic property by increasing the length of carbon chains the solubility of lcfas decreases he and yan 2016 sousa et al 2009a indicated that palmitic acid c16 has around 2 5 times higher solubility than stearic acid c18 at temperature range 20 60 c additionally unsaturated lcfas are more soluble than saturated types for example solubilities of stearic acid c18 and linoleic acid c18 2 were 0 57 and 1 59 mg l at 25 c respectively mabrouk and dugan 1961 a double bond structure expands the intermolecular distance of unsaturated lcfas facilitating the interaction with water molecules thus solubility of lcfas follows an order of c18 2 c18 1 c18 chipasa and mȩdrzycka 2006 listed the degradation rates represented by first order kinetic rate constants k for saturated and unsaturated lcfas via aerobic treatment using activated sludge saturated lcfas showed k of 0 0071 h 1 for palmitic acid c16 and 0 0052 h 1 for stearic acid c18 while unsaturated lcfas such as oleic acid c18 1 and linoleic acid c18 2 had higher degradation rates k of 0 044 and 0 034 h 1 respectively the authors suggested that the dissimilarities of degradation rates for lcfas are associated with the variation of solubility chipasa and mȩdrzycka 2006 domestic and industrial wastewaters are often polluted by vegetable and animal fats which contain a range of saturated and unsaturated lcfas as depicted from table 1 waste vegetable oil contains high concentrations of unsaturated lcfas especially oleic and linoleic acids hidalgo et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2014 the high unsaturated lcfas content is also observed in the grease waste silvestre et al 2014 in contrast animal fats are found to be rich in saturated lcfas such as palmitic and stearic acids the wastes such as sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid wastes ofmsw hold trace concentrations of lcfas martín gonzález et al 2010 silvestre et al 2014 3 anaerobic degradation pathways of lcfas in the anaerobic environment lipids are subjected to lipolysis process via enzymatic attack by lipase and decomposed into glycerol and lcfas meng et al 2015 petropoulos et al 2018 glycerol is further oxidized during the acidogenesis stage to form volatile fatty acids leng et al 2017 in contrast oxidation of lcfas requires lcfas degrading acetogens and external electron acceptors i e flavin adenine dinucleotide fad and proton h to deposit electrons liberated from β oxidation cycle therefore degradation of lcfas considered as acetogenesis during the acidogenic stage only saturation of unsaturated lcfas could occur as a result of the acquisition of h2 molecules released at this stage sousa et al 2009 the β oxidation pathway is considered as a critical step in the breakdown of lcfas molecules ahmad and ghufran 2011 firstly fatty acid molecules penetrate the outer membrane via protein fadl towards the bacterial cytoplasm this occurs simultaneously with their activation to fatty acyl coa by the aid of fatty acyl coa synthetase facs klett et al 2017 fig 2 afterwards fatty acyl coa undergoes repeated cycles of β oxidation process where two carbon atoms are removed from the carbon chain of fatty acetyl coa ch3 ch2 nco s coa at each cycle generating acetate and hydrogen kougias et al 2016 the overall reaction of β oxidation process can be described by eq 1 finally acetate and hydrogen are utilized by acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively to produce methane eq 2 and 3 1 ch3 ch2 ncooh 2h2o ch3 ch2 n 2cooh ch3cooh 2h2 2 ch3cooh ch4 co2 3 4h2 co2 ch4 h2o each cycle of β oxidation process consists of four consecutive enzymatic reactions of oxidation hydration oxidation and thiolysis the foremost oxidation reaction is stimulated by acyl coa dehydrogenase and responsible for extraction of two protons from fatty acyl coa the oxidized fatty acyl coa is further hydrated with the aid of enoyl coa hydratase by introducing water molecule to the double bond and forming 3l hydroxyacyl coa as declared in fig 2 this is followed by another oxidation reaction where two more protons are extracted to form β ketoacyl coa via 3l hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase producing nadh salama et al 2019 electrons e are donated from nadh to proton i e h forming hydrogen gas i e h2 as described by eq 4 lin et al 2016 4 nadh h nad h2 finally thiolysis occurs via the reverse claisen condensation catalyzed by β ketothiolase to separate the terminal acetyl coa which is further converted to acetate via acetate kinase leaving n 2lcfas to be subjected to a new β oxidation cycle brasen and schonheit 2004 the aforementioned metabolites of β oxidation pathway associated with lcfas expectedly have an even number of carbon atoms in the case of lcfas with odd numbers of carbon atoms propionate is also generated as a pathway intermediate sousa et al 2007a on the other hand the degradation pathway of unsaturated lcfas remains largely unclear for example previous study indicated that the complete saturation hydrogenation of unsaturated lcfas occurs prior to the β oxidation circle sharma et al 2015 while others proposed the availability of a direct decomposition of unsaturated lcfa via β oxidation in the absence of hydrogenation the latter reactions could take place via isomerase dependent pathway mediated by the extra three types of enzymes of δ3 δ2 enoyl coa isomerase eci 2 4 dienoyl coa reductase decr and δ3 5 δ2 4 dienoyl coa isomerase houten et al 2016 this cryptic point is still unresolved cavaleiro et al 2016 detected that c16 accounted for 79 of the intermediates when using c18 1 as the carbon source for the ad process while c18 denoted less than 13 similarly in the case of c16 2 the metabolites were c14 and c16 with percentages of 52 and 34 respectively likewise c18 2 was anaerobically degraded to c16 56 and c18 1 20 the standard gibbs free energy of reactions δgo for ad of lcfas are presented in fig 3 pathways such as c18 2 c18 1 c18 2 c16 0 and c18 1 c16 are considered thermodynamically favorable δgo 0 the reaction of hydrogenation pathway c18 1 c18 has never been detected in previous studies in the ad process despite being thermodynamically favorable δgo 78 6 kj mol sousa 2006 meanwhile the conversion equation of lcfas to acetate and h2 as final products reveals δg 0 meaning that this reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable as described in fig 3 oh and martin 2010 however the equation of complete conversion of lcfas to methane exhibits negative value of δgo therefore syntrophic interaction between acetogenic lcfas degraders and methanogens is essential to sustain low h2 partial pressure and efficiently degrade lcfas to methane cavaleiro et al 2016 salvador et al 2019 4 key factors affecting anaerobic digestion of lipids rich wastewater 4 1 effect of lcfas saturation degree the composition of lcfas in lws strongly affects the degradation behavior of lws in the ad process saturation degree of lcfas is represented by the iodine value iv 254 d ai mwi where d is the number of double bonds ai is the percentage of each fraction and mwi is the molecular mass kalayasiri et al 1996 in this context bio accessibility and bio toxicity relationships between lcfas molecules and their degraders can be identified by the iv value unsaturated lcfas with high iv value which have low melting point mp e g mp of c18 1 is 13 14 c are generally in dissolved form at ad operating temperature thus their molecules can easily access to lcfas degrading acetogens as illustrated in fig 4 in contrast saturated lcfas are presented in the solid form at ad process e g mp of c16 is 61 62 5 c therefore there is always a gap between saturated lcfas and their degraders wu et al 2017 which could explain the slow degradation and low methane yield harvested from saturated c16 compared to unsaturated c18 1 at low concentration on the other hand higher iv causes higher toxicity of lcfas to microbes such as acetogens and methanogens hidalgo et al 2018 pereira et al 2005 utilized the scanning electron microscope sem technique to differentiate the behaviors of c18 1 and c16 when they were used as sole carbon sources c18 1 as being in the liquid form was rapidly adsorbed onto the bacterial cell and further degraded to c16 on the membrane consequently the cellular surface was equally covered with a whitish greasy layer resulting in the encapsulation of cells the qualitative analysis of this lipidic layer showed that c16 accounts for 83 of total lcfas stuck on sludge membrane the accumulation of saturated lcfas mostly c16 on the bacterial membrane occurs possibly because i pathway of c18 1 conversion to c16 is faster than the subsequent c16 degradation under the continuous feeding condition of c18 1 and ii c16 degradation starts after the complete conversion of c18 1 to c16 wu et al 2018 however this was not the case when anaerobes were initially fed with saturated c16 in this case sludge retained its original dark color with small white spots as a result of c16 precipitation on bacterial membranes avoiding the sludge encapsulation pereira et al 2005 therefore the solid form of c16 at digestion temperature makes it less toxic to anaerobes and avoids its accumulation on bacterial membrane whereas c18 1 causes isolation of methanogens from their syntrophic microorganisms leading to the accumulation of cn 2 lcfas and hindering the lcfas degradation cavaleiro et al 2016 additionally lcfas exhibited direct toxicity towards methanogens not only acetogens lalman and bagley 2001 compared the effects of c18 and c18 1 on ad performance as role models for saturated and unsaturated lcfas although c18 witnessed a slow degradation rate compared to c18 1 c18 revealed a lower inhibitory effect on acetoclastic methanogens than c18 1 the toxicity of c18 and c18 1 started when their concentrations exceeded 100 and 30 mg l respectively likewise sousa et al 2013 investigated the effect of c18 1 and c16 as the sole carbon source on pure culture hydrogenotrophic methanogens of methanospirillum hungatei and methanobacterium formicicum in the study of sousa et al 2013 c18 1 revealed higher toxicity than c16 in which m hungatei was more sensitive than m formicicum 4 2 lipids content and lipid loading rates llr there are two major concerns associated with anaerobic degradation of fog i high concentrations inhibit acetogens and methanogens and ii accumulation of lcfas leads to cell membrane damage nutrient transport limitation and formation of acidic environment amha et al 2017 moreover high concentration of lipidic wastes i e fog reveals a rapid inhibition of the ad process as a consequence of metabolites accumulation i e hydrogen and acetate elsamadony et al 2015b usman et al 2020 complete degradation of lcfas i e fog metabolites via β oxidation cycles is thermodynamically unfavorable unless hydrogen partial pressure and acetate concentration are below 100 pa 10 3 atm and 420 to 2140 mg l cavaleiro et al 2016 oh and martin 2010 respectively this can be achieved only by sustaining adequate methanogenic populations that syntrophically co operate with acetogens to continuously consume the hydrogen and acetate released and sustain the stability of the ad process saha et al 2020 therefore lipids in ad process are usually used as co substrate with other biodegradable substrates that can enrich methanogens and are expressed as percentages of influent volatile solids vs sun et al 2014 reported that under olr of 10 gvs l day ad of co substrates food waste fruit and vegetable residues waste activated sludge and edible oil in semi continuous cstr under 35 c was optimized when lipid content was 60 of initial vs under these conditions maximum methane production of 706 ml gvs day was produced however methane production started to decline when lipid content was further increased likewise xu et al 2015 also noticed that methane productivity increased when fog based on vs was added as co substrate at content of 42 to food waste and municipal waste sludge in cstr under olr of 5 2 gvs l day and temperature of 35 c authors discovered that this enhancement was associated with 19 increase of extracellular polymeric substances eps generally eps is responsible for the formation of microorganism aggregates facilitating the syntrophic interaction between acetogens and methanogens moreover eps plays the role of protective layer against toxicants henriques and love 2007 on the other hand the reactor with higher fog content of 55 exhibited a reduction in the methane productivity by 37 possibly due to its toxicity effect similarly rodríguez méndez et al 2017 found that cstr reactor remained stable under llr from 0 16 to 0 32 gvs l day lipid content of 53 based on vs and temperature of 35 c with maximum methane yield of 519 ml gvs at llr of 0 32 gvs l day consequently previous literatures advised that to avoid lcfas accumulation and sustain stable ad process in continuous ad reactors llr should not exceed 0 4 gvs l day in case of lipid content ranging from 40 to 60 gonçalves et al 2012 neves et al 2009 rodríguez méndez et al 2017 4 3 temperature mesophilic condition of ad reveals higher process stability over thermophilic condition though increasing the temperature to a certain extent leads to better microbial metabolic rate zhang et al 2020 in addition thermophilic microorganisms are more sensitive to lcfas inhibition than mesophilic ones furthermore higher temperature leads to higher lcfas solubility and makes them more accessible to microorganisms as the results of the increased diffusion coefficients the accumulation of lcfas on the bacterial membrane is augmented and consequently the cellular activity is abruptly deteriorated jiang et al 2018 nzila et al 2019 for example bayr et al 2012 noticed that mesophilic ad 35 c of slaughterhouse wastes using continuously stirred tank reactor cstr could maintain a stable performance even when organic loading rate olr was fluctuating further such a condition revealed a higher methane yield of 965 ml gvs compared to 766 ml gvs recorded at thermophilic condition 55 c the low stability of thermophilic condition of slaughterhouse wastes can be related to not only lcfas but also ammonia lcfa synergetic co inhibition tian et al 2018 since high temperature promotes the conversion of ammonium nh4 to ammonia nh3 which is toxic to microbes massalha et al 2020 jeong et al 2014 discovered that optimum temperature is olr dependent during the treatment of pome using anaerobic baffled reactor abr mesophilic condition was found to be superior at olrs lower than 10 gcod l day while thermophilic condition generated higher methane at olr of 15 gcod l day the lcfas composition was also another key parameter e g thermophilic anaerobes were found to be more vulnerable to unsaturated lcfas i e c18 1 inhibition than mesophilic anaerobes hwu and lettinga 1997 hatamoto et al 2007b investigated the enrichment of mesophilic 37 c and thermophilic 55 c granules subjected to individual lcfas of palmitic c16 stearic c18 oleic c18 1 and linoleic c18 2 acids as the main carbon source as saturated lcfas are known with its low bioavailability to anaerobes in mesophilic condition thermophilic condition yielded higher methane productivity by 1 8 folds compared to the mesophilic condition when granules were fed with c18 on the contrary unsaturated lcfas such as c18 1 and c18 2 have shown three times higher methane production in the mesophilic condition compared to thermophilic condition most likely because increasing temperature boosted up the toxicity of unsaturated lcfas hatamoto et al 2007b this means that wastewater with high iv is better to operate under mesophilic condition while thermophilic temperature is preferable for low iv wastewater 5 microorganisms involved in the fatty acids rich ad process lcfas are formed in the ad process via hydrolysis of lipids rich substrates triacylglycerol which can be mediated by group of species mostly belonging to pseudomonas and clostridium genus baserba et al 2012 cirne et al 2006 these species can utilize triacylglycerol into glycerol and lcfas with the aid of excreted lipase enzyme for example predominant bacteria related to clostridium genus 33 belonging to firmicutes phyla were noticed in the anaerobic degradation of lipid rich swine slaughterhouse waste ning et al 2018 glycerol as the hydrolysate of triacylglycerol participates into the two acidogenesis degradation pathways i reductive pathway composed of glycerol 3 hydroxypropionaldehyde 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pd and ii oxidative pathway which involves the following conversion glycerol pyruvate short chain fatty acids acetate and lactate saxena et al 2009 species such as klebsiella pneumoniae enterobacter agglomerans enterobacter aerogenes and citrobacter freundii which belong to proteobacteria phylum as well as clostridium pasteurianum clostridium butyricum affiliated to firmicutes phylum can metabolize glycerol according to both reductive and oxidative pathways on the other hand lactobacillus reuteri descended from firmicutes phylum pursues the reductive pathway and requires additional substrates in yielding atp and forming reduction equivalents da silva et al 2009 saturation of unsaturated lcfas may take place during the acidogenesis process the detected bacteria capable of saturating the unsaturated lcfas are anaerobic ruminal bacteria belonging to firmicutes phylum with genera of butyrivibrio fusocillus selenomonas and clostridium buccioni et al 2012 hydrogenation of unsaturated lcfas mostly occurs by a combination of bacterial groups and is rarely mediated by individual bacterium h2 producing acetogens can degrade lcfas with carbon chains higher than 12 carbon atoms are listed in fig 5 a pure cultures studies discovered that not all species are able to degrade both saturated and unsaturated lcfas e g only syntrophomonas sapovorans roy et al 1986 syntrophomonas zehnderi sousa et al 2007b and thermosysntropha lipolytica svetlitshnyi et al 2009 have this ability in syntrophic interaction with methanogens of methanospirillum hungatei methanobacterium formicicum and methanobacterium strain jw vs m29 respectively to produce methane as final product in contrast syntrophomonas curvata zhang et al 2004 syntrophomonas palmitatica hatamoto et al 2007a and syntrophomonas saponavida lorowitz et al 1989 are able to degrade only saturated lcfas moreover thermosyntropha tengcongensis is a thermophile species capable of oxidizing saturated lcfas with carbon chains ranging from c12 to c18 as well as unsaturated lcfas i e c18 1 beside the ability for producing methane syntrophically with hydrogenotrophic bacteria methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus zhang et al 2012 species that can degrade unsaturated lcfas generally have the potential to degrade saturated lcfas however the opposite is not possible sousa et al 2009 this is probably because of the extra requirement of enzymes needed in the case of unsaturated lcfas degradation in the β oxidation cycles lcfas with even carbon numbers produce only acetate while odd types form propionate beside acetate fig 5b in the latter case both methane production and propionate degradation are completely depending on syntrophy occurrence among relevant partners sousa et al 2007a found that the enriched partners are syntrophobacter and smithella genus however it is quite difficult to specify which syntrophic partners will be activated under similar condition the reason is that the variety and number of syntrophes are so high hao et al 2020 in the mixed culture experiments high abundance of lcfas oxidizers and methanogens is required in order to sustain complete lcfas degradation process via syntrophic interaction ning et al 2018 found that the genera of syntrophomona as lcfas oxidizing bacteria and methanospirillum as hydrogenotrophic methanogen flourished during ad of lipid rich swine slaughterhouse waste highlighting the important role of the syntrophic association between these two types of microorganisms in the degradation of lcfas this was also emphasized by fujihira et al 2018 who investigated the microbial community in multi stages anaerobic baffled reactor abr showing that lcfas decomposition to methane started in the third and fourth compartments where the cooperation of lcfas oxidizers genera i e syntrophomonas syntrophus and syntrophobacter genus and hydrogen utilizing methanogens i e methanobacterium methanocorpusculum and methanoregula genus was observed kurade et al 2019 found that fog with volumetric ratio 25 v v augmented the relative abundance of acetogenic lcfa oxidizers sporosarcina and syntrophomonas to 41 and 11 respectively as well as methanosarcina to 95 achieving in the efficient degradation of lcfas to methane similarly co existence of syntrophus genus and acetoclastic methanosaeta facilitated lcfa degradation even in a psychrophilic condition 10 c and improved methane yields 79 85 from lcfa containing synthetic dairy wastewater singh et al 2019 in case of methanogens inhibition lcfas degradation could proceed with co occurrence of desulfonation this was confirmed in the anaerobic reactor treating c18 1 where methanogens were inhibited using 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes salvador et al 2019 the dominance of srb desulfovibrio aminophilus as well as acetate and sulfide as metabolites were observed salvador et al 2019 6 mitigation of lcfa induced inhibition by adding cations or natural adsorbents 6 1 cations supplementation in cations based mitigation processes by the addition of monovalent cations lcfas can be converted to suspended salts on the other hand precipitated salts of lcfas are produced when divalent or trivalent cations were added to lcfas dereli et al 2014 he et al 2011 iasmin et al 2014 kurnianto et al 2019a generally the addition of cations leads to promotion of ad performance through mitigating the lcfas toxicity and improving digestion stability dereli et al 2014 kleyböcker et al 2012 furthermore the counter ion presents along with the cation possibly influences ad of lcfas for example so4 2 with salt form of znso4 is likely able to stimulate the syntrophic interaction between srb and lcfas oxidizers that leads to hydrogen sulfide generation fig 5b then higher lcfas removal was found to be associated with znso4 supplementation compared to the case of zncl2 supplementation chuen et al 2019 however cations supplementation topic still has many questions to be answered e g is the formed salt completely or partially insoluble what is the benefit of the formed salts during the subsequent digestion process what can be the change in bio degradability bio accessibility of such lcfas salts compared to raw lcfas and so forth 6 1 1 suspended lcfas micelles formation via saponification saponification is a hydrolysis reaction where the hydroxide group of an alkali attacks and breaks the ester bonds formed between fatty acid and glycerol of triglyceride tg leading to the release of glycerol and free fatty acid eq 5 chanakaewsomboon et al 2019 5 tg 3 moh δ 3 rco o m c 2 h 5 coh saponification occurred by the addition of naoh or koh functions as a pretreatment method for lipidic wastes thermal energy is utilized for catalyzing saponification reaction khuntia et al 2017 consequently insoluble tg molecules could be converted to suspended lcfas salt micelles which improves the contact between microorganisms and organic matters salama et al 2019 fig s1 shows an example of glyceryl trioleate saponification firstly hydroxide ion oh dissociated from the strong base attacks the carbonyl in the carboxylic group cooh of the trioleate forming an unstable intermediate next alkoxide group ro is expulsed from the intermediate leaving the fatty acids which is then deprotonated by the attack of ro forming glycerol and oleate anion the anion reacts later with the metal ions na and forms suspended sodium saponified oleate micelles eze et al 2015 the saponification therefore produces saponified lcfa that has a similar structure to surfactants the saponification process reduces the solubility of lcfas since it causes a neutralization for the polar head hydroxyl group of lcfas however if an oil particle is presented along with the lcfas in the media the saponified lcfa can facilitate the dissolving dispersion of this oil particle in water to be specific the hydrophobic tails of saponified lcfa are directed to the oily contaminant while the hydrophilic heads are directed to outer layer this leads to dispersed micelles formation shah et al 2016 silverstein 1998 using a combination of naoh and koh kurnianto et al 2019a saponified air floated dairy industry waste for 1 5 hour at 70 c then fed the saponified waste into anaerobic reactor kurnianto et al 2019a found that the na bearing soap is hard and homogenous while the k bearing soap was soft and heterogenous this might be because k has larger atomic size than na and thus the electrostatic attraction force between lcfa and k is weaker than that for na therefore the soap formed with k is likely softer than that with na kurnianto et al 2019a the soft soap provided superior results in terms of digestion efficiency than hard soap such a conclusion was provided by mouneimne et al 2003 who hypothesized that the reason may be related to the toxicity of high concentration of na in this regard moderate methanogenic inhibition was found to occur at concentrations of 3 5 5 5 g na l and approximately 8 g k l magdalena et al 2019 zha et al 2020 battimelli et al 2009 explored the impact of saponification pretreatment for two kinds of slaughterhouse wastes aero floated fats vs solid carcasses fats using naoh on biogas production harvested from mesophilic and thermophilic ad batch processes the authors noticed that there is a significant enhancement in biogas production rate in case of saponified waste with higher influence in mesophilic ad conditions indicating that saponified form of lcfas has higher bioavailability to anaerobes than raw form of lcfas the same wastes were further investigated using different saponification pretreatment temperatures of 60 120 and 150 c then subjected to mesophilic digestion in fed batch reactors battimelli et al 2010 the optimum pretreatment temperature was found to be 120 c where the biodegradation bioavailability was improved by saponification with insignificant alteration of fatty acids composition kurnianto et al 2019 studied the impact of different doses of base mixture of naoh and koh at 0 5 and 1 1 gbase l utilized for the saponification pretreatment of dairy fat waste saponification at both doses enhanced the hydrolysis twenty times higher than control however high base dose caused an inhibition for bacteria in the digester and reduced methane yield in the saponified waste containing reactor pellera and gidarakos 2018 in contrast stated that pretreatment temperature is a key influence parameter rather than base doses table 2 summarizes the positive impact of saponification on the ad process 6 1 2 insoluble lcfas salt formation lcfas are ionized under the alkaline or neutral conditions to carboxylate ions rcoo mouneimne et al 2003 therefore when metal ions are available in water oil medium they can react with ionized fatty acids rcoo to produce lcfas metal salt as highlighted in eq 6 ye et al 2013 6 n rcooh m n rcoo n m nh n 2 unlike na and k divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 or higher multivalent cations produce soaps that form water insoluble precipitates pratiwi et al 2017 in short the monovalent metal can form suspended micelles of lcfa salt while the divalent or trivalent metal forms insoluble lcfa salt dereli et al 2014 he et al 2011 iasmin et al 2014 kurnianto et al 2019a highly soluble metal halides e g cacl2 have higher ability to mitigate the inhibition of fatty acids compared to the oxides or sulfates e g cao and caso4 both of which are poorly soluble in water ye et al 2013 further saturated lcfas are more vulnerable to reaction with metal ions than unsaturated lcfas torcello gómez et al 2018 use of cacl2 was found to play an antagonistic role against the inhibition of lipid derived lcfas during the treatment of swine wastewater ahn et al 2006 table 3 in batch tests ahn et al 2006 investigated the optimum ca2 dosage within the range from 1 to 7 g l using cacl2 the authors found that the optimum ca2 concentration was 3 g l at which methane yield was augmented by 9 higher than control they affirmed the salt formation by monitoring ph inside the reactor where initial ph of 7 was dropped to 6 51 and 6 34 in the control ca2 free reactor and ca2 containing reactor respectively the lower ph in the ca2 loaded reactor can be associated with h release as shown in eq 6 moreover zhang et al 2011 found that in case of control no ca2 addition fed with linoleic acid the syntrophic reaction between acetogenic degraders and methanogens was hindered and then negligible amount of methane was released 8 of the theoretical methane production addition of 4 g l of cacl2 however accelerated the bioconversion rate of linoleic acid to acetate via β oxidation and the produced methane was 93 7 of the theoretical methane production indicating the successful metabolism of almost all added linoleic acid to methane another evidence for calcium salt formation was noticed by kobayashi et al 2014 through analyzing the residual sludge after being harvested from two batch reactors i e control and ca2 supplemented batch reactor where both of them were fed by restaurant grease trap waste deoiling kobayashi et al 2014 tested various food to mass ratios f m of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 1 9 gcod gvss a significant drop in the methane production rate from 3 9 to 1 ml gvss d occurred for control batch when f m exceeded 1 0 gcod gvss on the other hand ca2 supplemented batch witnessed a slight drop in the methane production rate from 4 9 to 3 8 ml gvss d when f m exceeded 1 5 gcod gvss the performance difference among the two batches was assigned to the formation of small white particles 0 5 1 mm inside ca2 supplemented reactor such particles consisted of calcium salts of palmitate and stearate were found to be beneficial for both reducing lcfas inhibition and avoiding microbial cell blocking the mixing mode could affect the size of the formed lcfas aggregates e g gentle mixing produced large balls 2 3 cm size dereli et al 2014 in addition to calcium a previous work by ivanov et al 2002 indicated that iron ions have potential for enhancing the degradation of lcfas causing an uplift in methane production by 63 at iron concentration of 0 25 g l compared to the control iron free condition recently shim and chan 2018 found that 10 mg l of cucl2 were able to reduce the effluent concentration of lcfas during ad of food waste by 95 less than control reactor as a result methane yield was augmented to 0 33 l gcod while control yielded only 0 17 l gcod similarly the same authors investigated the ability of znso4 and zncl2 to catalyze ad of lcfas from food waste chuen et al 2019 both znso4 and zncl2 at concentration of 100 mg l boosted the methane yield to around 0 36 l gcod control reactor yielded only 0 17 l gcod the authors elaborated this enhancement by two practically proved mechanisms i the decrease of lcfas adsorbed onto bacterial membrane via lcfas m2 precipitates formation and ii bacterial activity stimulation due to the promotion of enzymatic activities in the presence of zn2 e g hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase the timing of adding the metal containing chemical and keeping high biomass to lcfas ratio inside the anaerobic reactor play significant role in the mitigation of lcfas inhibition palatsi et al 2009 salama et al 2019 three scenarios can be applied for the supplementation of metal containing chemical into ad i concurrent addition in which metal containing chemical is mixed with lipidic contaminant prior to being introduced to anaerobic consortia fig 6 a ii early addition of metal containing chemical to bacteria before feeding with lipid wastewater fig 6b and iii late addition by providing the metal containing chemical to the bacteria after the occurrence of lcfas inhibition as it was hypothesized by salama et al 2019 fig 6c the immediate addition of calcium chloride i e addition right after the inhibition occurrence was recommended in the case of lauric based inhibition by koster 1987 for methanogenic activity restoration ca2 addition should not be later than several minutes after lauric inhibition occurrence late addition by 6 h could not antagonize the inhibition similarly zhang et al 2011 highlighted that either instant or early addition of cacl2 could minimize the linoleic acid based inhibition similarly the delay in calcium addition by 25 and 20 h led to insignificant limitation for the inhibition caused by linoleic and oleic acids respectively wu et al 2017 zhang and jahng 2010 therefore according to previous literature early addition of cations is highly recommended to avoid lcfas inhibition 6 1 3 role of metal ions adsorbed on microbial cells the co occurrence of suspended and or precipitate lcfas salt formation as well as ions adsorption on microbial membrane was previously reported for instance zhang and jahng 2010 firstly added calcium ions and then after 25 hours linoleic acid was added the authors found that 0 64 to 0 80 g ca2 l was attached to the cellular membrane prior to c18 2 addition therefore the authors concluded that adsorption of calcium ions onto the cellular surface could play a role in biomass protection and final detoxification in short metal ions supplementation in the anaerobic media often stimulates bacteria activities during the ad process of lipidic wastes bagwell et al 2008 in term of enzymatic activities lipase enzyme secreted from pseudomonas fluorescens was catalyzed by fe2 during the feeding of olive oil and at the same time ca2 was found to have a role in the fixation of lipase active sites jaeger et al 1994 the impact of ca2 on lipase enzyme was explained in detail by torcello gómez et al 2018 who illustrated that adsorbed ca2 has electrostatic interactions with the negative charge of lipase enzyme resulting in a reduction for the intermolecular repulsion force between lipase molecules and triglyceride tg other studies also observed the stimulation of lipase activity in the presence of ca2 hendriks et al 2018 mostafa et al 2017 li and ma 2014 investigated the effect of various metal ions i e mg2 ca2 fe2 and cu2 originated from mgso4 cacl2 feso4 and cuso4 respectively on the activities of four enzymes involved in β oxidation process mg2 at concentration of 388 mg l boosted the activities of acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase and l 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase in addition 400 mg l of ca2 achieved the highest activities of acyl coa dehydrogenase and enoyl coa hydratase while ca2 concentration of 320 and 80 mg l augmented the activity of l 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase however when ca2 concentration exceeded 320 mg l a drastic reduction in the activity of enzymes was noticed in contrast to mg2 and ca2 fe2 showed inhibitory effect on acyl coa dehydrogenase even at low concentration of 55 8 mg l 1 mmol l despite of being able to stimulate enoyl coa hydratase l 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase finally cu2 could catalyze only enoyl coa hydratase at concentration of 6 4 mg l and suppressed the other three enzymes li and ma 2014 the results on fe2 treatment needs further research since it is not consistent with previous literature for instance fe2 did not show an inhibitory impact upon acyl coa dehydrogenase in a previous research lee and schulz 1979 furthermore the effect of ca2 mixture of ca oh 2 and cacl2 at molar ratio of 1 1 on microbial community was investigated in the ad using fog as substrate by salama et al 2020 the authors showed that ca2 concentration of 1 g l doubled the relative abundance of syntrophomonas genus since the presence of metals is essential for mitigating lcfas induced inhibition and protecting the bacterial community from potential blocking there are some optimal metal concentrations that are recommended in the ad medium as noted in table 3 however when the concentrations of the metal ions exceed the optimal ranges the ad process can be adversely affected soltan et al 2019 6 2 natural adsorbents 6 2 1 mechanisms of natural adsorbents action in lipid rich digestions natural adsorbents usually have negative charge on their surfaces due to the unshared oxygens however this negative charge is balanced by alkali earth metal cations i e na k ca2 and mg2 presented in the adsorbent awad et al 2019 these cations are exchangeable and their exchanging capacities depend on the type of dominant cation temperature and utilized activation method i e thermal or chemical methods karimi and salem 2011 when adsorbent is supplemented to fermentation media these cations can be rapidly exchanged by h which is produced by acetogens via β oxidation step fig 2 therefore natural adsorbents can act as buffering agents that prevent accumulation of soluble organic acids zhao et al 2019 this was confirmed by zhang et al 2018 who observed that bentonite loaded reactor revealed higher methane yield and content of 564 ml gvs and 66 7 than the 479 ml gvs and 64 0 found in the control respectively this was accompanied with high effluent ph of 6 96 for bentonite supplemented reactor versus ph of 6 27 for control confirming h neutralization by cations exchange with bentonite fernández et al 2007 denoted that under anaerobic condition zeolite could release mg2 which reacted later with negatively charged ions po4 3 available in media forming mgnh4po4 precipitate milán et al 2010 likely lcfas ions rcoo has the potential to react with cations released from natural adsorbents and to possibly form lcfa salt suspended or precipitated as discussed in section 6 1 the adsorption process of fatty acids onto natural adsorbents can be classified into physical and chemical adsorption since the size of lcfas are close to the size of adsorbent pores the adsorption of lcfas into the adsorbent meso pores might be uncommon rather physical attachment between lcfas molecules and adsorbent surface via electrostatic interaction in addition to the van der waals forces can be a hypothetically possible mechanism in adsorption process das et al 2017 isernia 2014 on the other hand chemical adsorption may occur via cations exchange with acidic sites h on the adsorbent surface namely brönsted acid sites as noticed in fig 7 a the more si4 substitution by al3 the more brönsted acid sites are formed therefore adsorbents with higher al3 si 4 ratio can sustain higher adsorption capacity of lcfas isernia 2014 oxygen atom of carboxylate group the polar head of lcfas can be adsorbed to brönsted acid sites of al oh si groups by hydrogen bonding which is accompanied by the association of hydrogen atom of carboxylate with deprotonated al o si groups these h bonds can be formed according to the difference in the electronegativity between carboxylate and the surface of utilized adsorbent as shown in fig 7b gomes et al 2017 such adsorption is a temperature dependent process for example maddikeri et al 2012 noted that increasing the incubation temperature from 20 to 30 and 40 c caused decline in the adsorption ability for stearic and oleic acid lipidic membrane of bacteria is negatively charged and can be targeted by acidic sites of adsorbent mingeot leclercq and décout 2016 therefore adsorbent surface can act as a scaffold for the microbes in such a way that secures protection for biomass from being washed out and enhances substrate uptake arnaiz et al 2006 ma et al 2018 raposo et al 2004 reported that cstr with biomass immobilized on bentonite exhibited higher stability and better substrate degradation efficiency coupled with lower effluent vfas than bentonite free cstr recently impregnation of iron in the zeolite amended culture has been suggested to facilitate the biofilm formation in fixed bed reactor purnomo et al 2017 the significant increment in biogas production can be attributed to the advanced features of natural adsorbents which maintain the effective microbial community via immobilization as well as the growth of microbes on iron impregnated zeolite at batch reactor cavaleiro et al 2010 based on the way of supplementation fig 8 differentiates the practically proved mechanisms of zeolite impact apparently in case zeolite is directly added to anaerobes zeolite supports the microbial colonization since it works as a carrier for the anaerobes therefore if zeolite is withdrawn from the media afterward a deterioration for methane productivity may occur however in the case that zeolite is directly added to lcfas an efficient adsorption for these lcfas on the surface of zeolite will occur in this case performance deterioration is not expected to take place even if zeolite is withdrawn from batch reactor media nordell et al 2013 table 4 listed different types of natural adsorbents the utilized dosage the characteristics of natural adsorbent operational conditions and the effect on the ad process treating lcfas rich substrates different activation methods were previously investigated to enhance the adsorptive ability of the natural adsorbents such as thermal activation delkash et al 2015 thermal activation stimulates both the dehydration of water molecules found inside adsorbent pores and the movement of cations inside the layer ma et al 2018 found that bentonite that was preheated at 300 c enhanced methane productivity by 29 higher than that achieved by non preheated bentonite the use of temperature at 300 c could maximize the dehydration enlarge the pores and enhance the release of ca2 and mg2 in chemical activation li et al 2017 found that treating zeolite by malic acid enhanced its adsorptive ability due to the increase of bronsted acid sites another possible activation technique is using surfactants such as cationic surfactants with a positive head this method enhances the adsorptive ability of zeolite to anionic head of lcfas coo and their nonpolar tails reeve and fallowfield 2018 6 2 2 lcfas adsorption related modelling previous research works attempted to improve predict the lcfas inhibition and methane production from lcfas contained substrates using international water association iwa anaerobic digestion model no1 adm1 astals et al 2014 palatsi et al 2010 spyridonidis et al 2018 zonta et al 2013 zonta et al 2013 used oleate as substrate made a modification on adm1 and gave a descriptive model for lcfas inhibition authors defined the inhibition function of lcfas over the ß oxidizing bacteria via eq 7 7 ixfa kxfa kxfa sfa bio 1 where kxfa is inhibitory concentration coefficient and sfa bio is the portion of lcfas adsorbed on the surface of the biomass which was assumed as the only possible source of inhibition importantly the proposed model included both of the adsorption process of lcfas upon the surface of the biomass and the subsequent lcfas caused damage of a specific portion of the biomass however the proposed model could not describe the digestion of lcfas if the inhibition did not occur as in case of the treatment of thermally pretreated slaughterhouse wastes by acclimated inoculum spyridonidis et al 2018 later spyridonidis et al 2018 solved the aforementioned problem and provided a mathematical model that could effectively describe the response of cstr treating slaughterhouse wastes in the absence and presence of inhibition however the model could not predict the reactor response if it was exposed to sudden increase in olr recently the kinetic constants i e consumption rate constant and half saturation coefficients of palmitic stearic and oleic were provided in a modified adm1 simulation eftaxias et al 2020 comparing the values gotten by model with the experimentally observed values showed that the values from adm1 were close to practical values 7 further research directions co digestion with cations rich substrates the potential of co digestion of lcfa containing and cations containing substrates could be investigated here we provide three possible substrates paperboard mill sludge pms and gelatinaceous wastewater gww with high calcium contents of 17 9 1 1 and 3 2 0 15 g ca2 l respectively elsamadony and tawfik 2015 meky et al 2020 mostafa et al 2017 2016 lime mud filtrate lmf with ca2 na and fe2 contents of 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 1 0 3 g l munera echeverri et al 2018 shao et al 2019 j zhang et al 2018 inexpensive materials supplementation the supplementation of inexpensive materials into reactors treating lcfas containing wastes is recommended for instance biochar can be utilized since it has high surface area e g 3170 m2 g and micropore volume e g 0 86 cm3 g biochar previously exhibited excellent performance in terms of boosting methanogenesis rate and yield as well as accelerating the reaction startup liu et al 2019 diet mediated lcfas digestion the supplementation of conductive materials cms is employed for the stimulation of direct interspecies electron transfer diet which refers to the direct free transfer of electrons from acetogens acidogens to methanogens martins et al 2018 through diet stimulation various digestion obstacles could be overcome such as the high toxicity or limited hydrolysis of the utilized substrate feng et al 2018 mostafa et al 2020a this is because of the thermodynamic advantages of diet as a fast electron movement pathway over conventional metabolites mediated electron transfer mmet pathways that depend on metabolites such as h2 mostafa et al 2020b specifically diet is more thermodynamically favorable than mmet since it does not consume energy for the generation diffusion of metabolites lovley 2011 therefore the syntrophic reaction among substrate oxidizers and methanogens can be enhanced as well as the inhibition caused by either high h2 partial pressure or short chain volatile acids accumulation can be avoided park et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yin and wu 2019 mostafa et al 2020c found that using magnetite and carbon nanotubes enhanced both β oxidation and methane generation from oleic acid in this concern we encourage investigating the enhancement of methane generation form lcfas by the supplementation of other cms that can work as diet stimulator such as granular activated carbon carbon nanotubes stainless steel and red mud mostafa et al 2020d yan et al 2017 ye et al 2018 conclusions and remarks controlling the lcfas induced inhibition is important to harvest high energy yield and maintain the stability of the ad process such inhibition is cardinally related to the lcfas properties and operational conditions in order to optimize the ad for lcfas rich wastewater optimal operational conditions were demonstrated as follows mesophilic temperature moderate lipids concentration and high saturated unsaturated lcfas ratio various materials utilized for mitigation of the lcfas caused inhibition such as cations and natural adsorbents i e bentonite and zeolite a general comparison between natural adsorbent and cation based chemicals can clearly indicate that natural adsorbent could acquire the superior results in terms of mitigating lcfas induced inhibition however the addition of cations specifically calcium ions seems to be one of the most appropriate option for implementing a quick recovery of previously contaminated effluents the strategy of adding bentonite followed by calcium ions seems to be more effective than the addition of calcium ions prior to bentonite this is because it is better to start with the additive that has physical impact upon lcfa i e bentonite and then the additive that chemically affects lcfa i e calcium ions can be added later additional advantage for early bentonite addition is that it can reduce the amount of calcium ions required in the subsequent step the enhancement in methane productivity due to the addition of these materials is not necessarily associated solely with the mitigation of lcfas inhibition rather all added materials should be referred as multi tasking antagonizing agents since these materials play multiple roles beside the mitigation of lcfas inhibition for instance natural adsorbent can effectively adsorb lcfas enhance buffering capacity supply the anaerobic media with alkali earth metal metals and promote microbial immobilization additionally cations supplementation can support both growth of biomass and mineralization of lcfas declaration of competing interest the

17235,the inhibition of the anaerobic digestion ad process caused by long chain fatty acids lcfas has been considered as an important issue in the wastewater treatment sector proper understanding of mechanisms behind the inhibition is a must for further improvements of the ad process in the presence of lcfas through analyzing recent literature this review extensively describes the mechanism of lcfas degradation during ad further a particular focus was directed to the key parameters which could affect such process besides this review highlights the recent research efforts in mitigating lcfas caused inhibition through the addition of commonly used additives such as cations and natural adsorbents specifically additives such as bentonite cation based adsorbents as well as zeolite and other natural adsorbents for alleviating the lcfas induced inhibition are discussed in detail further panoramic evaluations for characteristics various mechanisms of reaction merits limits recommended doses and preferred conditions for each of the different additives are provided moreover the potential for increasing the methane production via pretreatment using those additives are discussed finally we provide future horizons for the alternative materials that can be utilized more efficiently for both mitigating lcfas based inhibition and boosting methane potential in the subsequent digestion of lcfa related wastes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords long chain fatty acids anaerobic digestion inhibition cations supplementation natural adsorbent 1 introduction high concentrations of lipidic wastes lws cause operational problems in the anaerobic digestion ad reactors due to clogging and hindering mass transfer since the cellular membrane of anaerobes can be covered with lws causing the loss of proper cellular functions furthermore biomass floatation due to adhesion of lws leads to the loss of active biomass because of washout and foaming all these issues can deteriorate the operating efficiency of anaerobic digesters soltan et al 2019 tolba et al 2019 consequently an appropriate management of lws and their hydrolysis products in the corresponding treatment systems is an inevitable issue particularly in the industrial field mostafa et al 2017 lws such as waste frying oil rafieenia et al 2018 slaughterhouse waste yazdani et al 2019 and palm oil mill pome harris and mccabe 2015 are hydrolyzed to form long chain fatty acids lcfas which are also perceived as common lipidic pollutant elsamadony et al 2015a ning et al 2018 noteworthy based on the mccarty equation 94 8 of lipid fractions i e fog can be theoretically converted to methane and only 5 2 utilized for microbial synthesis during the ad process jeganathan et al 2006 accordingly considerable increase in methane yield after lws supplementation was reported compared to the other substrates i e carbohydrate and proteins most likely due to the more carbon reduced to methane in case of lws alqaralleh et al 2019 however the full degradation of lcfas to methane as an end product requires thermodynamically favorable conditions in the ad process i e δgo 0 saha et al 2019 this is because the β oxidation pathway that contains the catabolic reactions where lcfas can be broken down to acetate and hydrogen via acetogenic bacteria is an endergonic nonspontaneous reaction to overcome the thermodynamic unfavourability siphoning off the newly formed products i e acetate and hydrogen is necessary to maintain the concentration gradient in favor of reactants i e lcfas and drive the β oxidation pathway forward duarte et al 2018 therefore syntrophic collaboration between lcfas degrading acetogens and methanogens i e consuming the released acetate and hydrogen is essential to achieve the overall lcfas decomposition into methane and carbon dioxide oh and martin 2010 accumulation of lcfas triggers the inhibition and instability of ad process musa et al 2018 lcfas inhibition is likely initiated by their adsorption to the surface of microbes forming blocking layers kurade et al 2019 and thereby limiting the accessibility of nutrients campanaro et al 2019 soltan et al 2017 moreover the microbes fail to regulate the homeostasis such as intracellular ph due to the lcfas accumulation on the cellular surface amha et al 2017 long et al 2012 the inhibition caused by lcfas can be a reversible process since neither syntrophic acetogenic nor methanogenic activities are irreversibly damaged palatsi et al 2009 however the rate of lcfas accumulation on microbial membranes was found to be higher in the case of unsaturated lcfas compared with saturated types cavaleiro et al 2016 further lcfa caused inhibition is more significant in the thermophilic than mesophilic condition which can be attributed to the increase in lcfas solubility at high temperatures jiang et al 2018 in line with this trend lcfas calcium salt could be spontaneously formed in mesophilic condition leading to the mitigation of lcfa based inhibition in thermophilic condition however salt formation was found to be less and higher amount of calcium addition was required guo et al 2018 while addition of some materials e g cations and clays is likely an effective strategy to overcome the lcfas cased inhibition proper understanding of the mechanisms by which the possible inhibitions are mitigated is necessary for further improvement of biological lcfas treatment in this review based on several recent publications that handled the impact of lcfas on the ad performance and associated methane production the detailed mechanisms of lcfas cased inhibition as well as the possible strategies for the efficient methane production are discussed more specifically we provide insights into lcfas degradation pathways factors affecting ad system performance and microorganisms involved in the ad process as well as the relations among these perspectives this review also covers the recent strategies utilized for alleviating the adverse inhibitory impact of lcfas on the ad process such as treatment using cations and natural adsorbents the mechanisms of reaction impacts effect of conditions pros and cons of each additive are also discussed 2 classification of long chain fatty acids lcfas lcfas are classified into saturated mono unsaturated and poly unsaturated as presented at fig 1 these fatty acids are composed of carbon chains exceeding twelve carbon atoms verma and sharma 2016 the term of saturation represents that the carbon chain is bound to the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms on the other hand lcfas with one double bond c c are called mono unsaturated while those with multiple double bonds are named as poly unsaturated cavaleiro et al 2016 one of the main characteristics of the unsaturated fatty acids is the stretched intramolecular interaction due to the presence of double bonds causing the bended structure which leads to higher solubility for unsaturated compared to saturated fatty acids of similar molecular weight saturated fatty acids consequently remain in solid state at room temperature shin et al 2003 unsaturated lcfas have two configurations i e cis and trans as illustrated in fig 1 in which trans configuration has higher toxicity than cis chatgilialoglu et al 2014 in general lcfas are not completely soluble in water because their long hydrocarbon chains have hydrophobic property by increasing the length of carbon chains the solubility of lcfas decreases he and yan 2016 sousa et al 2009a indicated that palmitic acid c16 has around 2 5 times higher solubility than stearic acid c18 at temperature range 20 60 c additionally unsaturated lcfas are more soluble than saturated types for example solubilities of stearic acid c18 and linoleic acid c18 2 were 0 57 and 1 59 mg l at 25 c respectively mabrouk and dugan 1961 a double bond structure expands the intermolecular distance of unsaturated lcfas facilitating the interaction with water molecules thus solubility of lcfas follows an order of c18 2 c18 1 c18 chipasa and mȩdrzycka 2006 listed the degradation rates represented by first order kinetic rate constants k for saturated and unsaturated lcfas via aerobic treatment using activated sludge saturated lcfas showed k of 0 0071 h 1 for palmitic acid c16 and 0 0052 h 1 for stearic acid c18 while unsaturated lcfas such as oleic acid c18 1 and linoleic acid c18 2 had higher degradation rates k of 0 044 and 0 034 h 1 respectively the authors suggested that the dissimilarities of degradation rates for lcfas are associated with the variation of solubility chipasa and mȩdrzycka 2006 domestic and industrial wastewaters are often polluted by vegetable and animal fats which contain a range of saturated and unsaturated lcfas as depicted from table 1 waste vegetable oil contains high concentrations of unsaturated lcfas especially oleic and linoleic acids hidalgo et al 2013 kobayashi et al 2014 the high unsaturated lcfas content is also observed in the grease waste silvestre et al 2014 in contrast animal fats are found to be rich in saturated lcfas such as palmitic and stearic acids the wastes such as sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid wastes ofmsw hold trace concentrations of lcfas martín gonzález et al 2010 silvestre et al 2014 3 anaerobic degradation pathways of lcfas in the anaerobic environment lipids are subjected to lipolysis process via enzymatic attack by lipase and decomposed into glycerol and lcfas meng et al 2015 petropoulos et al 2018 glycerol is further oxidized during the acidogenesis stage to form volatile fatty acids leng et al 2017 in contrast oxidation of lcfas requires lcfas degrading acetogens and external electron acceptors i e flavin adenine dinucleotide fad and proton h to deposit electrons liberated from β oxidation cycle therefore degradation of lcfas considered as acetogenesis during the acidogenic stage only saturation of unsaturated lcfas could occur as a result of the acquisition of h2 molecules released at this stage sousa et al 2009 the β oxidation pathway is considered as a critical step in the breakdown of lcfas molecules ahmad and ghufran 2011 firstly fatty acid molecules penetrate the outer membrane via protein fadl towards the bacterial cytoplasm this occurs simultaneously with their activation to fatty acyl coa by the aid of fatty acyl coa synthetase facs klett et al 2017 fig 2 afterwards fatty acyl coa undergoes repeated cycles of β oxidation process where two carbon atoms are removed from the carbon chain of fatty acetyl coa ch3 ch2 nco s coa at each cycle generating acetate and hydrogen kougias et al 2016 the overall reaction of β oxidation process can be described by eq 1 finally acetate and hydrogen are utilized by acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens respectively to produce methane eq 2 and 3 1 ch3 ch2 ncooh 2h2o ch3 ch2 n 2cooh ch3cooh 2h2 2 ch3cooh ch4 co2 3 4h2 co2 ch4 h2o each cycle of β oxidation process consists of four consecutive enzymatic reactions of oxidation hydration oxidation and thiolysis the foremost oxidation reaction is stimulated by acyl coa dehydrogenase and responsible for extraction of two protons from fatty acyl coa the oxidized fatty acyl coa is further hydrated with the aid of enoyl coa hydratase by introducing water molecule to the double bond and forming 3l hydroxyacyl coa as declared in fig 2 this is followed by another oxidation reaction where two more protons are extracted to form β ketoacyl coa via 3l hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase producing nadh salama et al 2019 electrons e are donated from nadh to proton i e h forming hydrogen gas i e h2 as described by eq 4 lin et al 2016 4 nadh h nad h2 finally thiolysis occurs via the reverse claisen condensation catalyzed by β ketothiolase to separate the terminal acetyl coa which is further converted to acetate via acetate kinase leaving n 2lcfas to be subjected to a new β oxidation cycle brasen and schonheit 2004 the aforementioned metabolites of β oxidation pathway associated with lcfas expectedly have an even number of carbon atoms in the case of lcfas with odd numbers of carbon atoms propionate is also generated as a pathway intermediate sousa et al 2007a on the other hand the degradation pathway of unsaturated lcfas remains largely unclear for example previous study indicated that the complete saturation hydrogenation of unsaturated lcfas occurs prior to the β oxidation circle sharma et al 2015 while others proposed the availability of a direct decomposition of unsaturated lcfa via β oxidation in the absence of hydrogenation the latter reactions could take place via isomerase dependent pathway mediated by the extra three types of enzymes of δ3 δ2 enoyl coa isomerase eci 2 4 dienoyl coa reductase decr and δ3 5 δ2 4 dienoyl coa isomerase houten et al 2016 this cryptic point is still unresolved cavaleiro et al 2016 detected that c16 accounted for 79 of the intermediates when using c18 1 as the carbon source for the ad process while c18 denoted less than 13 similarly in the case of c16 2 the metabolites were c14 and c16 with percentages of 52 and 34 respectively likewise c18 2 was anaerobically degraded to c16 56 and c18 1 20 the standard gibbs free energy of reactions δgo for ad of lcfas are presented in fig 3 pathways such as c18 2 c18 1 c18 2 c16 0 and c18 1 c16 are considered thermodynamically favorable δgo 0 the reaction of hydrogenation pathway c18 1 c18 has never been detected in previous studies in the ad process despite being thermodynamically favorable δgo 78 6 kj mol sousa 2006 meanwhile the conversion equation of lcfas to acetate and h2 as final products reveals δg 0 meaning that this reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable as described in fig 3 oh and martin 2010 however the equation of complete conversion of lcfas to methane exhibits negative value of δgo therefore syntrophic interaction between acetogenic lcfas degraders and methanogens is essential to sustain low h2 partial pressure and efficiently degrade lcfas to methane cavaleiro et al 2016 salvador et al 2019 4 key factors affecting anaerobic digestion of lipids rich wastewater 4 1 effect of lcfas saturation degree the composition of lcfas in lws strongly affects the degradation behavior of lws in the ad process saturation degree of lcfas is represented by the iodine value iv 254 d ai mwi where d is the number of double bonds ai is the percentage of each fraction and mwi is the molecular mass kalayasiri et al 1996 in this context bio accessibility and bio toxicity relationships between lcfas molecules and their degraders can be identified by the iv value unsaturated lcfas with high iv value which have low melting point mp e g mp of c18 1 is 13 14 c are generally in dissolved form at ad operating temperature thus their molecules can easily access to lcfas degrading acetogens as illustrated in fig 4 in contrast saturated lcfas are presented in the solid form at ad process e g mp of c16 is 61 62 5 c therefore there is always a gap between saturated lcfas and their degraders wu et al 2017 which could explain the slow degradation and low methane yield harvested from saturated c16 compared to unsaturated c18 1 at low concentration on the other hand higher iv causes higher toxicity of lcfas to microbes such as acetogens and methanogens hidalgo et al 2018 pereira et al 2005 utilized the scanning electron microscope sem technique to differentiate the behaviors of c18 1 and c16 when they were used as sole carbon sources c18 1 as being in the liquid form was rapidly adsorbed onto the bacterial cell and further degraded to c16 on the membrane consequently the cellular surface was equally covered with a whitish greasy layer resulting in the encapsulation of cells the qualitative analysis of this lipidic layer showed that c16 accounts for 83 of total lcfas stuck on sludge membrane the accumulation of saturated lcfas mostly c16 on the bacterial membrane occurs possibly because i pathway of c18 1 conversion to c16 is faster than the subsequent c16 degradation under the continuous feeding condition of c18 1 and ii c16 degradation starts after the complete conversion of c18 1 to c16 wu et al 2018 however this was not the case when anaerobes were initially fed with saturated c16 in this case sludge retained its original dark color with small white spots as a result of c16 precipitation on bacterial membranes avoiding the sludge encapsulation pereira et al 2005 therefore the solid form of c16 at digestion temperature makes it less toxic to anaerobes and avoids its accumulation on bacterial membrane whereas c18 1 causes isolation of methanogens from their syntrophic microorganisms leading to the accumulation of cn 2 lcfas and hindering the lcfas degradation cavaleiro et al 2016 additionally lcfas exhibited direct toxicity towards methanogens not only acetogens lalman and bagley 2001 compared the effects of c18 and c18 1 on ad performance as role models for saturated and unsaturated lcfas although c18 witnessed a slow degradation rate compared to c18 1 c18 revealed a lower inhibitory effect on acetoclastic methanogens than c18 1 the toxicity of c18 and c18 1 started when their concentrations exceeded 100 and 30 mg l respectively likewise sousa et al 2013 investigated the effect of c18 1 and c16 as the sole carbon source on pure culture hydrogenotrophic methanogens of methanospirillum hungatei and methanobacterium formicicum in the study of sousa et al 2013 c18 1 revealed higher toxicity than c16 in which m hungatei was more sensitive than m formicicum 4 2 lipids content and lipid loading rates llr there are two major concerns associated with anaerobic degradation of fog i high concentrations inhibit acetogens and methanogens and ii accumulation of lcfas leads to cell membrane damage nutrient transport limitation and formation of acidic environment amha et al 2017 moreover high concentration of lipidic wastes i e fog reveals a rapid inhibition of the ad process as a consequence of metabolites accumulation i e hydrogen and acetate elsamadony et al 2015b usman et al 2020 complete degradation of lcfas i e fog metabolites via β oxidation cycles is thermodynamically unfavorable unless hydrogen partial pressure and acetate concentration are below 100 pa 10 3 atm and 420 to 2140 mg l cavaleiro et al 2016 oh and martin 2010 respectively this can be achieved only by sustaining adequate methanogenic populations that syntrophically co operate with acetogens to continuously consume the hydrogen and acetate released and sustain the stability of the ad process saha et al 2020 therefore lipids in ad process are usually used as co substrate with other biodegradable substrates that can enrich methanogens and are expressed as percentages of influent volatile solids vs sun et al 2014 reported that under olr of 10 gvs l day ad of co substrates food waste fruit and vegetable residues waste activated sludge and edible oil in semi continuous cstr under 35 c was optimized when lipid content was 60 of initial vs under these conditions maximum methane production of 706 ml gvs day was produced however methane production started to decline when lipid content was further increased likewise xu et al 2015 also noticed that methane productivity increased when fog based on vs was added as co substrate at content of 42 to food waste and municipal waste sludge in cstr under olr of 5 2 gvs l day and temperature of 35 c authors discovered that this enhancement was associated with 19 increase of extracellular polymeric substances eps generally eps is responsible for the formation of microorganism aggregates facilitating the syntrophic interaction between acetogens and methanogens moreover eps plays the role of protective layer against toxicants henriques and love 2007 on the other hand the reactor with higher fog content of 55 exhibited a reduction in the methane productivity by 37 possibly due to its toxicity effect similarly rodríguez méndez et al 2017 found that cstr reactor remained stable under llr from 0 16 to 0 32 gvs l day lipid content of 53 based on vs and temperature of 35 c with maximum methane yield of 519 ml gvs at llr of 0 32 gvs l day consequently previous literatures advised that to avoid lcfas accumulation and sustain stable ad process in continuous ad reactors llr should not exceed 0 4 gvs l day in case of lipid content ranging from 40 to 60 gonçalves et al 2012 neves et al 2009 rodríguez méndez et al 2017 4 3 temperature mesophilic condition of ad reveals higher process stability over thermophilic condition though increasing the temperature to a certain extent leads to better microbial metabolic rate zhang et al 2020 in addition thermophilic microorganisms are more sensitive to lcfas inhibition than mesophilic ones furthermore higher temperature leads to higher lcfas solubility and makes them more accessible to microorganisms as the results of the increased diffusion coefficients the accumulation of lcfas on the bacterial membrane is augmented and consequently the cellular activity is abruptly deteriorated jiang et al 2018 nzila et al 2019 for example bayr et al 2012 noticed that mesophilic ad 35 c of slaughterhouse wastes using continuously stirred tank reactor cstr could maintain a stable performance even when organic loading rate olr was fluctuating further such a condition revealed a higher methane yield of 965 ml gvs compared to 766 ml gvs recorded at thermophilic condition 55 c the low stability of thermophilic condition of slaughterhouse wastes can be related to not only lcfas but also ammonia lcfa synergetic co inhibition tian et al 2018 since high temperature promotes the conversion of ammonium nh4 to ammonia nh3 which is toxic to microbes massalha et al 2020 jeong et al 2014 discovered that optimum temperature is olr dependent during the treatment of pome using anaerobic baffled reactor abr mesophilic condition was found to be superior at olrs lower than 10 gcod l day while thermophilic condition generated higher methane at olr of 15 gcod l day the lcfas composition was also another key parameter e g thermophilic anaerobes were found to be more vulnerable to unsaturated lcfas i e c18 1 inhibition than mesophilic anaerobes hwu and lettinga 1997 hatamoto et al 2007b investigated the enrichment of mesophilic 37 c and thermophilic 55 c granules subjected to individual lcfas of palmitic c16 stearic c18 oleic c18 1 and linoleic c18 2 acids as the main carbon source as saturated lcfas are known with its low bioavailability to anaerobes in mesophilic condition thermophilic condition yielded higher methane productivity by 1 8 folds compared to the mesophilic condition when granules were fed with c18 on the contrary unsaturated lcfas such as c18 1 and c18 2 have shown three times higher methane production in the mesophilic condition compared to thermophilic condition most likely because increasing temperature boosted up the toxicity of unsaturated lcfas hatamoto et al 2007b this means that wastewater with high iv is better to operate under mesophilic condition while thermophilic temperature is preferable for low iv wastewater 5 microorganisms involved in the fatty acids rich ad process lcfas are formed in the ad process via hydrolysis of lipids rich substrates triacylglycerol which can be mediated by group of species mostly belonging to pseudomonas and clostridium genus baserba et al 2012 cirne et al 2006 these species can utilize triacylglycerol into glycerol and lcfas with the aid of excreted lipase enzyme for example predominant bacteria related to clostridium genus 33 belonging to firmicutes phyla were noticed in the anaerobic degradation of lipid rich swine slaughterhouse waste ning et al 2018 glycerol as the hydrolysate of triacylglycerol participates into the two acidogenesis degradation pathways i reductive pathway composed of glycerol 3 hydroxypropionaldehyde 1 3 propanediol 1 3 pd and ii oxidative pathway which involves the following conversion glycerol pyruvate short chain fatty acids acetate and lactate saxena et al 2009 species such as klebsiella pneumoniae enterobacter agglomerans enterobacter aerogenes and citrobacter freundii which belong to proteobacteria phylum as well as clostridium pasteurianum clostridium butyricum affiliated to firmicutes phylum can metabolize glycerol according to both reductive and oxidative pathways on the other hand lactobacillus reuteri descended from firmicutes phylum pursues the reductive pathway and requires additional substrates in yielding atp and forming reduction equivalents da silva et al 2009 saturation of unsaturated lcfas may take place during the acidogenesis process the detected bacteria capable of saturating the unsaturated lcfas are anaerobic ruminal bacteria belonging to firmicutes phylum with genera of butyrivibrio fusocillus selenomonas and clostridium buccioni et al 2012 hydrogenation of unsaturated lcfas mostly occurs by a combination of bacterial groups and is rarely mediated by individual bacterium h2 producing acetogens can degrade lcfas with carbon chains higher than 12 carbon atoms are listed in fig 5 a pure cultures studies discovered that not all species are able to degrade both saturated and unsaturated lcfas e g only syntrophomonas sapovorans roy et al 1986 syntrophomonas zehnderi sousa et al 2007b and thermosysntropha lipolytica svetlitshnyi et al 2009 have this ability in syntrophic interaction with methanogens of methanospirillum hungatei methanobacterium formicicum and methanobacterium strain jw vs m29 respectively to produce methane as final product in contrast syntrophomonas curvata zhang et al 2004 syntrophomonas palmitatica hatamoto et al 2007a and syntrophomonas saponavida lorowitz et al 1989 are able to degrade only saturated lcfas moreover thermosyntropha tengcongensis is a thermophile species capable of oxidizing saturated lcfas with carbon chains ranging from c12 to c18 as well as unsaturated lcfas i e c18 1 beside the ability for producing methane syntrophically with hydrogenotrophic bacteria methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus zhang et al 2012 species that can degrade unsaturated lcfas generally have the potential to degrade saturated lcfas however the opposite is not possible sousa et al 2009 this is probably because of the extra requirement of enzymes needed in the case of unsaturated lcfas degradation in the β oxidation cycles lcfas with even carbon numbers produce only acetate while odd types form propionate beside acetate fig 5b in the latter case both methane production and propionate degradation are completely depending on syntrophy occurrence among relevant partners sousa et al 2007a found that the enriched partners are syntrophobacter and smithella genus however it is quite difficult to specify which syntrophic partners will be activated under similar condition the reason is that the variety and number of syntrophes are so high hao et al 2020 in the mixed culture experiments high abundance of lcfas oxidizers and methanogens is required in order to sustain complete lcfas degradation process via syntrophic interaction ning et al 2018 found that the genera of syntrophomona as lcfas oxidizing bacteria and methanospirillum as hydrogenotrophic methanogen flourished during ad of lipid rich swine slaughterhouse waste highlighting the important role of the syntrophic association between these two types of microorganisms in the degradation of lcfas this was also emphasized by fujihira et al 2018 who investigated the microbial community in multi stages anaerobic baffled reactor abr showing that lcfas decomposition to methane started in the third and fourth compartments where the cooperation of lcfas oxidizers genera i e syntrophomonas syntrophus and syntrophobacter genus and hydrogen utilizing methanogens i e methanobacterium methanocorpusculum and methanoregula genus was observed kurade et al 2019 found that fog with volumetric ratio 25 v v augmented the relative abundance of acetogenic lcfa oxidizers sporosarcina and syntrophomonas to 41 and 11 respectively as well as methanosarcina to 95 achieving in the efficient degradation of lcfas to methane similarly co existence of syntrophus genus and acetoclastic methanosaeta facilitated lcfa degradation even in a psychrophilic condition 10 c and improved methane yields 79 85 from lcfa containing synthetic dairy wastewater singh et al 2019 in case of methanogens inhibition lcfas degradation could proceed with co occurrence of desulfonation this was confirmed in the anaerobic reactor treating c18 1 where methanogens were inhibited using 2 bromoethanesulfonate bes salvador et al 2019 the dominance of srb desulfovibrio aminophilus as well as acetate and sulfide as metabolites were observed salvador et al 2019 6 mitigation of lcfa induced inhibition by adding cations or natural adsorbents 6 1 cations supplementation in cations based mitigation processes by the addition of monovalent cations lcfas can be converted to suspended salts on the other hand precipitated salts of lcfas are produced when divalent or trivalent cations were added to lcfas dereli et al 2014 he et al 2011 iasmin et al 2014 kurnianto et al 2019a generally the addition of cations leads to promotion of ad performance through mitigating the lcfas toxicity and improving digestion stability dereli et al 2014 kleyböcker et al 2012 furthermore the counter ion presents along with the cation possibly influences ad of lcfas for example so4 2 with salt form of znso4 is likely able to stimulate the syntrophic interaction between srb and lcfas oxidizers that leads to hydrogen sulfide generation fig 5b then higher lcfas removal was found to be associated with znso4 supplementation compared to the case of zncl2 supplementation chuen et al 2019 however cations supplementation topic still has many questions to be answered e g is the formed salt completely or partially insoluble what is the benefit of the formed salts during the subsequent digestion process what can be the change in bio degradability bio accessibility of such lcfas salts compared to raw lcfas and so forth 6 1 1 suspended lcfas micelles formation via saponification saponification is a hydrolysis reaction where the hydroxide group of an alkali attacks and breaks the ester bonds formed between fatty acid and glycerol of triglyceride tg leading to the release of glycerol and free fatty acid eq 5 chanakaewsomboon et al 2019 5 tg 3 moh δ 3 rco o m c 2 h 5 coh saponification occurred by the addition of naoh or koh functions as a pretreatment method for lipidic wastes thermal energy is utilized for catalyzing saponification reaction khuntia et al 2017 consequently insoluble tg molecules could be converted to suspended lcfas salt micelles which improves the contact between microorganisms and organic matters salama et al 2019 fig s1 shows an example of glyceryl trioleate saponification firstly hydroxide ion oh dissociated from the strong base attacks the carbonyl in the carboxylic group cooh of the trioleate forming an unstable intermediate next alkoxide group ro is expulsed from the intermediate leaving the fatty acids which is then deprotonated by the attack of ro forming glycerol and oleate anion the anion reacts later with the metal ions na and forms suspended sodium saponified oleate micelles eze et al 2015 the saponification therefore produces saponified lcfa that has a similar structure to surfactants the saponification process reduces the solubility of lcfas since it causes a neutralization for the polar head hydroxyl group of lcfas however if an oil particle is presented along with the lcfas in the media the saponified lcfa can facilitate the dissolving dispersion of this oil particle in water to be specific the hydrophobic tails of saponified lcfa are directed to the oily contaminant while the hydrophilic heads are directed to outer layer this leads to dispersed micelles formation shah et al 2016 silverstein 1998 using a combination of naoh and koh kurnianto et al 2019a saponified air floated dairy industry waste for 1 5 hour at 70 c then fed the saponified waste into anaerobic reactor kurnianto et al 2019a found that the na bearing soap is hard and homogenous while the k bearing soap was soft and heterogenous this might be because k has larger atomic size than na and thus the electrostatic attraction force between lcfa and k is weaker than that for na therefore the soap formed with k is likely softer than that with na kurnianto et al 2019a the soft soap provided superior results in terms of digestion efficiency than hard soap such a conclusion was provided by mouneimne et al 2003 who hypothesized that the reason may be related to the toxicity of high concentration of na in this regard moderate methanogenic inhibition was found to occur at concentrations of 3 5 5 5 g na l and approximately 8 g k l magdalena et al 2019 zha et al 2020 battimelli et al 2009 explored the impact of saponification pretreatment for two kinds of slaughterhouse wastes aero floated fats vs solid carcasses fats using naoh on biogas production harvested from mesophilic and thermophilic ad batch processes the authors noticed that there is a significant enhancement in biogas production rate in case of saponified waste with higher influence in mesophilic ad conditions indicating that saponified form of lcfas has higher bioavailability to anaerobes than raw form of lcfas the same wastes were further investigated using different saponification pretreatment temperatures of 60 120 and 150 c then subjected to mesophilic digestion in fed batch reactors battimelli et al 2010 the optimum pretreatment temperature was found to be 120 c where the biodegradation bioavailability was improved by saponification with insignificant alteration of fatty acids composition kurnianto et al 2019 studied the impact of different doses of base mixture of naoh and koh at 0 5 and 1 1 gbase l utilized for the saponification pretreatment of dairy fat waste saponification at both doses enhanced the hydrolysis twenty times higher than control however high base dose caused an inhibition for bacteria in the digester and reduced methane yield in the saponified waste containing reactor pellera and gidarakos 2018 in contrast stated that pretreatment temperature is a key influence parameter rather than base doses table 2 summarizes the positive impact of saponification on the ad process 6 1 2 insoluble lcfas salt formation lcfas are ionized under the alkaline or neutral conditions to carboxylate ions rcoo mouneimne et al 2003 therefore when metal ions are available in water oil medium they can react with ionized fatty acids rcoo to produce lcfas metal salt as highlighted in eq 6 ye et al 2013 6 n rcooh m n rcoo n m nh n 2 unlike na and k divalent cations e g ca2 and mg2 or higher multivalent cations produce soaps that form water insoluble precipitates pratiwi et al 2017 in short the monovalent metal can form suspended micelles of lcfa salt while the divalent or trivalent metal forms insoluble lcfa salt dereli et al 2014 he et al 2011 iasmin et al 2014 kurnianto et al 2019a highly soluble metal halides e g cacl2 have higher ability to mitigate the inhibition of fatty acids compared to the oxides or sulfates e g cao and caso4 both of which are poorly soluble in water ye et al 2013 further saturated lcfas are more vulnerable to reaction with metal ions than unsaturated lcfas torcello gómez et al 2018 use of cacl2 was found to play an antagonistic role against the inhibition of lipid derived lcfas during the treatment of swine wastewater ahn et al 2006 table 3 in batch tests ahn et al 2006 investigated the optimum ca2 dosage within the range from 1 to 7 g l using cacl2 the authors found that the optimum ca2 concentration was 3 g l at which methane yield was augmented by 9 higher than control they affirmed the salt formation by monitoring ph inside the reactor where initial ph of 7 was dropped to 6 51 and 6 34 in the control ca2 free reactor and ca2 containing reactor respectively the lower ph in the ca2 loaded reactor can be associated with h release as shown in eq 6 moreover zhang et al 2011 found that in case of control no ca2 addition fed with linoleic acid the syntrophic reaction between acetogenic degraders and methanogens was hindered and then negligible amount of methane was released 8 of the theoretical methane production addition of 4 g l of cacl2 however accelerated the bioconversion rate of linoleic acid to acetate via β oxidation and the produced methane was 93 7 of the theoretical methane production indicating the successful metabolism of almost all added linoleic acid to methane another evidence for calcium salt formation was noticed by kobayashi et al 2014 through analyzing the residual sludge after being harvested from two batch reactors i e control and ca2 supplemented batch reactor where both of them were fed by restaurant grease trap waste deoiling kobayashi et al 2014 tested various food to mass ratios f m of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 1 9 gcod gvss a significant drop in the methane production rate from 3 9 to 1 ml gvss d occurred for control batch when f m exceeded 1 0 gcod gvss on the other hand ca2 supplemented batch witnessed a slight drop in the methane production rate from 4 9 to 3 8 ml gvss d when f m exceeded 1 5 gcod gvss the performance difference among the two batches was assigned to the formation of small white particles 0 5 1 mm inside ca2 supplemented reactor such particles consisted of calcium salts of palmitate and stearate were found to be beneficial for both reducing lcfas inhibition and avoiding microbial cell blocking the mixing mode could affect the size of the formed lcfas aggregates e g gentle mixing produced large balls 2 3 cm size dereli et al 2014 in addition to calcium a previous work by ivanov et al 2002 indicated that iron ions have potential for enhancing the degradation of lcfas causing an uplift in methane production by 63 at iron concentration of 0 25 g l compared to the control iron free condition recently shim and chan 2018 found that 10 mg l of cucl2 were able to reduce the effluent concentration of lcfas during ad of food waste by 95 less than control reactor as a result methane yield was augmented to 0 33 l gcod while control yielded only 0 17 l gcod similarly the same authors investigated the ability of znso4 and zncl2 to catalyze ad of lcfas from food waste chuen et al 2019 both znso4 and zncl2 at concentration of 100 mg l boosted the methane yield to around 0 36 l gcod control reactor yielded only 0 17 l gcod the authors elaborated this enhancement by two practically proved mechanisms i the decrease of lcfas adsorbed onto bacterial membrane via lcfas m2 precipitates formation and ii bacterial activity stimulation due to the promotion of enzymatic activities in the presence of zn2 e g hydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase the timing of adding the metal containing chemical and keeping high biomass to lcfas ratio inside the anaerobic reactor play significant role in the mitigation of lcfas inhibition palatsi et al 2009 salama et al 2019 three scenarios can be applied for the supplementation of metal containing chemical into ad i concurrent addition in which metal containing chemical is mixed with lipidic contaminant prior to being introduced to anaerobic consortia fig 6 a ii early addition of metal containing chemical to bacteria before feeding with lipid wastewater fig 6b and iii late addition by providing the metal containing chemical to the bacteria after the occurrence of lcfas inhibition as it was hypothesized by salama et al 2019 fig 6c the immediate addition of calcium chloride i e addition right after the inhibition occurrence was recommended in the case of lauric based inhibition by koster 1987 for methanogenic activity restoration ca2 addition should not be later than several minutes after lauric inhibition occurrence late addition by 6 h could not antagonize the inhibition similarly zhang et al 2011 highlighted that either instant or early addition of cacl2 could minimize the linoleic acid based inhibition similarly the delay in calcium addition by 25 and 20 h led to insignificant limitation for the inhibition caused by linoleic and oleic acids respectively wu et al 2017 zhang and jahng 2010 therefore according to previous literature early addition of cations is highly recommended to avoid lcfas inhibition 6 1 3 role of metal ions adsorbed on microbial cells the co occurrence of suspended and or precipitate lcfas salt formation as well as ions adsorption on microbial membrane was previously reported for instance zhang and jahng 2010 firstly added calcium ions and then after 25 hours linoleic acid was added the authors found that 0 64 to 0 80 g ca2 l was attached to the cellular membrane prior to c18 2 addition therefore the authors concluded that adsorption of calcium ions onto the cellular surface could play a role in biomass protection and final detoxification in short metal ions supplementation in the anaerobic media often stimulates bacteria activities during the ad process of lipidic wastes bagwell et al 2008 in term of enzymatic activities lipase enzyme secreted from pseudomonas fluorescens was catalyzed by fe2 during the feeding of olive oil and at the same time ca2 was found to have a role in the fixation of lipase active sites jaeger et al 1994 the impact of ca2 on lipase enzyme was explained in detail by torcello gómez et al 2018 who illustrated that adsorbed ca2 has electrostatic interactions with the negative charge of lipase enzyme resulting in a reduction for the intermolecular repulsion force between lipase molecules and triglyceride tg other studies also observed the stimulation of lipase activity in the presence of ca2 hendriks et al 2018 mostafa et al 2017 li and ma 2014 investigated the effect of various metal ions i e mg2 ca2 fe2 and cu2 originated from mgso4 cacl2 feso4 and cuso4 respectively on the activities of four enzymes involved in β oxidation process mg2 at concentration of 388 mg l boosted the activities of acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase and l 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase in addition 400 mg l of ca2 achieved the highest activities of acyl coa dehydrogenase and enoyl coa hydratase while ca2 concentration of 320 and 80 mg l augmented the activity of l 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase however when ca2 concentration exceeded 320 mg l a drastic reduction in the activity of enzymes was noticed in contrast to mg2 and ca2 fe2 showed inhibitory effect on acyl coa dehydrogenase even at low concentration of 55 8 mg l 1 mmol l despite of being able to stimulate enoyl coa hydratase l 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase finally cu2 could catalyze only enoyl coa hydratase at concentration of 6 4 mg l and suppressed the other three enzymes li and ma 2014 the results on fe2 treatment needs further research since it is not consistent with previous literature for instance fe2 did not show an inhibitory impact upon acyl coa dehydrogenase in a previous research lee and schulz 1979 furthermore the effect of ca2 mixture of ca oh 2 and cacl2 at molar ratio of 1 1 on microbial community was investigated in the ad using fog as substrate by salama et al 2020 the authors showed that ca2 concentration of 1 g l doubled the relative abundance of syntrophomonas genus since the presence of metals is essential for mitigating lcfas induced inhibition and protecting the bacterial community from potential blocking there are some optimal metal concentrations that are recommended in the ad medium as noted in table 3 however when the concentrations of the metal ions exceed the optimal ranges the ad process can be adversely affected soltan et al 2019 6 2 natural adsorbents 6 2 1 mechanisms of natural adsorbents action in lipid rich digestions natural adsorbents usually have negative charge on their surfaces due to the unshared oxygens however this negative charge is balanced by alkali earth metal cations i e na k ca2 and mg2 presented in the adsorbent awad et al 2019 these cations are exchangeable and their exchanging capacities depend on the type of dominant cation temperature and utilized activation method i e thermal or chemical methods karimi and salem 2011 when adsorbent is supplemented to fermentation media these cations can be rapidly exchanged by h which is produced by acetogens via β oxidation step fig 2 therefore natural adsorbents can act as buffering agents that prevent accumulation of soluble organic acids zhao et al 2019 this was confirmed by zhang et al 2018 who observed that bentonite loaded reactor revealed higher methane yield and content of 564 ml gvs and 66 7 than the 479 ml gvs and 64 0 found in the control respectively this was accompanied with high effluent ph of 6 96 for bentonite supplemented reactor versus ph of 6 27 for control confirming h neutralization by cations exchange with bentonite fernández et al 2007 denoted that under anaerobic condition zeolite could release mg2 which reacted later with negatively charged ions po4 3 available in media forming mgnh4po4 precipitate milán et al 2010 likely lcfas ions rcoo has the potential to react with cations released from natural adsorbents and to possibly form lcfa salt suspended or precipitated as discussed in section 6 1 the adsorption process of fatty acids onto natural adsorbents can be classified into physical and chemical adsorption since the size of lcfas are close to the size of adsorbent pores the adsorption of lcfas into the adsorbent meso pores might be uncommon rather physical attachment between lcfas molecules and adsorbent surface via electrostatic interaction in addition to the van der waals forces can be a hypothetically possible mechanism in adsorption process das et al 2017 isernia 2014 on the other hand chemical adsorption may occur via cations exchange with acidic sites h on the adsorbent surface namely brönsted acid sites as noticed in fig 7 a the more si4 substitution by al3 the more brönsted acid sites are formed therefore adsorbents with higher al3 si 4 ratio can sustain higher adsorption capacity of lcfas isernia 2014 oxygen atom of carboxylate group the polar head of lcfas can be adsorbed to brönsted acid sites of al oh si groups by hydrogen bonding which is accompanied by the association of hydrogen atom of carboxylate with deprotonated al o si groups these h bonds can be formed according to the difference in the electronegativity between carboxylate and the surface of utilized adsorbent as shown in fig 7b gomes et al 2017 such adsorption is a temperature dependent process for example maddikeri et al 2012 noted that increasing the incubation temperature from 20 to 30 and 40 c caused decline in the adsorption ability for stearic and oleic acid lipidic membrane of bacteria is negatively charged and can be targeted by acidic sites of adsorbent mingeot leclercq and décout 2016 therefore adsorbent surface can act as a scaffold for the microbes in such a way that secures protection for biomass from being washed out and enhances substrate uptake arnaiz et al 2006 ma et al 2018 raposo et al 2004 reported that cstr with biomass immobilized on bentonite exhibited higher stability and better substrate degradation efficiency coupled with lower effluent vfas than bentonite free cstr recently impregnation of iron in the zeolite amended culture has been suggested to facilitate the biofilm formation in fixed bed reactor purnomo et al 2017 the significant increment in biogas production can be attributed to the advanced features of natural adsorbents which maintain the effective microbial community via immobilization as well as the growth of microbes on iron impregnated zeolite at batch reactor cavaleiro et al 2010 based on the way of supplementation fig 8 differentiates the practically proved mechanisms of zeolite impact apparently in case zeolite is directly added to anaerobes zeolite supports the microbial colonization since it works as a carrier for the anaerobes therefore if zeolite is withdrawn from the media afterward a deterioration for methane productivity may occur however in the case that zeolite is directly added to lcfas an efficient adsorption for these lcfas on the surface of zeolite will occur in this case performance deterioration is not expected to take place even if zeolite is withdrawn from batch reactor media nordell et al 2013 table 4 listed different types of natural adsorbents the utilized dosage the characteristics of natural adsorbent operational conditions and the effect on the ad process treating lcfas rich substrates different activation methods were previously investigated to enhance the adsorptive ability of the natural adsorbents such as thermal activation delkash et al 2015 thermal activation stimulates both the dehydration of water molecules found inside adsorbent pores and the movement of cations inside the layer ma et al 2018 found that bentonite that was preheated at 300 c enhanced methane productivity by 29 higher than that achieved by non preheated bentonite the use of temperature at 300 c could maximize the dehydration enlarge the pores and enhance the release of ca2 and mg2 in chemical activation li et al 2017 found that treating zeolite by malic acid enhanced its adsorptive ability due to the increase of bronsted acid sites another possible activation technique is using surfactants such as cationic surfactants with a positive head this method enhances the adsorptive ability of zeolite to anionic head of lcfas coo and their nonpolar tails reeve and fallowfield 2018 6 2 2 lcfas adsorption related modelling previous research works attempted to improve predict the lcfas inhibition and methane production from lcfas contained substrates using international water association iwa anaerobic digestion model no1 adm1 astals et al 2014 palatsi et al 2010 spyridonidis et al 2018 zonta et al 2013 zonta et al 2013 used oleate as substrate made a modification on adm1 and gave a descriptive model for lcfas inhibition authors defined the inhibition function of lcfas over the ß oxidizing bacteria via eq 7 7 ixfa kxfa kxfa sfa bio 1 where kxfa is inhibitory concentration coefficient and sfa bio is the portion of lcfas adsorbed on the surface of the biomass which was assumed as the only possible source of inhibition importantly the proposed model included both of the adsorption process of lcfas upon the surface of the biomass and the subsequent lcfas caused damage of a specific portion of the biomass however the proposed model could not describe the digestion of lcfas if the inhibition did not occur as in case of the treatment of thermally pretreated slaughterhouse wastes by acclimated inoculum spyridonidis et al 2018 later spyridonidis et al 2018 solved the aforementioned problem and provided a mathematical model that could effectively describe the response of cstr treating slaughterhouse wastes in the absence and presence of inhibition however the model could not predict the reactor response if it was exposed to sudden increase in olr recently the kinetic constants i e consumption rate constant and half saturation coefficients of palmitic stearic and oleic were provided in a modified adm1 simulation eftaxias et al 2020 comparing the values gotten by model with the experimentally observed values showed that the values from adm1 were close to practical values 7 further research directions co digestion with cations rich substrates the potential of co digestion of lcfa containing and cations containing substrates could be investigated here we provide three possible substrates paperboard mill sludge pms and gelatinaceous wastewater gww with high calcium contents of 17 9 1 1 and 3 2 0 15 g ca2 l respectively elsamadony and tawfik 2015 meky et al 2020 mostafa et al 2017 2016 lime mud filtrate lmf with ca2 na and fe2 contents of 0 2 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 1 0 3 g l munera echeverri et al 2018 shao et al 2019 j zhang et al 2018 inexpensive materials supplementation the supplementation of inexpensive materials into reactors treating lcfas containing wastes is recommended for instance biochar can be utilized since it has high surface area e g 3170 m2 g and micropore volume e g 0 86 cm3 g biochar previously exhibited excellent performance in terms of boosting methanogenesis rate and yield as well as accelerating the reaction startup liu et al 2019 diet mediated lcfas digestion the supplementation of conductive materials cms is employed for the stimulation of direct interspecies electron transfer diet which refers to the direct free transfer of electrons from acetogens acidogens to methanogens martins et al 2018 through diet stimulation various digestion obstacles could be overcome such as the high toxicity or limited hydrolysis of the utilized substrate feng et al 2018 mostafa et al 2020a this is because of the thermodynamic advantages of diet as a fast electron movement pathway over conventional metabolites mediated electron transfer mmet pathways that depend on metabolites such as h2 mostafa et al 2020b specifically diet is more thermodynamically favorable than mmet since it does not consume energy for the generation diffusion of metabolites lovley 2011 therefore the syntrophic reaction among substrate oxidizers and methanogens can be enhanced as well as the inhibition caused by either high h2 partial pressure or short chain volatile acids accumulation can be avoided park et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yin and wu 2019 mostafa et al 2020c found that using magnetite and carbon nanotubes enhanced both β oxidation and methane generation from oleic acid in this concern we encourage investigating the enhancement of methane generation form lcfas by the supplementation of other cms that can work as diet stimulator such as granular activated carbon carbon nanotubes stainless steel and red mud mostafa et al 2020d yan et al 2017 ye et al 2018 conclusions and remarks controlling the lcfas induced inhibition is important to harvest high energy yield and maintain the stability of the ad process such inhibition is cardinally related to the lcfas properties and operational conditions in order to optimize the ad for lcfas rich wastewater optimal operational conditions were demonstrated as follows mesophilic temperature moderate lipids concentration and high saturated unsaturated lcfas ratio various materials utilized for mitigation of the lcfas caused inhibition such as cations and natural adsorbents i e bentonite and zeolite a general comparison between natural adsorbent and cation based chemicals can clearly indicate that natural adsorbent could acquire the superior results in terms of mitigating lcfas induced inhibition however the addition of cations specifically calcium ions seems to be one of the most appropriate option for implementing a quick recovery of previously contaminated effluents the strategy of adding bentonite followed by calcium ions seems to be more effective than the addition of calcium ions prior to bentonite this is because it is better to start with the additive that has physical impact upon lcfa i e bentonite and then the additive that chemically affects lcfa i e calcium ions can be added later additional advantage for early bentonite addition is that it can reduce the amount of calcium ions required in the subsequent step the enhancement in methane productivity due to the addition of these materials is not necessarily associated solely with the mitigation of lcfas inhibition rather all added materials should be referred as multi tasking antagonizing agents since these materials play multiple roles beside the mitigation of lcfas inhibition for instance natural adsorbent can effectively adsorb lcfas enhance buffering capacity supply the anaerobic media with alkali earth metal metals and promote microbial immobilization additionally cations supplementation can support both growth of biomass and mineralization of lcfas declaration of competing interest the

17236,the large number of trace organic contaminants trocs in wastewater has resulted in severe concerns to human health ozonation and uv h2o2 are widely used to remove trocs in wastewater treatment process owing to the trace concentrations of trocs in wastewater real time monitoring of the abatement efficiency of trocs through ozonation and uv h2o2 is quite challenging instead of a direct measurement of all the trocs the research community has begun to use different surrogates to monitor the attenuation of trocs during aops various surrogates have been developed over the past few decades in this review the different types of surrogates are summarized including ultraviolet spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy strong linear correlations have been found for the removal of trocs using aops and the abatement of uv absorption spectroscopy at 254 nm or total fluorescence tf moreover a two phase linear correlation can better describe the ozone resistant trocs compared with a single linear correlation two different kinds of predictive models exist that use surrogates as the input for ozonation the regression model and kinetic model the development of the models requires a further understanding of the impacts of water quality seasonal variations and storm events on the kinetic parameters for the in situ monitoring system the light emitting diode led is one of the most promising light sources although the sensitivity and accuracy still need to be improved graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surrogate ozonation uv h2o2 trace organic contaminant troc uv absorbance fluorescence kinetics surrogate model sensor 1 introduction with the burgeoning population wastewater reclamation and reuse have become important issues to provide an alternate water resource in a number of countries trace organic contaminants trocs in the wastewater which include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disruption chemicals edcs have gained critical yet growing attention in recent years because of their potential risks to human health and serious adverse ecological influence such as bioaccumulation in fish disruption to reproductive systems in aquatic wildlife and dispersion of antibiotic resistance chon et al 2015 tijani et al 2016 wee and aris 2017 yang et al 2011 many trocs cannot be eliminated by traditional wastewater treatment plants kosma et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2005 the persistent trocs in treated municipal wastewater contributes as one of the major sources of trocs to aquatic systems thus developing advanced treatment processes to remove the trocs in wastewater is an urgent requirement to attenuate the wide range of trocs from wastewater the advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven to be effective methods benotti et al 2009 miklos et al 2019 salimi et al 2017 ozonation and uv h2o2 are the major aops that have been adopted in the full scale applications for the attenuation of trocs these are the most promising processes for worldwide application and installation alharbi and price 2017 wert et al 2009b the major challenge in the treatment processes for the elimination of trocs is the difficulty to monitor their removal efficiency in real time with the trace concentrations of trocs in the water on line monitoring or frequent analysis of each compound is costly time consuming and infeasible the best solution is to introduce a surrogate which is easier to measure as an indicator of the degradation rate of trocs during the aops the use of a surrogate provides a feasible path to evaluate the treatment efficiency and success so far many studies have attempted to explore surrogate frameworks to monitor the trocs in real time certain water quality parameters may be appropriate surrogates if they can be measured easily and frequently for example measurements of spectroscopic parameters such as uv absorbance and fluorescence are fast inexpensive and sensitive they require no reagent and little sample preparation prior to analysis park and snyder 2018 sgroi et al 2020 the spectroscopic parameters also show good correlations with the removal of trocs by ozonation and uv h2o2 treatments chon et al 2015 gerrity et al 2016 pisarenko et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 in this review different types of surrogates used in the ozonation and uv h2o2 processes for wastewater reclamation and reuse are summarized two commonly used surrogate frameworks total fluorescence and suva254 are comprehensively compared to predict the treatment efficiency of trocs moreover various predictive models that have been developed for the removal of trocs by ozonation are compared this timely review will provide useful guidance for the future development of advanced surrogates with high applicability 2 dominant surrogates in this section the commonly used surrogates for the removal of trocs fig 1 are summarized which include ultraviolet spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy and electron donating capacity edc 2 1 ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis ultraviolet visible spectroscopy is widely used in the detection of pollutants in water dissolved organic matter dom demonstrates a significant absorption signal in ultraviolet spectroscopy because dom usually contains structures like a conjugated double bond or oxygen and sulfur atoms that have an unpaired electron yu et al 2015 the dom molecules with conjugated double bonds exhibit a higher absorption signal in ultraviolet visible spectroscopy the changes of ultraviolet visible spectroscopy also present a good correlation with the removal of trocs gerrity et al 2016 among all the wavelengths in ultraviolet spectroscopy uv absorption spectroscopy at the wavelength of 254 nm uv254 is most commonly used in the characterization of doms in water it is a good surrogate for hydrophobic and aromatic compounds with a c c bond and c o bond in addition to 254 nm other wavelengths have also been used as surrogates such as 280 nm characteristic of aromatic ring huang et al 2019 li et al 2016c yan et al 2017 436 nm or 455 nm color miklos et al 2019 wert et al 2009b and the absorbance slope index asi table 1 audenaert et al 2013 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy has also been widely used to investigate and monitor the types of dom in wastewater the excitation emission matrix eem contains three dimensional information and can be used to characterize dom coble 1996 several methods have been developed to decode the information in eems such as the peak picking method sgroi et al 2017a fluorescence regional integration fri chen et al 2003 and parallel factor analysis parafac carstea et al 2016 li et al 2014 shutova et al 2014 tfaily et al 2015 peak picking method defined several specific fluorescence peaks of eems to represent different dom components sgroi et al 2017b fri technique divided the eems into five regions including aromatic protein aromatic protein ⅱ fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humid acid like chen et al 2003 the parafac is a multivariate data analysis technique which disassemble the eems into several fluorescence regions such as humic substances fulvic acids and phenolic compounds peng et al 2018 the total fluorescence tf can be calculated by normalizing the integrated volume under the eem surface to the projected excitation emission area with excitation 220 450 nm and emission 250 580 nm wavelengths using the fri method yu et al 2015 sgroi et al compared the different eem data interpretation techniques used as surrogates to predict the abatement of trocs in effluents after conventional activated sludge treatment sgroi et al 2017a they found the removal of recalcitrant trocs was not correlated with any fluorescence indexes the peak peaking and parafac modeling showed the best correlation with the degradation of trocs but the parafac model cannot be used to predict the high removal trocs the peak intensity at the excitation emission wavelength positions λ ex λ em 225 290 nm correlated well with the high removal trocs removal rates 80 such as triclosan caffeine and ibuprofen the fluorescence region related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine like components also correlated well with these high removal trocs the peak intensity at λ ex λ em 245 440 nm and the parafac component indicating humic like substances correlated well with the medium removal trocs 50 removal rates 80 i e atenolol naproxen and gemfibrozil the peak peaking method fri and parafac method were also used to monitor the presence of some trocs in rivers contaminated by wastewater discharges sgroi et al 2017b the concentration of typical wastewater markers in river water such as sucralose sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine were highly correlated with the humic like fluorescence sgroi et al 2017b 2 3 electron donating capacity the electron transfer capacity etc can be divided into electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc edc refers to the number of electrons that the dom can donate as electron donors in chemical reactions thus the edc of dom decreases after oxidation wu et al 2020 researchers have found that phenolic moieties contribute most to the value of edc aeschbacher et al 2010 the edc of dom can be a surrogate for examining the degree of micropollutant abatement because the oxidation of dom moieties competes directly with the oxidation of micropollutants chon et al used uv254 and edc to estimate the abatement of trocs and the formation of bromate during ozonation they found that the combination of edc and uv254 surrogates works better than uv254 alone chon et al 2015 2 4 other surrogates nitrate formation was used as a surrogate in the study conducted by song et al song et al 2017 they showed an excellent linear correlation r2 0 9 between nitrate formation and the abatement of five trocs in dissolved organic nitrogen don contained in synthetic waters and real water samples during ozonation the total organic carbon toc which indicates the level of organics also showed a good correlation with the removal of trocs in the uv h2o2 process yu et al 2015 3 relationship between surrogates and removal of trocs the existing literature has concluded that uv254 and tf are strongly correlated with the removal of trocs moreover different oxidation processes also exhibit a distinct correlation this study is focused on discussing uv254 and tf as surrogates in the ozonation and uv h2o2 processes the reason for the correlations between the removal of trocs and the changes of dom absorbance or fluorescence is because oxidation of trocs in aops is influenced by the competition with dom li et al 2016a the uv254 or tf of dom in water samples decreases after the aop which indicates the concurrent degradation of trocs present in the same samples the competition relationship can be described by the following equations 1 d troc dt i k i troc troc r i 2 d dom dt i k i dom dom r i 3 d troc troc k troc k dom d dom dom where ki troc is the second order reaction rate between troc and reactive species ri ki dom is the second order reaction rate between dom and reactive species ri ktroc is the observed reaction rate of the target troc in the aop k t r o c i k i t r o c r i and kdom is the observed reaction rate of dom in the aop k d o m i k i d o m r i here the relationship between the decrease of uv254 or tf and the removal efficiency of trocs was classified into two types based on our literature review the linear relationship and the piecewise linear relationship the detailed findings are discussed separately based on these two different relationships 3 1 linear relationship 3 1 1 linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs in the ozonation process ozonation is an attractive and effective treatment to remove trocs in wastewater effluents trocs can react directly with ozone molecules or indirectly with ozone through the oh radicals produced during ozonation whether it is a direct or indirect reaction depends on the specific second order reaction rate constants of a specific troc with ozone ko3 and hydroxyl radicals k oh the ko3 of different trocs varies from 107 m 1 s 1 to less than 1 m 1 s 1 while k oh is approximately 109 m 1 s 1 recent studies have already shown that the ko3 of each troc plays a vital role in the correlation between the removal of trocs and the spectroscopic surrogates park et al 2017 according to gerrity et al and stapf et al the trocs can be separated into five groups depending on their ko3 and k oh gerrity et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 the linear correlations of the trocs in the five groups mentioned from different works of literature are summarized in figs 2 and 3 and tables s1 and s2 stapf et al 2016 the compounds with correlation information but lacking ko3 are not shown in the figures and tables all the linear correlations in figs 2 and 3 and tables s1 and s2 are based on equation 4 the data with different correlations i e uv 254 uv 254 0 from several reports were recalculated or replotted the calculation of the differential of uv254 δuv254 uv254 0 or total fluorescence δtf tf 0 and the removal of trocs δc c 0 are shown in equation 5 gerrity et al 2012 4 δ c c 0 slope δ u v 254 u v 254 0 or δ tf t f 0 intercept 5 δ a a 0 a 0 a a 0 100 where a can be c uv 254 or tf the data from tables s1 and s2 were replotted to visualize the regression parameters between groups in ozonation for uv254 fig 2 and tf fig 3 based on the figs 2 and 3 most of the trocs in groups 2 3 and 4 exhibited good correlations with uv254 and tf the slopes and intercepts varied greatly among the different reports figs 2 and 3 gerrity et al summarized the relationship between the slope and intercepts of the correlation and the specific reaction rates the steep slopes suggest fast reaction rates of the trocs with ozone and oh and the low intercepts indicate that the attenuation of trocs and the decrease of uv254 or tf take place at the same time gerrity et al 2012 in contrast a lower slope for the fastest reacting trocs implies that they start to be oxidized before the decrease of uv254 and tf for the trocs with a moderate reactivity with ozone and oh in groups 3 and 4 they would normally have a lag in oxidation with a negative vertical intercept of the correlation the compounds in group 5 tcep showed small slopes and negative intercepts as expected gerrity et al 2012 pisarenko et al 2012 this is possibly because the tcep is resistant to react with ozone with a small ko3 so the oxidation of tcep starts later than the changes of uv254 and tf gerrity et al 2012 the strong correlation between trocs and uv254 or tf is clear but the major issue is that different trocs show different correlations to the removal of surrogates even the same compound has been found to have different relationships with surrogates in various reports the different relationships could be due to two reasons one reason is that different equipment was used to measure the uv254 tf and trocs raman normalization should be used in all the studies so the fluorescence results can be compared in different study also the detection limit for the same troc varies 100 times between different studies chon et al 2015 gerrity et al 2012 as results the 100 removal for the same troc is different between different studies which would affect the correlation results another reason is the small sample sizes used in some studies may over or underestimate the correlation between the surrogates and trocs therefore it is essential to summarize the patterns between the character of trocs and their correlation with surrogates from different studies there is a significant impact of ko3 on the slope and intercept of the correlation between uv254 and trocs p 0 001 as a result by relating the slope of the correlation between uv254 and trocs shown in fig 2 and table s1 to ko3 a nonlinear relation with a good fit is developed for the trocs in groups 1 5 fig 4 a r2 0 558 p 0 001 as shown in fig 4 the slope of the correlation between uv254 and trocs is significantly influenced by log ko3 and increases with log ko3 therefore a nonlinear regression is presented in equation 6 the relationship can be used to build a correlation for other trocs with a known ko3 moreover a similar plot using the intercept from fig 2 and table s1 was also developed fig 4b the log ko3 had a weak but significant effect on the intercept of the correlation between uv254 and trocs f 1 71 18 41 p 0 001 6 a m log k o 3 2 n log k o 3 b where a is the slope of correlation of δuv 254 uv 254 0 and δc c 0 3 1 2 linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs in the uv h2o2 process compared with ozonation uv h2o2 also has two major reactions for the elimination of trocs direct photolysis by uv light and oxidation by oh radicals miklos et al 2018 when h2o2 is irradiated by uv light oh radicals will be produced in situ these radicals are unselective and able to oxidize almost all organic compounds owing to their high oxidizing potential e 0 2 3 v ph 7 yu et al 2015 in direct photolysis the photochemical transformation and degradation of trocs are realized through raising the molecule to its excited state by absorbing uv light energy the photochemical degradation rate of direct photolysis is mainly determined by the molar adsorption coefficient ε and quantum yield φ sanches et al 2010 these two parameters are compound specific the molar absorption coefficient is the competency of a compound to absorb uv light at the determined wavelength and the quantum yield is the ratio of the number of degraded compound molecules to the number of photons absorbed by the compound the rate constant of direct photolysis k uv can be predicted based on equation 7 lee et al 2016 7 k uv 2 303 10 u 254 ɛ ϕ where ε is the molar absorption coefficient of a compound for uv irradiation m 1 cm 1 and φ is the quantum yield of photodegradation of a compound for uv irradiation mol e 1 u 254 is the molar photon energy at 254 nm u 254 4 72 105 j e 1 in the uv h2o2 process the large chromophoric organic matters have high molar absorptivity and can easily react with oh radical thomson et al 2004 these organic matters would fragment into small molecules with a slower reaction rate sarathy and mohseni 2007 yu et al 2015 the accumulated small molecules are further broken down to form the non chromophoric molecules thomson et al 2004 therefore the uv h2o2 process leads to a decrease of uv254 the tf of organic matter has also been found to decrease after the uv h2o2 process yu et al 2015 therefore there is also a similar relationship between tf or uv254 and the removal efficiency of trocs with the uv h2o2 treatment the trocs can be separated into three groups based on k uv and k oh group 1 includes the photo favorable trocs with minor degradation by oh radical oxidation group 2 includes the trocs that can be degraded by both direct photolysis and oh radical oxidation group 3 includes the trocs that undergo fast degradation with oh radical oxidation but that are resistant to direct photolysis yu et al 2015 yu et al showed a good linear relationship r2 0 65 between the surrogates uv254 or tf and the trocs for each group table 2 the elimination of a total of 39 trocs was evaluated during uv h2o2 and 18 trocs were selected and separated into three groups to determine the correlation with the surrogate a similar grouping was also reported by lee et al lee et al 2016 however lee added one additional group group 4 in which the trocs exhibited relatively low k uv and k oh the correlations between the δuv 254 uv 254 0 and δc c 0 are shown in table 2 the correlation also followed equation 4 as has been discussed previously the slope of the correlation decreased with k uv figure s1 however there was no significant impact of kuv on the slope of the correlation with uv254 p 0 05 even though oh is a strong oxidant and plays an important role in attenuating the trocs the k oh did not have a significant impact on the slope p 0 05 there is also a lack of a significant influence of kuv and k oh p 0 05 on the slope the insignificant correlation is possibly because there is less data for uv h2o2 than for ozonation to generate a reliable relationship however rosario et al showed the uv254 decrease of 90 95 can be attributed to oh radical oxidation for compounds in groups 3 and 4 rosario ortiz et al 2010 thus a relationship may be developed between the slope of the surrogate correlation and k oh for compounds in groups 3 and 4 if more data are collected tf as a surrogate has not commonly been studied in the uv h2o2 treatment gerrity et al discussed the possibility of using uv254 and tf to evaluate the degradation of trocs during uv h2o2 gerrity et al 2016 the abatements of 17 trocs in 10 laboratory filtered secondary wastewater effluents were correlated with uv254 and tf in bench scale experiments the correlation with uv254 is summarized in table 2 as discussed earlier for the same compounds the slope of the correlation with tf data not shown was smaller than that with uv254 which is consistent with the results from yu et al and miklos et al miklos et al 2019 yu et al 2015 the greater slope may indicate a more rapid response to the removal of trocs by uv254 than tf however tf showed a stronger correlation than uv254 with a bigger r2 for all trocs except atenolol gerrity et al 2016 tf as a surrogate to predict the removal of iopromide iop and carbamazepine cbz during uv h2o2 was also studied by mikols et al miklos et al 2019 a strong correlation r2 0 89 for cbz but a weak correlation r2 0 5 for iop were observed in the same study uv254 was strongly correlated with both cbz and iop table 2 miklos et al 2019 the reaction rates of compounds and decreasing rates of surrogates are the major parameters that affect the correlation gerrity et al 2016 similar decreasing pace between surrogates and trocs would result in a good correlation 3 1 3 linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs in other aops in a lab scale study conducted by miklos et al different uv aops used to remove trocs in municipal wastewater were compared and various surrogates were discussed such as uv254 color tf two components from the parafac model and fluorescence index fi miklos et al 2019 they found uv254 and tf showed the highest r2 values compared with the other surrogates for most of the uv aops uv h2o2 uv pds and uv chlorine furthermore the slopes of the correlation with tf or uv254 decreased with the increase of oxidant dose for the compounds in group 1 which were predominantly eliminated by photolysis therefore the surrogates for trocs in group 1 should only be used in a limited range of oxidant dosages miklos et al 2019 another study conducted by lee et al also found a strong linear correlation r2 0 9 between the degradation of dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride ddbac and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac with uv254 in a uv ps process lee et al 2020 moreover a linear relationship was found between the fluorescence parameters and trocs using fenton and fenton like treatments li et al reported the humic like region was strongly correlated with the degradation of trocs li et al 2013 however no studies have shown a correlation of uv254 or tf with trocs in a fenton treatment uv254 and tf as surrogates were used to evaluate the removal of trocs in hospital water by advanced electrochemical oxidation ouarda et al 2019 good correlations r2 0 65 were observed for the 9 of studied compounds such as caffeine clarithromycin and venlafaxine 3 2 piecewise linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs chon et al presented a piecewise linear correlation between relative residual uva254 uva254 uva254 0 and relative residual concentrations c c0 for each selected contaminant 17a ethinylestradiol ee2 cbz atenolol ate bezafibrate bzf ibuprofen ibu and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba chon et al 2015 there were one phase and two phase reactions for the different compounds with various ko3 the fast reacting contaminants in group 1 i e cbz and ee2 were described with one linear relationship fig 2 however the intermediate and slow reacting contaminants were inefficiently removed in the first phase but they were efficiently degraded in the second phase as a result two linear relationships with different slopes were developed for the contaminants with a ko3 below 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 the two phases were a δuv 254 uv 254 0 in the range of 0 30 and 30 70 respectively a similar two phase correlation has also been observed in other studies table s3 nanaboina and korshin 2010 song et al 2017 similar to the earlier correlation information all the linear correlations in table s3 are expressed as δuv 254 uv 254 0 and δc c 0 the slope in phase 2 was bigger than in phase 1 which indicated a faster reaction this is possibly because the compounds with k o3 below 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 start the reaction slower than the decrease of uv254 as discussed earlier therefore phase 1 may be defined as a lag phase the other explanation may be that the two phases have two dominant oxidants chys et al 2017 the first phase is dominated by ozone and the second phase by oh the ozonation of compounds in groups 2 3 4 and 5 can be fitted to one linear or two linear relationships based on the literature it is difficult to determine if the two phase linear relationship is better than the single linear relationship because every study used different water sources and experiment conditions moreover the sample sizes varied between the different studies therefore the r2 value cannot simply be used to compare the correlations from different studies it is useful to collate all the data about the same compounds from different works to show the correlation between the surrogates and the removal of trocs in this way there would be sufficient data to compare the single linear and two phase linear relationships this would also help to eliminate the artificial errors from different studies to achieve this one compound from each group except group 1 was chosen fig 5 atenolol from group 2 did not show two obvious phases and the slopes from the two linear correlations fig 5b were similar compounds from group 3 pcba and group 4 meprobamate showed good two phase correlations even the r2 of the two phases was smaller than the one phase so two different phases were observed during the degradation of these compounds with quite different slopes the slopes of phase 2 were almost two times higher than those for the first phase for the two compounds fig 5c f the reason for the compounds in group 3 and group 4 having a two phase correlation was possibly because o3 was dominant in the first phase and oh played a vital role in the second phase tcep from group 5 was a little different to the other compounds because it showed two phases the first phase was likely to be caused by the late start of tcep oxidation compared with the decrease of uv254 as a result the compounds from group 1 and group 2 were well related with a one phase linear correlation and compounds from groups 3 4 and 5 were better expressed with a two phase linear correlation 4 surrogate model for the predication of troc removal robust correlation models using uva254 and fluorescence surrogates have been developed to monitor troc during ozonation in recent studies chys et al 2017 nanaboina and korshin 2010 representative models include the regression model and kinetics model 4 1 regression model in addition to the regression model that was mentioned in section 3 1 an inflected correlation model was proposed by chys et al based on 9 trocs in groups 1 2 and 3 following the grouping rule mentioned in section 3 2 chys et al 2017 they found that the ozonation process can be divided into two phases fast ozone reactions and the reaction of oh radicals this inflected correlation model is similar to the piecewise linear correlation that has been discussed in section 3 2 the following equations 8 10 were developed chys et al 2017 8 a p 1 m ln k o 3 b 9 δ tro c 0 inflection a p 1 δ s δ s i 10 δ tro c inflection a p 1 i a p 2 δ s i δ s i where ap 1 is the slope of the first phase ap 2 is the slope of the second phase δs is the reduction of suva254 or tf and i is the inflection point between the two phases see fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the slope of the first phase ap 1 was linearly correlated with log ko3 and ap 2 was independent of ko3 moreover ap 2 was also not correlated with k oh similar to what was reported in section 3 3 the trocs in group 3 ko3 less than 10 m 1 s 1 showed a two phase correlation red region in fig 6 some trocs in group 2 with lower ko3 also exhibited an inflection point in this study the inflection point was 19 for uv254 and 47 for tf the two phase model can predict the removal of trocs within the 95 confidence interval 4 2 kinetic model many studies have investigated the correlation between the removal of various target organic compounds and the observational indexes based on the second order reaction kinetics model it is clear that both the organic compounds and the surrogates are mainly under the influence of ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the ozonation process therefore their degradation can be expressed as park et al 2017 11 d i dt k oh i oh k o 3 i o 3 i 12 d troc dt k oh troc oh k o 3 troc o 3 troc where i is the observed index such as uv254 or tf and troc is the target compound k o h i and k o 3 i are the o3 and oh second order kinetic constants the kinetic relations between surrogates and organic compounds are further built upon using the two equations nanaboina et al developed a kinetic model to express the correlation between absorbance decay δuv 254 uv 254 0 and pollutant degradation by ozonation for all groups nanaboina and korshin 2010 good fittings with experimental data were observed in their investigation of 13 selected pharmaceuticals by assuming that effluent organic matter efom consists of two kinetically and possibly spectroscopically distinct functionalities s1 and s2 and the ratio of the concentration of hydroxyl radicals and ozone γ o h o 3 o h o 3 is nearly constant under certain conditions the model can be expressed as equation 13 nanaboina and korshin 2010 13 t r o c 0 t r o c d ln t r o c r t r o c s 2 a 0 a d a d a ε 1 r s 1 s 2 s 1 0 s 2 s 2 0 r s 1 s 2 ε 2 s 2 14 a ε 1 s 1 ε 2 s 2 a f 15 r troc s 2 k troc k s 2 16 r s 1 s 2 k s 1 k s 2 17 k x k x oh γ oh o 3 k x o 3 where ε 1 and ε 2 are the molar extinction coefficients of the chromophores s1 and s2 respectively a is absorbance of wastewater and a f is the absorbance of unreactive wastewater chromophores r troc s 2 is the ratio of kinetic constants k troc and k s 2 r s 1 s 2 is the ratio of kinetic constants k s 1 and k s 2 x stands for the troc or s1 or s2 s1 is for the kineticially fast efom chromophores that react readily with o3 and oh species s2 is for the efom chromophores that are less kinetically active than the reactive sites s1 the actual γ o h o 3 can be assumed to be affected by the wastewater quality at a specific site this model suggests that the functional shape of correlations between the degradation of trocs and the absorbance change depends on specific water qualities and intrinsic factors of the trocs such as molar absorbance and absorbance of unreactive efom chromophores li et al applied this model to estimate the degradation of antineoplastic drugs ads and polycyclic musks pms in municipal wastewater li et al 2016a they suggested using pcba as a reference compound because it was known to be degraded only by oh radicals wang et al further modified the model by separating the efom chromophores into three components reactive chromophore uv254 s1 moderate chromophore uv254 s2 and inert chromophore uv254 s3 wang et al 2020 they found the non linear surrogate model provided a better description than the linear model for the complex water matrices this surrogate model considered the chromophore with different reactivities and was proved to be a fast and cheap method to estimate the degradation of trocs more research is still needed to test the applicability of this model to various trocs and water matrices 5 effect of different parameters on the correlation in wastewater with low doc high concentration nitrate would interfere the value of uv254 leenheer and croué 2003 however other studies found water matrices did not influence the correlations in the ozonation process gerrity et al 2012 wert et al 2009 the concentration of nitrate in three wastewater tertiary treated effluents ranged from 0 074 to 13 mg n l the toc ranged from 6 6 to 10 3 mg l and uv254 ranged from 0 14 to 0 26 cm 1 wert et al 2009 in gerrity s study the nitrate concentration in 17 wastewater matrices changed from 0 07 to 24 mg n l gerrity et al 2012 the determined correlations are similar between 10 of secondary wastewater effluents from the united states switzerland and australia gerrity et al 2016 the doc uv254 and no3 in those wastewater effluents varied from 4 7 to 26 4 mg l 0 099 to 0 410 cm 1 0 11 to 24 mg n l respectively moreover the ph of wastewater has a negligible impact on the correlation song et al 2017 although the concentration of trocs varied in different wastewater effluents such as atenolol meprobamate and carbamazepine changing from 320 to 2800 ng l 380 to 790 ng l and 200 to 430 ng l respectively wert et al 2009 consistent correlations were found for each troc in the different wastewater effluents 6 troc control strategies based on in situ monitoring of surrogates the optimal oxidant dosage is an important factor to be determined during aops there are generally two control strategies for using a surrogate to control the oxidant dose one is a pure feed forward process control the other is a closed loop process control clpc stapf et al 2016 the first strategy involves a non feedback control system which predicts the oxidant dose using surrogates such as doc or uva254 of the input water before the aop lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 wert et al 2009a for example in ozonation a model is developed based on the correlation between the attenuation of trocs and the specific ozone dose g o3 g doc fig 7 the abatement efficiency of the ozonation process can then be predicted using the model altmann et al 2014 however clpc is a feedback control strategy which uses uv254 as a surrogate to predict the elimination of trocs the aops can remove numerous light absorbing unsaturated organic substances which reduces the absorbance of wastewater wittmer et al 2015 as a result the correlations between the decrease of uva254 or tf and the attenuation of trocs that were summarized in section 3 can be used to adjust the oxidant dose to achieve the target removal efficiency of trocs unlike the first method without knowing the outcome of the ozonation process the feedback control method of clpc can control the oxidant dose to reach a constant level of elimination of trocs 7 current development of the in situ monitoring system 7 1 light sources of instruments for surrogate determination mercury or xenon lamps have mainly been used as the light sources for the online uv absorption and eem measurement analyzers currently on the market representative lamps are the spectro lyser v3 from s can messtechnik gmbh and the uv colorplus from sigrist ag wittmer et al used the uv colorplus in an ozonation pilot plant to determine the correlation of δuv 254 uv 254 0 and the removal of trocs wittmer et al 2015 a portable fluorescence sensor with a laser as the light souce was used to estimate the removal of ddbac using uv chlorine du et al 2020 they found that the results from the portable sensor were similar to those from bench fluorescence spectroscopy compared with uv254 tf is harder for an in situ application because the eem measurement relies on expensive instruments and the need to record a complete eem zielinski et al invented a sensor system using xenon flash lamps which can measure the full eems from λ ex λ em of 220 200 to 750 950 zielinski et al 2018 the xenon lamps have a high energy output in the uv vis ultraviolet visible regions but the in situ monitoring device based on xenon lamps has not been applied worldwide because of its large size and high cost li et al 2016c the most attractive optical sensor is the light emitting diode led compared with mercury or xenon lamps leds consume less power and have a compact size low price and long lifetime table 3 the early leds were only able to cover the 370 640 nm wavelength range hart and jiji 2002 recently leds based on aluminum gallium nitride algan multiple quantum well active layer designs can emit down to 250 300 nm the deep uv leds provide the possibility to replace the xenon lamps used for the in situ monitoring uv fluorescence device tedetti et al used aigan deep uv leds to develop a field portable fluorimeter with two optical channels 255 and 280 nm tedetti et al 2013 the fluorimeter successfully detected the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in marine waters moreover li et al constructed a novel portable led based device that was able to detect uv280 absorbance as well as humic like peak c and protein like peak t fluorescence li et al 2016c the led uv fluorescence sensor was tested to monitor the trocs during ozonation li et al 2016c however several challenges still hinder the led fluorimeter from industrial applications such as calibration reabsorption effects and inner filter effects bridgeman et al 2015 li et al 2016b the sensitivity and accuracy of the led fluorimeter still need to be improved carstea et al 2020 7 2 instrument maintenance the maintenance of the online sensor greatly impacts its performance and consistency because of the complex water environment in the wastewater treatment plants fouling on the spectral sensor can result in an unstable online uva254 and fluorescence measurement which is sensitive to interference such as small particles the particles may block the optical path but they can still exhibit fluorescence and result in incorrect results conmy et al 2004 chys et al observed significant differences between in situ and laboratory measured uva254 possibly because of the existence of particles chys et al 2018 therefore regular maintenance of the online sensor is essential such as routinely cleaning the sensor and equipping the sensor with automated brushes or filters wittmer et al 2015 a filter with 50 µm pores was found to be efficient in removing the particles over a duration of 2 months wittmer et al 2015 furthermore ultrasonic cleaning also helps to reduce the fouling of the sensor chys et al 2018 8 conclusions and perspective real time monitoring of the trocs and alerting the operator to treatment failure are critical in aops surrogates provide a stable sensitive and cost friendly method to estimate the elimination of trocs among the various surrogates uv254 and tf are the most widely studied and have been found to strongly correlate with the removal of trocs in both o3 and uv h2o2 processes uv254 and tf can be measured to monitor the removal of trocs in continue mode operation lc ms ms can be used regularly to check the accuracy of the correlation between the decease of uv254 or tf and the removal of trocs the nonlinear relationship between ko3 and the slope of the correlation with the surrogate provides a way to estimate the attenuation of trocs with known ko3 one problem related to the ko3 is that it is determined based on the clean water in the laboratory the effects of the water matrix on the ko3 need to be considered in future work moreover the linear regression of surrogates and trocs can only be applied with a consistent water quality which means sudden changes in the water source may lead to misleading predictions although predictive models using surrogates as inputs have been developed for the removal of trocs in ozonation the use of a surrogate s model in uv h2o2 and other aops still needs more exploration furthermore it is essential to understand the impacts of seasonal variations water quality and storm events on the kinetic parameters of the model and uv254 or tf in the development of the model the led has been proven to be a promising light source for the in situ monitoring system of spectroscopic surrogates for practical application owing to its low cost and long lifetime changing the measuring frequency to once every half hour will further lower the high strain on the lifetime of the light source future studies should continue to develop effective cheap fast and robust monitoring tools for in situ analysis moreover the wavelength of 254 nm may not be the optimal choice to use as a surrogate thus other wavelengths should be explored for example the wavelength of 280 nm characteristic of aromatic ring or higher may be better candidates because a lamp with a higher wavelength is cheaper furthermore the tf is difficult to apply in situ more attention should be paid to other fluorescence indexes such as humic like fluorescence and protein like fluorescence a combination of different surrogates for predicting δc c 0 will provide a new insight to understand the reaction mechanism of dom and trocs during aops future research is also expected to test the feasibility and applicability of the use of surrogates in monitoring trocs in

17236,the large number of trace organic contaminants trocs in wastewater has resulted in severe concerns to human health ozonation and uv h2o2 are widely used to remove trocs in wastewater treatment process owing to the trace concentrations of trocs in wastewater real time monitoring of the abatement efficiency of trocs through ozonation and uv h2o2 is quite challenging instead of a direct measurement of all the trocs the research community has begun to use different surrogates to monitor the attenuation of trocs during aops various surrogates have been developed over the past few decades in this review the different types of surrogates are summarized including ultraviolet spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy strong linear correlations have been found for the removal of trocs using aops and the abatement of uv absorption spectroscopy at 254 nm or total fluorescence tf moreover a two phase linear correlation can better describe the ozone resistant trocs compared with a single linear correlation two different kinds of predictive models exist that use surrogates as the input for ozonation the regression model and kinetic model the development of the models requires a further understanding of the impacts of water quality seasonal variations and storm events on the kinetic parameters for the in situ monitoring system the light emitting diode led is one of the most promising light sources although the sensitivity and accuracy still need to be improved graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surrogate ozonation uv h2o2 trace organic contaminant troc uv absorbance fluorescence kinetics surrogate model sensor 1 introduction with the burgeoning population wastewater reclamation and reuse have become important issues to provide an alternate water resource in a number of countries trace organic contaminants trocs in the wastewater which include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and endocrine disruption chemicals edcs have gained critical yet growing attention in recent years because of their potential risks to human health and serious adverse ecological influence such as bioaccumulation in fish disruption to reproductive systems in aquatic wildlife and dispersion of antibiotic resistance chon et al 2015 tijani et al 2016 wee and aris 2017 yang et al 2011 many trocs cannot be eliminated by traditional wastewater treatment plants kosma et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2005 the persistent trocs in treated municipal wastewater contributes as one of the major sources of trocs to aquatic systems thus developing advanced treatment processes to remove the trocs in wastewater is an urgent requirement to attenuate the wide range of trocs from wastewater the advanced oxidation processes aops have been proven to be effective methods benotti et al 2009 miklos et al 2019 salimi et al 2017 ozonation and uv h2o2 are the major aops that have been adopted in the full scale applications for the attenuation of trocs these are the most promising processes for worldwide application and installation alharbi and price 2017 wert et al 2009b the major challenge in the treatment processes for the elimination of trocs is the difficulty to monitor their removal efficiency in real time with the trace concentrations of trocs in the water on line monitoring or frequent analysis of each compound is costly time consuming and infeasible the best solution is to introduce a surrogate which is easier to measure as an indicator of the degradation rate of trocs during the aops the use of a surrogate provides a feasible path to evaluate the treatment efficiency and success so far many studies have attempted to explore surrogate frameworks to monitor the trocs in real time certain water quality parameters may be appropriate surrogates if they can be measured easily and frequently for example measurements of spectroscopic parameters such as uv absorbance and fluorescence are fast inexpensive and sensitive they require no reagent and little sample preparation prior to analysis park and snyder 2018 sgroi et al 2020 the spectroscopic parameters also show good correlations with the removal of trocs by ozonation and uv h2o2 treatments chon et al 2015 gerrity et al 2016 pisarenko et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 in this review different types of surrogates used in the ozonation and uv h2o2 processes for wastewater reclamation and reuse are summarized two commonly used surrogate frameworks total fluorescence and suva254 are comprehensively compared to predict the treatment efficiency of trocs moreover various predictive models that have been developed for the removal of trocs by ozonation are compared this timely review will provide useful guidance for the future development of advanced surrogates with high applicability 2 dominant surrogates in this section the commonly used surrogates for the removal of trocs fig 1 are summarized which include ultraviolet spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy and electron donating capacity edc 2 1 ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis ultraviolet visible spectroscopy is widely used in the detection of pollutants in water dissolved organic matter dom demonstrates a significant absorption signal in ultraviolet spectroscopy because dom usually contains structures like a conjugated double bond or oxygen and sulfur atoms that have an unpaired electron yu et al 2015 the dom molecules with conjugated double bonds exhibit a higher absorption signal in ultraviolet visible spectroscopy the changes of ultraviolet visible spectroscopy also present a good correlation with the removal of trocs gerrity et al 2016 among all the wavelengths in ultraviolet spectroscopy uv absorption spectroscopy at the wavelength of 254 nm uv254 is most commonly used in the characterization of doms in water it is a good surrogate for hydrophobic and aromatic compounds with a c c bond and c o bond in addition to 254 nm other wavelengths have also been used as surrogates such as 280 nm characteristic of aromatic ring huang et al 2019 li et al 2016c yan et al 2017 436 nm or 455 nm color miklos et al 2019 wert et al 2009b and the absorbance slope index asi table 1 audenaert et al 2013 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy has also been widely used to investigate and monitor the types of dom in wastewater the excitation emission matrix eem contains three dimensional information and can be used to characterize dom coble 1996 several methods have been developed to decode the information in eems such as the peak picking method sgroi et al 2017a fluorescence regional integration fri chen et al 2003 and parallel factor analysis parafac carstea et al 2016 li et al 2014 shutova et al 2014 tfaily et al 2015 peak picking method defined several specific fluorescence peaks of eems to represent different dom components sgroi et al 2017b fri technique divided the eems into five regions including aromatic protein aromatic protein ⅱ fulvic acid like soluble microbial by product like and humid acid like chen et al 2003 the parafac is a multivariate data analysis technique which disassemble the eems into several fluorescence regions such as humic substances fulvic acids and phenolic compounds peng et al 2018 the total fluorescence tf can be calculated by normalizing the integrated volume under the eem surface to the projected excitation emission area with excitation 220 450 nm and emission 250 580 nm wavelengths using the fri method yu et al 2015 sgroi et al compared the different eem data interpretation techniques used as surrogates to predict the abatement of trocs in effluents after conventional activated sludge treatment sgroi et al 2017a they found the removal of recalcitrant trocs was not correlated with any fluorescence indexes the peak peaking and parafac modeling showed the best correlation with the degradation of trocs but the parafac model cannot be used to predict the high removal trocs the peak intensity at the excitation emission wavelength positions λ ex λ em 225 290 nm correlated well with the high removal trocs removal rates 80 such as triclosan caffeine and ibuprofen the fluorescence region related to aromatic proteins and tyrosine like components also correlated well with these high removal trocs the peak intensity at λ ex λ em 245 440 nm and the parafac component indicating humic like substances correlated well with the medium removal trocs 50 removal rates 80 i e atenolol naproxen and gemfibrozil the peak peaking method fri and parafac method were also used to monitor the presence of some trocs in rivers contaminated by wastewater discharges sgroi et al 2017b the concentration of typical wastewater markers in river water such as sucralose sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine were highly correlated with the humic like fluorescence sgroi et al 2017b 2 3 electron donating capacity the electron transfer capacity etc can be divided into electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc edc refers to the number of electrons that the dom can donate as electron donors in chemical reactions thus the edc of dom decreases after oxidation wu et al 2020 researchers have found that phenolic moieties contribute most to the value of edc aeschbacher et al 2010 the edc of dom can be a surrogate for examining the degree of micropollutant abatement because the oxidation of dom moieties competes directly with the oxidation of micropollutants chon et al used uv254 and edc to estimate the abatement of trocs and the formation of bromate during ozonation they found that the combination of edc and uv254 surrogates works better than uv254 alone chon et al 2015 2 4 other surrogates nitrate formation was used as a surrogate in the study conducted by song et al song et al 2017 they showed an excellent linear correlation r2 0 9 between nitrate formation and the abatement of five trocs in dissolved organic nitrogen don contained in synthetic waters and real water samples during ozonation the total organic carbon toc which indicates the level of organics also showed a good correlation with the removal of trocs in the uv h2o2 process yu et al 2015 3 relationship between surrogates and removal of trocs the existing literature has concluded that uv254 and tf are strongly correlated with the removal of trocs moreover different oxidation processes also exhibit a distinct correlation this study is focused on discussing uv254 and tf as surrogates in the ozonation and uv h2o2 processes the reason for the correlations between the removal of trocs and the changes of dom absorbance or fluorescence is because oxidation of trocs in aops is influenced by the competition with dom li et al 2016a the uv254 or tf of dom in water samples decreases after the aop which indicates the concurrent degradation of trocs present in the same samples the competition relationship can be described by the following equations 1 d troc dt i k i troc troc r i 2 d dom dt i k i dom dom r i 3 d troc troc k troc k dom d dom dom where ki troc is the second order reaction rate between troc and reactive species ri ki dom is the second order reaction rate between dom and reactive species ri ktroc is the observed reaction rate of the target troc in the aop k t r o c i k i t r o c r i and kdom is the observed reaction rate of dom in the aop k d o m i k i d o m r i here the relationship between the decrease of uv254 or tf and the removal efficiency of trocs was classified into two types based on our literature review the linear relationship and the piecewise linear relationship the detailed findings are discussed separately based on these two different relationships 3 1 linear relationship 3 1 1 linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs in the ozonation process ozonation is an attractive and effective treatment to remove trocs in wastewater effluents trocs can react directly with ozone molecules or indirectly with ozone through the oh radicals produced during ozonation whether it is a direct or indirect reaction depends on the specific second order reaction rate constants of a specific troc with ozone ko3 and hydroxyl radicals k oh the ko3 of different trocs varies from 107 m 1 s 1 to less than 1 m 1 s 1 while k oh is approximately 109 m 1 s 1 recent studies have already shown that the ko3 of each troc plays a vital role in the correlation between the removal of trocs and the spectroscopic surrogates park et al 2017 according to gerrity et al and stapf et al the trocs can be separated into five groups depending on their ko3 and k oh gerrity et al 2012 stapf et al 2016 the linear correlations of the trocs in the five groups mentioned from different works of literature are summarized in figs 2 and 3 and tables s1 and s2 stapf et al 2016 the compounds with correlation information but lacking ko3 are not shown in the figures and tables all the linear correlations in figs 2 and 3 and tables s1 and s2 are based on equation 4 the data with different correlations i e uv 254 uv 254 0 from several reports were recalculated or replotted the calculation of the differential of uv254 δuv254 uv254 0 or total fluorescence δtf tf 0 and the removal of trocs δc c 0 are shown in equation 5 gerrity et al 2012 4 δ c c 0 slope δ u v 254 u v 254 0 or δ tf t f 0 intercept 5 δ a a 0 a 0 a a 0 100 where a can be c uv 254 or tf the data from tables s1 and s2 were replotted to visualize the regression parameters between groups in ozonation for uv254 fig 2 and tf fig 3 based on the figs 2 and 3 most of the trocs in groups 2 3 and 4 exhibited good correlations with uv254 and tf the slopes and intercepts varied greatly among the different reports figs 2 and 3 gerrity et al summarized the relationship between the slope and intercepts of the correlation and the specific reaction rates the steep slopes suggest fast reaction rates of the trocs with ozone and oh and the low intercepts indicate that the attenuation of trocs and the decrease of uv254 or tf take place at the same time gerrity et al 2012 in contrast a lower slope for the fastest reacting trocs implies that they start to be oxidized before the decrease of uv254 and tf for the trocs with a moderate reactivity with ozone and oh in groups 3 and 4 they would normally have a lag in oxidation with a negative vertical intercept of the correlation the compounds in group 5 tcep showed small slopes and negative intercepts as expected gerrity et al 2012 pisarenko et al 2012 this is possibly because the tcep is resistant to react with ozone with a small ko3 so the oxidation of tcep starts later than the changes of uv254 and tf gerrity et al 2012 the strong correlation between trocs and uv254 or tf is clear but the major issue is that different trocs show different correlations to the removal of surrogates even the same compound has been found to have different relationships with surrogates in various reports the different relationships could be due to two reasons one reason is that different equipment was used to measure the uv254 tf and trocs raman normalization should be used in all the studies so the fluorescence results can be compared in different study also the detection limit for the same troc varies 100 times between different studies chon et al 2015 gerrity et al 2012 as results the 100 removal for the same troc is different between different studies which would affect the correlation results another reason is the small sample sizes used in some studies may over or underestimate the correlation between the surrogates and trocs therefore it is essential to summarize the patterns between the character of trocs and their correlation with surrogates from different studies there is a significant impact of ko3 on the slope and intercept of the correlation between uv254 and trocs p 0 001 as a result by relating the slope of the correlation between uv254 and trocs shown in fig 2 and table s1 to ko3 a nonlinear relation with a good fit is developed for the trocs in groups 1 5 fig 4 a r2 0 558 p 0 001 as shown in fig 4 the slope of the correlation between uv254 and trocs is significantly influenced by log ko3 and increases with log ko3 therefore a nonlinear regression is presented in equation 6 the relationship can be used to build a correlation for other trocs with a known ko3 moreover a similar plot using the intercept from fig 2 and table s1 was also developed fig 4b the log ko3 had a weak but significant effect on the intercept of the correlation between uv254 and trocs f 1 71 18 41 p 0 001 6 a m log k o 3 2 n log k o 3 b where a is the slope of correlation of δuv 254 uv 254 0 and δc c 0 3 1 2 linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs in the uv h2o2 process compared with ozonation uv h2o2 also has two major reactions for the elimination of trocs direct photolysis by uv light and oxidation by oh radicals miklos et al 2018 when h2o2 is irradiated by uv light oh radicals will be produced in situ these radicals are unselective and able to oxidize almost all organic compounds owing to their high oxidizing potential e 0 2 3 v ph 7 yu et al 2015 in direct photolysis the photochemical transformation and degradation of trocs are realized through raising the molecule to its excited state by absorbing uv light energy the photochemical degradation rate of direct photolysis is mainly determined by the molar adsorption coefficient ε and quantum yield φ sanches et al 2010 these two parameters are compound specific the molar absorption coefficient is the competency of a compound to absorb uv light at the determined wavelength and the quantum yield is the ratio of the number of degraded compound molecules to the number of photons absorbed by the compound the rate constant of direct photolysis k uv can be predicted based on equation 7 lee et al 2016 7 k uv 2 303 10 u 254 ɛ ϕ where ε is the molar absorption coefficient of a compound for uv irradiation m 1 cm 1 and φ is the quantum yield of photodegradation of a compound for uv irradiation mol e 1 u 254 is the molar photon energy at 254 nm u 254 4 72 105 j e 1 in the uv h2o2 process the large chromophoric organic matters have high molar absorptivity and can easily react with oh radical thomson et al 2004 these organic matters would fragment into small molecules with a slower reaction rate sarathy and mohseni 2007 yu et al 2015 the accumulated small molecules are further broken down to form the non chromophoric molecules thomson et al 2004 therefore the uv h2o2 process leads to a decrease of uv254 the tf of organic matter has also been found to decrease after the uv h2o2 process yu et al 2015 therefore there is also a similar relationship between tf or uv254 and the removal efficiency of trocs with the uv h2o2 treatment the trocs can be separated into three groups based on k uv and k oh group 1 includes the photo favorable trocs with minor degradation by oh radical oxidation group 2 includes the trocs that can be degraded by both direct photolysis and oh radical oxidation group 3 includes the trocs that undergo fast degradation with oh radical oxidation but that are resistant to direct photolysis yu et al 2015 yu et al showed a good linear relationship r2 0 65 between the surrogates uv254 or tf and the trocs for each group table 2 the elimination of a total of 39 trocs was evaluated during uv h2o2 and 18 trocs were selected and separated into three groups to determine the correlation with the surrogate a similar grouping was also reported by lee et al lee et al 2016 however lee added one additional group group 4 in which the trocs exhibited relatively low k uv and k oh the correlations between the δuv 254 uv 254 0 and δc c 0 are shown in table 2 the correlation also followed equation 4 as has been discussed previously the slope of the correlation decreased with k uv figure s1 however there was no significant impact of kuv on the slope of the correlation with uv254 p 0 05 even though oh is a strong oxidant and plays an important role in attenuating the trocs the k oh did not have a significant impact on the slope p 0 05 there is also a lack of a significant influence of kuv and k oh p 0 05 on the slope the insignificant correlation is possibly because there is less data for uv h2o2 than for ozonation to generate a reliable relationship however rosario et al showed the uv254 decrease of 90 95 can be attributed to oh radical oxidation for compounds in groups 3 and 4 rosario ortiz et al 2010 thus a relationship may be developed between the slope of the surrogate correlation and k oh for compounds in groups 3 and 4 if more data are collected tf as a surrogate has not commonly been studied in the uv h2o2 treatment gerrity et al discussed the possibility of using uv254 and tf to evaluate the degradation of trocs during uv h2o2 gerrity et al 2016 the abatements of 17 trocs in 10 laboratory filtered secondary wastewater effluents were correlated with uv254 and tf in bench scale experiments the correlation with uv254 is summarized in table 2 as discussed earlier for the same compounds the slope of the correlation with tf data not shown was smaller than that with uv254 which is consistent with the results from yu et al and miklos et al miklos et al 2019 yu et al 2015 the greater slope may indicate a more rapid response to the removal of trocs by uv254 than tf however tf showed a stronger correlation than uv254 with a bigger r2 for all trocs except atenolol gerrity et al 2016 tf as a surrogate to predict the removal of iopromide iop and carbamazepine cbz during uv h2o2 was also studied by mikols et al miklos et al 2019 a strong correlation r2 0 89 for cbz but a weak correlation r2 0 5 for iop were observed in the same study uv254 was strongly correlated with both cbz and iop table 2 miklos et al 2019 the reaction rates of compounds and decreasing rates of surrogates are the major parameters that affect the correlation gerrity et al 2016 similar decreasing pace between surrogates and trocs would result in a good correlation 3 1 3 linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs in other aops in a lab scale study conducted by miklos et al different uv aops used to remove trocs in municipal wastewater were compared and various surrogates were discussed such as uv254 color tf two components from the parafac model and fluorescence index fi miklos et al 2019 they found uv254 and tf showed the highest r2 values compared with the other surrogates for most of the uv aops uv h2o2 uv pds and uv chlorine furthermore the slopes of the correlation with tf or uv254 decreased with the increase of oxidant dose for the compounds in group 1 which were predominantly eliminated by photolysis therefore the surrogates for trocs in group 1 should only be used in a limited range of oxidant dosages miklos et al 2019 another study conducted by lee et al also found a strong linear correlation r2 0 9 between the degradation of dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride ddbac and dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride dtac with uv254 in a uv ps process lee et al 2020 moreover a linear relationship was found between the fluorescence parameters and trocs using fenton and fenton like treatments li et al reported the humic like region was strongly correlated with the degradation of trocs li et al 2013 however no studies have shown a correlation of uv254 or tf with trocs in a fenton treatment uv254 and tf as surrogates were used to evaluate the removal of trocs in hospital water by advanced electrochemical oxidation ouarda et al 2019 good correlations r2 0 65 were observed for the 9 of studied compounds such as caffeine clarithromycin and venlafaxine 3 2 piecewise linear relationship between surrogates and elimination of trocs chon et al presented a piecewise linear correlation between relative residual uva254 uva254 uva254 0 and relative residual concentrations c c0 for each selected contaminant 17a ethinylestradiol ee2 cbz atenolol ate bezafibrate bzf ibuprofen ibu and p chlorobenzoic acid pcba chon et al 2015 there were one phase and two phase reactions for the different compounds with various ko3 the fast reacting contaminants in group 1 i e cbz and ee2 were described with one linear relationship fig 2 however the intermediate and slow reacting contaminants were inefficiently removed in the first phase but they were efficiently degraded in the second phase as a result two linear relationships with different slopes were developed for the contaminants with a ko3 below 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 the two phases were a δuv 254 uv 254 0 in the range of 0 30 and 30 70 respectively a similar two phase correlation has also been observed in other studies table s3 nanaboina and korshin 2010 song et al 2017 similar to the earlier correlation information all the linear correlations in table s3 are expressed as δuv 254 uv 254 0 and δc c 0 the slope in phase 2 was bigger than in phase 1 which indicated a faster reaction this is possibly because the compounds with k o3 below 1 0 105 m 1 s 1 start the reaction slower than the decrease of uv254 as discussed earlier therefore phase 1 may be defined as a lag phase the other explanation may be that the two phases have two dominant oxidants chys et al 2017 the first phase is dominated by ozone and the second phase by oh the ozonation of compounds in groups 2 3 4 and 5 can be fitted to one linear or two linear relationships based on the literature it is difficult to determine if the two phase linear relationship is better than the single linear relationship because every study used different water sources and experiment conditions moreover the sample sizes varied between the different studies therefore the r2 value cannot simply be used to compare the correlations from different studies it is useful to collate all the data about the same compounds from different works to show the correlation between the surrogates and the removal of trocs in this way there would be sufficient data to compare the single linear and two phase linear relationships this would also help to eliminate the artificial errors from different studies to achieve this one compound from each group except group 1 was chosen fig 5 atenolol from group 2 did not show two obvious phases and the slopes from the two linear correlations fig 5b were similar compounds from group 3 pcba and group 4 meprobamate showed good two phase correlations even the r2 of the two phases was smaller than the one phase so two different phases were observed during the degradation of these compounds with quite different slopes the slopes of phase 2 were almost two times higher than those for the first phase for the two compounds fig 5c f the reason for the compounds in group 3 and group 4 having a two phase correlation was possibly because o3 was dominant in the first phase and oh played a vital role in the second phase tcep from group 5 was a little different to the other compounds because it showed two phases the first phase was likely to be caused by the late start of tcep oxidation compared with the decrease of uv254 as a result the compounds from group 1 and group 2 were well related with a one phase linear correlation and compounds from groups 3 4 and 5 were better expressed with a two phase linear correlation 4 surrogate model for the predication of troc removal robust correlation models using uva254 and fluorescence surrogates have been developed to monitor troc during ozonation in recent studies chys et al 2017 nanaboina and korshin 2010 representative models include the regression model and kinetics model 4 1 regression model in addition to the regression model that was mentioned in section 3 1 an inflected correlation model was proposed by chys et al based on 9 trocs in groups 1 2 and 3 following the grouping rule mentioned in section 3 2 chys et al 2017 they found that the ozonation process can be divided into two phases fast ozone reactions and the reaction of oh radicals this inflected correlation model is similar to the piecewise linear correlation that has been discussed in section 3 2 the following equations 8 10 were developed chys et al 2017 8 a p 1 m ln k o 3 b 9 δ tro c 0 inflection a p 1 δ s δ s i 10 δ tro c inflection a p 1 i a p 2 δ s i δ s i where ap 1 is the slope of the first phase ap 2 is the slope of the second phase δs is the reduction of suva254 or tf and i is the inflection point between the two phases see fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the slope of the first phase ap 1 was linearly correlated with log ko3 and ap 2 was independent of ko3 moreover ap 2 was also not correlated with k oh similar to what was reported in section 3 3 the trocs in group 3 ko3 less than 10 m 1 s 1 showed a two phase correlation red region in fig 6 some trocs in group 2 with lower ko3 also exhibited an inflection point in this study the inflection point was 19 for uv254 and 47 for tf the two phase model can predict the removal of trocs within the 95 confidence interval 4 2 kinetic model many studies have investigated the correlation between the removal of various target organic compounds and the observational indexes based on the second order reaction kinetics model it is clear that both the organic compounds and the surrogates are mainly under the influence of ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the ozonation process therefore their degradation can be expressed as park et al 2017 11 d i dt k oh i oh k o 3 i o 3 i 12 d troc dt k oh troc oh k o 3 troc o 3 troc where i is the observed index such as uv254 or tf and troc is the target compound k o h i and k o 3 i are the o3 and oh second order kinetic constants the kinetic relations between surrogates and organic compounds are further built upon using the two equations nanaboina et al developed a kinetic model to express the correlation between absorbance decay δuv 254 uv 254 0 and pollutant degradation by ozonation for all groups nanaboina and korshin 2010 good fittings with experimental data were observed in their investigation of 13 selected pharmaceuticals by assuming that effluent organic matter efom consists of two kinetically and possibly spectroscopically distinct functionalities s1 and s2 and the ratio of the concentration of hydroxyl radicals and ozone γ o h o 3 o h o 3 is nearly constant under certain conditions the model can be expressed as equation 13 nanaboina and korshin 2010 13 t r o c 0 t r o c d ln t r o c r t r o c s 2 a 0 a d a d a ε 1 r s 1 s 2 s 1 0 s 2 s 2 0 r s 1 s 2 ε 2 s 2 14 a ε 1 s 1 ε 2 s 2 a f 15 r troc s 2 k troc k s 2 16 r s 1 s 2 k s 1 k s 2 17 k x k x oh γ oh o 3 k x o 3 where ε 1 and ε 2 are the molar extinction coefficients of the chromophores s1 and s2 respectively a is absorbance of wastewater and a f is the absorbance of unreactive wastewater chromophores r troc s 2 is the ratio of kinetic constants k troc and k s 2 r s 1 s 2 is the ratio of kinetic constants k s 1 and k s 2 x stands for the troc or s1 or s2 s1 is for the kineticially fast efom chromophores that react readily with o3 and oh species s2 is for the efom chromophores that are less kinetically active than the reactive sites s1 the actual γ o h o 3 can be assumed to be affected by the wastewater quality at a specific site this model suggests that the functional shape of correlations between the degradation of trocs and the absorbance change depends on specific water qualities and intrinsic factors of the trocs such as molar absorbance and absorbance of unreactive efom chromophores li et al applied this model to estimate the degradation of antineoplastic drugs ads and polycyclic musks pms in municipal wastewater li et al 2016a they suggested using pcba as a reference compound because it was known to be degraded only by oh radicals wang et al further modified the model by separating the efom chromophores into three components reactive chromophore uv254 s1 moderate chromophore uv254 s2 and inert chromophore uv254 s3 wang et al 2020 they found the non linear surrogate model provided a better description than the linear model for the complex water matrices this surrogate model considered the chromophore with different reactivities and was proved to be a fast and cheap method to estimate the degradation of trocs more research is still needed to test the applicability of this model to various trocs and water matrices 5 effect of different parameters on the correlation in wastewater with low doc high concentration nitrate would interfere the value of uv254 leenheer and croué 2003 however other studies found water matrices did not influence the correlations in the ozonation process gerrity et al 2012 wert et al 2009 the concentration of nitrate in three wastewater tertiary treated effluents ranged from 0 074 to 13 mg n l the toc ranged from 6 6 to 10 3 mg l and uv254 ranged from 0 14 to 0 26 cm 1 wert et al 2009 in gerrity s study the nitrate concentration in 17 wastewater matrices changed from 0 07 to 24 mg n l gerrity et al 2012 the determined correlations are similar between 10 of secondary wastewater effluents from the united states switzerland and australia gerrity et al 2016 the doc uv254 and no3 in those wastewater effluents varied from 4 7 to 26 4 mg l 0 099 to 0 410 cm 1 0 11 to 24 mg n l respectively moreover the ph of wastewater has a negligible impact on the correlation song et al 2017 although the concentration of trocs varied in different wastewater effluents such as atenolol meprobamate and carbamazepine changing from 320 to 2800 ng l 380 to 790 ng l and 200 to 430 ng l respectively wert et al 2009 consistent correlations were found for each troc in the different wastewater effluents 6 troc control strategies based on in situ monitoring of surrogates the optimal oxidant dosage is an important factor to be determined during aops there are generally two control strategies for using a surrogate to control the oxidant dose one is a pure feed forward process control the other is a closed loop process control clpc stapf et al 2016 the first strategy involves a non feedback control system which predicts the oxidant dose using surrogates such as doc or uva254 of the input water before the aop lee et al 2013 lee et al 2014 wert et al 2009a for example in ozonation a model is developed based on the correlation between the attenuation of trocs and the specific ozone dose g o3 g doc fig 7 the abatement efficiency of the ozonation process can then be predicted using the model altmann et al 2014 however clpc is a feedback control strategy which uses uv254 as a surrogate to predict the elimination of trocs the aops can remove numerous light absorbing unsaturated organic substances which reduces the absorbance of wastewater wittmer et al 2015 as a result the correlations between the decrease of uva254 or tf and the attenuation of trocs that were summarized in section 3 can be used to adjust the oxidant dose to achieve the target removal efficiency of trocs unlike the first method without knowing the outcome of the ozonation process the feedback control method of clpc can control the oxidant dose to reach a constant level of elimination of trocs 7 current development of the in situ monitoring system 7 1 light sources of instruments for surrogate determination mercury or xenon lamps have mainly been used as the light sources for the online uv absorption and eem measurement analyzers currently on the market representative lamps are the spectro lyser v3 from s can messtechnik gmbh and the uv colorplus from sigrist ag wittmer et al used the uv colorplus in an ozonation pilot plant to determine the correlation of δuv 254 uv 254 0 and the removal of trocs wittmer et al 2015 a portable fluorescence sensor with a laser as the light souce was used to estimate the removal of ddbac using uv chlorine du et al 2020 they found that the results from the portable sensor were similar to those from bench fluorescence spectroscopy compared with uv254 tf is harder for an in situ application because the eem measurement relies on expensive instruments and the need to record a complete eem zielinski et al invented a sensor system using xenon flash lamps which can measure the full eems from λ ex λ em of 220 200 to 750 950 zielinski et al 2018 the xenon lamps have a high energy output in the uv vis ultraviolet visible regions but the in situ monitoring device based on xenon lamps has not been applied worldwide because of its large size and high cost li et al 2016c the most attractive optical sensor is the light emitting diode led compared with mercury or xenon lamps leds consume less power and have a compact size low price and long lifetime table 3 the early leds were only able to cover the 370 640 nm wavelength range hart and jiji 2002 recently leds based on aluminum gallium nitride algan multiple quantum well active layer designs can emit down to 250 300 nm the deep uv leds provide the possibility to replace the xenon lamps used for the in situ monitoring uv fluorescence device tedetti et al used aigan deep uv leds to develop a field portable fluorimeter with two optical channels 255 and 280 nm tedetti et al 2013 the fluorimeter successfully detected the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in marine waters moreover li et al constructed a novel portable led based device that was able to detect uv280 absorbance as well as humic like peak c and protein like peak t fluorescence li et al 2016c the led uv fluorescence sensor was tested to monitor the trocs during ozonation li et al 2016c however several challenges still hinder the led fluorimeter from industrial applications such as calibration reabsorption effects and inner filter effects bridgeman et al 2015 li et al 2016b the sensitivity and accuracy of the led fluorimeter still need to be improved carstea et al 2020 7 2 instrument maintenance the maintenance of the online sensor greatly impacts its performance and consistency because of the complex water environment in the wastewater treatment plants fouling on the spectral sensor can result in an unstable online uva254 and fluorescence measurement which is sensitive to interference such as small particles the particles may block the optical path but they can still exhibit fluorescence and result in incorrect results conmy et al 2004 chys et al observed significant differences between in situ and laboratory measured uva254 possibly because of the existence of particles chys et al 2018 therefore regular maintenance of the online sensor is essential such as routinely cleaning the sensor and equipping the sensor with automated brushes or filters wittmer et al 2015 a filter with 50 µm pores was found to be efficient in removing the particles over a duration of 2 months wittmer et al 2015 furthermore ultrasonic cleaning also helps to reduce the fouling of the sensor chys et al 2018 8 conclusions and perspective real time monitoring of the trocs and alerting the operator to treatment failure are critical in aops surrogates provide a stable sensitive and cost friendly method to estimate the elimination of trocs among the various surrogates uv254 and tf are the most widely studied and have been found to strongly correlate with the removal of trocs in both o3 and uv h2o2 processes uv254 and tf can be measured to monitor the removal of trocs in continue mode operation lc ms ms can be used regularly to check the accuracy of the correlation between the decease of uv254 or tf and the removal of trocs the nonlinear relationship between ko3 and the slope of the correlation with the surrogate provides a way to estimate the attenuation of trocs with known ko3 one problem related to the ko3 is that it is determined based on the clean water in the laboratory the effects of the water matrix on the ko3 need to be considered in future work moreover the linear regression of surrogates and trocs can only be applied with a consistent water quality which means sudden changes in the water source may lead to misleading predictions although predictive models using surrogates as inputs have been developed for the removal of trocs in ozonation the use of a surrogate s model in uv h2o2 and other aops still needs more exploration furthermore it is essential to understand the impacts of seasonal variations water quality and storm events on the kinetic parameters of the model and uv254 or tf in the development of the model the led has been proven to be a promising light source for the in situ monitoring system of spectroscopic surrogates for practical application owing to its low cost and long lifetime changing the measuring frequency to once every half hour will further lower the high strain on the lifetime of the light source future studies should continue to develop effective cheap fast and robust monitoring tools for in situ analysis moreover the wavelength of 254 nm may not be the optimal choice to use as a surrogate thus other wavelengths should be explored for example the wavelength of 280 nm characteristic of aromatic ring or higher may be better candidates because a lamp with a higher wavelength is cheaper furthermore the tf is difficult to apply in situ more attention should be paid to other fluorescence indexes such as humic like fluorescence and protein like fluorescence a combination of different surrogates for predicting δc c 0 will provide a new insight to understand the reaction mechanism of dom and trocs during aops future research is also expected to test the feasibility and applicability of the use of surrogates in monitoring trocs in

17237,in recent years fluidized bed fenton fbr fenton process has gained more attention in treating recalcitrant industrial wastewater fbr fenton combines the effectiveness of homogeneous fenton and sludge reduction of heterogeneous fenton comparing to other modified fenton processes fbr fenton has greater economical and scaling up potential however large consumption of fenton reagents and strict ph control are still the bottlenecks hampering the full scale application of fbr fenton while prior reviews mainly focused on the operation and performance of fbr fenton process the present study critically discussed the challenges and bottlenecks for its full scale industrial application this study also comprehensively reviewed the development strategies for tackling these drawbacks mainly over the recent five years homogeneous fbr fenton heterogeneous fbr fenton and heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes were classified for the first time according to their reaction mechanisms and system designs important operational and design parameters affecting the cost effectiveness of all fbr fenton technologies were reviewed including the fundamentals common practices and even innovative steps for enhancing the process performance up to date applications of fbr fenton technologies in recalcitrant wastewater compounds treatment were also summarized and it was found that upscaling of heterogeneous fbr fenton and heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes was still very challenging strategies to overcome the key technical limitations and enhance process cost effectiveness were discussed in the future perspective part furthermore modelling techniques such as computational fluid dynamics model and artificial neural network were suggested to be promising modelling techniques for speeding up the full scale applications of fbr fenton technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes fluidized bed fenton process heterogeneous fenton process photo fenton process recalcitrant organics removal industrial wastewater treatment 1 introduction 1 1 management and characteristics of industrial wastewater due to the potential harm to the receiving water bodies aquatic ecosystem and even human health there are growing concerns for discharge of industrial wastewaters with toxic and recalcitrant organics this has resulted in extensive research efforts on developing industrial wastewater treatment technologies for toxic and biologically refractory organic contaminants abatement due to their resilience to the conventional biological treatment processes these compounds are often released into the water environments and showing significant environmental persistence and ecotoxicity choi et al 2017 various types of refractory compounds could have unknown synergistic effects on the aquatic ecosystem or induce certain levels of bioaccumulation due to their environment persistence a study from directorate generals for health and consumers european commission showed that chemical industrial wastewater containing a large quantity of chemical mixtures exhibiting more significant health effect than single compound consumers 2011 world widely the discharge of industrial wastewater is regulated by more stringent and specific guidelines according to the water act in singapore australia and japan chemical oxygen demand cod discharge limit to fresh and marine water bodies ranges from 15 to 60 mg l and 5 day biological oxygen demand bod5 discharge limit is from 15 to 20 mg l in addition to controlling bulk organics emission governments and agencies started to enforce regulations for emerging contaminants ecs discharge from 2017 1 4 dioxane and polychlorinated biphenyls pcb were regulated in japan water pollution control law for their discharge limits to the surface waters norman project funded by the european commission studied the occurrence of ecs in surface waters and aimed to move towards environmental legislations for regulating ecs discharge dulio et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 stated that there has been increasing regularization in ecs discharge such as the implementation of the fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule by us epa with an ever increasing push for more stringent discharge standards greater emphasis has been placed on cost effective solutions for industrial wastewater treatment industrial wastewater treatment is challenging due to the inhibitory properties of recalcitrant organic pollutants and the typical variable composition in the water matrix biological treatments typically have slow reaction kinetics and might not sufficiently treat the industrial wastewaters for them to be safely discharged into the environment bilińska et al 2016 physico chemical technologies such as adsorption and membrane filtration do not degrade the pollutants and downstream treatment of the harmful concentrates is still required as such there has been growing interest in the development of various advanced oxidation processes aops for degrading recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewater table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of some prominent industrial wastewaters that were recently studied with aops including textile wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater papermill wastewater commercial oil production wastewater and reverse osmosis concentrate roc attributed to different industrial sectors and production processes the ph conditions cod and bod5 concentrations in these wastewaters can be varied over a wide range while their bod5 cod ratio are generally low indicating potential inhibitory effects to the biological treatment process textile wastewater generally contains azo dyes which are well known for their bio recalcitrant and acute toxicity some are also known carcinogens and show neurotoxicity to animals liang et al 2017 based on recent studies on textile wastewater treatment with aops the cod concentrations in textile wastewater range from 192 to 2360 mg l bod5 concentrations range from 24 to 400 mg l and the bod5 cod ratios are between 0 110 to 0 170 pharmaceutical wastewater mainly refers to the effluents and waste generated from drug manufacturing it comprises of pharmaceutically active compounds such as hormones and antibiotics through literature review the average cod levels in pharmaceutical wastewater range from 120 to 8370 mg l bod5 levels range from 4 to 4925 mg l and bod5 cod ratios are around 0 030 to 0 172 the large degree of variation of wastewater characteristics is due to type of manufacturing process the wastewater is taken from papermill wastewater contains micro pollutants omps which are difficult to remove due to their complex physicochemical properties and toxicity toxicity studies done by xing et al 2020 showed significant chronic toxicity and genotoxicity on zebrafish even with 8 times dilution of the wastewater the cod concentrations in papermill wastewater range from 124 to 800 mg l the bod5 concentrations range from 9 to 19 mg l and the bod5 cod ratios are between 0 069 to 0 110 commercially pressed oil cpo production wastewater usually contains phenolic compounds which are refractory to biological treatment caporaso et al 2017 the cod range of cpo wastewater is 479 12180 mg l and bod5 cod ratios are from 0 050 to 0 204 reverse osmosis has been widely used for water reclamation from industrial secondary effluents its cod levels range from 50 to 435 mg l and bod5 cod ratios are between 0 006 0 070 the contaminates levels in roc could be 4 to 20 times higher than their original levels kumar et al 2007 and most of them are recalcitrant to the conventional biotreatment high salinity in roc could also adversely affect the bioreactors stability and performance furthermore various inorganic species in roc could inhibit the chemical oxidation process efficiency achieving low effluent cod level in roc treatment is challenging with either biological processes or oxidation processes 1 2 fbr fenton for industrial wastewater treatment aops comprise of various techniques to transform and break down organic contaminants into carbon dioxide water and simpler substances the key advantage of aop is its non selective nature and ability to breakdown large or complex organic molecules marco et al 1997 the principle of aop is to use highly reactive oxidative species such as hydroxyl radical oh for degrading organic contaminants in the wastewater among all the aops fluidized bed reactor fenton fbr fenton based aops are deemed as cost effective means for refractory wastewater treatment tisa et al 2014b fbr fenton is a modified process from classic fenton it is a relatively new technology as compared to other forms of fenton processes such as photo fenton and electro fenton numerous research efforts are still being actively pursued to enhance its process efficiency and explore its full scale application in industrial wastewater treatment many researchers have assessed and reviewed the application of fenton based aops for treating real industrial wastewaters and synthetic wastewaters table 2 summarizes the major findings in recent reviews that were conducted from 2014 to present focusing on fbr fenton process for wastewater treatment tisa et al 2014b reviewed the applicability of fluidized bed reactor in recalcitrant compound degradation through advanced oxidation processes in her review different types of fbr aops were evaluated with their performances for degrading various model compounds such as acetaminophen aniline and nitrobenzene fbr fenton was recommended as the most effective fbr aop pliego et al 2015 conducted a critical review on various improvement techniques for classical fenton process in wastewater treatment although this review did not specifically target on fbr fenton it provided some insights about heterogeneous fenton process which could be effectively applied in fbr fenton process garcia segura et al 2016 proposed fbr fenton as an alternative technology for wastewater treatment he highlighted the key advantages of fbr fenton over classic fenton including higher organics removal efficiency and less sludge production bello et al 2017 provided a comprehensive review on the application of fbr in all sorts of aops he summarized the important features for fbr design and key operation parameters in fbr fenton process his later study bello et al 2019a addressed the key limitations of classic fenton for recalcitrant wastewater treatment and proposed fbr fenton as one of the potential solutions up to now researchers have successfully incorporated fenton heterogeneous fenton and heterogeneous photo fenton processes into fbr system while prior reviews provided some valuable insights to the operation and performance of fbr fenton process the mechanisms industrial applications related challenges and solutions were not critically reviewed to our best knowledge this is the first study to have an in depth discussion on the reaction mechanisms of various fbr fenton processes as well as their applications in recalcitrant industrial wastewater treatment the present study firstly elaborates the reaction mechanisms system design and process operation of each fbr fenton technology key operational and design parameters involved in all fbr fenton technologies are discussed with their effects on oxidation efficiency and iron crystallization efficiency current state of fbr fenton applications in specific industrial wastewater treatment is also included key challenges of fbr fenton full scale application and potential strategies to overcome the bottlenecks are discussed 2 fbr fenton process mechanism to address the problem of sludge production in classic fenton process researchers have explored the possibility of conducting fenton reaction in fluidized bed reactor a fluidized bed reactor is a contacting device that uses the principle of fluidization for its operation so that the packed material could be expanded by the upward or downward movement of the fluid the fluidized materials used in fbr fenton system can be inert solids or active catalysts and they are defined as carriers which provide available sites for crystallization and precipitation of iron hydroxides and hence reduce the sludge production in fenton reaction fbr fenton technologies can be categorized as fbr fenton process and fbr fenton like process fig 1 in fbr fenton process homogeneous fenton is the dominate process for organics oxidation and the carriers used are inert solids such as sand sio2 and bricks particles they are mainly participating in iron crystallization process in fbr fenton like process by introducing iron bearing minerals or bimetallic oxides heterogeneous fenton is the main mechanism for organics oxidation uv vis irradiation could be also incorporated to initiate the heterogeneous photo fenton process with reference to the terms of homogenous and heterogenous their key difference is the iron sources used to induce the fenton reaction in homogenous fbr fenton system free fe2 ion in the aqueous solution is the main iron sources in heterogeneous fbr fenton system iron sources are immobilized within on the catalyst structure and they could induce catalytic degradation of target pollutants with minimum generation of ferric sludge fig 2 a depicts schematic set up of homogeneous fbr fenton system which consists of a cylindrical reactor packed with carriers and their support material glass beads and porous ceramsite are usually used to support the carriers as well as provide even distributions of the incoming flow after wastewater is acidified with sulfuric acid ferrous salt and h2o2 solutions are dosed into the influent line and pumped together with wastewater into fbr fenton reactor from the bottom internal circulation of the reaction mixture is subsequently initiated to fluidize the carriers with desired bed expansion rate the treated wastewater is collected from the effluent outlet at the top and subsequently gone through neutralization flocculation and settling processes heterogeneous fbr fenton process usually shares the similar set up with homogeneous fbr fenton process both adopting liquid solid two phases design fig 2b shows a schematic heterogeneous fbr photo fenton system a uv lamp is fixed inside the reactor for carrying out the photo fenton process and an air pump is adopted for carrier fluidization this is a typical liquid solid air three phases design reactor reaction mechanisms of fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes are elaborated in the following parts 2 1 homogeneous fbr fenton process fbr fenton is firstly modified from classic fenton process thus the fundamental of homogeneous fbr fenton process is the fenton reaction which generates hydroxyl radicals when h2o2 and ferrous ion fenton reagents are brought into contact in aqueous solution at acidic ph eqs 2 1 to 2 8 depict the key reactions that take place in homogenous fbr fenton process de laat and gallard 1999 ferrous ion initiates the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 for oh formation eq 2 1 meanwhile the generated ferric ion is reduced by h2o2 to ferrous ion eq 2 2 enabling an effective cyclic mechanism for ferrous regeneration in the reaction described in eq 2 2 another radical specie hydroperoxyl radical ho2 is also produced which is less active than oh for organics oxidation due to its lower redox potential reaction 2 2 is usually referred as fenton like reaction and it is much slower than the fenton reaction thus the produced ferric ions in reaction 2 1 would be progressively accumulated leading to ferric sludge production in the fenton system 2 1 h 2 o 2 f e 2 f e 3 h o o h 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 f e 2 h o 2 h eqs 2 3 to 2 5 depicts other rate limiting steps for ferrous ion regeneration and hydroxyl radial production excess ferrous ion could scavenge the produced radical species eqs 2 3 and 2 4 and ho2 could react with ferric ion for additional ferrous ion regeneration eq 2 5 it shall be noted that in the above reactions ferrous ion acts as a catalyst and h2o2 is continuously consumed for oh production 2 3 f e 2 h o f e 3 o h 2 4 f e 2 h o 2 f e 3 h o 2 2 5 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 o 2 h eqs 2 6 to 2 8 summarizes other radical scavenging reactions that could occur during the fenton process 2 6 h o h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 7 h o h o 2 h 2 o o 2 2 8 h o h o h 2 o 2 the whole fenton process involves a complex reaction mechanism hydroxyl radical is generated in the chain initiation reaction eq 2 1 while it could be scavenged by ferrous ion eq 2 3 hydrogen peroxide eq 2 6 hydroperoxyl radical eq 2 7 and even itself hydrogen peroxide could be the initiator for radical production but also be the inhibitor for subsequent oxidation process ferrous ion could catalyze hydrogen peroxide decomposition but also scavenge the produced radicals in the presence of organic molecules rh the produced hydroxyl radicals will attack them through protons abstraction and produce highly reactive organic radicals r kato and walling 1971 which could be further oxidized eq 2 9 2 9 r h h o h 2 o r in homogeneous fbr fenton system in addition to the above described fenton reaction other four reaction mechanisms are also involved as shown in fig 3 the generated oh could oxidize the organics pollutants to less recalcitrant intermediates crystallization of ferric hydroxide on the carrier surface could occur via heterogeneous nucleation boonrattanakij et al 2011 the ferric hydroxide coated carrier may possess some extent of catalytic activity and initiate heterogeneous fenton reaction for additional oh generation meanwhile the presented organic oxidation intermediates particularly volatile fatty acids could form soluble complexes with ferric ion and hence interfere ferric ion solubility and crystallization boonrattanakij et al 2011 2 2 heterogeneous fbr fenton process to further overcome the high sludge production and narrow ph operation range in homogeneous fenton process researchers explored the possibility of conducting heterogeneous fenton in fluidized reactor the fbr system could provide adequate catalytic reaction site by housing large number of active carriers as well as induce high mass transfer rate with carrier fluidization heterogeneous fenton reaction occurs when h2o2 molecule is in contact with the iron sites of the carrier with minimum ferric sludge production natural pyrite magnetite and fe ti bimetallic oxides have been adopted as carriers to initiate the heterogeneous fenton reaction in fbr aghdasinia et al 2017a b 2016 farshchi et al 2019 2018 li et al 2019 in the presence of iron bearing minerals heterogeneous fenton reaction mainly involve the following reactions where the symbol represents the iron species bounded to the carrier surface hou et al 2016 2 10 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h h o 2 11 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e o o h 2 h 2 12 f e o o h 2 f e 2 h o 2 similar with the classic fenton reaction oh is the key radical for organic pollutants oxidation and the major mechanism for oh production in heterogeneous fenton is the reaction describes in eq 2 10 pathway for fe2 regeneration is composed of two consecutive reactions eqs 2 11 and 2 12 h2o2 reacts with fe3 to form the intermediate fe ooh 2 which can be dissociated into the hydroperoxyl radical and reduced fe2 molina et al 2006 under the acidic condition certain portion of fe2 could be leached out as free fe2 and participates in homogeneous fenton reaction aghdasinia et al 2017b zhang et al 2014 part of leached fe3 could also form iron hydroxide and form crystal by using carrier as the foreign particle although the proportion of leached free iron ions were reported to be insignificant it was worth mentioning that the reported studies were mostly conducted for short operation duration the dominance of the leaching mechanism is also highly dependent on the type of iron bearing minerals which will be further elaborated in the next section along the heterogeneous fenton oxidation the formed organic intermediates such as carboxylic acid compounds could form ferro organic complexes with fe3 affecting the solubilities of iron species in the fbr fenton system fig 4 illustrates the above mentioned reaction mechanisms involved in heterogeneous fbr fenton process 2 3 heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process photo fenton process is another modification of classic fenton process by combining fenton reaction with uv vis irradiation it could be conducted in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and the main difference between the two systems is the form of iron source homogeneous system requires strict ph control and forms large quantity of ferric sludge after the treatment process and hence heterogeneous photo fenton process was brought to the picture for overcoming these limitations nevertheless comparing to homogeneous reaction heterogeneous photo fenton reaction has slower oxidation rate due to limited catalyst surface and mass transfer rate these two limitations could be solved by adopting fbr for larger number of catalyst or carrier and higher mass transfer rate via the liquid solid air three phases fluidization recently goethite was adopted by researchers to carry out heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process for recalcitrant organics removal li et al 2015 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2015 apart from the mechanism for heterogenous fenton eqs 2 10 to 2 12 the additional uv vis irradiation will induce some alternative reaction mechanisms photo reduction of fe3 described in eq 2 13 could facilitate fe2 regeneration under uv vis irradiation extra oh would also be generated through direct photolysis of h2o2 eq 2 14 uv vis irradiation also facilitates regeneration of fe2 through the ligand to metal charge transfer lmct described in eq 2 15 clarizia et al 2017 during the oxidation process the formed fe ligand complexes could significantly absorb uv vis light and undergo photolytic decomposition 2 13 f e 3 h v f e 2 h o 2 14 h 2 o 2 h v 2 h o 2 15 f e 3 l h v f e 3 l f e 2 l li et al 2018 used zero valent iron fe0 powder in heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process for n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp removal different from iron mineral carriers in fe0 system dissolution of fe0 at acidic condition plays a key role for forming free fe2 ions and initiating the fenton reaction free fe2 ions can also be generated through the fe0 photocatalytic process eqs 2 16 and 2 17 in a three phases liquid solid air fbr system the aeration process could oxidize fe0 to form fe2 and h2o2 eq 2 18 which potentially propagates more oh generation for organics degradation minella et al 2016 the formed fe3 is reduced by fe for fe2 regeneration as well as photo reduced to fe2 under uv vis irradiation eqs 2 19 and 2 20 2 16 f e 0 2 h f e 2 h 2 2 17 f e 0 h v f e 2 2 e 2 18 f e 0 o 2 2 h f e 2 h 2 o 2 2 19 f e 0 2 f e 3 3 f e 2 2 20 f e 3 h v f e 2 h o fig 5 a and 5b summarize the main reaction mechanisms involved in goethite and fe0 initiated heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes in goethite system in addition to the above mentioned mechanisms for oh generation and fe2 regeneration homogeneous fenton reaction could occur with the leached fe2 in both systems there would also be ferric precipitates formation and iron crystallization on the carrier surface as well as the ferro organics complexation between the immobilized iron species and oxidation intermediates 3 factors affecting fbr fenton performance this part of review focuses on the key influencing parameters in the fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes based on exhaustive review of recent fbr fenton studies the key parameters affecting the efficiencies of fenton oxidation and iron crystallization include fenton reagents dosage operation ph water matrix bed expansion rate carriers and reactor configuration 3 1 fenton reagents dosage oxidation efficiency of fbr fenton process is correlated with the amount of oh generated and oh production is directly affected by the dosage of fenton reagents fenton oxidation efficiency were generally observed to be increased with higher h2o2 dosage kang and hwang 2000 lin et al 1999 while excess amount of h2o2 also scavenges the generated oh eq 2 6 thereby inhibiting the entire process performance the h2o2 dosage shall be optimized so that the total supplied amount is consumed effectively during the fenton process this optimal dosage can only be obtained through testing with specific target wastewater and cod concentration in wastewater can be used as an indicative value of required h2o2 dosage based on our reviewed studies on industrial wastewater treatment with fbr fenton process the mass ratio between h2o2 dosage and cod concentration is ranging from 1 00 to 7 78 anotai et al 2018 boonrattanakij et al 2018 cai et al 2020a cai et al 2020b chen et al 2015 liu et al 2014 chen et al chen et al 2015 adopted homogeneous fbr fenton process for flax wastewater treatment and reported 89 toc removal with 600 mg l h2o2 further increasing of h2o2 dosage to 800 mg l reduced the final toc removal efficiency h2o2 overdosing was also reported in heterogeneous fbr fenton system in the presence of natural magnetite aghdasinia et al aghdasinia et al 2017a observed faster basic blue 3 bb3 degradation when h2o2 dosage was increased from 1 to 4 mm however the kinetic of bb3 degradation slowed down while h2o2 dosage was further increased higher concentration of fe2 usually induces higher oxidation efficiency of fenton process while the efficiency enhancement was observed to be marginal above an excessive concentration of fe2 this is due to the reaction between fe2 and oh eq 2 3 that reduces the available active radicals for organics oxidation lacson et al 2018 reported higher removal efficiency of imidacloprid imi with increased fe2 dosage from 0 1 to 0 8 mm while higher fe2 dosage beyond 0 8 mm inhibited imi degradation the optimal fe2 dosage could be determined based on the optimal h2o2 dosage they are related via the optimal molar ratio of fenton reagents h2o2 fe2 for each specific wastewater treatment in spite of many research studies and industrial applications of fenton process there is no agreement on a universal value of optimal h2o2 fe2 nevertheless some optimum values of h2o2 fe2 were reported from 3 30 to 30 00 for industrial wastewater treatment with fbr fenton process anotai et al 2018 boonrattanakij et al 2018 cai et al 2020a cai et al 2020b chen et al 2015 liu et al 2014 in fbr fenton system fe2 dosage could also affect the iron crystallization process and ferric sludge production after fe2 was converted to fe3 via fenton reaction the formed ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 would be agglomerated with homogeneous nucleation and simultaneously deposited on the carrier surface via heterogeneous nucleation effective iron crystallization only occurs with notable dormancy of heterogeneous nucleation process boonrattanakij et al 2018 high fe2 dosage produces supersaturated iron solution and under this supersaturated condition fe oh 3 crystal would grow and ripen with homogeneous nucleation process instead of using carrier as the foreign particle for heterogeneous nucleation the formed fe oh 3 crystals would be suspended in the aqueous phase resulting in more ferric sludge production as previously mentioned the optimal fenton reagents dosage required for treating a specific wastewater must be determined empirically based on series of lab scale or pilot scale studies the optimal dosages of h2o2 and fe2 are dependent on target wastewater characteristics nature and concentration of the target pollutants fenton reaction conditions and treatment objectives in recent fbr fenton related studies the reported optimal h2o2 dosage ranged from 0 04 to 104 4 mm and the optimal fe2 dosage was from 1 to 5 mm most studies adopted taguchi method and response surface method with central composite for process optimization aghdasinia et al 2017a 2016 bello et al 2019c cai et al 2020a there is also increasing use of machine learning systems like deep learning and reinforced learning for fbr fenton process optimization one popular deep learning tool is the artificial neural network ann which is able to model complex interactions that have unknown behaviors elmolla et al 2010 ann is powerful in terms of multivariate calibration and it is able to identify cause effect correlations through training with multiple input and output systems the applications of ann analysis for fbr fenton system modelling and process optimization could significantly reduce the workload and resource requirements 3 2 operation ph the effectiveness of fenton based processes is highly dependent on the operation ph ph affects the solubility of iron species iron crystallization process and also governs the overall stability of h2o2 molecules and radical species table 3 summarises the impacts of ph on fenton oxidation and iron crystallization processes the optimum ph used in fenton oxidation is mostly reported to be 3 at ph lower than 3 the produced oh could be scavenged by excess h ions fe2 would react with larger amount of h ions to form fe h2o 6 2 complex and h2o2 would form more stable oxonium ions h3o2 with lower activity of the fenton reagents fenton reaction for oh production is hindered and the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 for fe2 regeneration would also be inhibited in fbr fenton based processes the organics removal efficiencies were also reported to be higher with reduced ph till 3 whereas heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process could achieve effective organics removal over a wider ph range from 3 to 5 aghdasinia et al 2017a li et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in heterogeneous fbr fenton and photo fenton processes lower ph condition would induce iron leaching from the catalytic carrier and promote the homogeneous fenton reaction though most studies reported the homogeneous fenton reaction to be insignificant due to low concentration of free fe2 ion higher ph condition ph 4 would dramatically reduce the free iron ions availability as they would mostly form ferric hydroxide precipitates under the alkaline condition self decomposition of h2o2 to h2o and o2 is accelerated at ph level higher than 5 moreover the redox potential of oh is reported to be lower at higher ph e0 2 8 1 95 v at ph 0 14 kim 1998 the operation ph also affects the iron crystallization on the carrier surface boonrattanakij et al boonrattanakij et al 2011 observed negligible iron crystallization onto the carrier at ph 7 and it was attributed to strongly supersaturated condition of ferric ions at ph 7 the growth and ripening of ferric crystal can only occur very rapidly via homogeneous nucleation and the carrier could not involve in iron crystallization via heterogeneous nucleation thus the iron crystallization efficiency was observed to be higher at ph 3 than ph 7 and more ferric sludge was produced at higher operation ph 3 3 water matrix some common inorganic anions presented in the water matrix could hinder the fenton reaction either by reducing catalytic activity of free iron species or scavenging the produced oh ratanatamskul et al 2010 reported inhibitory effects of inorganic anions on nitrobenzene degradation in fbr fenton process with the order of h2po4 cl no3 it was also indicated that when the concentration of cl ion was less than 20 mm its inhibition effect on nitrobenzene removal could be overcome with extended reaction time anotai et al 2010 reported higher inhibitory effect of h2po4 ion than cl ion on aniline oxidation in fbr fenton process siedlecka et al 2007 studied methyl t butylether mtbe decomposition in fenton reaction and found the inorganic anions suppressed the mtbe removal rate in the order of h2po4 cl so4 2 clo4 at acidic reaction condition fenton reaction is extremely sensitive to h2po4 ion due to its complex reactions with the iron species eqs 3 1 to 3 8 summarize the complex reactions with ferric and ferrous ions in the presence of h2po4 cl and so4 2 ions the complexation of ferrous ion reduces its availability and reactivity for h2o2 decomposition and hence hinder oh generation formation of ferric complexes with these anions affects the ferrous regeneration step which in a way also decreases the rate of oh generation 3 1 f e 2 h 2 p o 4 f e h 2 p o 4 3 2 f e 3 h 2 p o 4 f e h 2 p o 4 2 3 3 f e 2 c l f e c l 3 4 f e 3 c l f e c l 2 3 5 f e 3 2 c l f e c l 2 3 6 f e 2 s o 4 2 f e s o 4 3 7 f e 3 s o 4 2 f e s o 4 3 8 f e 3 2 s o 4 2 f e s o 2 in addition to complex reactions h2po4 cl and so4 2 also compete with organic compounds to react with oh these oh scavenging reactions could result in formation of different inorganic radicals and at acidic condition the dominate inorganic radicals consist of h2po4 cl2 and so4 though these inorganics radicals are strong oxidants according to neta et al 1988 rosso et al 1998 their second order reaction rate constants for organics degradation were among the range of 103 to 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 this reaction kinetics are much slower than organic degradation initiated by oh that ranges from 107 to 1010 m 1s 1 therefore oh scavenging by inorganic anions hinders the overall organics degradation kinetics it was also highlighted that clo4 and no3 less interfered the organics degradation in fenton reaction this could be due to negligible complexation between these two anions and the iron species as well as insignificant oh scavenging effect of clo4 and no3 liao and gurol 1995 riga et al 2007 for specific recalcitrant pollutants removal in industrial wastewaters the background organic matters humic acids fulvic acids carbohydrates and proteins could also compete with the target pollutants to react with oh for oxidation or forming organic radicals with lower redox potential michael kordatou et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2015 some water matrix components might be able to promote the fbr fenton processes for example the natural iron species existed in the wastewater could act as extra iron sources for the fenton reaction and some inherent reductants might facilitate ferrous ion regeneration from ferric ion lado ribeiro et al 2019 in photo fenton process complexations between ferric ion and some organic compounds containing carboxylic or hydroxy groups could enhance the quantum yield of fe2 ion via the ligand to metal charge transfer lmct manenti et al 2015 in heterogeneous fenton process iron precipitation at circumvent ph might also be mitigated by the metal ligand complexation the formed ferric ligand complexes could enhance the solubility of fe3 ion and allow the fenton oxidation to be conducted over a wider ph range while it was also reported that the metal ligand complexation between fe3 and the oxidation intermediates such as carboxylic compounds could remarkably deteriorate the iron crystallization in fbr fenton process anotai et al 2018 some inorganic ligands presented in the wastewater could also reduce the effectiveness of fbr fenton process fischbacher et al 2017 reported complexation between pyrophosphate ligand and fe3 ion and the formed complex did not react with h2o2 thereby terminating the reactions for fe2 ion regeneration ligands addition was suggested to be an effective solution for expanding the operation ph of fenton based processes while they could be acting as both the process promoters and inhibitors more details on ligands addition will be elaborated in the future perspective part 3 4 bed expansion rate in fbr system the minimum liquid velocity required for carrier fluidization is defined as the minimum fluidization velocity vmf which can be calculated using wen and yu equation lim et al 2008 to achieve effective carrier bed expansion the liquid velocity shall be maintained higher than vmf and the internal recirculation flow rate shall be applied according to desired fenton reaction time for effective organics removal sufficient bed expansion rate could enhance the mass transfer rate for homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton reactions chen et al 2015 adopted a batch fbr fenton reactor 5 2 cm diameter and 50 cm height to treat flax wastewater it was found that within 100 min reaction time 20 bed expansion rate had significantly lower decolorization performance as compared to 50 and 100 bed expansion rate it was also noted that higher bed expansion rate would enhance the contact between iron oxides and the carrier and thus facilitate the iron crystallization process while too high bed expansion rate or water flow rate could deteriorate iron coating on carrier surface through scouring effect anotai et al 2018 chou et al 2004 studied total iron removal efficiency in a fbr reactor 3 cm diameter and 200 cm height under different bed expansion rates it was found that the lowest bed expansion rate of 20 achieved better total iron removal efficiency in 24 min and higher bed expansion rate of 30 and 90 could wash out the iron oxides flocs and hinder the iron crystallization process in liquid solid fbr fenton systems the bed expansion rate typically ranges from 30 to 100 most studies reported 50 to be optimal for fenton oxidation and iron crystallization process 3 5 carriers the physical and chemical properties of carrier materials play important roles on iron crystallization and organics removal kinetics in this context different carriers haven been adopted in fbr fenton process for industrial effluent treatment including sio2 sand al2o3 fe2o3 granular activated carbon ceramsite and bricks particles anotai et al 2012 bello et al 2020 boonrattanakij et al 2011 briones et al 2012 chen et al 2015 matira et al 2015 su et al 2011 su et al 2013 sio2 is the most popular carrier used in fbr fenton process due to its proved capability to promote iron crystallization chen et al compared the performance of sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 and reported sio2 to be the most suitable carrier for highest organics removal and total iron removal according to lyu et al granular activated carbon exhibited relatively higher iron removal capability than ceramsite liu et al reported sand to be the best carrier for silicon wastewater treatment comparing to granular activated carbon gac and brick particles sand material was able to achieve better reactor bed expansion fluidized state and pollutant removal rate boonrattanakij et al 2011 studied the iron crystallization onto construction sand and sio2 during fbr fenton process it was found that iron crystallization onto the construction sand was faster than crystallization onto sio2 although the final iron removal efficiencies were comparable larger quantity of construction sand could also promote the iron crystallization rate by providing larger available surface aera for iron heterogeneous nucleation anotai et al 2018 in term of organics removal carriers with larger particle size and lower density exhibited better heat and mass transfer characteristics which could promote the organics degradation kinetics in three phases liquid solid air fbr system kim and kang 1997 comparing to inert carriers reactive carriers such as gac and zeolite achieve higher organics removal in fbr fenton process cai et al 2020a reported that gac carrier enhanced organics removal in roc via extra gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction zeolite carrier also showed significant adsorption capacity for organics removal in reverse osmosis concentrate roc both gac and zeolite carriers achieved higher organics removal in roc as compared to sand carrier furthermore effective in situ gac regeneration was observed along the fenton oxidation process fig 6 illustrates how gac carrier facilitated the organics removal in roc in heterogeneous fbr fenton system higher dosage of catalytic carriers could provide more active iron surface site for oh generation while beyond the optimal carrier dosage carrier surface bonded fe2 could react with oh and reduce its availability for organics oxidation aghdasinia et al 2017b in heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process increased catalytic carrier dosage can also result in better organics removal efficiencies due to more active iron surface site or larger amount of dissolved fe2 ions in the aqueous solution while it was found that excess amount of catalytic carrier reduced the uv vis transmission and inhibited the photo fenton process li et al 2018 liu et al 2020 iron leaching from iron containing carriers at acidic condition is also an issue that affects carrier life span and treated effluent quality in zero valent iron and pyrite initiated heterogeneous fenton processes free iron ion dissolution is one of the key reactions for oh generation while in heterogeneous fenton processes that use other iron bearing minerals such as goethite hematite and magnetite iron leaching is rather a parasitic process though recent studies reported iron leaching and its induced homogeneous fenton reaction to be negligible in fbr fenton like processes aghdasinia et al 2017a li et al 2018 liu et al 2020 continuous dissolution of iron bearing minerals would adversely affect the carrier s long term performance and stability sidhu et al 1981 suggested that the crystal structure and fe o bond strength of the iron bearing minerals affected their dissolution rate at acidic condition in 0 5 m hcl solution at 25 c the dissolution rates of iron bearing minerals were in the order of magnetite hematite goethite comparing to hematite and goethite magnetite s crystal structure allows for higher chance of proton attack during the hcl dissolution and the fe o bond in magnetite is relatively weak therefore magnetite is more susceptible to acidic dissolution and during the heterogeneous fenton reaction relatively higher operation ph might be required to mitigate the iron leaching process meanwhile due to higher resilience of acidic dissolution hematite and goethite can be adopted at lower ph condition more researches can be conducted for developing these two minerals based catalysts for fbr fenton like processes 3 6 reactor configuration reactor configuration highly affects the mixing and distribution of particles in fbr systems choi and shin 1999 in the context of fbr fenton carrier mixing plays an important role on mass transfer and subsequently the oxidation efficiency there are limited studies investigating the effects of reactor configuration on fbr fenton process performance bello et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive review on fluidized bed reactor performance with different reactor geometries he highlighted the importance of reactor shape cross sectional area aspect ratio and internal structures cylindrical column is better than square column due to the less presence of dead zones in the reactor comparing to flat bed fbr tapered bed fbr could reduce carrier wash out at high liquid velocity aspect ratio was defined as the ratio between the bed height and the reactor height optimal aspect ratio shall be determined to ensure sufficient interphase mixing under reasonably high system flow rate some internal structure such as tubes and baffles can be added into the reactor to provide uniform fluidization and enhancing the interphase mixing a study conducted by wang et al 2015 demonstrated that internal draft tube in the three phases fbr system could induce smooth and steady circulation of catalytic carrier and subsequently enhance the decolorization and toc removal in azo dye orange g solution it shall also be noted that the reactor internals would come with more complex system design and operation dutta and suciu 1992 similarly for incorporating tapered bed design with optimal aspect ratio into the fbr column for fbr reactor design and optimization fluid dynamics modelling tool could be combined with kinetic modelling to predict the fbr fenton process performance based on the hydrodynamic condition farshchi et al 2019 successfully developed a modified computational fluid dynamics cfd model to predict removal of acid yellow 36 and ph changes during the heterogeneous fbr fenton process based on our review most fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes adopted batch reactors for lab scale studies and continuous flow reactors for pilot scale studies it is well known that batch reactors obtain faster reaction kinetics than continuous flow reactors anotai et al 2018 reported higher formic acid removal and iron removal 37 69 and 87 63 respectively in batch fbr fenton system than those 34 45 and 81 40 respectively in continuous flow fbr fenton systems to mitigate compromising treatment efficiency in large scale continuous flow fbr fenton systems researchers explored other reactor design elements to increase efficiency and different chemicals dosing mode was one of them it was found that stepwise chemicals dosing could improve the fenton oxidation efficiencies asymmetric stepwise dosing of h2o2 and fe2 into fenton reaction system showed significant enhancement on organics degradation due to diminished radical scavenging effect boonrattanakij et al 2018 chu et al 2007 deng 2007 gan and li 2013 to our best knowledge there are few applications of stepwise chemicals dosing in fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes this technique could be further explored for enhancing fenton oxidation performance 4 applications of fbr fenton processes 4 1 fbr fenton process in recent years there has been growing interest of deploying fbr fenton process for treating recalcitrant wastewaters fig 7 summarizes the number of studies adopting fbr fenton process for treating wastewater originated from different industry sectors since 2014 53 of the studies are focusing on model compounds removal 20 of the studies are applying fbr fenton process as a polishing step for industrial effluent treatment and 27 of the studies are dealing with raw industrial wastewater table 4 summarizes these research works with detail information on operating conditions and process performance dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is a sulfur containing organic solvent and has been intensively used in the thin film transistor liquid crystal display tft lcd industry matira et al 2015 reported 95 22 removal of dmso and 34 38 of cod removal in dmso containing wastewater imi is an emerging insecticide used as an alternative to carcinogenic organochloride insecticides fbr fenton process completely removed 0 4 mm imi and achieved total cod removal of 80 lacson et al 2018 acetophenone ap and aniline an were selected to model recalcitrant phenol compounds degradation in phenol production wastewater with initial concentration of 5 mm and 60 min reaction time more than 80 and 60 of ap and an was removed in fbr fenton system respectively boonrattanakij et al 2017 reactive black rb5 was mostly studied as a model compound in textile wastewater in rb5 containing wastewater fbr fenton process achieved cod removal efficiency of 61 83 and decolourization rate of 90 99 7 bello et al 2020 2019c b in addition to single model compounds removal fbr fenton process was also adopted for treating wastewaters from pulp and paper textile and electronics industries the overall cod removal in these industrial wastewaters ranged from 40 to 72 cai et al 2020b coupled fbr fenton with biological activated carbon bac as a cost effective solution for roc treatment the combined fbr fenton bac system achieved overall cod removal of 69 and the average effluent cod level in roc was 26 mg l fbr fenton technology has been exploited in full scale industrial wastewater treatment in taiwan since 2000 it is usually applied to achieve further cod reduction in bio treated wastewaters containing recalcitrant organic pollutants table 5 summaries several completed projects from greentec environmental protection technology co ltd greentec www biogreentec com tw and ever clear environmental eng corp ever clear www ever clear com tw these projects demonstrate full scale applications of fbr fenton in different industrial sectors including paper mill yeast production leather manufacturing and electronic industries it is important to note that the reported full scale plants are conventional fbr fenton system with sand carriers and flat bed column reactor while the current application of fbr fenton process has a good degree of application with various scales and wastewater types the key limitation of fbr fenton process for wider application is still the sludge generation and strict ph control despite reported decrease in sludge generation as compared to classic fenton cai et al 2020b there is a need to further reduce sludge generation and mitigate strict ph control in order to enhance the attractiveness of using this process for the treatment of recalcitrant wastewater 4 2 fbr fenton like process in recent years researchers also explored the feasibility of heterogeneous fbr fenton and heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes for treating wastewaters from different industry sectors such as textile pulp and paper plastic production seafood processing tft led manufacturing and so on among these studies most of them 76 were dealing with model compounds degradation 12 were applying fbr fenton like processes as tertiary treatment technology 6 of the studies focused on raw industrial wastewater treatment and 6 on other applications fig 8 table 6 summarizes recent applications of fbr fenton like processes for treating recalcitrant wastewater and compounds together with the operating conditions and process performance azo dyes such as acid yellow 36 ay36 basic bule 3 bb3 acid orange 7 ao7 orange g og and reactive black rb5 were the mostly studied compounds for mimicking textile wastewater treatment with fbr fenton like technologies in heterogeneous fbr fenton system the average removal rate of azo dyes ranged from 84 to 98 9 aghdasinia et al 2017a b 2016 farshchi et al 2019 2018 in 50 mg l og synthetic wastewater heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process achieved more than 92 colour removal and 78 9 toc removal in 180 min wang et al 2015 paracetamol a painkiller was reduced from 100 mg l to 50 mg l in 300 min with heterogeneous fbr fenton process velichkova et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa is widely used in polycarbonate plastic production with an initial concentration of 0 05 mm heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process achieved 90 toc removal in 180 min li et al 2015 n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp is a type of organic solvent used in tft led manufacturing in 10 mm nmp solution heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process achieved 82 5 removal of nmp and 93 removal of toc li et al 2018 heterogeneous fbr fenton process was also successfully implemented for dissolution of cation ion exchange resin ier purolite nrw 100 resin ier is usually employed for water purification in nuclear facilities huang et al 2020 reported that heterogeneous fbr fenton process converted 91 6 of radioactive purolite nrw 100 resin into gas and soluble fragments for safe disposal this study suggests a potential application of heterogeneous fbr fenton process in handling radioactive waste in addition to model compounds degradation heterogeneous fbr fenton process was also adopted for treating seafood processing wastewater and papermaking wastewater li et al 2019 used fe ti bimetallic oxides as the carrier and achieved total cod removal of 51 in seafood wastewater xing et al 2020 conducted a large scale papermaking wastewater treatability study treatment capacity of the heterogeneous fbr fenton system was 120 000 ton day final cod and toc removal efficiency was 74 10 and 71 30 respectively in terms of industrial effluents tertiary treatment heterogeneous fbr fenton process achieved 84 toc removal and 94 decolourization in flax secondary effluent fan et al 2017 there are few reported full scale applications of fbr fenton like processes which indicates the potential for future development the key issues identified for fbr fenton like processes were slow reaction kinetics of heterogeneous fenton poor catalyst stability and high energy consumption involved in uv vis assisted process future research efforts for tackling these bottlenecks will be discussed in the following section 5 concluding remarks and perspectives the present study provides a complete overview on recent fbr fenton related research works from the fundamentals process design operational parameters to up to date technology development and applications in industrial wastewater treatment fbr fenton process has been successfully transferred from lab scale to full scale applications research efforts are still being actively pursued to scale up the fbr fenton like processes and enhance their overall cost effectiveness based on the present state of fbr fenton technologies development some existing technical hurdles in their industrial applications are addressed as following together with the potential solutions and future development opportunities for full scale applications of fbr fenton processes 5 1 modelling techniques for process optimization and scaling up among the main constrains preventing a wider adoption of fbr fenton technologies the lack of strategies for expanding their applications in treating different types of industrial wastewaters and fluidized bed reactor scale up are the major ones in this context numerical tools such as kinetic models would facilitate technology scaling up by simulating the fbr fenton processes and predicting their performance at large scale applications while as previously mentioned the chemical kinetics in fbr fenton processes can be highly affected by the mass transfer between different phases and reactor hydrodynamics it will be very challenging to numerically solve the mass and momentum conservation equations in conjunction with more than 20 chemical reactions involved in fbr fenton processes computational fluid dynamic cfd is a suitable simulation tool that is able to simultaneously solve the governing equations through space and time alpert et al 2010 with appropriate boundary and initial conditions cfd technique can integrate reaction kinetics and reactor hydrodynamics into one model framework by describing both physical and chemical changes within a reactor furthermore cfd analysis can effectively reduce the workload and cost required for reactor scale up several studies have successfully implemented cfd technique to simulate the advanced oxidation processes for their performance prediction and reactor scale up alpert et al 2010 chuang et al 2016 farshchi et al 2019 mohajerani et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 tisa et al 2014a khongprom et al 2020 developed a cfd model for predicting the performance of full scale circulating fluidized bed downer reactors the validated model performed reliable process performance prediction with a deviation of 10 and mean relative absolute error of less than 5 when compared to the actual full scale plant performance fbr fenton process is complex in nature its operation involves spatial distribution of fenton reagents wastewater and carriers mass transfer fenton reactions radical species generation sludge formation and iron crystallization kinetic modelling of this multivariate system could be very tedious and time consuming machine learning such as artificial neural network ann might be useful in solving this problem it can derive the model from available data without prior design or adjustment ann is powerful in terms of multivariate calibration and it is able to identify cause effect correlations through training with multiple input and output systems elmolla et al 2010 implemented ann for the modelling of antibiotic degradation in fenton process correlation between ann predicted results and experimental results had a r2 value of 0 997 and h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was the most influential parameter on chemical oxygen demand cod removal performance yu et al 2013 adopted ann analysis to predict the required fe2 dosage in electro fenton process for treating synthetic textile wastewater a good correlation r2 0 99 between the actual and predicted fe2 dosage was performed by ann model application of machine learning for fbr fenton process optimization and performance prediction could significantly reduce the workload and resources requirement for future scaling up 5 2 chelating agents for wider operation ph as discussed in earlier sections higher operation ph reduces the free iron ions availability for hydroxyl radical production and subsequently hinders the fenton oxidation efficiency fbr fenton process has a very limited operation ph range though fbr fenton like processes could be operated over a wider range strict ph control within the acidic condition is still required ph control has been a critical bottleneck in the industrial applications of fbr fenton technologies more research efforts are needed to omit the ph control step one potential solution can be explored for heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process is the addition of chelating agents which could form stable complexes with ferric ions and preventing ferric precipitation at neutral ph under uv vis irradiation the ferric ligand complexes could also significantly absorb uv vis light and undergo photolytic decomposition for ferrous ion regeneration the most commonly used chelating agents in photo fenton process were oxalate citrate ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetic acid nta clarizia et al 2017 each ferric ligand complex would exhibit different light absorption property at varying ph and irradiation wavelength which thereby affects the lmct reaction rate for ferrous ion regeneration weller et al 2013 reported that ferric bisoxalate complex had a higher quantum yield for ferrous ion regeneration 1 23 at 313 nm and ferric trisoxalate complex had a higher quantum yield 1 00 at 436 nm kocot et al 2006 found that ferric edta complex obtained highest quantum yield 0 05 at 313 nm and ph of 4 highest quantum yield of ferric nta complex was 0 46 at 313 nm and ph of 4 abida et al 2006 ferric citrate complex could achieve good quantum yield values 0 21 0 28 at longer irradiation wavelength of 436 nm faust and zepp 1993 whereas for homogeneous fbr fenton process addition of chelating agents will prevent ferric ions from precipitating as ferric hydroxide at high ph lewis et al 2009 hence allowing homogenous fenton reaction to be operated at wider ph ranges while aguiar and ferraz 2012 demonstrated the dual effects of chelating agents addition where the decolorization of azure b could be promoted and inhibited with different chelating agent loadings and ph conditions therefore to develop cost effective heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process and homogeneous fbr fenton process at near neutral ph the chelating agents should be carefully selected with a minimal increase in chemical cost and initial organic loading the chelating agent dosage operating condition biodegradability and ecotoxicity of the species formed should all be evaluated 5 3 carriers with high catalytic activity and slow dissolution rate one key drawback of fbr fenton like processes is the slow reaction kinetics which is mainly due to the low catalytic activity of iron bearing minerals researchers have explored alternative carriers with higher catalytic activity for promoted hydroxyl radicals generation in the fbr system li et al 2019 adopted fe ti bimetallic oxides as the carrier to conduct heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process for real seafood processing wastewater treatment the bimetallic carrier exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for h2o2 decomposition under the visible light irradiation in the context of heterogeneous fenton process great efforts have been made to study different types of heterogeneous catalysts including iron bearing minerals clay based catalysts and other form of iron containing catalysts zhu et al 2019 iron containing catalysts consist of zero valent iron transition metal exchanged zeolites fe zeolites mn zeolites cu zeolites and metal doped iron oxides znfe2o4 lafeo3 mnfe2o4 these groups of heterogeneous catalysts possess better catalytic activity for h2o2 decomposition currently iron bearing minerals are the mostly used carrier materials in fbr fenton like processes more research works could be carried out to investigate the feasibility of iron containing catalysts as the fbr carriers furthermore to enhance the stability of currently used iron bearing minerals and to mitigate the iron leaching process at acidic condition morphological augmentation can be consider as an alternative for fbr fenton carrier development composites of aluminium doped iron minerals such as al goethite and al hematite have shown enhanced stability against to acidic dissolution schwertmann 1991 another recent development in homogenous fbr fenton is the use of gac as a carrier for its adsorption properties and catalytic activity for oh generation recent understanding of the synergistic effect of adsorption and catalytic activity of gac as a carrier has interesting potential to be further explored bello et al 2020 cai et al 2020a facilitation of gac materials on oh formation and how the functional groups such as chromene type structures in gac could enhance oh formation were also reported elsewhere vega and valdés 2018 more future studies can be carried out to developed gac based catalysts with good stability and higher catalytic activity as well as to validate and demonstrate their long term performance in large scale applications 5 4 coupled fbr fenton biological process aops have been widely recognized as effective alternatives for treatment of industrial wastewater containing recalcitrant organic compounds tisa et al 2014b suggested fbr fenton process to be the most economic fluidized bed aop however aops for complete mineralization are generally expensive because the intermediates formed during treatment tend to be even more resistant to complete chemical degradation and furthermore the intermediates also consume substantial amount of energy uv vis radiation and chemicals oxidants catalyst etc which increase with the treatment duration muñoz et al 2005 one attractive alternative is to apply aops as pre treatment processes for breaking down the recalcitrant organics into biodegradable intermediates which could be further treated with biological processes at a considerably lower cost oller et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 another option would be to apply the combination strategy in the opposite direction first eliminating the highly biodegradable portion of the industrial wastewater and then break down the remnant recalcitrant contaminants by post treatment aops most of the reviewed studies adopted fbr fenton technologies as stand alone processes for recalcitrant organics removal researchers could further look into the cost effectiveness of coupled fbr fenton

17237,in recent years fluidized bed fenton fbr fenton process has gained more attention in treating recalcitrant industrial wastewater fbr fenton combines the effectiveness of homogeneous fenton and sludge reduction of heterogeneous fenton comparing to other modified fenton processes fbr fenton has greater economical and scaling up potential however large consumption of fenton reagents and strict ph control are still the bottlenecks hampering the full scale application of fbr fenton while prior reviews mainly focused on the operation and performance of fbr fenton process the present study critically discussed the challenges and bottlenecks for its full scale industrial application this study also comprehensively reviewed the development strategies for tackling these drawbacks mainly over the recent five years homogeneous fbr fenton heterogeneous fbr fenton and heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes were classified for the first time according to their reaction mechanisms and system designs important operational and design parameters affecting the cost effectiveness of all fbr fenton technologies were reviewed including the fundamentals common practices and even innovative steps for enhancing the process performance up to date applications of fbr fenton technologies in recalcitrant wastewater compounds treatment were also summarized and it was found that upscaling of heterogeneous fbr fenton and heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes was still very challenging strategies to overcome the key technical limitations and enhance process cost effectiveness were discussed in the future perspective part furthermore modelling techniques such as computational fluid dynamics model and artificial neural network were suggested to be promising modelling techniques for speeding up the full scale applications of fbr fenton technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation processes fluidized bed fenton process heterogeneous fenton process photo fenton process recalcitrant organics removal industrial wastewater treatment 1 introduction 1 1 management and characteristics of industrial wastewater due to the potential harm to the receiving water bodies aquatic ecosystem and even human health there are growing concerns for discharge of industrial wastewaters with toxic and recalcitrant organics this has resulted in extensive research efforts on developing industrial wastewater treatment technologies for toxic and biologically refractory organic contaminants abatement due to their resilience to the conventional biological treatment processes these compounds are often released into the water environments and showing significant environmental persistence and ecotoxicity choi et al 2017 various types of refractory compounds could have unknown synergistic effects on the aquatic ecosystem or induce certain levels of bioaccumulation due to their environment persistence a study from directorate generals for health and consumers european commission showed that chemical industrial wastewater containing a large quantity of chemical mixtures exhibiting more significant health effect than single compound consumers 2011 world widely the discharge of industrial wastewater is regulated by more stringent and specific guidelines according to the water act in singapore australia and japan chemical oxygen demand cod discharge limit to fresh and marine water bodies ranges from 15 to 60 mg l and 5 day biological oxygen demand bod5 discharge limit is from 15 to 20 mg l in addition to controlling bulk organics emission governments and agencies started to enforce regulations for emerging contaminants ecs discharge from 2017 1 4 dioxane and polychlorinated biphenyls pcb were regulated in japan water pollution control law for their discharge limits to the surface waters norman project funded by the european commission studied the occurrence of ecs in surface waters and aimed to move towards environmental legislations for regulating ecs discharge dulio et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 stated that there has been increasing regularization in ecs discharge such as the implementation of the fourth unregulated contaminant monitoring rule by us epa with an ever increasing push for more stringent discharge standards greater emphasis has been placed on cost effective solutions for industrial wastewater treatment industrial wastewater treatment is challenging due to the inhibitory properties of recalcitrant organic pollutants and the typical variable composition in the water matrix biological treatments typically have slow reaction kinetics and might not sufficiently treat the industrial wastewaters for them to be safely discharged into the environment bilińska et al 2016 physico chemical technologies such as adsorption and membrane filtration do not degrade the pollutants and downstream treatment of the harmful concentrates is still required as such there has been growing interest in the development of various advanced oxidation processes aops for degrading recalcitrant organics in industrial wastewater table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of some prominent industrial wastewaters that were recently studied with aops including textile wastewater pharmaceutical wastewater papermill wastewater commercial oil production wastewater and reverse osmosis concentrate roc attributed to different industrial sectors and production processes the ph conditions cod and bod5 concentrations in these wastewaters can be varied over a wide range while their bod5 cod ratio are generally low indicating potential inhibitory effects to the biological treatment process textile wastewater generally contains azo dyes which are well known for their bio recalcitrant and acute toxicity some are also known carcinogens and show neurotoxicity to animals liang et al 2017 based on recent studies on textile wastewater treatment with aops the cod concentrations in textile wastewater range from 192 to 2360 mg l bod5 concentrations range from 24 to 400 mg l and the bod5 cod ratios are between 0 110 to 0 170 pharmaceutical wastewater mainly refers to the effluents and waste generated from drug manufacturing it comprises of pharmaceutically active compounds such as hormones and antibiotics through literature review the average cod levels in pharmaceutical wastewater range from 120 to 8370 mg l bod5 levels range from 4 to 4925 mg l and bod5 cod ratios are around 0 030 to 0 172 the large degree of variation of wastewater characteristics is due to type of manufacturing process the wastewater is taken from papermill wastewater contains micro pollutants omps which are difficult to remove due to their complex physicochemical properties and toxicity toxicity studies done by xing et al 2020 showed significant chronic toxicity and genotoxicity on zebrafish even with 8 times dilution of the wastewater the cod concentrations in papermill wastewater range from 124 to 800 mg l the bod5 concentrations range from 9 to 19 mg l and the bod5 cod ratios are between 0 069 to 0 110 commercially pressed oil cpo production wastewater usually contains phenolic compounds which are refractory to biological treatment caporaso et al 2017 the cod range of cpo wastewater is 479 12180 mg l and bod5 cod ratios are from 0 050 to 0 204 reverse osmosis has been widely used for water reclamation from industrial secondary effluents its cod levels range from 50 to 435 mg l and bod5 cod ratios are between 0 006 0 070 the contaminates levels in roc could be 4 to 20 times higher than their original levels kumar et al 2007 and most of them are recalcitrant to the conventional biotreatment high salinity in roc could also adversely affect the bioreactors stability and performance furthermore various inorganic species in roc could inhibit the chemical oxidation process efficiency achieving low effluent cod level in roc treatment is challenging with either biological processes or oxidation processes 1 2 fbr fenton for industrial wastewater treatment aops comprise of various techniques to transform and break down organic contaminants into carbon dioxide water and simpler substances the key advantage of aop is its non selective nature and ability to breakdown large or complex organic molecules marco et al 1997 the principle of aop is to use highly reactive oxidative species such as hydroxyl radical oh for degrading organic contaminants in the wastewater among all the aops fluidized bed reactor fenton fbr fenton based aops are deemed as cost effective means for refractory wastewater treatment tisa et al 2014b fbr fenton is a modified process from classic fenton it is a relatively new technology as compared to other forms of fenton processes such as photo fenton and electro fenton numerous research efforts are still being actively pursued to enhance its process efficiency and explore its full scale application in industrial wastewater treatment many researchers have assessed and reviewed the application of fenton based aops for treating real industrial wastewaters and synthetic wastewaters table 2 summarizes the major findings in recent reviews that were conducted from 2014 to present focusing on fbr fenton process for wastewater treatment tisa et al 2014b reviewed the applicability of fluidized bed reactor in recalcitrant compound degradation through advanced oxidation processes in her review different types of fbr aops were evaluated with their performances for degrading various model compounds such as acetaminophen aniline and nitrobenzene fbr fenton was recommended as the most effective fbr aop pliego et al 2015 conducted a critical review on various improvement techniques for classical fenton process in wastewater treatment although this review did not specifically target on fbr fenton it provided some insights about heterogeneous fenton process which could be effectively applied in fbr fenton process garcia segura et al 2016 proposed fbr fenton as an alternative technology for wastewater treatment he highlighted the key advantages of fbr fenton over classic fenton including higher organics removal efficiency and less sludge production bello et al 2017 provided a comprehensive review on the application of fbr in all sorts of aops he summarized the important features for fbr design and key operation parameters in fbr fenton process his later study bello et al 2019a addressed the key limitations of classic fenton for recalcitrant wastewater treatment and proposed fbr fenton as one of the potential solutions up to now researchers have successfully incorporated fenton heterogeneous fenton and heterogeneous photo fenton processes into fbr system while prior reviews provided some valuable insights to the operation and performance of fbr fenton process the mechanisms industrial applications related challenges and solutions were not critically reviewed to our best knowledge this is the first study to have an in depth discussion on the reaction mechanisms of various fbr fenton processes as well as their applications in recalcitrant industrial wastewater treatment the present study firstly elaborates the reaction mechanisms system design and process operation of each fbr fenton technology key operational and design parameters involved in all fbr fenton technologies are discussed with their effects on oxidation efficiency and iron crystallization efficiency current state of fbr fenton applications in specific industrial wastewater treatment is also included key challenges of fbr fenton full scale application and potential strategies to overcome the bottlenecks are discussed 2 fbr fenton process mechanism to address the problem of sludge production in classic fenton process researchers have explored the possibility of conducting fenton reaction in fluidized bed reactor a fluidized bed reactor is a contacting device that uses the principle of fluidization for its operation so that the packed material could be expanded by the upward or downward movement of the fluid the fluidized materials used in fbr fenton system can be inert solids or active catalysts and they are defined as carriers which provide available sites for crystallization and precipitation of iron hydroxides and hence reduce the sludge production in fenton reaction fbr fenton technologies can be categorized as fbr fenton process and fbr fenton like process fig 1 in fbr fenton process homogeneous fenton is the dominate process for organics oxidation and the carriers used are inert solids such as sand sio2 and bricks particles they are mainly participating in iron crystallization process in fbr fenton like process by introducing iron bearing minerals or bimetallic oxides heterogeneous fenton is the main mechanism for organics oxidation uv vis irradiation could be also incorporated to initiate the heterogeneous photo fenton process with reference to the terms of homogenous and heterogenous their key difference is the iron sources used to induce the fenton reaction in homogenous fbr fenton system free fe2 ion in the aqueous solution is the main iron sources in heterogeneous fbr fenton system iron sources are immobilized within on the catalyst structure and they could induce catalytic degradation of target pollutants with minimum generation of ferric sludge fig 2 a depicts schematic set up of homogeneous fbr fenton system which consists of a cylindrical reactor packed with carriers and their support material glass beads and porous ceramsite are usually used to support the carriers as well as provide even distributions of the incoming flow after wastewater is acidified with sulfuric acid ferrous salt and h2o2 solutions are dosed into the influent line and pumped together with wastewater into fbr fenton reactor from the bottom internal circulation of the reaction mixture is subsequently initiated to fluidize the carriers with desired bed expansion rate the treated wastewater is collected from the effluent outlet at the top and subsequently gone through neutralization flocculation and settling processes heterogeneous fbr fenton process usually shares the similar set up with homogeneous fbr fenton process both adopting liquid solid two phases design fig 2b shows a schematic heterogeneous fbr photo fenton system a uv lamp is fixed inside the reactor for carrying out the photo fenton process and an air pump is adopted for carrier fluidization this is a typical liquid solid air three phases design reactor reaction mechanisms of fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes are elaborated in the following parts 2 1 homogeneous fbr fenton process fbr fenton is firstly modified from classic fenton process thus the fundamental of homogeneous fbr fenton process is the fenton reaction which generates hydroxyl radicals when h2o2 and ferrous ion fenton reagents are brought into contact in aqueous solution at acidic ph eqs 2 1 to 2 8 depict the key reactions that take place in homogenous fbr fenton process de laat and gallard 1999 ferrous ion initiates the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 for oh formation eq 2 1 meanwhile the generated ferric ion is reduced by h2o2 to ferrous ion eq 2 2 enabling an effective cyclic mechanism for ferrous regeneration in the reaction described in eq 2 2 another radical specie hydroperoxyl radical ho2 is also produced which is less active than oh for organics oxidation due to its lower redox potential reaction 2 2 is usually referred as fenton like reaction and it is much slower than the fenton reaction thus the produced ferric ions in reaction 2 1 would be progressively accumulated leading to ferric sludge production in the fenton system 2 1 h 2 o 2 f e 2 f e 3 h o o h 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 f e 2 h o 2 h eqs 2 3 to 2 5 depicts other rate limiting steps for ferrous ion regeneration and hydroxyl radial production excess ferrous ion could scavenge the produced radical species eqs 2 3 and 2 4 and ho2 could react with ferric ion for additional ferrous ion regeneration eq 2 5 it shall be noted that in the above reactions ferrous ion acts as a catalyst and h2o2 is continuously consumed for oh production 2 3 f e 2 h o f e 3 o h 2 4 f e 2 h o 2 f e 3 h o 2 2 5 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 o 2 h eqs 2 6 to 2 8 summarizes other radical scavenging reactions that could occur during the fenton process 2 6 h o h 2 o 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 7 h o h o 2 h 2 o o 2 2 8 h o h o h 2 o 2 the whole fenton process involves a complex reaction mechanism hydroxyl radical is generated in the chain initiation reaction eq 2 1 while it could be scavenged by ferrous ion eq 2 3 hydrogen peroxide eq 2 6 hydroperoxyl radical eq 2 7 and even itself hydrogen peroxide could be the initiator for radical production but also be the inhibitor for subsequent oxidation process ferrous ion could catalyze hydrogen peroxide decomposition but also scavenge the produced radicals in the presence of organic molecules rh the produced hydroxyl radicals will attack them through protons abstraction and produce highly reactive organic radicals r kato and walling 1971 which could be further oxidized eq 2 9 2 9 r h h o h 2 o r in homogeneous fbr fenton system in addition to the above described fenton reaction other four reaction mechanisms are also involved as shown in fig 3 the generated oh could oxidize the organics pollutants to less recalcitrant intermediates crystallization of ferric hydroxide on the carrier surface could occur via heterogeneous nucleation boonrattanakij et al 2011 the ferric hydroxide coated carrier may possess some extent of catalytic activity and initiate heterogeneous fenton reaction for additional oh generation meanwhile the presented organic oxidation intermediates particularly volatile fatty acids could form soluble complexes with ferric ion and hence interfere ferric ion solubility and crystallization boonrattanakij et al 2011 2 2 heterogeneous fbr fenton process to further overcome the high sludge production and narrow ph operation range in homogeneous fenton process researchers explored the possibility of conducting heterogeneous fenton in fluidized reactor the fbr system could provide adequate catalytic reaction site by housing large number of active carriers as well as induce high mass transfer rate with carrier fluidization heterogeneous fenton reaction occurs when h2o2 molecule is in contact with the iron sites of the carrier with minimum ferric sludge production natural pyrite magnetite and fe ti bimetallic oxides have been adopted as carriers to initiate the heterogeneous fenton reaction in fbr aghdasinia et al 2017a b 2016 farshchi et al 2019 2018 li et al 2019 in the presence of iron bearing minerals heterogeneous fenton reaction mainly involve the following reactions where the symbol represents the iron species bounded to the carrier surface hou et al 2016 2 10 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h h o 2 11 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e o o h 2 h 2 12 f e o o h 2 f e 2 h o 2 similar with the classic fenton reaction oh is the key radical for organic pollutants oxidation and the major mechanism for oh production in heterogeneous fenton is the reaction describes in eq 2 10 pathway for fe2 regeneration is composed of two consecutive reactions eqs 2 11 and 2 12 h2o2 reacts with fe3 to form the intermediate fe ooh 2 which can be dissociated into the hydroperoxyl radical and reduced fe2 molina et al 2006 under the acidic condition certain portion of fe2 could be leached out as free fe2 and participates in homogeneous fenton reaction aghdasinia et al 2017b zhang et al 2014 part of leached fe3 could also form iron hydroxide and form crystal by using carrier as the foreign particle although the proportion of leached free iron ions were reported to be insignificant it was worth mentioning that the reported studies were mostly conducted for short operation duration the dominance of the leaching mechanism is also highly dependent on the type of iron bearing minerals which will be further elaborated in the next section along the heterogeneous fenton oxidation the formed organic intermediates such as carboxylic acid compounds could form ferro organic complexes with fe3 affecting the solubilities of iron species in the fbr fenton system fig 4 illustrates the above mentioned reaction mechanisms involved in heterogeneous fbr fenton process 2 3 heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process photo fenton process is another modification of classic fenton process by combining fenton reaction with uv vis irradiation it could be conducted in both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and the main difference between the two systems is the form of iron source homogeneous system requires strict ph control and forms large quantity of ferric sludge after the treatment process and hence heterogeneous photo fenton process was brought to the picture for overcoming these limitations nevertheless comparing to homogeneous reaction heterogeneous photo fenton reaction has slower oxidation rate due to limited catalyst surface and mass transfer rate these two limitations could be solved by adopting fbr for larger number of catalyst or carrier and higher mass transfer rate via the liquid solid air three phases fluidization recently goethite was adopted by researchers to carry out heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process for recalcitrant organics removal li et al 2015 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2015 apart from the mechanism for heterogenous fenton eqs 2 10 to 2 12 the additional uv vis irradiation will induce some alternative reaction mechanisms photo reduction of fe3 described in eq 2 13 could facilitate fe2 regeneration under uv vis irradiation extra oh would also be generated through direct photolysis of h2o2 eq 2 14 uv vis irradiation also facilitates regeneration of fe2 through the ligand to metal charge transfer lmct described in eq 2 15 clarizia et al 2017 during the oxidation process the formed fe ligand complexes could significantly absorb uv vis light and undergo photolytic decomposition 2 13 f e 3 h v f e 2 h o 2 14 h 2 o 2 h v 2 h o 2 15 f e 3 l h v f e 3 l f e 2 l li et al 2018 used zero valent iron fe0 powder in heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process for n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp removal different from iron mineral carriers in fe0 system dissolution of fe0 at acidic condition plays a key role for forming free fe2 ions and initiating the fenton reaction free fe2 ions can also be generated through the fe0 photocatalytic process eqs 2 16 and 2 17 in a three phases liquid solid air fbr system the aeration process could oxidize fe0 to form fe2 and h2o2 eq 2 18 which potentially propagates more oh generation for organics degradation minella et al 2016 the formed fe3 is reduced by fe for fe2 regeneration as well as photo reduced to fe2 under uv vis irradiation eqs 2 19 and 2 20 2 16 f e 0 2 h f

initiated heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes in goethite system in addition to the above mentioned mechanisms for oh generation and fe2 regeneration homogeneous fenton reaction could occur with the leached fe2 in both systems there would also be ferric precipitates formation and iron crystallization on the carrier surface as well as the ferro organics complexation between the immobilized iron species and oxidation intermediates 3 factors affecting fbr fenton performance this part of review focuses on the key influencing parameters in the fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes based on exhaustive review of recent fbr fenton studies the key parameters affecting the efficiencies of fenton oxidation and iron crystallization include fenton reagents dosage operation ph water matrix bed expansion rate carriers and reactor configuration 3 1 fenton reagents dosage oxidation efficiency of fbr fenton process is correlated with the amount of oh generated and oh production is directly affected by the dosage of fenton reagents fenton oxidation efficiency were generally observed to be increased with higher h2o2 dosage kang and hwang 2000 lin et al 1999 while excess amount of h2o2 also scavenges the generated oh eq 2 6 thereby inhibiting the entire process performance the h2o2 dosage shall be optimized so that the total supplied amount is consumed effectively during the fenton process this optimal dosage can only be obtained through testing with specific target wastewater and cod concentration in wastewater can be used as an indicative value of required h2o2 dosage based on our reviewed studies on industrial wastewater treatment with fbr fenton process the mass ratio between h2o2 dosage and cod concentration is ranging from 1 00 to 7 78 anotai et al 2018 boonrattanakij et al 2018 cai et al 2020a cai et al 2020b chen et al 2015 liu et al 2014 chen et al chen et al 2015 adopted homogeneous fbr fenton process for flax wastewater treatment and reported 89 toc removal with 600 mg l h2o2 further increasing of h2o2 dosage to 800 mg l reduced the final toc removal efficiency h2o2 overdosing was also reported in heterogeneous fbr fenton system in the presence of natural magnetite aghdasinia et al aghdasinia et al 2017a observed faster basic blue 3 bb3 degradation when h2o2 dosage was increased from 1 to 4 mm however the kinetic of bb3 degradation slowed down while h2o2 dosage was further increased higher concentration of fe2 usually induces higher oxidation efficiency of fenton process while the efficiency enhancement was observed to be marginal above an excessive concentration of fe2 this is due to the reaction between fe2 and oh eq 2 3 that reduces the available active radicals for organics oxidation lacson et al 2018 reported higher removal efficiency of imidacloprid imi with increased fe2 dosage from 0 1 to 0 8 mm while higher fe2 dosage beyond 0 8 mm inhibited imi degradation the optimal fe2 dosage could be determined based on the optimal h2o2 dosage they are related via the optimal molar ratio of fenton reagents h2o2 fe2 for each specific wastewater treatment in spite of many research studies and industrial applications of fenton process there is no agreement on a universal value of optimal h2o2 fe2 nevertheless some optimum values of h2o2 fe2 were reported from 3 30 to 30 00 for industrial wastewater treatment with fbr fenton process anotai et al 2018 boonrattanakij et al 2018 cai et al 2020a cai et al 2020b chen et al 2015 liu et al 2014 in fbr fenton system fe2 dosage could also affect the iron crystallization process and ferric sludge production after fe2 was converted to fe3 via fenton reaction the formed ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 would be agglomerated with homogeneous nucleation and simultaneously deposited on the carrier surface via heterogeneous nucleation effective iron crystallization only occurs with notable dormancy of heterogeneous nucleation process boonrattanakij et al 2018 high fe2 dosage produces supersaturated iron solution and under this supersaturated condition fe oh 3 crystal would grow and ripen with homogeneous nucleation process instead of using carrier as the foreign particle for heterogeneous nucleation the formed fe oh 3 crystals would be suspended in the aqueous phase resulting in more ferric sludge production as previously mentioned the optimal fenton reagents dosage required for treating a specific wastewater must be determined empirically based on series of lab scale or pilot scale studies the optimal dosages of h2o2 and fe2 are dependent on target wastewater characteristics nature and concentration of the target pollutants fenton reaction conditions and treatment objectives in recent fbr fenton related studies the reported optimal h2o2 dosage ranged from 0 04 to 104 4 mm and the optimal fe2 dosage was from 1 to 5 mm most studies adopted taguchi method and response surface method with central composite for process optimization aghdasinia et al 2017a 2016 bello et al 2019c cai et al 2020a there is also increasing use of machine learning systems like deep learning and reinforced learning for fbr fenton process optimization one popular deep learning tool is the artificial neural network ann which is able to model complex interactions that have unknown behaviors elmolla et al 2010 ann is powerful in terms of multivariate calibration and it is able to identify cause effect correlations through training with multiple input and output systems the applications of ann analysis for fbr fenton system modelling and process optimization could significantly reduce the workload and resource requirements 3 2 operation ph the effectiveness of fenton based processes is highly dependent on the operation ph ph affects the solubility of iron species iron crystallization process and also governs the overall stability of h2o2 molecules and radical species table 3 summarises the impacts of ph on fenton oxidation and iron crystallization processes the optimum ph used in fenton oxidation is mostly reported to be 3 at ph lower than 3 the produced oh could be scavenged by excess h ions fe2 would react with larger amount of h ions to form fe h2o 6 2 complex and h2o2 would form more stable oxonium ions h3o2 with lower activity of the fenton reagents fenton reaction for oh production is hindered and the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 for fe2 regeneration would also be inhibited in fbr fenton based processes the organics removal efficiencies were also reported to be higher with reduced ph till 3 whereas heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process could achieve effective organics removal over a wider ph range from 3 to 5 aghdasinia et al 2017a li et al 2018 liu et al 2020 in heterogeneous fbr fenton and photo fenton processes lower ph condition would induce iron leaching from the catalytic carrier and promote the homogeneous fenton reaction though most studies reported the homogeneous fenton reaction to be insignificant due to low concentration of free fe2 ion higher ph condition ph 4 would dramatically reduce the free iron ions availability as they would mostly form ferric hydroxide precipitates under the alkaline condition self decomposition of h2o2 to h2o and o2 is accelerated at ph level higher than 5 moreover the redox potential of oh is reported to be lower at higher ph e0 2 8 1 95 v at ph 0 14 kim 1998 the operation ph also affects the iron crystallization on the carrier surface boonrattanakij et al boonrattanakij et al 2011 observed negligible iron crystallization onto the carrier at ph 7 and it was attributed to strongly supersaturated condition of ferric ions at ph 7 the growth and ripening of ferric crystal can only occur very rapidly via homogeneous nucleation and the carrier could not involve in iron crystallization via heterogeneous nucleation thus the iron crystallization efficiency was observed to be higher at ph 3 than ph 7 and more ferric sludge was produced at higher operation ph 3 3 water matrix some common inorganic anions presented in the water matrix could hinder the fenton reaction either by reducing catalytic activity of free iron species or scavenging the produced oh ratanatamskul et al 2010 reported inhibitory effects of inorganic anions on nitrobenzene degradation in fbr fenton process with the order of h2po4 cl no3 it was also indicated that when the concentration of cl ion was less than 20 mm its inhibition effect on nitrobenzene removal could be overcome with extended reaction time anotai et al 2010 reported higher inhibitory effect of h2po4 ion than cl ion on aniline oxidation in fbr fenton process siedlecka et al 2007 studied methyl t butylether mtbe decomposition in fenton reaction and found the inorganic anions suppressed the mtbe removal rate in the order of h2po4 cl so4 2 clo4 at acidic reaction condition fenton reaction is extremely sensitive to h2po4 ion due to its complex reactions with the iron species eqs 3 1 to 3 8 summarize the complex reactions with ferric and ferrous ions in the presence of h2po4 cl and so4 2 ions the complexation of ferrous ion reduces its availability and reactivity for h2o2 decomposition and hence hinder oh generation formation of ferric complexes with these anions affects the ferrous regeneration step which in a way also decreases the rate of oh generation 3 1 f e 2 h 2 p o 4 f e h 2 p o 4 3 2 f e 3 h 2 p o 4 f e h 2 p o 4 2 3 3 f e 2 c l f e c l 3 4 f e 3 c l f e c l 2 3 5 f e 3 2 c l f e c l 2 3 6 f e 2 s o 4 2 f e s o 4 3 7 f e 3 s o 4 2 f e s o 4 3 8 f e 3 2 s o 4 2 f e s o 2 in addition to complex reactions h2po4 cl and so4 2 also compete with organic compounds to react with oh these oh scavenging reactions could result in formation of different inorganic radicals and at acidic condition the dominate inorganic radicals consist of h2po4 cl2 and so4 though these inorganics radicals are strong oxidants according to neta et al 1988 rosso et al 1998 their second order reaction rate constants for organics degradation were among the range of 103 to 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 this reaction kinetics are much slower than organic degradation initiated by oh that ranges from 107 to 1010 m 1s 1 therefore oh scavenging by inorganic anions hinders the overall organics degradation kinetics it was also highlighted that clo4 and no3 less interfered the organics degradation in fenton reaction this could be due to negligible complexation between these two anions and the iron species as well as insignificant oh scavenging effect of clo4 and no3 liao and gurol 1995 riga et al 2007 for specific recalcitrant pollutants removal in industrial wastewaters the background organic matters humic acids fulvic acids carbohydrates and proteins could also compete with the target pollutants to react with oh for oxidation or forming organic radicals with lower redox potential michael kordatou et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2015 some water matrix components might be able to promote the fbr fenton processes for example the natural iron species existed in the wastewater could act as extra iron sources for the fenton reaction and some inherent reductants might facilitate ferrous ion regeneration from ferric ion lado ribeiro et al 2019 in photo fenton process complexations between ferric ion and some organic compounds containing carboxylic or hydroxy groups could enhance the quantum yield of fe2 ion via the ligand to metal charge transfer lmct manenti et al 2015 in heterogeneous fenton process iron precipitation at circumvent ph might also be mitigated by the metal ligand complexation the formed ferric ligand complexes could enhance the solubility of fe3 ion and allow the fenton oxidation to be conducted over a wider ph range while it was also reported that the metal ligand complexation between fe3 and the oxidation intermediates such as carboxylic compounds could remarkably deteriorate the iron crystallization in fbr fenton process anotai et al 2018 some inorganic ligands presented in the wastewater could also reduce the effectiveness of fbr fenton process fischbacher et al 2017 reported complexation between pyrophosphate ligand and fe3 ion and the formed complex did not react with h2o2 thereby terminating the reactions for fe2 ion regeneration ligands addition was suggested to be an effective solution for expanding the operation ph of fenton based processes while they could be acting as both the process promoters and inhibitors more details on ligands addition will be elaborated in the future perspective part 3 4 bed expansion rate in fbr system the minimum liquid velocity required for carrier fluidization is defined as the minimum fluidization velocity vmf which can be calculated using wen and yu equation lim et al 2008 to achieve effective carrier bed expansion the liquid velocity shall be maintained higher than vmf and the internal recirculation flow rate shall be applied according to desired fenton reaction time for effective organics removal sufficient bed expansion rate could enhance the mass transfer rate for homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton reactions chen et al 2015 adopted a batch fbr fenton reactor 5 2 cm diameter and 50 cm height to treat flax wastewater it was found that within 100 min reaction time 20 bed expansion rate had significantly lower decolorization performance as compared to 50 and 100 bed expansion rate it was also noted that higher bed expansion rate would enhance the contact between iron oxides and the carrier and thus facilitate the iron crystallization process while too high bed expansion rate or water flow rate could deteriorate iron coating on carrier surface through scouring effect anotai et al 2018 chou et al 2004 studied total iron removal efficiency in a fbr reactor 3 cm diameter and 200 cm height under different bed expansion rates it was found that the lowest bed expansion rate of 20 achieved better total iron removal efficiency in 24 min and higher bed expansion rate of 30 and 90 could wash out the iron oxides flocs and hinder the iron crystallization process in liquid solid fbr fenton systems the bed expansion rate typically ranges from 30 to 100 most studies reported 50 to be optimal for fenton oxidation and iron crystallization process 3 5 carriers the physical and chemical properties of carrier materials play important roles on iron crystallization and organics removal kinetics in this context different carriers haven been adopted in fbr fenton process for industrial effluent treatment including sio2 sand al2o3 fe2o3 granular activated carbon ceramsite and bricks particles anotai et al 2012 bello et al 2020 boonrattanakij et al 2011 briones et al 2012 chen et al 2015 matira et al 2015 su et al 2011 su et al 2013 sio2 is the most popular carrier used in fbr fenton process due to its proved capability to promote iron crystallization chen et al compared the performance of sio2 al2o3 and fe2o3 and reported sio2 to be the most suitable carrier for highest organics removal and total iron removal according to lyu et al granular activated carbon exhibited relatively higher iron removal capability than ceramsite liu et al reported sand to be the best carrier for silicon wastewater treatment comparing to granular activated carbon gac and brick particles sand material was able to achieve better reactor bed expansion fluidized state and pollutant removal rate boonrattanakij et al 2011 studied the iron crystallization onto construction sand and sio2 during fbr fenton process it was found that iron crystallization onto the construction sand was faster than crystallization onto sio2 although the final iron removal efficiencies were comparable larger quantity of construction sand could also promote the iron crystallization rate by providing larger available surface aera for iron heterogeneous nucleation anotai et al 2018 in term of organics removal carriers with larger particle size and lower density exhibited better heat and mass transfer characteristics which could promote the organics degradation kinetics in three phases liquid solid air fbr system kim and kang 1997 comparing to inert carriers reactive carriers such as gac and zeolite achieve higher organics removal in fbr fenton process cai et al 2020a reported that gac carrier enhanced organics removal in roc via extra gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction zeolite carrier also showed significant adsorption capacity for organics removal in reverse osmosis concentrate roc both gac and zeolite carriers achieved higher organics removal in roc as compared to sand carrier furthermore effective in situ gac regeneration was observed along the fenton oxidation process fig 6 illustrates how gac carrier facilitated the organics removal in roc in heterogeneous fbr fenton system higher dosage of catalytic carriers could provide more active iron surface site for oh generation while beyond the optimal carrier dosage carrier surface bonded fe2 could react with oh and reduce its availability for organics oxidation aghdasinia et al 2017b in heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process increased catalytic carrier dosage can also result in better organics removal efficiencies due to more active iron surface site or larger amount of dissolved fe2 ions in the aqueous solution while it was found that excess amount of catalytic carrier reduced the uv vis transmission and inhibited the photo fenton process li et al 2018 liu et al 2020 iron leaching from iron containing carriers at acidic condition is also an issue that affects carrier life span and treated effluent quality in zero valent iron and pyrite initiated heterogeneous fenton processes free iron ion dissolution is one of the key reactions for oh generation while in heterogeneous fenton processes that use other iron bearing minerals such as goethite hematite and magnetite iron leaching is rather a parasitic process though recent studies reported iron leaching and its induced homogeneous fenton reaction to be negligible in fbr fenton like processes aghdasinia et al 2017a li et al 2018 liu et al 2020 continuous dissolution of iron bearing minerals would adversely affect the carrier s long term performance and stability sidhu et al 1981 suggested that the crystal structure and fe o bond strength of the iron bearing minerals affected their dissolution rate at acidic condition in 0 5 m hcl solution at 25 c the dissolution rates of iron bearing minerals were in the order of magnetite hematite goethite comparing to hematite and goethite magnetite s crystal structure allows for higher chance of proton attack during the hcl dissolution and the fe o bond in magnetite is relatively weak therefore magnetite is more susceptible to acidic dissolution and during the heterogeneous fenton reaction relatively higher operation ph might be required to mitigate the iron leaching process meanwhile due to higher resilience of acidic dissolution hematite and goethite can be adopted at lower ph condition more researches can be conducted for developing these two minerals based catalysts for fbr fenton like processes 3 6 reactor configuration reactor configuration highly affects the mixing and distribution of particles in fbr systems choi and shin 1999 in the context of fbr fenton carrier mixing plays an important role on mass transfer and subsequently the oxidation efficiency there are limited studies investigating the effects of reactor configuration on fbr fenton process performance bello et al 2017 conducted a comprehensive review on fluidized bed reactor performance with different reactor geometries he highlighted the importance of reactor shape cross sectional area aspect ratio and internal structures cylindrical column is better than square column due to the less presence of dead zones in the reactor comparing to flat bed fbr tapered bed fbr could reduce carrier wash out at high liquid velocity aspect ratio was defined as the ratio between the bed height and the reactor height optimal aspect ratio shall be determined to ensure sufficient interphase mixing under reasonably high system flow rate some internal structure such as tubes and baffles can be added into the reactor to provide uniform fluidization and enhancing the interphase mixing a study conducted by wang et al 2015 demonstrated that internal draft tube in the three phases fbr system could induce smooth and steady circulation of catalytic carrier and subsequently enhance the decolorization and toc removal in azo dye orange g solution it shall also be noted that the reactor internals would come with more complex system design and operation dutta and suciu 1992 similarly for incorporating tapered bed design with optimal aspect ratio into the fbr column for fbr reactor design and optimization fluid dynamics modelling tool could be combined with kinetic modelling to predict the fbr fenton process performance based on the hydrodynamic condition farshchi et al 2019 successfully developed a modified computational fluid dynamics cfd model to predict removal of acid yellow 36 and ph changes during the heterogeneous fbr fenton process based on our review most fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes adopted batch reactors for lab scale studies and continuous flow reactors for pilot scale studies it is well known that batch reactors obtain faster reaction kinetics than continuous flow reactors anotai et al 2018 reported higher formic acid removal and iron removal 37 69 and 87 63 respectively in batch fbr fenton system than those 34 45 and 81 40 respectively in continuous flow fbr fenton systems to mitigate compromising treatment efficiency in large scale continuous flow fbr fenton systems researchers explored other reactor design elements to increase efficiency and different chemicals dosing mode was one of them it was found that stepwise chemicals dosing could improve the fenton oxidation efficiencies asymmetric stepwise dosing of h2o2 and fe2 into fenton reaction system showed significant enhancement on organics degradation due to diminished radical scavenging effect boonrattanakij et al 2018 chu et al 2007 deng 2007 gan and li 2013 to our best knowledge there are few applications of stepwise chemicals dosing in fbr fenton and fbr fenton like processes this technique could be further explored for enhancing fenton oxidation performance 4 applications of fbr fenton processes 4 1 fbr fenton process in recent years there has been growing interest of deploying fbr fenton process for treating recalcitrant wastewaters fig 7 summarizes the number of studies adopting fbr fenton process for treating wastewater originated from different industry sectors since 2014 53 of the studies are focusing on model compounds removal 20 of the studies are applying fbr fenton process as a polishing step for industrial effluent treatment and 27 of the studies are dealing with raw industrial wastewater table 4 summarizes these research works with detail information on operating conditions and process performance dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is a sulfur containing organic solvent and has been intensively used in the thin film transistor liquid crystal display tft lcd industry matira et al 2015 reported 95 22 removal of dmso and 34 38 of cod removal in dmso containing wastewater imi is an emerging insecticide used as an alternative to carcinogenic organochloride insecticides fbr fenton process completely removed 0 4 mm imi and achieved total cod removal of 80 lacson et al 2018 acetophenone ap and aniline an were selected to model recalcitrant phenol compounds degradation in phenol production wastewater with initial concentration of 5 mm and 60 min reaction time more than 80 and 60 of ap and an was removed in fbr fenton system respectively boonrattanakij et al 2017 reactive black rb5 was mostly studied as a model compound in textile wastewater in rb5 containing wastewater fbr fenton process achieved cod removal efficiency of 61 83 and decolourization rate of 90 99 7 bello et al 2020 2019c b in addition to single model compounds removal fbr fenton process was also adopted for treating wastewaters from pulp and paper textile and electronics industries the overall cod removal in these industrial wastewaters ranged from 40 to 72 cai et al 2020b coupled fbr fenton with biological activated carbon bac as a cost effective solution for roc treatment the combined fbr fenton bac system achieved overall cod removal of 69 and the average effluent cod level in roc was 26 mg l fbr fenton technology has been exploited in full scale industrial wastewater treatment in taiwan since 2000 it is usually applied to achieve further cod reduction in bio treated wastewaters containing recalcitrant organic pollutants table 5 summaries several completed projects from greentec environmental protection technology co ltd greentec www biogreentec com tw and ever clear environmental eng corp ever clear www ever clear com tw these projects demonstrate full scale applications of fbr fenton in different industrial sectors including paper mill yeast production leather manufacturing and electronic industries it is important to note that the reported full scale plants are conventional fbr fenton system with sand carriers and flat bed column reactor while the current application of fbr fenton process has a good degree of application with various scales and wastewater types the key limitation of fbr fenton process for wider application is still the sludge generation and strict ph control despite reported decrease in sludge generation as compared to classic fenton cai et al 2020b there is a need to further reduce sludge generation and mitigate strict ph control in order to enhance the attractiveness of using this process for the treatment of recalcitrant wastewater 4 2 fbr fenton like process in recent years researchers also explored the feasibility of heterogeneous fbr fenton and heterogeneous fbr photo fenton processes for treating wastewaters from different industry sectors such as textile pulp and paper plastic production seafood processing tft led manufacturing and so on among these studies most of them 76 were dealing with model compounds degradation 12 were applying fbr fenton like processes as tertiary treatment technology 6 of the studies focused on raw industrial wastewater treatment and 6 on other applications fig 8 table 6 summarizes recent applications of fbr fenton like processes for treating recalcitrant wastewater and compounds together with the operating conditions and process performance azo dyes such as acid yellow 36 ay36 basic bule 3 bb3 acid orange 7 ao7 orange g og and reactive black rb5 were the mostly studied compounds for mimicking textile wastewater treatment with fbr fenton like technologies in heterogeneous fbr fenton system the average removal rate of azo dyes ranged from 84 to 98 9 aghdasinia et al 2017a b 2016 farshchi et al 2019 2018 in 50 mg l og synthetic wastewater heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process achieved more than 92 colour removal and 78 9 toc removal in 180 min wang et al 2015 paracetamol a painkiller was reduced from 100 mg l to 50 mg l in 300 min with heterogeneous fbr fenton process velichkova et al 2017 bisphenol a bpa is widely used in polycarbonate plastic production with an initial concentration of 0 05 mm heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process achieved 90 toc removal in 180 min li et al 2015 n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp is a type of organic solvent used in tft led manufacturing in 10 mm nmp solution heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process achieved 82 5 removal of nmp and 93 removal of toc li et al 2018 heterogeneous fbr fenton process was also successfully implemented for dissolution of cation ion exchange resin ier purolite nrw 100 resin ier is usually employed for water purification in nuclear facilities huang et al 2020 reported that heterogeneous fbr fenton process converted 91 6 of radioactive purolite nrw 100 resin into gas and soluble fragments for safe disposal this study suggests a potential application of heterogeneous fbr fenton process in handling radioactive waste in addition to model compounds degradation heterogeneous fbr fenton process was also adopted for treating seafood processing wastewater and papermaking wastewater li et al 2019 used fe ti bimetallic oxides as the carrier and achieved total cod removal of 51 in seafood wastewater xing et al 2020 conducted a large scale papermaking wastewater treatability study treatment capacity of the heterogeneous fbr fenton system was 120 000 ton day final cod and toc removal efficiency was 74 10 and 71 30 respectively in terms of industrial effluents tertiary treatment heterogeneous fbr fenton process achieved 84 toc removal and 94 decolourization in flax secondary effluent fan et al 2017 there are few reported full scale applications of fbr fenton like processes which indicates the potential for future development the key issues identified for fbr fenton like processes were slow reaction kinetics of heterogeneous fenton poor catalyst stability and high energy consumption involved in uv vis assisted process future research efforts for tackling these bottlenecks will be discussed in the following section 5 concluding remarks and perspectives the present study provides a complete overview on recent fbr fenton related research works from the fundamentals process design operational parameters to up to date technology development and applications in industrial wastewater treatment fbr fenton process has been successfully transferred from lab scale to full scale applications research efforts are still being actively pursued to scale up the fbr fenton like processes and enhance their overall cost effectiveness based on the present state of fbr fenton technologies development some existing technical hurdles in their industrial applications are addressed as following together with the potential solutions and future development opportunities for full scale applications of fbr fenton processes 5 1 modelling techniques for process optimization and scaling up among the main constrains preventing a wider adoption of fbr fenton technologies the lack of strategies for expanding their applications in treating different types of industrial wastewaters and fluidized bed reactor scale up are the major ones in this context numerical tools such as kinetic models would facilitate technology scaling up by simulating the fbr fenton processes and predicting their performance at large scale applications while as previously mentioned the chemical kinetics in fbr fenton processes can be highly affected by the mass transfer between different phases and reactor hydrodynamics it will be very challenging to numerically solve the mass and momentum conservation equations in conjunction with more than 20 chemical reactions involved in fbr fenton processes computational fluid dynamic cfd is a suitable simulation tool that is able to simultaneously solve the governing equations through space and time alpert et al 2010 with appropriate boundary and initial conditions cfd technique can integrate reaction kinetics and reactor hydrodynamics into one model framework by describing both physical and chemical changes within a reactor furthermore cfd analysis can effectively reduce the workload and cost required for reactor scale up several studies have successfully implemented cfd technique to simulate the advanced oxidation processes for their performance prediction and reactor scale up alpert et al 2010 chuang et al 2016 farshchi et al 2019 mohajerani et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 tisa et al 2014a khongprom et al 2020 developed a cfd model for predicting the performance of full scale circulating fluidized bed downer reactors the validated model performed reliable process performance prediction with a deviation of 10 and mean relative absolute error of less than 5 when compared to the actual full scale plant performance fbr fenton process is complex in nature its operation involves spatial distribution of fenton reagents wastewater and carriers mass transfer fenton reactions radical species generation sludge formation and iron crystallization kinetic modelling of this multivariate system could be very tedious and time consuming machine learning such as artificial neural network ann might be useful in solving this problem it can derive the model from available data without prior design or adjustment ann is powerful in terms of multivariate calibration and it is able to identify cause effect correlations through training with multiple input and output systems elmolla et al 2010 implemented ann for the modelling of antibiotic degradation in fenton process correlation between ann predicted results and experimental results had a r2 value of 0 997 and h2o2 fe2 molar ratio was the most influential parameter on chemical oxygen demand cod removal performance yu et al 2013 adopted ann analysis to predict the required fe2 dosage in electro fenton process for treating synthetic textile wastewater a good correlation r2 0 99 between the actual and predicted fe2 dosage was performed by ann model application of machine learning for fbr fenton process optimization and performance prediction could significantly reduce the workload and resources requirement for future scaling up 5 2 chelating agents for wider operation ph as discussed in earlier sections higher operation ph reduces the free iron ions availability for hydroxyl radical production and subsequently hinders the fenton oxidation efficiency fbr fenton process has a very limited operation ph range though fbr fenton like processes could be operated over a wider range strict ph control within the acidic condition is still required ph control has been a critical bottleneck in the industrial applications of fbr fenton technologies more research efforts are needed to omit the ph control step one potential solution can be explored for heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process is the addition of chelating agents which could form stable complexes with ferric ions and preventing ferric precipitation at neutral ph under uv vis irradiation the ferric ligand complexes could also significantly absorb uv vis light and undergo photolytic decomposition for ferrous ion regeneration the most commonly used chelating agents in photo fenton process were oxalate citrate ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and nitrilotriacetic acid nta clarizia et al 2017 each ferric ligand complex would exhibit different light absorption property at varying ph and irradiation wavelength which thereby affects the lmct reaction rate for ferrous ion regeneration weller et al 2013 reported that ferric bisoxalate complex had a higher quantum yield for ferrous ion regeneration 1 23 at 313 nm and ferric trisoxalate complex had a higher quantum yield 1 00 at 436 nm kocot et al 2006 found that ferric edta complex obtained highest quantum yield 0 05 at 313 nm and ph of 4 highest quantum yield of ferric nta complex was 0 46 at 313 nm and ph of 4 abida et al 2006 ferric citrate complex could achieve good quantum yield values 0 21 0 28 at longer irradiation wavelength of 436 nm faust and zepp 1993 whereas for homogeneous fbr fenton process addition of chelating agents will prevent ferric ions from precipitating as ferric hydroxide at high ph lewis et al 2009 hence allowing homogenous fenton reaction to be operated at wider ph ranges while aguiar and ferraz 2012 demonstrated the dual effects of chelating agents addition where the decolorization of azure b could be promoted and inhibited with different chelating agent loadings and ph conditions therefore to develop cost effective heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process and homogeneous fbr fenton process at near neutral ph the chelating agents should be carefully selected with a minimal increase in chemical cost and initial organic loading the chelating agent dosage operating condition biodegradability and ecotoxicity of the species formed should all be evaluated 5 3 carriers with high catalytic activity and slow dissolution rate one key drawback of fbr fenton like processes is the slow reaction kinetics which is mainly due to the low catalytic activity of iron bearing minerals researchers have explored alternative carriers with higher catalytic activity for promoted hydroxyl radicals generation in the fbr system li et al 2019 adopted fe ti bimetallic oxides as the carrier to conduct heterogeneous fbr photo fenton process for real seafood processing wastewater treatment the bimetallic carrier exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for h2o2 decomposition under the visible light irradiation in the context of heterogeneous fenton process great efforts have been made to study different types of heterogeneous catalysts including iron bearing minerals clay based catalysts and other form of iron containing catalysts zhu et al 2019 iron containing catalysts consist of zero valent iron transition metal exchanged zeolites fe zeolites mn zeolites cu zeolites and metal doped iron oxides znfe2o4 lafeo3 mnfe2o4 these groups of heterogeneous catalysts possess better catalytic activity for h2o2 decomposition currently iron bearing minerals are the mostly used carrier materials in fbr fenton like processes more research works could be carried out to investigate the feasibility of iron containing catalysts as the fbr carriers furthermore to enhance the stability of currently used iron bearing minerals and to mitigate the iron leaching process at acidic condition morphological augmentation can be consider as an alternative for fbr fenton carrier development composites of aluminium doped iron minerals such as al goethite and al hematite have shown enhanced stability against to acidic dissolution schwertmann 1991 another recent development in homogenous fbr fenton is the use of gac as a carrier for its adsorption properties and catalytic activity for oh generation recent understanding of the synergistic effect of adsorption and catalytic activity of gac as a carrier has interesting potential to be further explored bello et al 2020 cai et al 2020a facilitation of gac materials on oh formation and how the functional groups such as chromene type structures in gac could enhance oh formation were also reported elsewhere vega and valdés 2018 more future studies can be carried out to developed gac based catalysts with good stability and higher catalytic activity as well as to validate and demonstrate their long term performance in large scale applications 5 4 coupled fbr fenton biological process aops have been widely recognized as effective alternatives for treatment of industrial wastewater containing recalcitrant organic compounds tisa et al 2014b suggested fbr fenton process to be the most economic fluidized bed aop however aops for complete mineralization are generally expensive because the intermediates formed during treatment tend to be even more resistant to complete chemical degradation and furthermore the intermediates also consume substantial amount of energy uv vis radiation and chemicals oxidants catalyst etc which increase with the treatment duration muñoz et al 2005 one attractive alternative is to apply aops as pre treatment processes for breaking down the recalcitrant organics into biodegradable intermediates which could be further treated with biological processes at a considerably lower cost oller et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 another option would be to apply the combination strategy in the opposite direction first eliminating the highly biodegradable portion of the industrial wastewater and then break down the remnant recalcitrant contaminants by post treatment aops most of the reviewed studies adopted fbr fenton technologies as stand alone processes for recalcitrant organics removal researchers could further look into the cost effectiveness of coupled fbr fenton biological processes for recalcitrant wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17238,the fast growth of industrialization combined with the increasing population has led to an unparalleled demand for providing water in a safe reliable and cost effective way which has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first century faced by global society the application of nanotechnology in water treatment and pollution cleanup is a promising alternative in order to overcome the current limitations in particular the application of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles mions for environmental remediation has currently received remarkable attention due to its unique combination of physicochemical and magnetic properties given the broadening use of these functional engineered nanomaterials there is a growing concern about the adverse effects upon exposure of products and by products to the environment this makes vitally relevant the development of green chemistry in the synthesis processes combined with a trustworthy risk assessment of the nanotoxicity of mions as the

first century faced by global society is providing water in a safe trustworthy and low cost way the fast growth of industrialization the increasing population and changing lifestyles of people have led to an unprecedented increase of production in combination with the inappropriate disposal of hazardous industrial by products in water systems such as organic dyes heavy metals pesticides and pharmaceuticals residues thus in the view of this scenario environmental remediation has become an urgent need to preserve ecological stability and public health alvarez et al 2018 kalita and baruah 2020 lu and astruc 2020 a variety of conventional technologies have been used for the treatment of water among them the most common are chemical precipitation flotation gravity separation solvent extraction ion exchange and membrane filtration linden et al 2020 maksoud et al 2020 sadegh et al 2017 subban et al 2019 however they undergo some drawbacks such as time consumption partial effectiveness and high costs corsi et al 2018 from the past few decades new opportunities in nanotechnology have stimulated researches exploring the use of engineered nanomaterials in advanced oxidation processes aops hodges et al 2018 these water treatment methods have demonstrated to be effective for wastewater remediation through the in situ generation of extremely reactive radicals which have a strong oxidation capability and represent an innovative solution for unspecifically degrading most of the recalcitrant contaminants into less toxic species ferroudj et al 2017 wang et al 2016a the better performance of catalytic nanomaterials can be mostly attributed to the high surface area and consequently high chemical reactivity corsi et al 2018 kalita and baruah 2020 among the different types of nanomaterials for environmental applications magnetic nanoparticles have attracted remarkable research interest mainly because they are magnetically responsive structures that can be manipulated under the influence of an applied magnetic field wang and yin 2016 the capacity to control the spatial distribution and the particle size of these nanoparticles provides a distinct advantage for interface related applications such as adsorption kim et al 2018 maksoud et al 2020 and catalysis hodges et al 2018 hua and huang 2017 in particular their usage enables the recovery and reuse of the sorbent catalyst after magnetic separation and further appropriate processing which potentially eliminates the need for additional chemical reagents and complexes processes to separate the catalyst from the treated water li et al 2015 tang and lo 2013 this important inherent feature associated with its huge surface to volume ratio and outstanding catalytic activity has been providing numerous opportunities to develop smart environmental nanomaterials for the improvement of the eco friendly catalytic approach hamers 2017 different classes of magnetic nanoparticles have been evaluated for advanced applications mainly making use of the size and chemical composition which actively govern the magnetic properties moise et al 2017 pure transition metals such as fe ni and co are the main magnetic metallic nanoparticles because they possess high saturation magnetization however they are highly toxic and extremely susceptible to oxidation leading to partial or complete loss of their magnetization although the production of magnetic alloy nanoparticles such as feco fept and fepd can improve their resistance towards oxidation they still undergo poor chemical stability and also have some limitations for applications hedayatnasab et al 2017 in contrast metal oxides are less susceptible to oxidation and consequently can exhibit a stable magnetic response furthermore some important reviews have demonstrated preliminary endorsement of nontoxicity yuliarto et al 2019 albeit the study of the toxicity of nanoparticles should be comprehensively investigated since it comprises several relevant aspects such as size morphology chemical composition concentration and surface features buzea and pacheco 2019 carvalho et al 2019 because of these attributes associated with the possibility of developing metal oxide nanoparticles with superparamagnetic behavior this strategy has gained much attention for technological applications despite the excellent physicochemical and magnetic properties of metal oxides nanoparticles their intrinsic characteristic to agglomerate during the synthesis process and use can restrict its direct application from the chemistry point of view this behavior can be explained by focusing on the dual nature of the nanoparticles poor stability and high reactivity xu et al 2018 to address this issue surface modified metal oxide nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized into desired functional nanostructured materials cotin et al 2018 although the synthesis procedures and high technological applications of iron oxide nanoparticles have been extensively investigated reviews covering the development of sustainable synthesis and the understanding of how these materials interact with the environment are still scarcely reported the products and processes should integrate the principles of green chemistry and sustainable engineering in order to achieve new functionalities which maximizes their potential while minimizing any adverse environmental impact hamers 2017 zimmerman et al 2020 this review encompasses the most recent progress on iron oxide based magnetic nanomaterials and their special features which benefit advanced environmental applications focusing on water treatment and remediation including the main types of advanced oxidation processes furthermore the design and the green synthesis of these materials are discussed underlying the role of size shape surface coating and functionalization in the stability reactivity and magnetic properties additionally this review highlights the nanotoxicity and environmental risks of iron oxide based nanoparticles for the ecosystem to conclude current challenges and future prospects are covered 2 iron oxide based nanomaterials iron oxides have been the cornerstone of the nanostructured magnetic materials considering their natural abundance low cost and interesting chemistry iron possesses high chemical versatility in aqueous media arising from the existence of two stable oxidation states fe2 and fe3 on a broad range of ph combined with the high chemical reactivity of iron complexes regarding acid base phenomena jolivet et al 2004 in the natural environment iron oxides have existed in various structural types including ferrous ferric and mixed valence compounds among them hematite α fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 are the main representatives which have received significant attention regarding scientific technological and industrial applications hematite α fe2o3 is the most stable iron oxide under atmosphere conditions used in gas sensors pigments and catalysis owing to its low cost and high corrosion resistance however its weak ferromagnetism associated with the absence of superparamagnetism behavior in nanoscale makes them less suitable for advanced applications wu et al 2015 magnetite fe3o4 differs from most other iron oxides due to the presence of iron cations in both divalent and trivalent valence states it is a conventional ferrite that belongs to the inverse cubic spinel structure in which fe2 species occupy the octahedral sites in order to obtain higher crystal field stabilization energy while fe3 species are equally distributed among both tetrahedral a and octahedral b sites in this configuration the structure of fe3o4 is responsible for producing two magnetic sublattices with antiparallel spin moments on the a and b sites therefore the ferrimagnetic behavior of magnetite arises from the magnetic moments of divalent cations hiemstra 2018 ramimoghadam et al 2014 this typical spinel ferrite exhibits superior magnetic properties compared to other iron oxides such as high saturation magnetization ms 92 100 emu g 1 and magnetic susceptibility which make them widespread exploited for biomedical and environmental applications ashraf et al 2019 hedayatnasab et al 2017 maghemite γ fe2o3 is also a ferrimagnetic oxide with a similar spinel structure of fe3o4 nonetheless it diverges from magnetite because all iron species are in the trivalent state in order to compensate for the oxidation of fe2 cation vacancies take place within the octahedral sites therefore γ fe2o3 is recognized as a fully oxidized form of magnetite ashraf et al 2019 because it has lower saturation magnetization ms 80 emu g 1 magnetite is more applied than maghemite however it has the benefit of being more stable and resistant in acidic environments which can favor its use under some adverse conditions rossi et al 2014 table 1 summarizes some of the structural physicochemical and magnetic properties of the main representatives of iron oxides 3 design and synthesis of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and hybrids 3 1 synthesis processes numerous synthetic routes including chemical physical and biological processes can be used to produce nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles termed as ferrofluids such as iron oxide nanoparticles with different levels of controlled size morphology stability dispersion and appropriate surface chemistry chemical methods are considered bottom up approaches responsible for assembling nanoparticles from monomers atoms they are widely used owing to the possibility of low production cost and high yield ali et al 2016 laurent et al 2008 nowadays these methods are considered by some researchers as the only ones capable of satisfactorily addressing the challenges in the design of multifunctional nanoparticles cotin et al 2018 several chemical processes are available for the preparation of mions including co precipitation hydrothermal solvothermal synthesis microemulsion microwave sonochemical thermal decomposition sol gel and polyol dadfar et al 2019 jamkhande et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 marcelo et al 2020 shaterabadi et al 2017 most of these routes often employ highly toxic organic solvents that are not easily degraded and remain in the environment unless the recovery of these reagents is made which can demand a large amount of energy additionally high temperatures combined or not with high pressures are requirements for some processes including the hydrothermal solvothermal and thermal decomposition where expensive surfactants are demanded the sum of these aspects contributes to high cost energy consumption compared to methods that operate at lower room temperatures and atmospheric pressure such as co precipitation it is also noteworthy that some of the chemical routes only produce hydrophobic mions nanoparticles that require subsequent surface modifications after synthesis to make them hydrophilic suitable for the applications natarajan et al 2019 verdugo et al 2016 physical based routes constitute synthetic methods that follow a top down approach in this case bulk materials are reduced into nanosized particles by different mechanical physical and chemical processes such as aerosol gas phase deposition laser ablation ball milling and ion sputtering jamkhande et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 although these methods are relatively easy to perform and suitable for production on a large scale they are recognized for the usual inability to control the size of particles at the nanoscale dimensions this drawback associated with the requirement of expensive equipment for the preparation of the magnetic nanoparticle usually turn them less representative as synthesizing processes marcelo et al 2020 the use of biological based systems for the synthesis of nanoparticles is not unexpected considering that some of the unicellular and multicellular organisms are known to transform inorganic metal ions into nanomaterials via intra or extracellular mechanisms virkutyte and varma 2013 biological based routes including bacteria fungi and plant mediated synthetic pathways are a growing field that enables the formation of biocompatible nanoparticles but there are some limitations associated with the slow rate of production cotin et al 2018 together physical and biological synthetic procedures comprise up to approximately 10 of all iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis which is very narrow when compared to chemical based synthesis the most used synthesis procedures combined with summarized nanoparticle properties advantages limitations and recent examples are presented in table 2 ansari et al 2019b assab et al 2020 burgos castillo et al 2020 dadfar et al 2019 jamkhande et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 leonel et al 2019 natarajan et al 2019 marcelo et al 2020 sharma et al 2020 shaterabadi et al 2017 tanaka et al 2019 vanyorek et al 2019 yadav et al 2020 yang et al 2020 3 2 greener synthesis of ferrofluids considering the application in water remediation the use of greener routes for mions synthesis may be a pursuit for a more comprehensive approach in the chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles solvents are essential to provide a medium for dissolving precursors promoting heat and reagents transfer and dispersing the final product because it is used in large quantities the choice of solvent should be carefully made among green solvents water is an advantageous choice since it is the cheapest solvent and the most abundant molecule besides that it is non toxic can dissolve well all kinds of ionic species and also some organic components such as sugars and proteins shanker et al 2016 singh et al 2018 as the eco friendly approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles has gained considerable attention advanced green solvents are being developed in this emerging field of research one of the best examples is ionic liquids ils which consist of ions with melting points below 100 c because most of them liquefy below room temperature and start to decompose above 300 c or 400 c they can operate in a wider synthesis temperature range than water another benefit of using these solvents includes the feasibility of modulating solubility properties through the choice of the nature of cations and anions however problems associated with their biodegradability raise environmental concerns in this context deep eutectic solvents have emerged as ionic liquids analogs which also possess high thermal stability flexible miscibility low volatility but better biodegradability and lower cost shanker et al 2016 singh et al 2018 yousefi et al 2017 to date co precipitation from homogeneous aqueous phase solutions is the classical and greener chemical technique for the synthesis of mions even though the colloidal nature of this technique sometimes can make it a relatively intricate process ali et al 2016 laurent et al 2008 the first critical challenge consists of adjusting the experimental conditions leading to monodisperse nanoparticles with a suitable size the second one is the selection of a reproducible process that can be applied to an industrial scale laurent et al 2008 regardless of these challenges environmentally friendly chemical processes are becoming progressively more attractive and are much required as a consequence of worldwide increasing concerns related to environmental contamination corsi et al 2018 this synthesis is based on the simultaneous precipitation of fe ii and fe iii aqueous salt solutions in an alkaline medium gul et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 the main advantages of this method rely on simplicity the requirement of low temperatures typically in the range of 25 c to 80 c large scale production and economic viability since it does not demand complex purification processes however the control of the particle size distribution is limited considering that the crystal growth is mostly governed by kinetic factors gul et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 despite that the size morphology and composition can be tailored by controlling synthesis parameters including ph ionic strength temperature fe ii and fe iii ratio atmosphere and type of salts used ali et al 2016 ramimoghadam et al 2014 soler and paterno 2017 the complete precipitation of magnetite is expected with a stoichiometric ratio of fe ii and fe iii equals to 1 2 in alkaline solution according to eq 1 based on the thermodynamics of the reaction it still requires a ph in the range from 8 to 14 under non oxidizing conditions as it is not a stable iron oxide and in the presence of oxygen converts to maghemite eq 2 ramimoghadam et al 2014 soler and paterno 2017 1 f e 2 aq 2 f e 3 aq 8 o h aq f e 3 o 4 s 4 h 2 o l 2 4 f e 3 o 4 s o 2 g 6 γ f e 2 o 3 s finally biosynthesis is a completely green route that provides several advantages over conventional chemical synthesis for example low energy requirement because it can be performed at room temperature consumption of less harmful chemicals production of less toxic by products and natural abundance bolade et al 2020 virkutyte and varma 2013 as a consequence biological based routes represent an alternative to conventional methods where bacteria fungi or plants usually behave as reducing and capping agents one of the most renowned biological techniques for the production of magnetite nanoparticles by a direct mechanism of mineralization is through magnetotactic bacteria these bacteria produce intracellular organelle composed of fe3o4 known as magnetosomes of high purity and crystallinity abdeen et al 2016 nonetheless the regulation of biomineralization which takes the role of controlling crystal growth and morphology is still a difficult task to be achieved through biosynthetic routes yamagishi et al 2016 synthesis of nanoparticles by fungi has plenty of advantages over other organisms due to the relative cost effectiveness ease of manipulation of the organic matter and because they have enzymes and reducing components on the cell surface devatha and thalla 2018 virkutyte and varma 2013 however the synthesis is time consuming because of the fungal biomass preparation as reported in some studies devatha and thalla 2018 sarkar et al 2016 similarly plant bioactive components known as phytochemicals and biomolecules can behave as reducing capping and stabilizing agents during the synthesis thereby improving the stability of nanoparticles similar to fungi synthesis plant mediated methods can be time consuming due to the requirement of extra steps to acquire such phytochemicals including extraction isolation purification and characterization of the compound of interest devatha and thalla 2018 lópez and antuch 2020 singh et al 2018 yuliarto et al 2019 unquestionably bio assisted methods have demonstrated to be sustainable and eco friendly processes but still there are some shortcomings associated with the biological nanoparticles firstly there is no well established standard method for the synthesis of nanoparticles because there are diverse mechanisms of reactions between biological entities and metal ion precursor which make difficult to completely understand these pathways resulting in nanoparticles with varied morphologies virkutyte and varma 2013 moreover the natural variability between species can lead to different synthetic parameters restraining the reproducibility of the biologically synthesized nanoparticles comprehensive knowledge of the active biomolecules and their mechanisms of reactions responsible for producing and stabilizing nanoparticles is therefore required additionally further studies and development of these green procedures should be extended to an industrial scale in order to consider the environmental and human health impacts in comparison with traditional alternatives despite these drawbacks the demand for green synthesis of mions opens space for more research in this field for new opportunities bolade et al 2020 zikalala et al 2018 table 3 provides the appraisal of the multifaceted of iron based nanoparticles biosynthesis and their use in environmental remediation 3 3 the role of surface coating in the stability of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle the large surface volume ratio is a crucial feature common to all nanomaterials that make their surface the dominant factor in many physical and chemical processes boles et al 2016 because nanoparticles exhibit high surface energy they tend to aggregate to thermodynamically reduce this energy however agglomeration is an undesirable process since it significantly decreases reactivity for bare magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles colloidal stability solely relies on ph dependent surface charges there are some discrepancies in the value of the isoelectric point iep reported for magnetite in the literature 6 2 8 5 but fe3o4 presents limited stability in colloidal suspensions at circumneutral ph i e 6 5 7 5 that is the regular ph of water bodies rivers and seas kosmulski 2020 lei et al 2018 as a result nanoparticles require a stabilizing coating to hinder aggregation and to preserve high reactivity during applications phan and haes 2019 virkutyte and varma 2013 xu et al 2018 thus surface stabilization of nanoparticles can typically be achieved using different types of materials that can act as surface coatings the most commonly used are shells of inorganic materials such as silica and gold low iep broadening the ph range of colloidal stability organic monomers possessing functional groups including carboxylates sulfates and phosphates and polymeric macromolecules cotin et al 2018 laurent et al 2008 among these types more attention has been given to polymers the advantage of using macromolecules over small molecules as coatings relies on polymers with more charged species to enhance repulsive forces between adjacent chains this has the effect of balancing the magnetic and van der waals attractive forces acting on the magnetic nanoparticles therefore they can provide exceptional colloidal stability bohara et al 2016 these ligands enable colloidal stability preferably via two distinct and complementary mechanisms steric stabilization occurs when the adsorption of molecules over the nanocrystal surface provides a steric barrier that hinders interactions between neighboring nanoparticles on the other hand when the nanocrystals are stabilized by ligands with charged species there occurs an effect of electrostatic stabilization through repulsion forces boles et al 2016 heuer jungemann et al 2019 natural and synthetic polymers can be used as stabilizing and functionalization agents for magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles the growing interest in developing environmentally friendly procedures for the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles has stimulated the use of natural polymers as green stabilizing agents saif et al 2016 this class of polymers usually provides biocompatibility low toxicity and biodegradability to the system moreover they exhibit considerable diversity of structures possessing a lot of functional groups accessible for further chemical modification among natural polymers the use of polysaccharides and derivatives like carboxymethylcellulose cmc chitosan cs dextran starch agar and alginates has gained attention as globally commercially available and affordable materials in addition to their physicochemical properties the strategy of obtaining polysaccharide derivatives li et al 2019a merzendorfer 2019 is adopted for the improvement of limited solubility biocompatibility and or adsorption properties that has been explored through a myriad of chemical modifications to create different functional derivatives as presented for example for cs in fig 1 besides these most representative polysaccharides and derivatives a vast universe of feasible conjugation and modification of iron oxide nanoparticles surfaces has been used to reach advancements in environmental remediation sousa et al 2015 because biopolymers are often obtained from natural sources such as vegetal algae corals fungi invertebrates fish and mammals the existence of batch to batch property variations is perhaps the main restraint for their wide ranging use simionescu and ivanov 2016 on the contrary the versatility of synthetic polymers in designing particular physical and chemical properties through their controlled chemical composition makes them attractive components to create hybrid organic inorganic nanomaterials for different advanced applications simionescu and ivanov 2016 polyethylene glycol peg polydopamine pda polyethyleneimine pei polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylic acid paa and polyaniline pani are important classes of synthetic polymers used to stabilize mions natarajan et al 2019 the capping agents can passivate the surface of magnetic nanoparticles during the nucleation and growth processes i e in situ coatings or post synthesis synthesis in the presence of ligands has several benefits including reduced agglomeration and a small number of processing procedures nevertheless the presence of polymeric molecules during the nucleation and growth processes of nanocrystals has a pivotal influence on the crystallinity size and morphology properties of nanoparticles heuer jungemann et al 2019 for example shaterabadi et al 2017 have investigated the effect of in situ dextran coating on the stability and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles their results showed that the presence of dextran in the reaction medium during co precipitation synthesis caused a reduction in the size of the nanoparticles 10 nm as compared to bare magnetite 17 nm this behavior is regularly observed for nanoparticles as the presence of macromolecular capping ligands hinders agglomeration and particle growth the guarantee of the colloidal stability is however one of the three fundamental purposes in controlling the surface chemistry of mions the second is to modify the surface of nanomaterials creating conditions for the modulation of adsorption properties the release of the bound contaminant and re use of the nanoparticles as many cycles as possible the third goal is the anchorage of target species mainly biomolecules markers and therapeutic agents soler and paterno 2017 in this sense the coating agent not only provides stability but also can further be employed in functionalization which becomes difficult to separate stabilization from functionalization gul et al 2019 finally it should not be neglected that surface coating may also act to prevent nanoparticle oxidation it is noteworthy that despite many advantages in removal degradation of pollutants in water treatment processes some studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles capped with ligands or other nanomaterials for producing surface modified nanoassemblies can also present lower adsorption and catalytic activity than bare analogs since some coordination sites are blocked by the stabilizing agent and the accessibility to the substrate decreases ferroudj et al 2013 kim et al 2018 rossi et al 2018 ferroudj et al 2013 have investigated the catalytic efficiency of maghemite nanoparticles and maghemite silica nanocomposite for the removal of water pollutants such as methyl orange mo the lower activity of the nanocomposite system was attributed to the restriction of the reagents to access the catalytic sites placed at the surface of the maghemite nanoparticles that were encapsulated in the sio2 beads regarding polymer ligands kim et al 2018 have described the role of different organic coatings concerning the adsorption of as v and cr vi by magnetite nanocrystals including polyethyleneimine pei and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab c16h33 n ch3 3 br the positively charged amino functional groups in pei and cbta benefits their interactions with anionic adsorbates which improve the performance of heavy metals sorption due to their propensity to form negatively charged oxyanions in the aqueous medium it was hypothesized by the authors therefore that the presence of amine groups at the surface of pei and ctab coatings were the main binding sites for both as v and cr vi anionic species however it was observed a slight difference in adsorption ability between fe3o4 pei and fe3o4 ctab despite ctab has 25 times fewer amine groups than pei a reasonable interpretation for that can be ascribed to the steric hindrance caused by the branched structure of pei difficulting the accessibility to the substrate and consequently the adsorption process table 4 summarizes some of the relevant examples of inorganic and organic coatings applied for the functionalization of mions underlying their comparative benefits and drawbacks for biomedical and environmental applications 3 4 the role of size and shape in the magnetic properties and environmental applications of nanomaterials as previously presented it is well recognized that the influence of different features on the synthesis of mions such as temperature atmosphere the presence of surfactants precursors species and concentration are relevant to understand the physicochemical and magnetic properties of the produced nanomaterials and nanostructures in this sense surface chemistry plays an important role in determining these properties and in particular it can be responsible for tuning the dimensions and morphology of the nanoparticles that directly affect magnetic properties guardia et al 2011 magnetic nanomaterials exhibit high sensitiveness of their magnetism to variations in size and shape this phenomenon can be explained by two main factors that not only govern the magnetic properties of nanoparticles but also provide them with special characteristics finite size and surface effects issa et al 2013 magnetic nanoparticles generally bigger than 20 nm are composed of a multi domain structure where domain walls separate regions of uniform magnetization the creation of these walls is driven by the balance between two components the external magnetostatic and domain wall energies which are associated with the particle volume and the interfacial area between the domains respectively when the size of the particle is reduced below a critical diameter threshold size its structure becomes a single domain because it requires more energy to create the walls than to sustain the magnetostatic energy nanomaterials consisted of a single magnetic domain might exhibit superparamagnetic behavior highly desirable for many advanced applications issa et al 2013 soler and paterno 2017 surface effects arise from the breaking of the crystal symmetry dangling bonds the existence of capping agents surface strain or even the production of core shell design with distinct physical and chemical structures these effects become more prominent as the particle size decreases and consequently the fraction of surface atoms increases exponentially guardia et al 2011 issa et al 2013 therefore a better understanding of the impact of the synthesis and surface chemistry on magnetic properties is essential to improve and maximize nanoparticle magnetic responses torres gómez et al 2019 have demonstrated the effect of synthesis temperature on the shape and morphological features of magnetite nanoparticles in their studies the nanoparticles were produced by the hydrothermal method at 120 c 140 c and 160 c and the morphologies obtained were semi spherical octahedral and cubic respectively all the nanoparticles showed superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature however the saturation magnetization parameter ms changed from 52 emu g 1 quasi spherical shape to 107 emu g 1 cubic shape a similar study was developed by tadic et al 2019 where hematite nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method in different conditions of precursors concentration surfactants solvents temperature and time of reaction these changes induced the formation of three different morphologies irregular nanoplates and microsized ellipsoid superstructures with distinct magnetic behaviors as it can be observed in fig 2 the irregular hematite nanoparticles showed superparamagnetism at room temperature with low coercivity hc and remanence hr both nanoplates and ellipsoid shaped hematite exhibited changes in magnetic behavior the increase of the coercivity in the nanoplates was attributed to the shape anisotropy while in the ellipsoid structure it was ascribed to the formation of multi domains mcgrath et al 2017 have studied the evolution in size and shape of iron nanoparticles after successive growth reactions the synthetic protocol based on seed mediated growth showed an increase in size after each growth stage and shape evolution leading to a cubic morphology the magnetic behavior was gradually tuned from superparamagnetic to ferromagnetic and the ms varied in the range from 40 emu g 1 to 176 emu g 1 as the size of nanoparticles increased from 7 to 13 nm these results demonstrated the high sensitivity of magnetic properties to variation in the crystallite size the magnetic behavior is one of the main advantages when using mions in water treatment allowing their separation and recovery from the contaminated medium via an external magnetic field more importantly the presence of mions with superparamagnetic behavior is highly beneficial to the reusability of the catalyst or sorbent because after the removal of the external magnetic field they are easily dispersed in the medium preserving their stability in this sense the control and evaluation of these properties before and during usage should be properly investigated the size and shape of mions also affect the adsorption and catalytic catalytic selectivity properties of nanoparticles as the chemical processes of adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis are performed on the surface of the catalyst nanoparticle catalysts often provide a much higher surface to volume ratio and usually adsorption efficiency and catalytic activity are improved with increasing specific surface area ssa however a more in depth analysis may involve the effect of chemistry and the structure of the surface changes in size affect the coordination number of surface atoms and the electronic state of the nanoparticle and therefore the adsorption and activation energy barriers for the adsorption process also a catalyst nanoparticle with a specific shape typically exposes one or more crystallographic surfaces with a specific coordination environment and electronic state resulting in a shape dependent adsorptive catalytic performance cao et al 2016 for example hou et al 2020 evaluated the role of particle size and surface chemistry characteristics for the removal of phosphates from wastewater using sorption methods nanometer sized magnetite with larger pore volume higher surface area and surface functional groups compared to micrometer sized fe3o4 presented higher adsorption of kh2po4 which was associated with its larger surface area moreover it was stated that the amount of functional groups at the surface also affects the adsorption mechanism of phosphate to magnetite by influencing the formation of outer sphere complexes for micro fe3o4 and inner sphere complexes for nano fe3o4 regarding morphology effects on catalytic activity magnetite samples synthesized with different shapes microcube c nanosphere s and porous nanorod r in comparison to a commercial product com uniform round like were evaluated for mineralization of phenol based on fenton reactions the different morphologies exhibited different surface areas c 2 8 m2 g 1 s 10 9 m2 g 1 r 24 7 m2 g 1 com 0 5 mg 1 and crystal sizes c 65 nm s 42 nm r 37 nm com 79 nm the molar ratio of fe ii fe iii at the surface was similar for the synthesized materials c r s 0 5 and in agreement with the theoretical value of fe3o4 the magnetite obtained from commercial product presented fe ii fe iii of 0 25 lower than the theoretical value despite its composition based on pure magnetite the degradation activity trend obtained was r s c com which clearly indicated that a larger surface area was beneficial to the reaction the excellent catalytic performance of porous nanorods was associated with the overall balance of its physical properties small crystal size large surface area and high fe ii fe iii ratio moreover the sample of porous nanorods was conveniently separated recovered from the reaction mixture via an external magnetic field and re used with degradation efficiencies higher than 90 hou et al 2014 4 iron oxide based systems for water treatment technology the global demand for clean water is increasing at a fast pace due to population growth and industrialization because conventional chemical methods have shown to be only partially effective time consuming and sometimes unable to fulfill the modern requirements of energy saving and environmental sustainability there is a growing demand for new technologies that can efficiently remove contaminants from water corsi et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in recent years the use of mions has been widely investigated for the removal of pollutants in water as reported in interesting reviews das et al 2017 hao et al 2018 simeonidis et al 2016 such interest in iron oxides can be mainly attributed to their natural abundance low cost interesting chemistry and magnetic properties which are influenced by their crystalline structure jolivet et al 2004 usually two types of technologies are employed for water treatment adsorption and degradation technologies while the first one uses mions as a nanosorbent for improving the removal efficiency the second makes its use as a catalyst to mineralize or to convert contaminants into inert products nonetheless in many applications it is observed the combination of both processes xu et al 2012a 4 1 adsorption iron oxides based systems are of special interest as nanosized sorbents because in addition to the very high surface area strong adsorption capability and reasonable cost they also possess magnetic properties that enable ease separation and recovery khandare and mukherjee 2019 several papers describe the use of bare magnetic nanoparticles with different morphologies as nanosorbents of chromium and dyes e g congo red reactive orange and reactive yellow as summarized by santhosh et al 2018 the adsorption capacities ranged from 17 up to 160 mg g 1 depending mostly on the specific surface area higher surface area means a larger number of adsorption sites and ph as it affects both the adsorbent and adsorbate surface charges favoring attraction or repulsion between the entities however as previously discussed their poor colloidal stability associated with magnetic forces and surface energy can lead to aggregation of nanoparticles which may hamper its application as sorbents to overcome this drawback these nanoparticles can be immobilized onto a support structure or stabilized by surface coatings developing advanced functional nanostructures maksoud et al 2020 wang et al 2020 layered graphite based nanostructures carbon nanotubes graphene and graphene oxide sheets have been used as solid support for iron oxide nanoparticles in functional nanomaterials these carbonaceous materials present unique properties including large external surface area and functional groups for adsorption incorporated during synthesis or after surface modification treatments that enable the removal of inorganic and organic pollutants from aqueous solutions however they are not easily separated from the liquid medium in hybrid nanostructures the results indicated the possibility of developing a synergetic adsorptive effect between carbon based and iron oxide that outperforms both of its individual building blocks for water remediation maksoud et al 2020 santhosh et al 2018 verdugo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 for example verdugo et al 2016 reported the synthesis of hematite nanoparticles decorated on the multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt surfaces for use as a hybrid sorbent nanocomposite the results showed that the capacity of this supported α fe2o3 nanoparticles for cu ii and cro4 2 removal from aqueous suspensions at neutral ph was higher even 19 fold for cu ii than the performance of freely suspended nanoparticles besides graphene based materials other carbonaceous nanomaterials have been reported as promising sorbents after modification with iron oxides li et al 2019 have described the production of activated carbon coated hematite nanoparticles for increasing cr iv adsorption capacity although activated carbon ac possesses a porous structure and numerous functional i e hydroxyl carboxyl groups it presented a poor adsorption capability for cr iv because both carboxylate groups and chromate ions are negatively charged in the aqueous medium the functionalization of ac surface with nanosized α fe2o3 showed 3 times higher efficiency of adsorption due to electrostatic attraction forces between the toxic metal ions and the iron oxide nanoparticles nanocomposites of iron oxide with different inorganic and organic materials were also designed in order to endow chemical stability in a wide ph range and improve adsorption capabilities maksoud et al 2020 wang et al 2020 guivar et al 2017 have demonstrated distinct adsorption capabilities of hybrid nanomaterials of maghemite nanoparticles and silica mesoporous silica and hydroxyapatite and some organic compounds these materials not only prevented the agglomeration of maghemite nanoparticles but also changed the structural magnetic and structural properties that influence the uptake of cu ii and pb ii species based on electrostatic interactions and cation exchange natural and synthetic polymers frequently applied as capping agents or macromolecular matrices have also been described for tailoring adsorption properties of iron oxides while also providing chemical stability of nanoparticulate systems and functionalizing agents carboxymethylcellulose cmc a water soluble biopolymer derived from cellulose the most abundant polysaccharide in the earth has gained interest as a greener stabilizing and functionalization agent for the preparation of mions nanohybrids for several advanced biomedical and environmental applications fan et al 2019 leonel et al 2019 for example fan et al 2019 have reported the use of cmc immobilized fe3o4 nanoparticles as a highly efficient adsorbent system for pb ii removal the cellulose derivative behaved as a ligand avoiding aggregation and enhancing magnetite nanoparticle dispersibility moreover the presence of hydroxyl oh and carboxyl groups cooh in the polymer structure provides water solubility in a wide range of ph and plentiful o donating sites which have a powerful complexation capability for heavy metals the carboxymethylcellulose magnetite nanoparticles thus exhibited better adsorption ability and a faster rate of contaminant removal than bare fe3o4 nanoparticles another biopolymer which has attracted attention as a potent low cost biosorbent for water pollutants is chitosan cs a water soluble chitin derivative under acidic conditions ph 6 the high content of amino r nh2 and hydroxyl oh functional groups has the ability to bind to metallic cations and anions as reported by several studies gomez maldonado et al 2019 pooresmaeil and namazi 2020 polydopamine pda is originated by the self polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions at room temperature it is an attractive polymer due to its chemical structure that includes amine catechol and imine as functional groups these species provide a robust interfacial binding between the ligand and the nanoparticle through intermolecular interactions and covalent bonds that is the reason why they have been used as a coating in a variety of organic and inorganic surfaces including metal oxides besides pda coating offers conditions for further surface modification liu et al 2014b some studies have reported that the hydrophilicity of polydopamine can heighten the proximity between adsorbent and water contaminants due to the enhancement of the dispersibility of pda fe3o4 in aqueous media capriotti et al 2016 wang and deng 2016 polyvinyl alcohol pva is another class of synthetic polymer with hydrophilic and suitable biocompatible characteristics which can be tuned by the degree of hydrolysis in the chain mansur et al 2008 the main feature of pva that has been explored recently is its ability to be transformed into hydrogels with specific properties as the exceptional capacity to form films good processability and chemical resistivity bohara et al 2016 yang et al 2018 have reported the synthesis of prussian blue embedded magnetically responsive hydrogel for the removal of radioactive 137cs from water in particular the hydroxyl groups existing in the polymeric structure adsorbed iron species to form a homogeneous three dimensional structure in a mixed solution containing prussian blue pb and then acted as a stabilizing agent of iron oxide nanoparticles fig 3 the results showed the excellent potential of pva in creating hydrogel beads for the removal of 137cs by the adsorption process a combination of synthetic with natural polymers was also designed to acquire a novel set of properties in comparison with those of the single components simionescu and ivanov 2016 hydrogel nanocomposites aiming at the absorption of cationic dyes were proposed by sakai and teramoto 2018 where the matrix for the production of magnetite nanoparticles was composed of a polymer composite consisting of pva and k carrageenan that is a sulfated polysaccharide oso3 in this study the addition of the biopolymer had the function of improving the ionic behavior of pva hydrogels after obtaining the magnetic gel like nanocomposite the structure was stretched to change the morphology and distribution of magnetite in the polymer gel creating a magnetically anisotropic hybrid engineered soft material recently the development of integrated adsorption systems with multifunctionalities has been adopted as a novel approach for water decontamination treatment zhang et al 2016 prepared multifaceted magnetic nanoadsorbents composed of a magnetite core surrounded by pei that exhibited excellent performances of adsorption of heavy metals and disinfection of pathogens e g escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis at the same time the disinfection mechanism was ascribed to the very high frequency of collision of nanosized particles and bacteria associated with the brownian motion in water resulting in a high disinfection efficiency and fast disinfection kinetics cs is also applied in the development of water disinfection systems due to its well established antibacterial properties credited to the interactions of negatively charged groups present on the cell wall by the positively charged amino groups leading to the disruption of bacterial cell walls aravamudhan et al 2014 table 5 summarizes recent examples of iron oxide based adsorbents used for environmental remediation of pollutants in water 4 2 catalysis regarding water remediation by the degradation of pollutants iron oxide nanoparticles can play a pivotal role as catalysts in advanced oxidation processes aop aops are an enticing wastewater treatment alternative that involves the in situ generation of strongly reactive species to oxidize in a non selective way toxic pollutants under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure hodges et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 by employing aops organic molecules can be completely mineralized or partially oxidated to non toxic products as the complete mineralization to co2 and h2o can be costly in practice these processes focus on achieving a combination of both mineralization and partial oxidation hodges et al 2018 remarkable advantages of aops are that they neither produce a large quantity of hazardous sludge nor transfer contaminants from one to the other phase like adsorption and other separation methods which normally require further treatment bello et al 2019 aops are a general classification which consists of numerous techniques for the production of reactive oxygen species ros one of the most powerful ros is the hydroxyl radical ho it has a much stronger oxidation capacity e0 2 80 v than other traditional oxidizing species such as h2o2 e0 1 77 v or o3 e0 2 07 v arimi et al 2020 munoz et al 2015 the next sections will cover based on the literature review some of the recent progress of the most significant methods for the removal of pollutants from water based on advanced oxidative processes 4 2 1 photocatalysis essentially photocatalysis is a process in which ros species are generated by the formation of an electron hole pair in a semiconductor upon photoactivation the holes h and electrons e migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst where the holes form hydroxyl radicals ho after oxidation of water molecules and the electrons reduce the dissolved oxygen for producing superoxide radical o2 some iron oxides behave as semiconductors although their use presents some drawbacks due to the fast recombination of electron hole pair and low separation efficiency kiwi and rtimi 2021 the first alternative to obtain more effective charge separation of electrons and holes and also reduce the recombination rate is by employing other semiconductors with different energy levels forming composite structures several oxides tio2 sro2 ag2o nitio3 wo3 bismuth oxyhalides biocl biobr and bioi and other semiconductor materials have been used to produce p n and n n heterojunctions that were effective in improving photocatalytic activity of fe2o3 in many applications for instance the degradation of dyes and pharmaceuticals as well as the reduction of metals with improved photodegradation observed for the composite in comparison to individual building blocks as shown by zhang et al 2015 the development of a nanofiber based on α fe2o3 nitio3 catalyst was able to enhance the decolorization 90 for rhodamine b rhb under visible light irradiation xenon lamp 300 w compared with the bare fe2o3 55 and nitio3 59 catalysts composites involving hematite and carbonaceous materials were also developed with enhanced photocatalytic activity as well as extended to ternary composites mohamed 2019 has explored the functionalities of a novel ternary α fe2o3 graphene oxide go wo3 nanocomposite for enhancing solar light photocatalysis to degrade methylene blue mb and crystal violet cv used as model water contaminants the increase in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the smart design of suppression of e h pair recombination pathways where the electrons generated in the conduction band of wo3 were transferred through the go matrix and were recombined with the holes in the valence band of hematite fig 4 santhosh et al 2018 summarized several composite systems involving photocatalysis applications of hematite including composition light source and time or irradiation degradation efficiency of composite and individual semiconductors another interesting approach to improve the photocatalyst behavior of iron oxide is the doping of nanoparticles with metal and non metal elements the introduction of impurity states within the bandgap not only enhances the optical activity of iron oxide nanoparticles by narrowing the energy bandgap but also can expand the absorption to visible regions for example satheesh et al 2014 have investigated the photocatalytic activity of cu doped hematite nanoparticles under visible light to degrade acid red 27 ar 27 dye the results revealed a higher photocatalytic capability of cu α fe2o3 compared with undoped α fe2o3 it was suggested that the cu2 species behave as a shallow trap for both electrons and holes generated by irradiation and hamper the recombination of charge carriers as a consequence more reactive species o2 and ho were generated promoting the degradation of the ar 27 dye although such approaches can boost performance they also incorporate complexity and increased cost to the hybrid system preparation there is therefore an ever growing demand for optimizing synthetic routes and developing nanostructured materials with better functionalities at feasible costs zhu et al 2018 4 2 2 fenton and fenton like processes conventionally the fenton process involves the decomposition of h2o2 to generate oh radicals ho through catalytic reaction with ferrous ions fe2 according to eq 3 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 the ho can attack organic contaminants generating an organic radical r which undergoes a sequence of chemical transformations generating different oxidation products the fe ii species can be regenerated in an effective cyclic mechanism through fenton like reactions which consist of the reduction of the resulting ferric ions by the excess of h2o2 eq 4 there also occurs the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 that can oxidize organic pollutants but with less sensitivity than ho because they have weaker oxidation capacity e0 1 65 v babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o 4 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h they have been extensively investigated for the removal of various pollutants in water treatment such as pharmaceuticals textiles and chemical pesticides buthiyappan et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2017 take into consideration that these reactions are affected by some parameters including ph the concentration of h2o2 and catalyst temperature and pollutant concentration the systematic study of these variables is of utmost importance to enhance the catalytic properties of the system bello et al 2019 the ph of the medium is one of the most critical parameters for effective wastewater treatment some studies have reported that ho production is efficient when the ph is in the range of 2 8 3 5 arimi et al 2020 hodges et al 2018 under acidic conditions fe ii and fe iii species can preserve their catalytic capability while higher ph causes the precipitation of ferric ions as iron hydroxide bello et al 2019 however studies showed that it is possible to design magnetic iron based advanced nanosystems with suitable activity in neutral and even in alkaline ph conditions by the combination of magnetite nanoparticles with carbon based materials wang et al 2016b have demonstrated that fe3o4 sio2 c nanocomposite could be carried out as a high performance catalyst for the removal of mb at the ph range from 3 5 to 9 5 it benefits from efficacious electron transfer on the addition of carbonaceous materials which favors the oxidation of mb it was also suggested that the chelation of fe ii fe iii species with hydroxyl groups present on the surface of sio2 could facilitate the catalytic capability of magnetite enlarging the ph range of the metal oxide application more recently song et al 2019 have produced a nanohybrid composed of fe3o4 nanoparticles associated with ultrasmall graphene oxide for acting as fenton like agents in mb degradation the high efficiency of the system was attributed once more to the specific electron transfer between the go and magnetite nanoparticles in addition the abundance of active sites on the go surface due to the ultrasmall size boosted the catalytic activity which was evaluated at different ph another pivotal parameter that plays an important role in the catalytic activity is fenton s reactants the concentration of hydrogen peroxide dictates the potential for ho generation insufficient h2o2 concentration can lead to a deficiency of radicals generation which might result in a decrease of pollutant oxidation wang et al 2016a on the other hand an excess concentration of h2o2 can induce a scavenge effect according to eq 5 contributing to the decrease in the treatment efficiency as well associated with the weaker oxidation capacity of hydroperoxyl radicals babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 mirzaei et al 2017 hence large quantities of oxidants are not recommended besides the presence of h2o2 is harmful to plenty of organisms and can affect the degradation efficiency in case of use in fenton reactions as a previous treatment to biological oxidation in this sense the concentration of h2o2 should be adjusted in such a way that the total amount is consumed during the reaction babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 5 h 2 o 2 aq h o h 2 o l h o 2 in the same way fe ii catalyst concentration should be optimized to ensure ideal hydroxyl radical production and avoid scavenging effect supposing an excess amount of ferrous ions arimi et al 2020 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 eq 6 6 f e 2 aq h o f e 3 aq o h aq neamtu et al 2018 have investigated the effect of h2o2 concentration and catalyst dosage on the efficiency of bisphenol a pba degradation through the fenton like process using magnetite nanoparticles stabilized by peg polyethylene glycol their study tested two different concentrations of h2o2 10 mmol l 1 and 20 mmol l 1 and catalyst 1 0 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 the results showed that the most efficient removal of bpa 15 minutes to the complete degradation was achieved with 1 0 g l 1 of catalyst in the presence of 10 mmol l 1 of oxidant an increase in h2o2 concentration did not cause any significant improvement in the process efficiency while an increase in catalyst dosage decreased the effectiveness probably due to the blocking of available surface active sites reducing pollutant degradation the effect of temperature on the contaminant degradation rate is a controversial issue yet some studies have demonstrated that high temperatures adversely affect the fenton reactions due to the potential decomposition of h2o2 into h2o and o2 conversely recent studies have shown that high temperatures in the range of 40 c to 90 c favor the oxidation rate which enhances the generation of ho and improves therefore the fenton reactions however ambient conditions can securely be used with suitable efficiency in this process babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 the effect of increasing the concentration of the contaminant has been proven to decrease the removal efficiency while maintaining constant other parameters such as the concentration of the catalyst it occurs mainly because of two reasons higher pollutant concentrations demand higher concentrations of radicals and a higher number of active sites which can become limited when the dosage of pollutants is too high to this end these circumstances indicate that the initial contaminant concentration is responsible for determining the optimum fenton s reactants concentration to ensure pronounced reactivity and effective water treatment mirzaei et al 2017 stability re use and environmental aspects should also be examined xu and wang 2012 have investigated the use of magnetite nanoparticles as a catalyst for the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol although they achieved satisfactory results in terms of pollutant conversion they pointed out the importance to better understand the loss of activity after successive uses of the nanoparticles besides some studies have been characterized by making use of large amounts of hydrogen peroxide ferroudj et al 2013 sun et al 2013 which is a critical concern in terms of process economy and environmental toxicity sun et al 2013 according to the literature hodges et al 2018 further enhancing heterogeneous fenton processes can be obtained through the combination of distinct aops for example with additional input of light photo fenton ultrasound sono fenton and electricity electro fenton which will be concisely presented in the next sections because the comprehensive coverage is beyond the scope of this review 4 2 3 photo fenton processes the photo fenton reactions comprise the combination of fenton reagents and irradiation for producing additional ho by photo reduction of ferric to ferrous ions eq 7 combined with hydrogen peroxide photolysis eq 8 han et al 2020 7 fe oh 2 aq h ν f e 2 aq h o h aq 8 h 2 o 2 aq h ν 2 h o in these processes the role of photochemistry is to provide energy making use of ultraviolet uv or visible light to enhance the catalytic activity of the system and also to reduce the catalyst loading pouran et al 2014 han et al 2020 have investigated the efficiency of a photo fenton process using a low concentration of fenton reactants to degrade tetracycline and oxytetracycline their results evidenced that the uv light assisted fenton reaction uv h2o2 fe2 was the most powerful way to remove the contaminants from water compared to the h2o2 uv and uv h2o2 processes even though it was not able to fully mineralized the antibiotics therefore the transformation products were identified and their toxicity was assessed using a bacteria model to determine the potential toxicity effects of the by products a serious concern that has received increased attention in most cases of heterogeneous photo fenton processes uv irradiation is chosen to stimulate the photoreduction of fe3 to fe2 however it has some practical limitations as uv light represents only 3 5 of the solar light energy and the production of an artificial uv apparatus usually consume a large amount of energy it is therefore highly cost effective to have a system in which visible light is employed to drive photoreactions liu et al 2014a iron oxides such as hematite can efficiently absorb visible light due to its electronic band structure however the photocatalytic activity is restricted because the e h pairs present fast recombination santhosh et al 2018 a valuable strategy used for charge separation is the photo fenton oxidation by employing semiconductors with wide bandgap such as tio2 hassan et al 2016 have demonstrated the photocatalytic mechanism in which fe2o3 tio2 nanocomposite was used to degrade mo under visible light irradiation it was based on the transference of excited electrons to the conduction band of tio2 to fe2o3 leading to the reduction of fe iii to fe ii in the presence of h2o2 these generated fe iii species could produce ho the hole carriers h created in the valence band of tio2 also produced ho leading to the oxidation of mo the established cycling system inhibited the electron hole recombination improving the catalytic activity moreover it was observed a much higher removal efficiency by fe3o4 tio2 h2o2 nanoparticles under irradiation of visible light 98 after 60 min compared to the following systems tio2 no removal after 180 min h2o2 8 after 180 min tio2 h2o2 70 after 180 min and fe3o4 tio2 75 after 180 min which was ascribed to the effect heterogeneous photo fenton reaction photo fenton processes have also attracted interest in water disinfection some studies have been described the use of mild conditions and a low concentration of reagents to induce the death of a great number of microorganisms including bacteria and viruses mosteo et al 2020 o dowd and pillai 2020 ruales lonfat et al 2015 showed that after introducing solar light the catalytic activity of different iron oxides i e hematite wüstite and magnetite was notably enhanced causing bacterial inactivation at neutral ph however the occurrence of the photo fenton process at neutral or near neutral ph is still controversial as far as the mechanism of bacterial disinfection is not well understood and should be more investigated including different parameters e g the concentration of h2o2 light irradiance temperature 4 2 4 electrochemical processes among the electricity driven aops e aops electrochemical oxidation has been widely investigated for water remediation hodges et al 2018 the mineralization of contaminants can occur by direct electron transfer at the surface of the electrode anodic oxidation or by indirect electro oxidation responsible for the generation of powerful oxidants arimi et al 2020 buthiyappan et al 2015 although this process presents some benefits including versatility facile operation flexibility to adapt to variations in the flow rate and influent water composition concerns about the formation of toxic byproducts cost and performance of the electrodes can hamper its applications radjenovic and sedlak 2015 magnetic iron oxides possess catalytic and electrocatalytic properties that can promote fast electron transfer between the electrode and redox sites located on molecules in this sense several composite materials incorporating magnetic particles have been developed as electrodes to perform an electrocatalytic activity kudr et al 2018 as an example ribeiro et al 2017 produced nanotechnology based electrodes using the layer by layer technique comprising 4 layers of cationic poly diallyl dimethylammonium hydrochloride anionic carbon nanotubes cationic iron oxide nanoparticles and anionic carbon nanotubes deposited onto ito indium doped tin oxide substrates this electrode was used for electrochemical oxidation of salicylic acid molecules for sensing and quantification of this drug metabolite that is an environmental contaminant however the electro fenton process is one of the most applied e aops in this process electrons are used as reagents to produce in situ at least one constituent for the fenton reaction where the following alternatives are feasible to take place generation of h2o2 at the cathode and o2 at the anode while fe2 catalyst is added production of h2 at the cathode and fe2 solution at a sacrificial iron anode while h2o2 is externally added generation of h2o2 at the cathode and fe2 solution at a sacrificial iron anode the last case does not require any addition of chemicals which makes the process simple to perform the continuous in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide eliminates the problems associated with its transport and storage however the drawback of this technique is the production of an iron hydroxide sludge that needs to be disposed of accordingly a promising alternative to avoid the release of ferrous sludge is the use of membranes muddemann et al 2019 heterogeneous electro fenton has been developed to overcome the challenges of homogeneous electro fenton such as narrow ph range reusability of the catalyst after several consecutive cycles laborious separation from the treated solution as well as the generation of large quantities of ferric iron sludge ganiyu 2016 heterogeneous electro fenton can be categorized into two groups catalyst impregnated electrode and those with the solid catalyst addition in solution in a sophisticated study geraldino et al 2020 have designed an electro fenton system composed of a gas diffusion electrode improved with reduced graphene oxide rgo and reinforced with the fe3o4 go catalyst aiming at degrading textile wastewater the utilization of a gas diffusion electrode with rgo enabled the increase in the production of h2o2 while the incorporation of go into magnetite nanoparticles was responsible for enhancing the active sites available for charge transfer and increasing the composite performance due to the outstanding properties of go as high electrical and thermal conductivities the results demonstrated the high efficiency of the electron fenton system in degrading textile wastewater and also the effectiveness of the catalyst reusability the catalyst modified with go could be used in ten successive cycles with only a 5 6 loss of efficiency whereas the unmodified magnetite evidenced a gradual decrease reaching 42 loss of efficiency after the third cycle in another study yuan et al 2020 three dimensional 3d electrodes impregnated with hematite and powdered activated carbon α fe2o3 pac were produced for the degradation of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in simulated wastewater the 3d electrodes have drawn wide attention because they exhibit a larger specific surface area and higher conversion rate compared to the traditional two dimensional electrodes as a result they can adsorb contaminants improve conductivity and provide more active sites for catalytic reactions thereby enhancing the removal efficiency the degradation efficiency of ammonium nitrogen was 95 3 from the simulated wastewater under the optimal conditions in the 3d system but only 34 7 in the 2d system after treatment for 20 minutes heterogeneous electro fenton processes can also employ the catalyst in solution to enable the redox reactions görmez et al 2019 have investigated the degradation of two antibiotics chloramphenicol and metronidazole by an electro fenton technique using a composite graphene oxide fe3o4 as a catalyst the results showed that the use of a catalyst concentration of 0 5 g l 1 increased the degradation rate by 16 compared to a homogeneous process in which fe2 salt was used as a catalyst apart from its effectiveness in degrading the contaminants this composite exhibits potential reusability due to the low iron release 5 after 4 successive runs in another case of heterogeneous electro fenton application with the use of magnetite nanoparticles added in the solution for mineralization of acid red 18 high fe ions leaching of 67 at 100 ma of current was observed this effect indicated that homogeneous fenton reaction played an important role in the process and the combination of both activities of the ions species and the solid catalyst governed the overall catalytic activity hafaiedh et al 2018 the leaching of the catalyst into the aqueous phase is one parameter intimately associated with their stability thus it should be diminished to avoid an excess of these species in the medium that cause loss of solid activity in the long term and all of the disadvantages associated with homogeneous catalysis high cost low efficiency generation of iron sludge no re use of catalyst 4 2 5 alternative advanced oxidation processes as an alternative to the fenton processes the idea of activating different oxidants to produce strongly reactive radicals have driven the pursuit of other species such as ozone and sulfates ozonation has been recognized as a promising process for water remediation usually two pathways can be used to degrade pollutants direct oxidation molecular o3 due to its high potential of oxidation or by forming ho radicals via complex chain reactions buthiyappan et al 2015 because the direct oxidation of o3 is a selective procedure it results in partial mineralization with low rates additionally the low solubility of ozone in aqueous solution hampers its effective use yu et al 2020 therefore many studies have employed catalysts to accelerate ozone decomposition and ros generation chen and wang 2019 have used a fe3o4 co3o4 composite in the catalytic ozonation of sulfamethoxazole smx which was responsible for the enhancement of 60 in the mineralization of the pollutant this result was ascribed to the increase in the surface area and reactive sites provided by the catalyst which could boost the reaction between o3 smx and the generation of free radicals different parameters were evaluated including ph the concentration of the catalyst ozone and contaminant in order to define the better catalytic activity and how the reaction mechanisms are influenced by these parameters another promising alternative to fenton and ozonation processes are sulfate radical based aops because the main oxidants i e persulfates ps and peroxymonosulfate pms often used to generate these radicals are considered less expensive and more stable compared to both hydrogen peroxide and ozone for water purification hodges et al 2018 moreover sulfate radicals exhibit some advantages over ho such as similar or even stronger oxidation potential e0 2 5 3 1 v wide operating ph range from 2 to 8 solubility stability in water and environmentally benign process xiao et al 2020 iron oxide nanoparticles are considered efficient in activating peroxygen to produce sulfate radicals so4 and some studies have investigated this potential for example jegadeesan et al 2019 have reported the use of feo α fe2o3 biosynthesized nanoparticles to activate ps and pms for the degradation of congo red their results showed that the degradation efficiencies of the systems composed of catalysts and oxidants were significantly higher than both pristine iron nanoparticles and ps or pms suggesting the effectiveness of the fe nanoparticles activated oxidant system to existing ho based aops similarly zhao et al 2015 have shown the effective removal of p nitroaniline from water by the persulfate fe3o4 nanoparticles process after 300 minutes of reaction the contaminant removal rate was almost 100 after successive cycles however the degradation efficiency was progressively decreased reaching only 15 3 after the fifth cycle this result was explained by the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 on the surface of magnetite after persulfate activation and draw attention to the need for improvements in the reusability of the catalyst in successive runs a new approach to activate persulfate was described by wang et al 2019 where it was demonstrated the use of visible light for ps activated water disinfection the catalyst free technique provides a cost effective and sustainable bacteria inactivation since it does not require a high cost activating agent and catalyst recycling the oxidation of organic pollutants by ultrasound us has gained considerable attention the application of us waves in an aqueous medium can lead to the dissociation of water molecules into ho which is induced by high temperatures and high pressures when cavitation processes take place babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 then the pollutants can be oxidized by the radical species although ultrasound irradiation shows great potential in breaking down wastewater pollutants achieving total mineralization is unrealistic and researches are focused on the incorporation of us in different aops to increase the decomposition rate buthiyappan et al 2015 a large number of studies that cover hybrid methods as us o3 us fenton us h2o2 to improve the extent of mineralization can be found in the literature babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 moradi et al 2020 particularly an interesting work hassani et al 2018 reported the application of a heterogeneous sono fenton process using fe3o4 nanoparticles for the removal of the cationic dye violet 10 as expected the association of both aops contributed to the enhancement of radicals generation under acid conditions and consequently to dye degradation however the authors highlighted the importance of identifying the by products formed during the processes and their potential risks in the environment considering that the dye was not fully mineralized table 6 summarizes diverse examples of engineered nanostructures based on iron oxides for environmental applications through distinct aops 4 3 recovery of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles one important reason for using iron oxide nanoparticles in water remediation is their magnetic behavior that allows separation recovery re use from the contaminated system in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field however most works using mions are carried out at the bench scale and utilize handheld magnets for magnetic separation that is not feasible when treating large volumes of water or continuous flows baresel et al 2019 powell et al 2020 recently the magnetic capture of nanosorbents catalytic has been examined for use in larger scale water treatment some devices are being studied to overcome the inability to separate nanoparticles from flowing water based on the green technology of high gradient magnetic separation hgms baresel et al 2019 powell et al 2020 these new technologies for water treatment try to amalgamate separation and recovery efficiencies to be envisaged as a feasible alternative integrated into real world water remediation and encourage the safe use of magnetic nanomaterials by ensuring nanoparticle concentrations and or dissolved species below the regulatory limits for water for example for the united states environmental protection agency epa iron total content is considered a secondary contaminant with a total limit below 0 3 mg l 1 for drinking water according to table 6 considering the applications for degradation of pollutants the amount of nanomaterials used for catalysis varied in a wide range from 2 9 mg l 1 up to 1 5 g l 1 these values are much higher than the limit because they consider not only the iron mass but the whole nanoparticle nanocomposite systems that are also expected to be recovered from the medium by an external magnetic field in this sense the stability of the nanosystem in the medium is not only desired for allowing several cycles of use but also to guarantee that the degradation process is mainly heterogeneous as previously discussed moreover it should avoid reduce the contamination of the medium by iron species considering that fe leaching is a drawback still found in some applications considering the work of song et al 2016 that used the smallest amount of catalyst 2 9 mg l 1 table 6 after 2 h one cycle of degradation the leached fe was 24 µg l 1 below the epa regulation however concentrations of approximately 7 mg l 1 were detected in the solution by ferroudj et al 2013 after one cycle of 4 h although this value corresponded only to 0 25 of the material added confirming the required stability and possibility of reusability of the catalyst this concentration is higher than the regulatory values and therefore iron ions also need to be separated from treated water as potential contaminants 5 nanotoxicity and environmental risks 5 1 nano bio interactions and risks of iron oxide engineered nanoparticles the growing popularity of engineered iron oxide based nanomaterials has heightened concerns regarding their interactions with biotic and abiotic surrounding environments and the potential effects on aquatic ecosystems upon release and exposure he et al 2015 lei et al 2018 albeit often considered non toxic and unharmful to the environment that is not necessarily true several characteristics of iron oxide nanoparticles play a pivotal role in their properties which affect the overall behavior of colloidal nanoparticles in the water medium and surrounding ecosystems carvalho et al 2019 leonel et al 2019 as soon as the nanoparticles nps are released in the natural environment interactions occur between the nanomaterial and environmental interface these interactions at the nanoscale level are responsible for changing the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles due to various transformation processes which eventually modify their fate and potential ecological and biological toxicity he et al 2015 thus the potential toxicity of nps in natural environments must be assessed bearing in mind the processes of their transformation in these systems rather than considering only their properties particularly in aquatic systems key transformations include agglomeration adsorption dissolution and oxidation reduction reactions fig 5 overall the reactivity and mobility of nanoparticles in the environment are determined by their state of aggregation which means that less agglomeration leads to more accessible sites for interactions and slow sedimentation rate of nps on a solid surface resulting in enhanced reactivity bioavailability and eventually toxicity he et al 2015 aggregation of nps with organic matter heteroaggregation or with themselves homoaggregation occurs spontaneously to reduce their high surface energy lei et al 2018 several factors including ph surface coating ionic strength natural organic matter and temperature can significantly affect the behavior of nanoparticles as aggregates or particulates in the system abbas et al 2020 essentially solution ph governs the particle s surface charge or zeta potential zp which is crucial for the stability of the dispersion theoretically the farther the ph is from the point of zero charge pzc of the nps the higher the aqueous stability of the colloidal system will be due to the electrostatic repulsion lei et al 2018 usually colloidal nanoparticles are extremely unstable and therefore tend to form agglomerates at zp values below 30 mv mansur et al 2017 surface coatings are often used to stabilize nps in solution because they possess a large amount of surface functional groups consequently ph changes can affect the behavior of coated nanomaterials due to the protonation and deprotonation of these groups i e ph sensitive which in turn determine the balance of surface charges abbas et al 2020 in this manner different ligands can improve or worsen the stability of nanoparticles favoring or hindering their aggregation in natural environments tombácz et al 2013 have studied the influence of different organic acid coatings citric acid gallic acid poly acrylic acid poly acrylic co maleic acid and humic acid on the stability of fe3o4 nanoparticles their results showed that these ligands could either increase or decrease the stabilization of magnetite nanoparticles in natural waters depending on ph salinity i e dissolved salt content and organic concentration ionic strength is also regulates the stability of nanoparticles in colloidal aqueous systems at a given ph an increase in is can compress the electrical double layer thereby reducing the zeta potential this process leads to a rapid agglomeration of nps insofar as the electrostatic repulsion between the particles is overcome by attractive interactions vikesland et al 2016 have demonstrated that the particle concentration ph and ionic strength influence the aggregation and sedimentation behavior of magnetite nanoclusters chekli et al 2015 have likewise shown that the aggregate structure of nanoparticles is dependent on these physicochemical characteristics of the medium which is a significant factor in determining their fate in aquatic environments adsorption is one of the utmost important interactions between natural organic matter nom and nps that play a vital role in the stability of engineered nanomaterials nom possesses a macromolecular nature which can contribute to the stability of iron based nanoparticles in a similar way to polymeric ligands modifying the particle charge surface and providing electrostatic and steric repulsions however it can also favor aggregation depending on environmental conditions e g ph and is and the properties of the nanoparticles pzc which can destabilize the system abbas et al 2020 iron oxide based nps once released in natural water bodies and the environment can also interact with a variety of living organisms these nano bio interactions can trigger chemical transformations such as oxidation reduction and sulfidation reactions mediated by biological entities that can alter both the composition and behavior of the nps in the environment lei et al 2018 furthermore despite often neglected or underestimated these nanostructured particles may have potential cytotoxic effects on the living organisms either by the generation of ros metal ion release or cellular uptake lei et al 2018 although relevant the discussion of cytotoxic mechanisms is a complex and vast topic not fully understood yet and therefore it is beyond the scope of this study a more comprehensive analysis of this theme will certainly be required in future researches 5 2 assessment of in vitro nanotoxicity despite being generally considered safe and biocompatible mostly based on cell viability test results in vitro the potential toxicity of mions should not be disregarded the toxicity is significantly influenced by the chemical composition nanoparticle concentration crystal phase size shape surface coating time exposure and cell type among other factors it is therefore crucial to comprehensively assess the in vitro toxicity of iron oxide based materials prior to their introduction into the natural environment buzea and pacheco 2019 carvalho et al 2019 valdiglesias et al 2016 to date oxidative stress is the most broadly accepted mechanism of cytotoxicity for iron based nanomaterials it is principally correlated to the generation of ros both extra and intracellularly through fenton reactions lei et al 2018 a detailed revision of previous studies can be found in the literature ganguly et al 2018 liu et al 2019 in summary intracellular h2o2 produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain is catalyzed by fe2 and fe3 from iron oxide nanoparticles to produce highly toxic reactive hydroxyl ho and hydroperoxyl ho2 radicals according to the previously presented fenton reactions eq 3 and eq 4 the imbalance in the rate of ros generation leads to oxidative stress and the consequent production of free radicals that can damage proteins dna and lipids cellular and organelle membranes due to their high polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially susceptible to ros damage that is named lipid peroxidation it is a process in which free radical species remove electrons from lipids and subsequently produce new reactive intermediates in a chain reaction the lipid peroxidation process damages phospholipids by directly altering their structure activity and physical properties which can induce cell death signaling termed as ferroptosis more specifically ferroptosis occurs as a result of increased ros presence due to high intracellular iron levels and a depletion of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione gsh that cause lipid peroxidation and consequently to programed cell death distinct from the apoptotic mechanism 5 2 1 oxidative stress evaluation the enhancement of ros in cells exposed to iron oxide nanoparticles engenders cytotoxicity and oxidative damage which can be detected via three main different approaches direct measurement of reactive oxygen species evaluation of the presence of superoxides hydrogen peroxides hydroxyl radicals etc assessment of oxidative damage protein lipid and dna damages and assessment of antioxidant status changes in catalase cat gsh superoxide dismutase sod vitamins a c e etc katerji et al 2019 as demonstrated by gaharwar et al 2017 the uptake of iron oxide nps in the lymphocytes of rats prompted oxidative stress mediated by ros production and depletion of glutathione in a concentration and time dependent way similarly ansari et al 2019a have proposed that the exposure of fe3o4 nanoparticles to the primary lymphocytes of rats in vitro induced dose dependent cytotoxicity which was measured by ros production in addition increasing concentrations of magnetite led to a reduction in catalase activity in order to minimize the effect of ros generation on the toxicity of rat cells they also investigated the influence of the natural antioxidant thymoquinone on the neutralization of ros before it could induce damage to cells the results showed that the antioxidant has the potential to be used to avoid the harmful effects of iron oxide nanoparticles in vitro 5 2 2 cell viability evaluation the cell viability evaluation using different colorimetric assays is widely recognized to investigate the potential toxicity of nanoparticles in vitro these analyses are based on the quantification of the number of viable nonviable cells through a spectrophotometer or a microscope which is possible due to the generation of colored dye enzymes complexes ganguly et al 2018 although they are employed to preliminarily access cell viability the results from different techniques cannot be directly compared since they are determined by distinct parameters as an example the mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay is associated with the mitochondrial activity whereas trypan blue tb or lactate dehydrogenase ldh assay with membrane integrity soenen et al 2011 it has been reported several cytotoxic effects of mions mainly using mtt assay which are influenced by multiple features such as size shape the concentration of nanoparticles typically in the order of μg ml or a few mg ml exposure time commonly 24 to 72 h cell type surface modification among others malhotra et al 2020 patil et al 2018 for example carvalho et al 2019 have shown using mtt protocol that mions cytotoxicity is composition and cell type dependent in this report the cytotoxicity of hematite and magnetite were evaluated towards glioblastoma cancer cells u87 and human embryonic kidney cells hek 293t considering the same concentration and time of cell exposure the results demonstrated that fe3o4 was relatively more cytotoxic than fe2o3 for both cell types because it provided fe2 as more reactive species for the generation of ros in oxidative processes in addition a higher lethality of fe3o4 was observed in u87 cells ascribed to the abnormal metabolism frequently present in cancer cells usually it is a difficult task to compare data from different researches as most nanoparticles related cytotoxicity results are produced by individual studies that monitor particular physicochemical properties for a specific type of cell and nanoparticles as well as distinct experimental conditions soenen et al 2011 to address this issue some studies have pointed out the need for protocols standardization not only to enhance the comparison of data and the understanding of induced toxicity but also to establish suitable and reproducible environments in terms of sample preparation choice of cells growing conditions and appropriate control groups soenen et al 2011 another usual way to measure cytotoxicity effects is by assessing cellular membrane integrity where trypan blue tb and ldh are commonly used while the first one can be evaluated by staining the cell membrane that has been compromised i e nonviable cells the second one can be measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage in the extracellular media ganguly et al 2018 in addition to the drawbacks previously mentioned tb has its particular downsides the manual counting of viable cells using a microscope can perhaps increase the chances of error in the measurements thus to have more accuracy in the results it is recommended to conduct various assays for the same sample patil et al 2018 or verifying it through more quantitative cell viability techniques ganguly et al 2018 5 3 assessment of in vivo nanotoxicity in a broad perspective besides preliminary in vitro assays due to the high threats posed by engineered nanoparticles to different animal species researchers must also use in vivo models to assess environmental risk and potential effects on human health nps that are used in industries and remain in the water or soil can be easily absorbed distributed and even accumulated in various living organisms due to their nano size after their penetration into cells a variety of reactions can potentially cause damage to the organelles and affecting metabolic pathways to this end many studies have employed unicellular and multicellular organisms to investigate nanomaterial toxicity including biodistribution and toxicokinetic research prajitha et al 2019 5 3 1 zebrafish danio rerio embryotoxicity test model among several animal models used experimentally the zebrafish danio rerio is considered the most suitable fish specie for nanoparticle toxicity studies some features that make it convenient include large egg production rapid development easy preservation in laboratory conditions and small size another key aspect is related to their genetic similarity to humans which assures a resemblance between cell structure signaling and physiology pereira et al 2019 numerous studies have demonstrated that zebrafish testing offers advantages over mammalian models like rodents in terms of economic ethical and biological issues the maintenance of fish species is less costly and less time consuming the studies are done in the embryonic phase and they have increased sensitivity haque and ward 2018 hence zebrafish have been widely used for nanotoxicity evaluation of metal oxide nanoparticles chakraborty et al 2016 cassar et al 2020 in particular villacis et al 2017 have analyzed the toxic effects caused by maghemite nanoparticles in danio rerio using genotoxicity oxidative stress and molecular methodologies adult animals were exposed to different concentrations of nanoparticles in the range of 4 7 mg l 1 to 74 7 mg l 1 over 96 h the results showed harmful and concentration dependent effects on the exposed danio rerio 5 3 2 daphnia magna as an organism test model daphnia magna a small planktonic crustacean has become an important model for ecotoxicological investigation the main characteristics that make these organisms attractive as an experimental model are a periodic parthenogenetic life cycle as well as simple culturing and handling tkaczyk et al 2020 one recent and interesting study kwon et al 2014 has investigated the effects on the exposure of daphnia magna to two types of iron oxides magnetite and hematite the results confirmed that the difference in physicochemical properties of iron based nanoparticles led to distinct interactions with the biological system which caused dissimilar nanotoxicity outcomes fe3o4 nanoparticles showed higher dissolution and oxidation rates which changed their biodistribution and bioaccumulation within the planktonic animal and induce severe metabolism disturbances more recently magro et al 2018 have evaluated the effects of surface reactivity of maghemite nanoparticles on daphnia magna adults and embryos it was showed that nps toxicity could be ascribed not only to nonspecific biological response related for example the size and shape of the material but also the effect of specific bio interactions caused by reactive surfaces this work highlighted the critical relevance of the composition and surface chemistry of nanoparticles as an indispensable element for assessing ecotoxicological risks in the aquatic systems 5 4 assessment of ecotoxicity toxicity induced in the environment and its influence on the whole ecosystem is known as ecotoxicity the introduction of engineered nanomaterials into aquatic environments e g marine and freshwater ecosystems can affect organisms at distinct levels of the trophic chain due to bioconcentration and biomagnification therefore the ecotoxicity assessment is crucial to prevent environmental pollution affecting water resources and the harmful consequences in living organisms ganguly et al 2018 5 4 1 bacterial toxicity assay bacteria play an essential ecological role in aquatic ecosystems they are associated with the conversion of organic substrates into mineral nutrients because these microorganisms respond very rapidly to variations in the environment they are suitable for fast screening of contaminants in natural waters in addition they have reasonably short life cycles and low cost maintenance diverse bacterial assays therefore have been established for assessing potential ecotoxicity bitton and koopman 1992 bacterial assessment of chemical toxicity in water environments is based on the impact of the pollutants on growth inhibition or cell viability of the bacterial cultures these conventional assays comprise the measurements of changes in cell densities by absorbance analysis and verification of inhibition regions or colony formation on agar plates bitton and koopman 1992 some studies have evaluated the potential microbial toxicity of various metal oxide nanoparticles for bacillus subtilis escherichia coli and streptococcus aureus cultures baek and an 2011 leareng et al 2019 and the results have shown that the microbial growth is adversely influenced by increasing concentration of nps however this antimicrobial tendency can be modulated upon different nano bio interface interactions arakha et al 2015 have explored the effect of the nanoparticle bacteria interface on the antimicrobial activity of magnetite nanoparticles to this end fe3o4 without any surface coating and fe3o4 coated with chitosan were exposed to bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli bacterial cultures to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility the results showed that chitosan coated magnetite was more toxic to the bacteria due to the stronger attachment of the nanoparticles on the microorganism cell this effect was ascribed to chitosan adding positive charges onto the surface of the magnetite which was electrostatically attracted to the negative charges on the bacterial surface the stronger interactions were responsible for producing more ros resulting in bacterial death 5 4 2 algal toxicity assay algae also play an important role in aquatic systems since they are primary producers in food chains because these organisms are more susceptible to pollutants than invertebrates and fishes they are generally used for assessing water quality and toxicity algal assays are comparatively easy to perform in laboratory conditions adopting batch cultures some parameters used to evaluate the toxicity include in vivo fluorescence cell counting and nitrogenase activity tang et al 2017 lei et al 2016 have studied the effect of particle size crystal phase and oxidation state of iron based nanoparticles on green algae toxicity the results showed that algal growth inhibition was significantly affected by these parameters the algae toxicity was mainly associated with the oxidative stress induced by the iron nanoparticles even though the nps cell heteroagglomeration also contributed to the toxic effects a similar study was performed by saxena et al 2020 where a comparative evaluation of toxicity and accumulation of nanosized fe2o3 nanoparticles and their bulk counterpart have been done using microalgae as a model it was evidenced that nanoparticles with nanometric sizes were more cytotoxic due to higher internalization of nps and stimulation of oxidative stress associated with a larger surface area given the diversity of mechanisms which can induce nanomaterial toxicity a series of analysis is required to establish the possible toxic potential of nanoparticles at distinct levels therefore table 7 summarizes a set of methodologies that have been more often used to assess the in vitro in vivo and ecotoxicity of iron based nanoparticles 6 conclusions and future outlook the development and applications of advanced functional nanostructures based on magnetic iron oxide nanomaterials seem extremely promising for water remediation as demonstrated by the several studies presented in this review nonetheless further studies are highly necessary to develop large scale production and cost effective sustainable engineered nanomaterials through greener chemistry as well as considering their potential toxicity to the environment and human health after exposure moreover because the hybrid nanostructures required for catalysis may lead to complexity and increased costs there is a growing demand for designing and producing these nanomaterials with integrated multiple features and through optimized synthetic routes regarding the use of mions for water treatment an important problem to be addressed is that adsorption and catalysis studies should be performed under realistic conditions concerning the presence of organic matter co ions ph pollutant concentrations among others also the magnetic capture of nanosorbents catalytic has to be examined more closely for potential use in larger scale water treatment and more studies are highly needed to develop successful and non harmful regeneration methods xu and wang 2012 apart from the catalyst recovery and reusability another demand for the aops is the evaluation of their industrial applicability commonly limited by the high operational costs which usually involve the requirement for high energy consumption and expensive chemical reagents thus innovative studies should be focused on some puzzling and appealing sustainable approaches including the use of mild processing conditions preferably at room temperature and renewable energy resources e g sunlight in photo fenton reactions mirzaei et al 2017 iron oxide based nanozymes nanoparticles that mimic the enzyme like properties in redox reactions are a hot topic of research in recent years for pollutant detection and treatment current research and applications are still limited but the future of nanozymes in the environmental field seems very promising as they can be used to detect and degrade organic pollutants and toxins as well as for sterilization through the inactivation of bacteria viruses fungi and spores li et al 2019b meng et al 2020 unnikrishnan et al 2021 finally despite the vast horizon of opportunities and innovation breakthroughs of iron based nanosystems for technological and science applications the environmental and health impacts of engineered nanoparticles their toxicological effects fate and bioaccumulation are yet not comprehensively understood and therefore should be further investigated prior to their safe introduction into

17238,the fast growth of industrialization combined with the increasing population has led to an unparalleled demand for providing water in a safe reliable and cost effective way which has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first century faced by global society the application of nanotechnology in water treatment and pollution cleanup is a promising alternative in order to overcome the current limitations in particular the application of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles mions for environmental remediation has currently received remarkable attention due to its unique combination of physicochemical and magnetic properties given the broadening use of these functional engineered nanomaterials there is a growing concern about the adverse effects upon exposure of products and by products to the environment this makes vitally relevant the development of green chemistry in the synthesis processes combined with a trustworthy risk assessment of the nanotoxicity of mions as the scientific knowledge of the potential hazard of nanomaterials remains limited this work provides comprehensive coverage of the recent progress on designing and developing iron oxide based nanomaterials through a green synthesis strategy including the use of benign solvents and ligands despite the limitations of nanotoxicity and environmental risks of iron oxide based nanoparticles for the ecosystem this critical review presents a contribution to the emerging knowledge concerning the theoretical and experimental studies on the toxicity of mions potential improvement of applications

first century faced by global society is providing water in a safe trustworthy and low cost way the fast growth of industrialization the increasing population and changing lifestyles of people have led to an unprecedented increase of production in combination with the inappropriate disposal of hazardous industrial by products in water systems such as organic dyes heavy metals pesticides and pharmaceuticals residues thus in the view of this scenario environmental remediation has become an urgent need to preserve ecological stability and public health alvarez et al 2018 kalita and baruah 2020 lu and astruc 2020 a variety of conventional technologies have been used for the treatment of water among them the most common are chemical precipitation flotation gravity separation solvent extraction ion exchange and membrane filtration linden et al 2020 maksoud et al 2020 sadegh et al 2017 subban et al 2019 however they undergo some drawbacks such as time consumption partial effectiveness and high costs corsi et al 2018 from the past few decades new opportunities in nanotechnology have stimulated researches exploring the use of engineered nanomaterials in advanced oxidation processes aops hodges et al 2018 these water treatment methods have demonstrated to be effective for wastewater remediation through the in situ generation of extremely reactive radicals which have a strong oxidation capability and represent an innovative solution for unspecifically degrading most of the recalcitrant contaminants into less toxic species ferroudj et al 2017 wang et al 2016a the better performance of catalytic nanomaterials can be mostly attributed to the high surface area and consequently high chemical reactivity corsi et al 2018 kalita and baruah 2020 among the different types of nanomaterials for environmental applications magnetic nanoparticles have attracted remarkable research interest mainly because they are magnetically responsive structures that can be manipulated under the influence of an applied magnetic field wang and yin 2016 the capacity to control the spatial distribution and the particle size of these nanoparticles provides a distinct advantage for interface related applications such as adsorption kim et al 2018 maksoud et al 2020 and catalysis hodges et al 2018 hua and huang 2017 in particular their usage enables the recovery and reuse of the sorbent catalyst after magnetic separation and further appropriate processing which potentially eliminates the need for additional chemical reagents and complexes processes to separate the catalyst from the treated water li et al 2015 tang and lo 2013 this important inherent feature associated with its huge surface to volume ratio and outstanding catalytic activity has been providing numerous opportunities to develop smart environmental nanomaterials for the improvement of the eco friendly catalytic approach hamers 2017 different classes of magnetic nanoparticles have been evaluated for advanced applications mainly making use of the size and chemical composition which actively govern the magnetic properties moise et al 2017 pure transition metals such as fe ni and co are the main magnetic metallic nanoparticles because they possess high saturation magnetization however they are highly toxic and extremely susceptible to oxidation leading to partial or complete loss of their magnetization although the production of magnetic alloy nanoparticles such as feco fept and fepd can improve their resistance towards oxidation they still undergo poor chemical stability and also have some limitations for applications hedayatnasab et al 2017 in contrast metal oxides are less susceptible to oxidation and consequently can exhibit a stable magnetic response furthermore some important reviews have demonstrated preliminary endorsement of nontoxicity yuliarto et al 2019 albeit the study of the toxicity of nanoparticles should be comprehensively investigated since it comprises several relevant aspects such as size morphology chemical composition concentration and surface features buzea and pacheco 2019 carvalho et al 2019 because of these attributes associated with the possibility of developing metal oxide nanoparticles with superparamagnetic behavior this strategy has gained much attention for technological applications despite the excellent physicochemical and magnetic properties of metal oxides nanoparticles their intrinsic characteristic to agglomerate during the synthesis process and use can restrict its direct application from the chemistry point of view this behavior can be explained by focusing on the dual nature of the nanoparticles poor stability and high reactivity xu et al 2018 to address this issue surface modified metal oxide nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized into desired functional nanostructured materials cotin et al 2018 although the synthesis procedures and high technological applications of iron oxide nanoparticles have been extensively investigated reviews covering the development of sustainable synthesis and the understanding of how these materials interact with the environment are still scarcely reported the products and processes should integrate the principles of green chemistry and sustainable engineering in order to achieve new functionalities which maximizes their potential while minimizing any adverse environmental impact hamers 2017 zimmerman et al 2020 this review encompasses the most recent progress on iron oxide based magnetic nanomaterials and their special features which benefit advanced environmental applications focusing on water treatment and remediation including the main types of advanced oxidation processes furthermore the design and the green synthesis of these materials are discussed underlying the role of size shape surface coating and functionalization in the stability reactivity and magnetic properties additionally this review highlights the nanotoxicity and environmental risks of iron oxide based nanoparticles for the ecosystem to conclude current challenges and future prospects are covered 2 iron oxide based nanomaterials iron oxides have been the cornerstone of the nanostructured magnetic materials considering their natural abundance low cost and interesting chemistry iron possesses high chemical versatility in aqueous media arising from the existence of two stable oxidation states fe2 and fe3 on a broad range of ph combined with the high chemical reactivity of iron complexes regarding acid base phenomena jolivet et al 2004 in the natural environment iron oxides have existed in various structural types including ferrous ferric and mixed valence compounds among them hematite α fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 are the main representatives which have received significant attention regarding scientific technological and industrial applications hematite α fe2o3 is the most stable iron oxide under atmosphere conditions used in gas sensors pigments and catalysis owing to its low cost and high corrosion resistance however its weak ferromagnetism associated with the absence of superparamagnetism behavior in nanoscale makes them less suitable for advanced applications wu et al 2015 magnetite fe3o4 differs from most other iron oxides due to the presence of iron cations in both divalent and trivalent valence states it is a conventional ferrite that belongs to the inverse cubic spinel structure in which fe2 species occupy the octahedral sites in order to obtain higher crystal field stabilization energy while fe3 species are equally distributed among both tetrahedral a and octahedral b sites in this configuration the structure of fe3o4 is responsible for producing two magnetic sublattices with antiparallel spin moments on the a and b sites therefore the ferrimagnetic behavior of magnetite arises from the magnetic moments of divalent cations hiemstra 2018 ramimoghadam et al 2014 this typical spinel ferrite exhibits superior magnetic properties compared to other iron oxides such as high saturation magnetization ms 92 100 emu g 1 and magnetic susceptibility which make them widespread exploited for biomedical and environmental applications ashraf et al 2019 hedayatnasab et al 2017 maghemite γ fe2o3 is also a ferrimagnetic oxide with a similar spinel structure of fe3o4 nonetheless it diverges from magnetite because all iron species are in the trivalent state in order to compensate for the oxidation of fe2 cation vacancies take place within the octahedral sites therefore γ fe2o3 is recognized as a fully oxidized form of magnetite ashraf et al 2019 because it has lower saturation magnetization ms 80 emu g 1 magnetite is more applied than maghemite however it has the benefit of being more stable and resistant in acidic environments which can favor its use under some adverse conditions rossi et al 2014 table 1 summarizes some of the structural physicochemical and magnetic properties of the main representatives of iron oxides 3 design and synthesis of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and hybrids 3 1 synthesis processes numerous synthetic routes including chemical physical and biological processes can be used to produce nanoscale ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic particles termed as ferrofluids such as iron oxide nanoparticles with different levels of controlled size morphology stability dispersion and appropriate surface chemistry chemical methods are considered bottom up approaches responsible for assembling nanoparticles from monomers atoms they are widely used owing to the possibility of low production cost and high yield ali et al 2016 laurent et al 2008 nowadays these methods are considered by some researchers as the only ones capable of satisfactorily addressing the challenges in the design of multifunctional nanoparticles cotin et al 2018 several chemical processes are available for the preparation of mions including co precipitation hydrothermal solvothermal synthesis microemulsion microwave sonochemical thermal decomposition sol gel and polyol dadfar et al 2019 jamkhande et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 marcelo et al 2020 shaterabadi et al 2017 most of these routes often employ highly toxic organic solvents that are not easily degraded and remain in the environment unless the recovery of these reagents is made which can demand a large amount of energy additionally high temperatures combined or not with high pressures are requirements for some processes including the hydrothermal solvothermal and thermal decomposition where expensive surfactants are demanded the sum of these aspects contributes to high cost energy consumption compared to methods that operate at lower room temperatures and atmospheric pressure such as co precipitation it is also noteworthy that some of the chemical routes only produce hydrophobic mions nanoparticles that require subsequent surface modifications after synthesis to make them hydrophilic suitable for the applications natarajan et al 2019 verdugo et al 2016 physical based routes constitute synthetic methods that follow a top down approach in this case bulk materials are reduced into nanosized particles by different mechanical physical and chemical processes such as aerosol gas phase deposition laser ablation ball milling and ion sputtering jamkhande et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 although these methods are relatively easy to perform and suitable for production on a large scale they are recognized for the usual inability to control the size of particles at the nanoscale dimensions this drawback associated with the requirement of expensive equipment for the preparation of the magnetic nanoparticle usually turn them less representative as synthesizing processes marcelo et al 2020 the use of biological based systems for the synthesis of nanoparticles is not unexpected considering that some of the unicellular and multicellular organisms are known to transform inorganic metal ions into nanomaterials via intra or extracellular mechanisms virkutyte and varma 2013 biological based routes including bacteria fungi and plant mediated synthetic pathways are a growing field that enables the formation of biocompatible nanoparticles but there are some limitations associated with the slow rate of production cotin et al 2018 together physical and biological synthetic procedures comprise up to approximately 10 of all iron oxide nanoparticle synthesis which is very narrow when compared to chemical based synthesis the most used synthesis procedures combined with summarized nanoparticle properties advantages limitations and recent examples are presented in table 2 ansari et al 2019b assab et al 2020 burgos castillo et al 2020 dadfar et al 2019 jamkhande et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 leonel et al 2019 natarajan et al 2019 marcelo et al 2020 sharma et al 2020 shaterabadi et al 2017 tanaka et al 2019 vanyorek et al 2019 yadav et al 2020 yang et al 2020 3 2 greener synthesis of ferrofluids considering the application in water remediation the use of greener routes for mions synthesis may be a pursuit for a more comprehensive approach in the chemical synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles solvents are essential to provide a medium for dissolving precursors promoting heat and reagents transfer and dispersing the final product because it is used in large quantities the choice of solvent should be carefully made among green solvents water is an advantageous choice since it is the cheapest solvent and the most abundant molecule besides that it is non toxic can dissolve well all kinds of ionic species and also some organic components such as sugars and proteins shanker et al 2016 singh et al 2018 as the eco friendly approach for the synthesis of nanoparticles has gained considerable attention advanced green solvents are being developed in this emerging field of research one of the best examples is ionic liquids ils which consist of ions with melting points below 100 c because most of them liquefy below room temperature and start to decompose above 300 c or 400 c they can operate in a wider synthesis temperature range than water another benefit of using these solvents includes the feasibility of modulating solubility properties through the choice of the nature of cations and anions however problems associated with their biodegradability raise environmental concerns in this context deep eutectic solvents have emerged as ionic liquids analogs which also possess high thermal stability flexible miscibility low volatility but better biodegradability and lower cost shanker et al 2016 singh et al 2018 yousefi et al 2017 to date co precipitation from homogeneous aqueous phase solutions is the classical and greener chemical technique for the synthesis of mions even though the colloidal nature of this technique sometimes can make it a relatively intricate process ali et al 2016 laurent et al 2008 the first critical challenge consists of adjusting the experimental conditions leading to monodisperse nanoparticles with a suitable size the second one is the selection of a reproducible process that can be applied to an industrial scale laurent et al 2008 regardless of these challenges environmentally friendly chemical processes are becoming progressively more attractive and are much required as a consequence of worldwide increasing concerns related to environmental contamination corsi et al 2018 this synthesis is based on the simultaneous precipitation of fe ii and fe iii aqueous salt solutions in an alkaline medium gul et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 the main advantages of this method rely on simplicity the requirement of low temperatures typically in the range of 25 c to 80 c large scale production and economic viability since it does not demand complex purification processes however the control of the particle size distribution is limited considering that the crystal growth is mostly governed by kinetic factors gul et al 2019 laurent et al 2008 despite that the size morphology and composition can be tailored by controlling synthesis parameters including ph ionic strength temperature fe ii and fe iii ratio atmosphere and type of salts used ali et al 2016 ramimoghadam et al 2014 soler and paterno 2017 the complete precipitation of magnetite is expected with a stoichiometric ratio of fe ii and fe iii equals to 1 2 in alkaline solution according to eq 1 based on the thermodynamics of the reaction it still requires a ph in the range from 8 to 14 under non oxidizing conditions as it is not a stable iron oxide and in the presence of oxygen converts to maghemite eq 2 ramimoghadam et al 2014 soler and paterno 2017 1 f e 2 aq 2 f e 3 aq 8 o h aq f e 3 o 4 s 4 h 2 o l 2 4 f e 3 o 4 s o 2 g 6 γ f e 2 o 3 s finally biosynthesis is a completely green route that provides several advantages over conventional chemical synthesis for example low energy requirement because it can be performed at room temperature consumption of less harmful chemicals production of less toxic by products and natural abundance bolade et al 2020 virkutyte and varma 2013 as a consequence biological based routes represent an alternative to conventional methods where bacteria fungi or plants usually behave as reducing and capping agents one of the most renowned biological techniques for the production of magnetite nanoparticles by a direct mechanism of mineralization is through magnetotactic bacteria these bacteria produce intracellular organelle composed of fe3o4 known as magnetosomes of high purity and crystallinity abdeen et al 2016 nonetheless the regulation of biomineralization which takes the role of controlling crystal growth and morphology is still a difficult task to be achieved through biosynthetic routes yamagishi et al 2016 synthesis of nanoparticles by fungi has plenty of advantages over other organisms due to the relative cost effectiveness ease of manipulation of the organic matter and because they have enzymes and reducing components on the cell surface devatha and thalla 2018 virkutyte and varma 2013 however the synthesis is time consuming because of the fungal biomass preparation as reported in some studies devatha and thalla 2018 sarkar et al 2016 similarly plant bioactive components known as phytochemicals and biomolecules can behave as reducing capping and stabilizing agents during the synthesis thereby improving the stability of nanoparticles similar to fungi synthesis plant mediated methods can be time consuming due to the requirement of extra steps to acquire such phytochemicals including extraction isolation purification and characterization of the compound of interest devatha and thalla 2018 lópez and antuch 2020 singh et al 2018 yuliarto et al 2019 unquestionably bio assisted methods have demonstrated to be sustainable and eco friendly processes but still there are some shortcomings associated with the biological nanoparticles firstly there is no well established standard method for the synthesis of nanoparticles because there are diverse mechanisms of reactions between biological entities and metal ion precursor which make difficult to completely understand these pathways resulting in nanoparticles with varied morphologies virkutyte and varma 2013 moreover the natural variability between species can lead to different synthetic parameters restraining the reproducibility of the biologically synthesized nanoparticles comprehensive knowledge of the active biomolecules and their mechanisms of reactions responsible for producing and stabilizing nanoparticles is therefore required additionally further studies and development of these green procedures should be extended to an industrial scale in order to consider the environmental and human health impacts in comparison with traditional alternatives despite these drawbacks the demand for green synthesis of mions opens space for more research in this field for new opportunities bolade et al 2020 zikalala et al 2018 table 3 provides the appraisal of the multifaceted of iron based nanoparticles biosynthesis and their use in environmental remediation 3 3 the role of surface coating in the stability of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle the large surface volume ratio is a crucial feature common to all nanomaterials that make their surface the dominant factor in many physical and chemical processes boles et al 2016 because nanoparticles exhibit high surface energy they tend to aggregate to thermodynamically reduce this energy however agglomeration is an undesirable process since it significantly decreases reactivity for bare magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles colloidal stability solely relies on ph dependent surface charges there are some discrepancies in the value of the isoelectric point iep reported for magnetite in the literature 6 2 8 5 but fe3o4 presents limited stability in colloidal suspensions at circumneutral ph i e 6 5 7 5 that is the regular ph of water bodies rivers and seas kosmulski 2020 lei et al 2018 as a result nanoparticles require a stabilizing coating to hinder aggregation and to preserve high reactivity during applications phan and haes 2019 virkutyte and varma 2013 xu et al 2018 thus surface stabilization of nanoparticles can typically be achieved using different types of materials that can act as surface coatings the most commonly used are shells of inorganic materials such as silica and gold low iep broadening the ph range of colloidal stability organic monomers possessing functional groups including carboxylates sulfates and phosphates and polymeric macromolecules cotin et al 2018 laurent et al 2008 among these types more attention has been given to polymers the advantage of using macromolecules over small molecules as coatings relies on polymers with more charged species to enhance repulsive forces between adjacent chains this has the effect of balancing the magnetic and van der waals attractive forces acting on the magnetic nanoparticles therefore they can provide exceptional colloidal stability bohara et al 2016 these ligands enable colloidal stability preferably via two distinct and complementary mechanisms steric stabilization occurs when the adsorption of molecules over the nanocrystal surface provides a steric barrier that hinders interactions between neighboring nanoparticles on the other hand when the nanocrystals are stabilized by ligands with charged species there occurs an effect of electrostatic stabilization through repulsion forces boles et al 2016 heuer jungemann et al 2019 natural and synthetic polymers can be used as stabilizing and functionalization agents for magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles the growing interest in developing environmentally friendly procedures for the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles has stimulated the use of natural polymers as green stabilizing agents saif et al 2016 this class of polymers usually provides biocompatibility low toxicity and biodegradability to the system moreover they exhibit considerable diversity of structures possessing a lot of functional groups accessible for further chemical modification among natural polymers the use of polysaccharides and derivatives like carboxymethylcellulose cmc chitosan cs dextran starch agar and alginates has gained attention as globally commercially available and affordable materials in addition to their physicochemical properties the strategy of obtaining polysaccharide derivatives li et al 2019a merzendorfer 2019 is adopted for the improvement of limited solubility biocompatibility and or adsorption properties that has been explored through a myriad of chemical modifications to create different functional derivatives as presented for example for cs in fig 1 besides these most representative polysaccharides and derivatives a vast universe of feasible conjugation and modification of iron oxide nanoparticles surfaces has been used to reach advancements in environmental remediation sousa et al 2015 because biopolymers are often obtained from natural sources such as vegetal algae corals fungi invertebrates fish and mammals the existence of batch to batch property variations is perhaps the main restraint for their wide ranging use simionescu and ivanov 2016 on the contrary the versatility of synthetic polymers in designing particular physical and chemical properties through their controlled chemical composition makes them attractive components to create hybrid organic inorganic nanomaterials for different advanced applications simionescu and ivanov 2016 polyethylene glycol peg polydopamine pda polyethyleneimine pei polyvinyl alcohol pva polyacrylic acid paa and polyaniline pani are important classes of synthetic polymers used to stabilize mions natarajan et al 2019 the capping agents can passivate the surface of magnetic nanoparticles during the nucleation and growth processes i e in situ coatings or post synthesis synthesis in the presence of ligands has several benefits including reduced agglomeration and a small number of processing procedures nevertheless the presence of polymeric molecules during the nucleation and growth processes of nanocrystals has a pivotal influence on the crystallinity size and morphology properties of nanoparticles heuer jungemann et al 2019 for example shaterabadi et al 2017 have investigated the effect of in situ dextran coating on the stability and magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles their results showed that the presence of dextran in the reaction medium during co precipitation synthesis caused a reduction in the size of the nanoparticles 10 nm as compared to bare magnetite 17 nm this behavior is regularly observed for nanoparticles as the presence of macromolecular capping ligands hinders agglomeration and particle growth the guarantee of the colloidal stability is however one of the three fundamental purposes in controlling the surface chemistry of mions the second is to modify the surface of nanomaterials creating conditions for the modulation of adsorption properties the release of the bound contaminant and re use of the nanoparticles as many cycles as possible the third goal is the anchorage of target species mainly biomolecules markers and therapeutic agents soler and paterno 2017 in this sense the coating agent not only provides stability but also can further be employed in functionalization which becomes difficult to separate stabilization from functionalization gul et al 2019 finally it should not be neglected that surface coating may also act to prevent nanoparticle oxidation it is noteworthy that despite many advantages in removal degradation of pollutants in water treatment processes some studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles capped with ligands or other nanomaterials for producing surface modified nanoassemblies can also present lower adsorption and catalytic activity than bare analogs since some coordination sites are blocked by the stabilizing agent and the accessibility to the substrate decreases ferroudj et al 2013 kim et al 2018 rossi et al 2018 ferroudj et al 2013 have investigated the catalytic efficiency of maghemite nanoparticles and maghemite silica nanocomposite for the removal of water pollutants such as methyl orange mo the lower activity of the nanocomposite system was attributed to the restriction of the reagents to access the catalytic sites placed at the surface of the maghemite nanoparticles that were encapsulated in the sio2 beads regarding polymer ligands kim et al 2018 have described the role of different organic coatings concerning the adsorption of as v and cr vi by magnetite nanocrystals including polyethyleneimine pei and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab c16h33 n ch3 3 br the positively charged amino functional groups in pei and cbta benefits their interactions with anionic adsorbates which improve the performance of heavy metals sorption due to their propensity to form negatively charged oxyanions in the aqueous medium it was hypothesized by the authors therefore that the presence of amine groups at the surface of pei and ctab coatings were the main binding sites for both as v and cr vi anionic species however it was observed a slight difference in adsorption ability between fe3o4 pei and fe3o4 ctab despite ctab has 25 times fewer amine groups than pei a reasonable interpretation for that can be ascribed to the steric hindrance caused by the branched structure of pei difficulting the accessibility to the substrate and consequently the adsorption process table 4 summarizes some of the relevant examples of inorganic and organic coatings applied for the functionalization of mions underlying their comparative benefits and drawbacks for biomedical and environmental applications 3 4 the role of size and shape in the magnetic properties and environmental applications of nanomaterials as previously presented it is well recognized that the influence of different features on the synthesis of mions such as temperature atmosphere the presence of surfactants precursors species and concentration are relevant to understand the physicochemical and magnetic properties of the produced nanomaterials and nanostructures in this sense surface chemistry plays an important role in determining these properties and in particular it can be responsible for tuning the dimensions and morphology of the nanoparticles that directly affect magnetic properties guardia et al 2011 magnetic nanomaterials exhibit high sensitiveness of their magnetism to variations in size and shape this phenomenon can be explained by two main factors that not only govern the magnetic properties of nanoparticles but also provide them with special characteristics finite size and surface effects issa et al 2013 magnetic nanoparticles generally bigger than 20 nm are composed of a multi domain structure where domain walls separate regions of uniform magnetization the creation of these walls is driven by the balance between two components the external magnetostatic and domain wall energies which are associated with the particle volume and the interfacial area between the domains respectively when the size of the particle is reduced below a critical diameter threshold size its structure becomes a single domain because it requires more energy to create the walls than to sustain the magnetostatic energy nanomaterials consisted of a single magnetic domain might exhibit superparamagnetic behavior highly desirable for many advanced applications issa et al 2013 soler and paterno 2017 surface effects arise from the breaking of the crystal symmetry dangling bonds the existence of capping agents surface strain or even the production of core shell design with distinct physical and chemical structures these effects become more prominent as the particle size decreases and consequently the fraction of surface atoms increases exponentially guardia et al 2011 issa et al 2013 therefore a better understanding of the impact of the synthesis and surface chemistry on magnetic properties is essential to improve and maximize nanoparticle magnetic responses torres gómez et al 2019 have demonstrated the effect of synthesis temperature on the shape and morphological features of magnetite nanoparticles in their studies the nanoparticles were produced by the hydrothermal method at 120 c 140 c and 160 c and the morphologies obtained were semi spherical octahedral and cubic respectively all the nanoparticles showed superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature however the saturation magnetization parameter ms changed from 52 emu g 1 quasi spherical shape to 107 emu g 1 cubic shape a similar study was developed by tadic et al 2019 where hematite nanoparticles were synthesized by a hydrothermal method in different conditions of precursors concentration surfactants solvents temperature and time of reaction these changes induced the formation of three different morphologies irregular nanoplates and microsized ellipsoid superstructures with distinct magnetic behaviors as it can be observed in fig 2 the irregular hematite nanoparticles showed superparamagnetism at room temperature with low coercivity hc and remanence hr both nanoplates and ellipsoid shaped hematite exhibited changes in magnetic behavior the increase of the coercivity in the nanoplates was attributed to the shape anisotropy while in the ellipsoid structure it was ascribed to the formation of multi domains mcgrath et al 2017 have studied the evolution in size and shape of iron nanoparticles after successive growth reactions the synthetic protocol based on seed mediated growth showed an increase in size after each growth stage and shape evolution leading to a cubic morphology the magnetic behavior was gradually tuned from superparamagnetic to ferromagnetic and the ms varied in the range from 40 emu g 1 to 176 emu g 1 as the size of nanoparticles increased from 7 to 13 nm these results demonstrated the high sensitivity of magnetic properties to variation in the crystallite size the magnetic behavior is one of the main advantages when using mions in water treatment allowing their separation and recovery from the contaminated medium via an external magnetic field more importantly the presence of mions with superparamagnetic behavior is highly beneficial to the reusability of the catalyst or sorbent because after the removal of the external magnetic field they are easily dispersed in the medium preserving their stability in this sense the control and evaluation of these properties before and during usage should be properly investigated the size and shape of mions also affect the adsorption and catalytic catalytic selectivity properties of nanoparticles as the chemical processes of adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis are performed on the surface of the catalyst nanoparticle catalysts often provide a much higher surface to volume ratio and usually adsorption efficiency and catalytic activity are improved with increasing specific surface area ssa however a more in depth analysis may involve the effect of chemistry and the structure of the surface changes in size affect the coordination number of surface atoms and the electronic state of the nanoparticle and therefore the adsorption and activation energy barriers for the adsorption process also a catalyst nanoparticle with a specific shape typically exposes one or more crystallographic surfaces with a specific coordination environment and electronic state resulting in a shape dependent adsorptive catalytic performance cao et al 2016 for example hou et al 2020 evaluated the role of particle size and surface chemistry characteristics for the removal of phosphates from wastewater using sorption methods nanometer sized magnetite with larger pore volume higher surface area and surface functional groups compared to micrometer sized fe3o4 presented higher adsorption of kh2po4 which was associated with its larger surface area moreover it was stated that the amount of functional groups at the surface also affects the adsorption mechanism of phosphate to magnetite by influencing the formation of outer sphere complexes for micro fe3o4 and inner sphere complexes for nano fe3o4 regarding morphology effects on catalytic activity magnetite samples synthesized with different shapes microcube c nanosphere s and porous nanorod r in comparison to a commercial product com uniform round like were evaluated for mineralization of phenol based on fenton reactions the different morphologies exhibited different surface areas c 2 8 m2 g 1 s 10 9 m2 g 1 r 24 7 m2 g 1 com 0 5 mg 1 and crystal sizes c 65 nm s 42 nm r 37 nm com 79 nm the molar ratio of fe ii fe iii at the surface was similar for the synthesized materials c r s 0 5 and in agreement with the theoretical value of fe3o4 the magnetite obtained from commercial product presented fe ii fe iii of 0 25 lower than the theoretical value despite its composition based on pure magnetite the degradation activity trend obtained was r s c com which clearly indicated that a larger surface area was beneficial to the reaction the excellent catalytic performance of porous nanorods was associated with the overall balance of its physical properties small crystal size large surface area and high fe ii fe iii ratio moreover the sample of porous nanorods was conveniently separated recovered from the reaction mixture via an external magnetic field and re used with degradation efficiencies higher than 90 hou et al 2014 4 iron oxide based systems for water treatment technology the global demand for clean water is increasing at a fast pace due to population growth and industrialization because conventional chemical methods have shown to be only partially effective time consuming and sometimes unable to fulfill the modern requirements of energy saving and environmental sustainability there is a growing demand for new technologies that can efficiently remove contaminants from water corsi et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 in recent years the use of mions has been widely investigated for the removal of pollutants in water as reported in interesting reviews das et al 2017 hao et al 2018 simeonidis et al 2016 such interest in iron oxides can be mainly attributed to their natural abundance low cost interesting chemistry and magnetic properties which are influenced by their crystalline structure jolivet et al 2004 usually two types of technologies are employed for water treatment adsorption and degradation technologies while the first one uses mions as a nanosorbent for improving the removal efficiency the second makes its use as a catalyst to mineralize or to convert contaminants into inert products nonetheless in many applications it is observed the combination of both processes xu et al 2012a 4 1 adsorption iron oxides based systems are of special interest as nanosized sorbents because in addition to the very high surface area strong adsorption capability and reasonable cost they also possess magnetic properties that enable ease separation and recovery khandare and mukherjee 2019 several papers describe the use of bare magnetic nanoparticles with different morphologies as nanosorbents of chromium and dyes e g congo red reactive orange and reactive yellow as summarized by santhosh et al 2018 the adsorption capacities ranged from 17 up to 160 mg g 1 depending mostly on the specific surface area higher surface area means a larger number of adsorption sites and ph as it affects both the adsorbent and adsorbate surface charges favoring attraction or repulsion between the entities however as previously discussed their poor colloidal stability associated with magnetic forces and surface energy can lead to aggregation of nanoparticles which may hamper its application as sorbents to overcome this drawback these nanoparticles can be immobilized onto a support structure or stabilized by surface coatings developing advanced functional nanostructures maksoud et al 2020 wang et al 2020 layered graphite based nanostructures carbon nanotubes graphene and graphene oxide sheets have been used as solid support for iron oxide nanoparticles in functional nanomaterials these carbonaceous materials present unique properties including large external surface area and functional groups for adsorption incorporated during synthesis or after surface modification treatments that enable the removal of inorganic and organic pollutants from aqueous solutions however they are not easily separated from the liquid medium in hybrid nanostructures the results indicated the possibility of developing a synergetic adsorptive effect between carbon based and iron oxide that outperforms both of its individual building blocks for water remediation maksoud et al 2020 santhosh et al 2018 verdugo et al 2016 wang et al 2020 for example verdugo et al 2016 reported the synthesis of hematite nanoparticles decorated on the multi walled carbon nanotube mwcnt surfaces for use as a hybrid sorbent nanocomposite the results showed that the capacity of this supported α fe2o3 nanoparticles for cu ii and cro4 2 removal from aqueous suspensions at neutral ph was higher even 19 fold for cu ii than the performance of freely suspended nanoparticles besides graphene based materials other carbonaceous nanomaterials have been reported as promising sorbents after modification with iron oxides li et al 2019 have described the production of activated carbon coated hematite nanoparticles for increasing cr iv adsorption capacity although activated carbon ac possesses a porous structure and numerous functional i e hydroxyl carboxyl groups it presented a poor adsorption capability for cr iv because both carboxylate groups and chromate ions are negatively charged in the aqueous medium the functionalization of ac surface with nanosized α fe2o3 showed 3 times higher efficiency of adsorption due to electrostatic attraction forces between the toxic metal ions and the iron oxide nanoparticles nanocomposites of iron oxide with different inorganic and organic materials were also designed in order to endow chemical stability in a wide ph range and improve adsorption capabilities maksoud et al 2020 wang et al 2020 guivar et al 2017 have demonstrated distinct adsorption capabilities of hybrid nanomaterials of maghemite nanoparticles and silica mesoporous silica and hydroxyapatite and some organic compounds these materials not only prevented the agglomeration of maghemite nanoparticles but also changed the structural magnetic and structural properties that influence the uptake of cu ii and pb ii species based on electrostatic interactions and cation exchange natural and synthetic polymers frequently applied as capping agents or macromolecular matrices have also been described for tailoring adsorption properties of iron oxides while also providing chemical stability of nanoparticulate systems and functionalizing agents carboxymethylcellulose cmc a water soluble biopolymer derived from cellulose the most abundant polysaccharide in the earth has gained interest as a greener stabilizing and functionalization agent for the preparation of mions nanohybrids for several advanced biomedical and environmental applications fan et al 2019 leonel et al 2019 for example fan et al 2019 have reported the use of cmc immobilized fe3o4 nanoparticles as a highly efficient adsorbent system for pb ii removal the cellulose derivative behaved as a ligand avoiding aggregation and enhancing magnetite nanoparticle dispersibility moreover the presence of hydroxyl oh and carboxyl groups cooh in the polymer structure provides water solubility in a wide range of ph and plentiful o donating sites which have a powerful complexation capability for heavy metals the carboxymethylcellulose magnetite nanoparticles thus exhibited better adsorption ability and a faster rate of contaminant removal than bare fe3o4 nanoparticles another biopolymer which has attracted attention as a potent low cost biosorbent for water pollutants is chitosan cs a water soluble chitin derivative under acidic conditions ph 6 the high content of amino r nh2 and hydroxyl oh functional groups has the ability to bind to metallic cations and anions as reported by several studies gomez maldonado et al 2019 pooresmaeil and namazi 2020 polydopamine pda is originated by the self polymerization of dopamine under alkaline conditions at room temperature it is an attractive polymer due to its chemical structure that includes amine catechol and imine as functional groups these species provide a robust interfacial binding between the ligand and the nanoparticle through intermolecular interactions and covalent bonds that is the reason why they have been used as a coating in a variety of organic and inorganic surfaces including metal oxides besides pda coating offers conditions for further surface modification liu et al 2014b some studies have reported that the hydrophilicity of polydopamine can heighten the proximity between adsorbent and water contaminants due to the enhancement of the dispersibility of pda fe3o4 in aqueous media capriotti et al 2016 wang and deng 2016 polyvinyl alcohol pva is another class of synthetic polymer with hydrophilic and suitable biocompatible characteristics which can be tuned by the degree of hydrolysis in the chain mansur et al 2008 the main feature of pva that has been explored recently is its ability to be transformed into hydrogels with specific properties as the exceptional capacity to form films good processability and chemical resistivity bohara et al 2016 yang et al 2018 have reported the synthesis of prussian blue embedded magnetically responsive hydrogel for the removal of radioactive 137cs from water in particular the hydroxyl groups existing in the polymeric structure adsorbed iron species to form a homogeneous three dimensional structure in a mixed solution containing prussian blue pb and then acted as a stabilizing agent of iron oxide nanoparticles fig 3 the results showed the excellent potential of pva in creating hydrogel beads for the removal of 137cs by the adsorption process a combination of synthetic with natural polymers was also designed to acquire a novel set of properties in comparison with those of the single components simionescu and ivanov 2016 hydrogel nanocomposites aiming at the absorption of cationic dyes were proposed by sakai and teramoto 2018 where the matrix for the production of magnetite nanoparticles was composed of a polymer composite consisting of pva and k carrageenan that is a sulfated polysaccharide oso3 in this study the addition of the biopolymer had the function of improving the ionic behavior of pva hydrogels after obtaining the magnetic gel like nanocomposite the structure was stretched to change the morphology and distribution of magnetite in the polymer gel creating a magnetically anisotropic hybrid engineered soft material recently the development of integrated adsorption systems with multifunctionalities has been adopted as a novel approach for water decontamination treatment zhang et al 2016 prepared multifaceted magnetic nanoadsorbents composed of a magnetite core surrounded by pei that exhibited excellent performances of adsorption of heavy metals and disinfection of pathogens e g escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis at the same time the disinfection mechanism was ascribed to the very high frequency of collision of nanosized particles and bacteria associated with the brownian motion in water resulting in a high disinfection efficiency and fast disinfection kinetics cs is also applied in the development of water disinfection systems due to its well established antibacterial properties credited to the interactions of negatively charged groups present on the cell wall by the positively charged amino groups leading to the disruption of bacterial cell walls aravamudhan et al 2014 table 5 summarizes recent examples of iron oxide based adsorbents used for environmental remediation of pollutants in water 4 2 catalysis regarding water remediation by the degradation of pollutants iron oxide nanoparticles can play a pivotal role as catalysts in advanced oxidation processes aop aops are an enticing wastewater treatment alternative that involves the in situ generation of strongly reactive species to oxidize in a non selective way toxic pollutants under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure hodges et al 2018 munoz et al 2015 by employing aops organic molecules can be completely mineralized or partially oxidated to non toxic products as the complete mineralization to co2 and h2o can be costly in practice these processes focus on achieving a combination of both mineralization and partial oxidation hodges et al 2018 remarkable advantages of aops are that they neither produce a large quantity of hazardous sludge nor transfer contaminants from one to the other phase like adsorption and other separation methods which normally require further treatment bello et al 2019 aops are a general classification which consists of numerous techniques for the production of reactive oxygen species ros one of the most powerful ros is the hydroxyl radical ho it has a much stronger oxidation capacity e0 2 80 v than other traditional oxidizing species such as h2o2 e0 1 77 v or o3 e0 2 07 v arimi et al 2020 munoz et al 2015 the next sections will cover based on the literature review some of the recent progress of the most significant methods for the removal of pollutants from water based on advanced oxidative processes 4 2 1 photocatalysis essentially photocatalysis is a process in which ros species are generated by the formation of an electron hole pair in a semiconductor upon photoactivation the holes h and electrons e migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst where the holes form hydroxyl radicals ho after oxidation of water molecules and the electrons reduce the dissolved oxygen for producing superoxide radical o2 some iron oxides behave as semiconductors although their use presents some drawbacks due to the fast recombination of electron hole pair and low separation efficiency kiwi and rtimi 2021 the first alternative to obtain more effective charge separation of electrons and holes and also reduce the recombination rate is by employing other semiconductors with different energy levels forming composite structures several oxides tio2 sro2 ag2o nitio3 wo3 bismuth oxyhalides biocl biobr and bioi and other semiconductor materials have been used to produce p n and n n heterojunctions that were effective in improving photocatalytic activity of fe2o3 in many applications for instance the degradation of dyes and pharmaceuticals as well as the reduction of metals with improved photodegradation observed for the composite in comparison to individual building blocks as shown by zhang et al 2015 the development of a nanofiber based on α fe2o3 nitio3 catalyst was able to enhance the decolorization 90 for rhodamine b rhb under visible light irradiation xenon lamp 300 w compared with the bare fe2o3 55 and nitio3 59 catalysts composites involving hematite and carbonaceous materials were also developed with enhanced photocatalytic activity as well as extended to ternary composites mohamed 2019 has explored the functionalities of a novel ternary α fe2o3 graphene oxide go wo3 nanocomposite for enhancing solar light photocatalysis to degrade methylene blue mb and crystal violet cv used as model water contaminants the increase in the photocatalytic performance was attributed to the smart design of suppression of e h pair recombination pathways where the electrons generated in the conduction band of wo3 were transferred through the go matrix and were recombined with the holes in the valence band of hematite fig 4 santhosh et al 2018 summarized several composite systems involving photocatalysis applications of hematite including composition light source and time or irradiation degradation efficiency of composite and individual semiconductors another interesting approach to improve the photocatalyst behavior of iron oxide is the doping of nanoparticles with metal and non metal elements the introduction of impurity states within the bandgap not only enhances the optical activity of iron oxide nanoparticles by narrowing the energy bandgap but also can expand the absorption to visible regions for example satheesh et al 2014 have investigated the photocatalytic activity of cu doped hematite nanoparticles under visible light to degrade acid red 27 ar 27 dye the results revealed a higher photocatalytic capability of cu α fe2o3 compared with undoped α fe2o3 it was suggested that the cu2 species behave as a shallow trap for both electrons and holes generated by irradiation and hamper the recombination of charge carriers as a consequence more reactive species o2 and ho were generated promoting the degradation of the ar 27 dye although such approaches can boost performance they also incorporate complexity and increased cost to the hybrid system preparation there is therefore an ever growing demand for optimizing synthetic routes and developing nanostructured materials with better functionalities at feasible costs zhu et al 2018 4 2 2 fenton and fenton like processes conventionally the fenton process involves the decomposition of h2o2 to generate oh radicals ho through catalytic reaction with ferrous ions fe2 according to eq 3 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 the ho can attack organic contaminants generating an organic radical r which undergoes a sequence of chemical transformations generating different oxidation products the fe ii species can be regenerated in an effective cyclic mechanism through fenton like reactions which consist of the reduction of the resulting ferric ions by the excess of h2o2 eq 4 there also occurs the formation of hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 that can oxidize organic pollutants but with less sensitivity than ho because they have weaker oxidation capacity e0 1 65 v babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o 4 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h they have been extensively investigated for the removal of various pollutants in water treatment such as pharmaceuticals textiles and chemical pesticides buthiyappan et al 2015 mirzaei et al 2017 take into consideration that these reactions are affected by some parameters including ph the concentration of h2o2 and catalyst temperature and pollutant concentration the systematic study of these variables is of utmost importance to enhance the catalytic properties of the system bello et al 2019 the ph of the medium is one of the most critical parameters for effective wastewater treatment some studies have reported that ho production is efficient when the ph is in the range of 2 8 3 5 arimi et al 2020 hodges et al 2018 under acidic conditions fe ii and fe iii species can preserve their catalytic capability while higher ph causes the precipitation of ferric ions as iron hydroxide bello et al 2019 however studies showed that it is possible to design magnetic iron based advanced nanosystems with suitable activity in neutral and even in alkaline ph conditions by the combination of magnetite nanoparticles with carbon based materials wang et al 2016b have demonstrated that fe3o4 sio2 c nanocomposite could be carried out as a high performance catalyst for the removal of mb at the ph range from 3 5 to 9 5 it benefits from efficacious electron transfer on the addition of carbonaceous materials which favors the oxidation of mb it was also suggested that the chelation of fe ii fe iii species with hydroxyl groups present on the surface of sio2 could facilitate the catalytic capability of magnetite enlarging the ph range of the metal oxide application more recently song et al 2019 have produced a nanohybrid composed of fe3o4 nanoparticles associated with ultrasmall graphene oxide for acting as fenton like agents in mb degradation the high efficiency of the system was attributed once more to the specific electron transfer between the go and magnetite nanoparticles in addition the abundance of active sites on the go surface due to the ultrasmall size boosted the catalytic activity which was evaluated at different ph another pivotal parameter that plays an important role in the catalytic activity is fenton s reactants the concentration of hydrogen peroxide dictates the potential for ho generation insufficient h2o2 concentration can lead to a deficiency of radicals generation which might result in a decrease of pollutant oxidation wang et al 2016a on the other hand an excess concentration of h2o2 can induce a scavenge effect according to eq 5 contributing to the decrease in the treatment efficiency as well associated with the weaker oxidation capacity of hydroperoxyl radicals babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 mirzaei et al 2017 hence large quantities of oxidants are not recommended besides the presence of h2o2 is harmful to plenty of organisms and can affect the degradation efficiency in case of use in fenton reactions as a previous treatment to biological oxidation in this sense the concentration of h2o2 should be adjusted in such a way that the total amount is consumed during the reaction babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 5 h 2 o 2 aq h o h 2 o l h o 2 in the same way fe ii catalyst concentration should be optimized to ensure ideal hydroxyl radical production and avoid scavenging effect supposing an excess amount of ferrous ions arimi et al 2020 babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 eq 6 6 f e 2 aq h o f e 3 aq o h aq neamtu et al 2018 have investigated the effect of h2o2 concentration and catalyst dosage on the efficiency of bisphenol a pba degradation through the fenton like process using magnetite nanoparticles stabilized by peg polyethylene glycol their study tested two different concentrations of h2o2 10 mmol l 1 and 20 mmol l 1 and catalyst 1 0 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 the results showed that the most efficient removal of bpa 15 minutes to the complete degradation was achieved with 1 0 g l 1 of catalyst in the presence of 10 mmol l 1 of oxidant an increase in h2o2 concentration did not cause any significant improvement in the process efficiency while an increase in catalyst dosage decreased the effectiveness probably due to the blocking of available surface active sites reducing pollutant degradation the effect of temperature on the contaminant degradation rate is a controversial issue yet some studies have demonstrated that high temperatures adversely affect the fenton reactions due to the potential decomposition of h2o2 into h2o and o2 conversely recent studies have shown that high temperatures in the range of 40 c to 90 c favor the oxidation rate which enhances the generation of ho and improves therefore the fenton reactions however ambient conditions can securely be used with suitable efficiency in this process babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 bello et al 2019 the effect of increasing the concentration of the contaminant has been proven to decrease the removal efficiency while maintaining constant other parameters such as the concentration of the catalyst it occurs mainly because of two reasons higher pollutant concentrations demand higher concentrations of radicals and a higher number of active sites which can become limited when the dosage of pollutants is too high to this end these circumstances indicate that the initial contaminant concentration is responsible for determining the optimum fenton s reactants concentration to ensure pronounced reactivity and effective water treatment mirzaei et al 2017 stability re use and environmental aspects should also be examined xu and wang 2012 have investigated the use of magnetite nanoparticles as a catalyst for the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol although they achieved satisfactory results in terms of pollutant conversion they pointed out the importance to better understand the loss of activity after successive uses of the nanoparticles besides some studies have been characterized by making use of large amounts of hydrogen peroxide ferroudj et al 2013 sun et al 2013 which is a critical concern in terms of process economy and environmental toxicity sun et al 2013 according to the literature hodges et al 2018 further enhancing heterogeneous fenton processes can be obtained through the combination of distinct aops for example with additional input of light photo fenton ultrasound sono fenton and electricity electro fenton which will be concisely presented in the next sections because the comprehensive coverage is beyond the scope of this review 4 2 3 photo fenton processes the photo fenton reactions comprise the combination of fenton reagents and irradiation for producing additional ho by photo reduction of ferric to ferrous ions eq 7 combined with hydrogen peroxide photolysis eq 8 han et al 2020 7 fe oh 2 aq h ν f e 2 aq h o h aq 8 h 2 o 2 aq h ν 2 h o in these processes the role of photochemistry is to provide energy making use of ultraviolet uv or visible light to enhance the catalytic activity of the system and also to reduce the catalyst loading pouran et al 2014 han et al 2020 have investigated the efficiency of a photo fenton process using a low concentration of fenton reactants to degrade tetracycline and oxytetracycline their results evidenced that the uv light assisted fenton reaction uv h2o2 fe2 was the most powerful way to remove the contaminants from water compared to the h2o2 uv and uv h2o2 processes even though it was not able to fully mineralized the antibiotics therefore the transformation products were identified and their toxicity was assessed using a bacteria model to determine the potential toxicity effects of the by products a serious concern that has received increased attention in most cases of heterogeneous photo fenton processes uv irradiation is chosen to stimulate the photoreduction of fe3 to fe2 however it has some practical limitations as uv light represents only 3 5 of the solar light energy and the production of an artificial uv apparatus usually consume a large amount of energy it is therefore highly cost effective to have a system in which visible light is employed to drive photoreactions liu et al 2014a iron oxides such as hematite can efficiently absorb visible light due to its electronic band structure however the photocatalytic activity is restricted because the e h pairs present fast recombination santhosh et al 2018 a valuable strategy used for charge separation is the photo fenton oxidation by employing semiconductors with wide bandgap such as tio2 hassan et al 2016 have demonstrated the photocatalytic mechanism in which fe2o3 tio2 nanocomposite was used to degrade mo under visible light irradiation it was based on the transference of excited electrons to the conduction band of tio2 to fe2o3 leading to the reduction of fe iii to fe ii in the presence of h2o2 these generated fe iii species could produce ho the hole carriers h created in the valence band of tio2 also produced ho leading to the oxidation of mo the established cycling system inhibited the electron hole recombination improving the catalytic activity moreover it was observed a much higher removal efficiency by fe3o4 tio2 h2o2 nanoparticles under irradiation of visible light 98 after 60 min compared to the following systems tio2 no removal after 180 min h2o2 8 after 180 min tio2 h2o2 70 after 180 min and fe3o4 tio2 75 after 180 min which was ascribed to the effect heterogeneous photo fenton reaction photo fenton processes have also attracted interest in water disinfection some studies have been described the use of mild conditions and a low concentration of reagents to induce the death of a great number of microorganisms including bacteria and viruses mosteo et al 2020 o dowd and pillai 2020 ruales lonfat et al 2015 showed that after introducing solar light the catalytic activity of different iron oxides i e hematite wüstite and magnetite was notably enhanced causing bacterial inactivation at neutral ph however the occurrence of the photo fenton process at neutral or near neutral ph is still controversial as far as the mechanism of bacterial disinfection is not well understood and should be more investigated including different parameters e g the concentration of h2o2 light irradiance temperature 4 2 4 electrochemical processes among the electricity driven aops e aops electrochemical oxidation has been widely investigated for water remediation hodges et al 2018 the mineralization of contaminants can occur by direct electron transfer at the surface of the electrode anodic oxidation or by indirect electro oxidation responsible for the generation of powerful oxidants arimi et al 2020 buthiyappan et al 2015 although this process presents some benefits including versatility facile operation flexibility to adapt to variations in the flow rate and influent water composition concerns about the formation of toxic byproducts cost and performance of the electrodes can hamper its applications radjenovic and sedlak 2015 magnetic iron oxides possess catalytic and electrocatalytic properties that can promote fast electron transfer between the electrode and redox sites located on molecules in this sense several composite materials incorporating magnetic particles have been developed as electrodes to perform an electrocatalytic activity kudr et al 2018 as an example ribeiro et al 2017 produced nanotechnology based electrodes using the layer by layer technique comprising 4 layers of cationic poly diallyl dimethylammonium hydrochloride anionic carbon nanotubes cationic iron oxide nanoparticles and anionic carbon nanotubes deposited onto ito indium doped tin oxide substrates this electrode was used for electrochemical oxidation of salicylic acid molecules for sensing and quantification of this drug metabolite that is an environmental contaminant however the electro fenton process is one of the most applied e aops in this process electrons are used as reagents to produce in situ at least one constituent for the fenton reaction where the following alternatives are feasible to take place generation of h2o2 at the cathode and o2 at the anode while fe2 catalyst is added production of h2 at the cathode and fe2 solution at a sacrificial iron anode while h2o2 is externally added generation of h2o2 at the cathode and fe2 solution at a sacrificial iron anode the last case does not require any addition of chemicals which makes the process simple to perform the continuous in situ generation of hydrogen peroxide eliminates the problems associated with its transport and storage however the drawback of this technique is the production of an iron hydroxide sludge that needs to be disposed of accordingly a promising alternative to avoid the release of ferrous sludge is the use of membranes muddemann et al 2019 heterogeneous electro fenton has been developed to overcome the challenges of homogeneous electro fenton such as narrow ph range reusability of the catalyst after several consecutive cycles laborious separation from the treated solution as well as the generation of large quantities of ferric iron sludge ganiyu 2016 heterogeneous electro fenton can be categorized into two groups catalyst impregnated electrode and those with the solid catalyst addition in solution in a sophisticated study geraldino et al 2020 have designed an electro fenton system composed of a gas diffusion electrode improved with reduced graphene oxide rgo and reinforced with the fe3o4 go catalyst aiming at degrading textile wastewater the utilization of a gas diffusion electrode with rgo enabled the increase in the production of h2o2 while the incorporation of go into magnetite nanoparticles was responsible for enhancing the active sites available for charge transfer and increasing the composite performance due to the outstanding properties of go as high electrical and thermal conductivities the results demonstrated the high efficiency of the electron fenton system in degrading textile wastewater and also the effectiveness of the catalyst reusability the catalyst modified with go could be used in ten successive cycles with only a 5 6 loss of efficiency whereas the unmodified magnetite evidenced a gradual decrease reaching 42 loss of efficiency after the third cycle in another study yuan et al 2020 three dimensional 3d electrodes impregnated with hematite and powdered activated carbon α fe2o3 pac were produced for the degradation of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in simulated wastewater the 3d electrodes have drawn wide attention because they exhibit a larger specific surface area and higher conversion rate compared to the traditional two dimensional electrodes as a result they can adsorb contaminants improve conductivity and provide more active sites for catalytic reactions thereby enhancing the removal efficiency the degradation efficiency of ammonium nitrogen was 95 3 from the simulated wastewater under the optimal conditions in the 3d system but only 34 7 in the 2d system after treatment for 20 minutes heterogeneous electro fenton processes can also employ the catalyst in solution to enable the redox reactions görmez et al 2019 have investigated the degradation of two antibiotics chloramphenicol and metronidazole by an electro fenton technique using a composite graphene oxide fe3o4 as a catalyst the results showed that the use of a catalyst concentration of 0 5 g l 1 increased the degradation rate by 16 compared to a homogeneous process in which fe2 salt was used as a catalyst apart from its effectiveness in degrading the contaminants this composite exhibits potential reusability due to the low iron release 5 after 4 successive runs in another case of heterogeneous electro fenton application with the use of magnetite nanoparticles added in the solution for mineralization of acid red 18 high fe ions leaching of 67 at 100 ma of current was observed this effect indicated that homogeneous fenton reaction played an important role in the process and the combination of both activities of the ions species and the solid catalyst governed the overall catalytic activity hafaiedh et al 2018 the leaching of the catalyst into the aqueous phase is one parameter intimately associated with their stability thus it should be diminished to avoid an excess of these species in the medium that cause loss of solid activity in the long term and all of the disadvantages associated with homogeneous catalysis high cost low efficiency generation of iron sludge no re use of catalyst 4 2 5 alternative advanced oxidation processes as an alternative to the fenton processes the idea of activating different oxidants to produce strongly reactive radicals have driven the pursuit of other species such as ozone and sulfates ozonation has been recognized as a promising process for water remediation usually two pathways can be used to degrade pollutants direct oxidation molecular o3 due to its high potential of oxidation or by forming ho radicals via complex chain reactions buthiyappan et al 2015 because the direct oxidation of o3 is a selective procedure it results in partial mineralization with low rates additionally the low solubility of ozone in aqueous solution hampers its effective use yu et al 2020 therefore many studies have employed catalysts to accelerate ozone decomposition and ros generation chen and wang 2019 have used a fe3o4 co3o4 composite in the catalytic ozonation of sulfamethoxazole smx which was responsible for the enhancement of 60 in the mineralization of the pollutant this result was ascribed to the increase in the surface area and reactive sites provided by the catalyst which could boost the reaction between o3 smx and the generation of free radicals different parameters were evaluated including ph the concentration of the catalyst ozone and contaminant in order to define the better catalytic activity and how the reaction mechanisms are influenced by these parameters another promising alternative to fenton and ozonation processes are sulfate radical based aops because the main oxidants i e persulfates ps and peroxymonosulfate pms often used to generate these radicals are considered less expensive and more stable compared to both hydrogen peroxide and ozone for water purification hodges et al 2018 moreover sulfate radicals exhibit some advantages over ho such as similar or even stronger oxidation potential e0 2 5 3 1 v wide operating ph range from 2 to 8 solubility stability in water and environmentally benign process xiao et al 2020 iron oxide nanoparticles are considered efficient in activating peroxygen to produce sulfate radicals so4 and some studies have investigated this potential for example jegadeesan et al 2019 have reported the use of feo α fe2o3 biosynthesized nanoparticles to activate ps and pms for the degradation of congo red their results showed that the degradation efficiencies of the systems composed of catalysts and oxidants were significantly higher than both pristine iron nanoparticles and ps or pms suggesting the effectiveness of the fe nanoparticles activated oxidant system to existing ho based aops similarly zhao et al 2015 have shown the effective removal of p nitroaniline from water by the persulfate fe3o4 nanoparticles process after 300 minutes of reaction the contaminant removal rate was almost 100 after successive cycles however the degradation efficiency was progressively decreased reaching only 15 3 after the fifth cycle this result was explained by the oxidation of fe2 to fe3 on the surface of magnetite after persulfate activation and draw attention to the need for improvements in the reusability of the catalyst in successive runs a new approach to activate persulfate was described by wang et al 2019 where it was demonstrated the use of visible light for ps activated water disinfection the catalyst free technique provides a cost effective and sustainable bacteria inactivation since it does not require a high cost activating agent and catalyst recycling the oxidation of organic pollutants by ultrasound us has gained considerable attention the application of us waves in an aqueous medium can lead to the dissociation of water molecules into ho which is induced by high temperatures and high pressures when cavitation processes take place babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 then the pollutants can be oxidized by the radical species although ultrasound irradiation shows great potential in breaking down wastewater pollutants achieving total mineralization is unrealistic and researches are focused on the incorporation of us in different aops to increase the decomposition rate buthiyappan et al 2015 a large number of studies that cover hybrid methods as us o3 us fenton us h2o2 to improve the extent of mineralization can be found in the literature babuponnusami and muthukumar 2014 moradi et al 2020 particularly an interesting work hassani et al 2018 reported the application of a heterogeneous sono fenton process using fe3o4 nanoparticles for the removal of the cationic dye violet 10 as expected the association of both aops contributed to the enhancement of radicals generation under acid conditions and consequently to dye degradation however the authors highlighted the importance of identifying the by products formed during the processes and their potential risks in the environment considering that the dye was not fully mineralized table 6 summarizes diverse examples of engineered nanostructures based on iron oxides for environmental applications through distinct aops 4 3 recovery of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles one important reason for using iron oxide nanoparticles in water remediation is their magnetic behavior that allows separation recovery re use from the contaminated system in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field however most works using mions are carried out at the bench scale and utilize handheld magnets for magnetic separation that is not feasible when treating large volumes of water or continuous flows baresel et al 2019 powell et al 2020 recently the magnetic capture of nanosorbents catalytic has been examined for use in larger scale water treatment some devices are being studied to overcome the inability to separate nanoparticles from flowing water based on the green technology of high gradient magnetic separation hgms baresel et al 2019 powell et al 2020 these new technologies for water treatment try to amalgamate separation and recovery efficiencies to be envisaged as a feasible alternative integrated into real world water remediation and encourage the safe use of magnetic nanomaterials by ensuring nanoparticle concentrations and or dissolved species below the regulatory limits for water for example for the united states environmental protection agency epa iron total content is considered a secondary contaminant with a total limit below 0 3 mg l 1 for drinking water according to table 6 considering the applications for degradation of pollutants the amount of nanomaterials used for catalysis varied in a wide range from 2 9 mg l 1 up to 1 5 g l 1 these values are much higher than the limit because they consider not only the iron mass but the whole nanoparticle nanocomposite systems that are also expected to be recovered from the medium by an external magnetic field in this sense the stability of the nanosystem in the medium is not only desired for allowing several cycles of use but also to guarantee that the degradation process is mainly heterogeneous as previously discussed moreover it should avoid reduce the contamination of the medium by iron species considering that fe leaching is a drawback still found in some applications considering the work of song et al 2016 that used the smallest amount of catalyst 2 9 mg l 1 table 6 after 2 h one cycle of degradation the leached fe was 24 µg l 1 below the epa regulation however concentrations of approximately 7 mg l 1 were detected in the solution by ferroudj et al 2013 after one cycle of 4 h although this value corresponded only to 0 25 of the material added confirming the required stability and possibility of reusability of the catalyst this concentration is higher than the regulatory values and therefore iron ions also need to be separated from treated water as potential contaminants 5 nanotoxicity and environmental risks 5 1 nano bio interactions and risks of iron oxide engineered nanoparticles the growing popularity of engineered iron oxide based nanomaterials has heightened concerns regarding their interactions with biotic and abiotic surrounding environments and the potential effects on aquatic ecosystems upon release and exposure he et al 2015 lei et al 2018 albeit often considered non toxic and unharmful to the environment that is not necessarily true several characteristics of iron oxide nanoparticles play a pivotal role in their properties which affect the overall behavior of colloidal nanoparticles in the water medium and surrounding ecosystems carvalho et al 2019 leonel et al 2019 as soon as the nanoparticles nps are released in the natural environment interactions occur between the nanomaterial and environmental interface these interactions at the nanoscale level are responsible for changing the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles due to various transformation processes which eventually modify their fate and potential ecological and biological toxicity he et al 2015 thus the potential toxicity of nps in natural environments must be assessed bearing in mind the processes of their transformation in these systems rather than considering only their properties particularly in aquatic systems key transformations include agglomeration adsorption dissolution and oxidation reduction reactions fig 5 overall the reactivity and mobility of nanoparticles in the environment are determined by their state of aggregation which means that less agglomeration leads to more accessible sites for interactions and slow sedimentation rate of nps on a solid surface resulting in enhanced reactivity bioavailability and eventually toxicity he et al 2015 aggregation of nps with organic matter heteroaggregation or with themselves homoaggregation occurs spontaneously to reduce their high surface energy lei et al 2018 several factors including ph surface coating ionic strength natural organic matter and temperature can significantly affect the behavior of nanoparticles as aggregates or particulates in the system abbas et al 2020 essentially solution ph governs the particle s surface charge or zeta potential zp which is crucial for the stability of the dispersion theoretically the farther the ph is from the point of zero charge pzc of the nps the higher the aqueous stability of the colloidal system will be due to the electrostatic repulsion lei et al 2018 usually colloidal nanoparticles are extremely unstable and therefore tend to form agglomerates at zp values below 30 mv mansur et al 2017 surface coatings are often used to stabilize nps in solution because they possess a large amount of surface functional groups consequently ph changes can affect the behavior of coated nanomaterials due to the protonation and deprotonation of these groups i e ph sensitive which in turn determine the balance of surface charges abbas et al 2020 in this manner different ligands can improve or worsen the stability of nanoparticles favoring or hindering their aggregation in natural environments tombácz et al 2013 have studied the influence of different organic acid coatings citric acid gallic acid poly acrylic acid poly acrylic co maleic acid and humic acid on the stability of fe3o4 nanoparticles their results showed that these ligands could either increase or decrease the stabilization of magnetite nanoparticles in natural waters depending on ph salinity i e dissolved salt content and organic concentration ionic strength is also regulates the stability of nanoparticles in colloidal aqueous systems at a given ph an increase in is can compress the electrical double layer thereby reducing the zeta potential this process leads to a rapid agglomeration of nps insofar as the electrostatic repulsion between the particles is overcome by attractive interactions vikesland et al 2016 have demonstrated that the particle concentration ph and ionic strength influence the aggregation and sedimentation behavior of magnetite nanoclusters chekli et al 2015 have likewise shown that the aggregate structure of nanoparticles is dependent on these physicochemical characteristics of the medium which is a significant factor in determining their fate in aquatic environments adsorption is one of the utmost important interactions between natural organic matter nom and nps that play a vital role in the stability of engineered nanomaterials nom possesses a macromolecular nature which can contribute to the stability of iron based nanoparticles in a similar way to polymeric ligands modifying the particle charge surface and providing electrostatic and steric repulsions however it can also favor aggregation depending on environmental conditions e g ph and is and the properties of the nanoparticles pzc which can destabilize the system abbas et al 2020 iron oxide based nps once released in natural water bodies and the environment can also interact with a variety of living organisms these nano bio interactions can trigger chemical transformations such as oxidation reduction and sulfidation reactions mediated by biological entities that can alter both the composition and behavior of the nps in the environment lei et al 2018 furthermore despite often neglected or underestimated these nanostructured particles may have potential cytotoxic effects on the living organisms either by the generation of ros metal ion release or cellular uptake lei et al 2018 although relevant the discussion of cytotoxic mechanisms is a complex and vast topic not fully understood yet and therefore it is beyond the scope of this study a more comprehensive analysis of this theme will certainly be required in future researches 5 2 assessment of in vitro nanotoxicity despite being generally considered safe and biocompatible mostly based on cell viability test results in vitro the potential toxicity of mions should not be disregarded the toxicity is significantly influenced by the chemical composition nanoparticle concentration crystal phase size shape surface coating time exposure and cell type among other factors it is therefore crucial to comprehensively assess the in vitro toxicity of iron oxide based materials prior to their introduction into the natural environment buzea and pacheco 2019 carvalho et al 2019 valdiglesias et al 2016 to date oxidative stress is the most broadly accepted mechanism of cytotoxicity for iron based nanomaterials it is principally correlated to the generation of ros both extra and intracellularly through fenton reactions lei et al 2018 a detailed revision of previous studies can be found in the literature ganguly et al 2018 liu et al 2019 in summary intracellular h2o2 produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain is catalyzed by fe2 and fe3 from iron oxide nanoparticles to produce highly toxic reactive hydroxyl ho and hydroperoxyl ho2 radicals according to the previously presented fenton reactions eq 3 and eq 4 the imbalance in the rate of ros generation leads to oxidative stress and the consequent production of free radicals that can damage proteins dna and lipids cellular and organelle membranes due to their high polyunsaturated fatty acids are especially susceptible to ros damage that is named lipid peroxidation it is a process in which free radical species remove electrons from lipids and subsequently produce new reactive intermediates in a chain reaction the lipid peroxidation process damages phospholipids by directly altering their structure activity and physical properties which can induce cell death signaling termed as ferroptosis more specifically ferroptosis occurs as a result of increased ros presence due to high intracellular iron levels and a depletion of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione gsh that cause lipid peroxidation and consequently to programed cell death distinct from the apoptotic mechanism 5 2 1 oxidative stress evaluation the enhancement of ros in cells exposed to iron oxide nanoparticles engenders cytotoxicity and oxidative damage which can be detected via three main different approaches direct measurement of reactive oxygen species evaluation of the presence of superoxides hydrogen peroxides hydroxyl radicals etc assessment of oxidative damage protein lipid and dna damages and assessment of antioxidant status changes in catalase cat gsh superoxide dismutase sod vitamins a c e etc katerji et al 2019 as demonstrated by gaharwar et al 2017 the uptake of iron oxide nps in the lymphocytes of rats prompted oxidative stress mediated by ros production and depletion of glutathione in a concentration and time dependent way similarly ansari et al 2019a have proposed that the exposure of fe3o4 nanoparticles to the primary lymphocytes of rats in vitro induced dose dependent cytotoxicity which was measured by ros production in addition increasing concentrations of magnetite led to a reduction in catalase activity in order to minimize the effect of ros generation on the toxicity of rat cells they also investigated the influence of the natural antioxidant thymoquinone on the neutralization of ros before it could induce damage to cells the results showed that the antioxidant has the potential to be used to avoid the harmful effects of iron oxide nanoparticles in vitro 5 2 2 cell viability evaluation the cell viability evaluation using different colorimetric assays is widely recognized to investigate the potential toxicity of nanoparticles in vitro these analyses are based on the quantification of the number of viable nonviable cells through a spectrophotometer or a microscope which is possible due to the generation of colored dye enzymes complexes ganguly et al 2018 although they are employed to preliminarily access cell viability the results from different techniques cannot be directly compared since they are determined by distinct parameters as an example the mtt 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2yl 2 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay is associated with the mitochondrial activity whereas trypan blue tb or lactate dehydrogenase ldh assay with membrane integrity soenen et al 2011 it has been reported several cytotoxic effects of mions mainly using mtt assay which are influenced by multiple features such as size shape the concentration of nanoparticles typically in the order of μg ml or a few mg ml exposure time commonly 24 to 72 h cell type surface modification among others malhotra et al 2020 patil et al 2018 for example carvalho et al 2019 have shown using mtt protocol that mions cytotoxicity is composition and cell type dependent in this report the cytotoxicity of hematite and magnetite were evaluated towards glioblastoma cancer cells u87 and human embryonic kidney cells hek 293t considering the same concentration and time of cell exposure the results demonstrated that fe3o4 was relatively more cytotoxic than fe2o3 for both cell types because it provided fe2 as more reactive species for the generation of ros in oxidative processes in addition a higher lethality of fe3o4 was observed in u87 cells ascribed to the abnormal metabolism frequently present in cancer cells usually it is a difficult task to compare data from different researches as most nanoparticles related cytotoxicity results are produced by individual studies that monitor particular physicochemical properties for a specific type of cell and nanoparticles as well as distinct experimental conditions soenen et al 2011 to address this issue some studies have pointed out the need for protocols standardization not only to enhance the comparison of data and the understanding of induced toxicity but also to establish suitable and reproducible environments in terms of sample preparation choice of cells growing conditions and appropriate control groups soenen et al 2011 another usual way to measure cytotoxicity effects is by assessing cellular membrane integrity where trypan blue tb and ldh are commonly used while the first one can be evaluated by staining the cell membrane that has been compromised i e nonviable cells the second one can be measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage in the extracellular media ganguly et al 2018 in addition to the drawbacks previously mentioned tb has its particular downsides the manual counting of viable cells using a microscope can perhaps increase the chances of error in the measurements thus to have more accuracy in the results it is recommended to conduct various assays for the same sample patil et al 2018 or verifying it through more quantitative cell viability techniques ganguly et al 2018 5 3 assessment of in vivo nanotoxicity in a broad perspective besides preliminary in vitro assays due to the high threats posed by engineered nanoparticles to different animal species researchers must also use in vivo models to assess environmental risk and potential effects on human health nps that are used in industries and remain in the water or soil can be easily absorbed distributed and even accumulated in various living organisms due to their nano size after their penetration into cells a variety of reactions can potentially cause damage to the organelles and affecting metabolic pathways to this end many studies have employed unicellular and multicellular organisms to investigate nanomaterial toxicity including biodistribution and toxicokinetic research prajitha et al 2019 5 3 1 zebrafish danio rerio embryotoxicity test model among several animal models used experimentally the zebrafish danio rerio is considered the most suitable fish specie for nanoparticle toxicity studies some features that make it convenient include large egg production rapid development easy preservation in laboratory conditions and small size another key aspect is related to their genetic similarity to humans which assures a resemblance between cell structure signaling and physiology pereira et al 2019 numerous studies have demonstrated that zebrafish testing offers advantages over mammalian models like rodents in terms of economic ethical and biological issues the maintenance of fish species is less costly and less time consuming the studies are done in the embryonic phase and they have increased sensitivity haque and ward 2018 hence zebrafish have been widely used for nanotoxicity evaluation of metal oxide nanoparticles chakraborty et al 2016 cassar et al 2020 in particular villacis et al 2017 have analyzed the toxic effects caused by maghemite nanoparticles in danio rerio using genotoxicity oxidative stress and molecular methodologies adult animals were exposed to different concentrations of nanoparticles in the range of 4 7 mg l 1 to 74 7 mg l 1 over 96 h the results showed harmful and concentration dependent effects on the exposed danio rerio 5 3 2 daphnia magna as an organism test model daphnia magna a small planktonic crustacean has become an important model for ecotoxicological investigation the main characteristics that make these organisms attractive as an experimental model are a periodic parthenogenetic life cycle as well as simple culturing and handling tkaczyk et al 2020 one recent and interesting study kwon et al 2014 has investigated the effects on the exposure of daphnia magna to two types of iron oxides magnetite and hematite the results confirmed that the difference in physicochemical properties of iron based nanoparticles led to distinct interactions with the biological system which caused dissimilar nanotoxicity outcomes fe3o4 nanoparticles showed higher dissolution and oxidation rates which changed their biodistribution and bioaccumulation within the planktonic animal and induce severe metabolism disturbances more recently magro et al 2018 have evaluated the effects of surface reactivity of maghemite nanoparticles on daphnia magna adults and embryos it was showed that nps toxicity could be ascribed not only to nonspecific biological response related for example the size and shape of the material but also the effect of specific bio interactions caused by reactive surfaces this work highlighted the critical relevance of the composition and surface chemistry of nanoparticles as an indispensable element for assessing ecotoxicological risks in the aquatic systems 5 4 assessment of ecotoxicity toxicity induced in the environment and its influence on the whole ecosystem is known as ecotoxicity the introduction of engineered nanomaterials into aquatic environments e g marine and freshwater ecosystems can affect organisms at distinct levels of the trophic chain due to bioconcentration and biomagnification therefore the ecotoxicity assessment is crucial to prevent environmental pollution affecting water resources and the harmful consequences in living organisms ganguly et al 2018 5 4 1 bacterial toxicity assay bacteria play an essential ecological role in aquatic ecosystems they are associated with the conversion of organic substrates into mineral nutrients because these microorganisms respond very rapidly to variations in the environment they are suitable for fast screening of contaminants in natural waters in addition they have reasonably short life cycles and low cost maintenance diverse bacterial assays therefore have been established for assessing potential ecotoxicity bitton and koopman 1992 bacterial assessment of chemical toxicity in water environments is based on the impact of the pollutants on growth inhibition or cell viability of the bacterial cultures these conventional assays comprise the measurements of changes in cell densities by absorbance analysis and verification of inhibition regions or colony formation on agar plates bitton and koopman 1992 some studies have evaluated the potential microbial toxicity of various metal oxide nanoparticles for bacillus subtilis escherichia coli and streptococcus aureus cultures baek and an 2011 leareng et al 2019 and the results have shown that the microbial growth is adversely influenced by increasing concentration of nps however this antimicrobial tendency can be modulated upon different nano bio interface interactions arakha et al 2015 have explored the effect of the nanoparticle bacteria interface on the antimicrobial activity of magnetite nanoparticles to this end fe3o4 without any surface coating and fe3o4 coated with chitosan were exposed to bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli bacterial cultures to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility the results showed that chitosan coated magnetite was more toxic to the bacteria due to the stronger attachment of the nanoparticles on the microorganism cell this effect was ascribed to chitosan adding positive charges onto the surface of the magnetite which was electrostatically attracted to the negative charges on the bacterial surface the stronger interactions were responsible for producing more ros resulting in bacterial death 5 4 2 algal toxicity assay algae also play an important role in aquatic systems since they are primary producers in food chains because these organisms are more susceptible to pollutants than invertebrates and fishes they are generally used for assessing water quality and toxicity algal assays are comparatively easy to perform in laboratory conditions adopting batch cultures some parameters used to evaluate the toxicity include in vivo fluorescence cell counting and nitrogenase activity tang et al 2017 lei et al 2016 have studied the effect of particle size crystal phase and oxidation state of iron based nanoparticles on green algae toxicity the results showed that algal growth inhibition was significantly affected by these parameters the algae toxicity was mainly associated with the oxidative stress induced by the iron nanoparticles even though the nps cell heteroagglomeration also contributed to the toxic effects a similar study was performed by saxena et al 2020 where a comparative evaluation of toxicity and accumulation of nanosized fe2o3 nanoparticles and their bulk counterpart have been done using microalgae as a model it was evidenced that nanoparticles with nanometric sizes were more cytotoxic due to higher internalization of nps and stimulation of oxidative stress associated with a larger surface area given the diversity of mechanisms which can induce nanomaterial toxicity a series of analysis is required to establish the possible toxic potential of nanoparticles at distinct levels therefore table 7 summarizes a set of methodologies that have been more often used to assess the in vitro in vivo and ecotoxicity of iron based nanoparticles 6 conclusions and future outlook the development and applications of advanced functional nanostructures based on magnetic iron oxide nanomaterials seem extremely promising for water remediation as demonstrated by the several studies presented in this review nonetheless further studies are highly necessary to develop large scale production and cost effective sustainable engineered nanomaterials through greener chemistry as well as considering their potential toxicity to the environment and human health after exposure moreover because the hybrid nanostructures required for catalysis may lead to complexity and increased costs there is a growing demand for designing and producing these nanomaterials with integrated multiple features and through optimized synthetic routes regarding the use of mions for water treatment an important problem to be addressed is that adsorption and catalysis studies should be performed under realistic conditions concerning the presence of organic matter co ions ph pollutant concentrations among others also the magnetic capture of nanosorbents catalytic has to be examined more closely for potential use in larger scale water treatment and more studies are highly needed to develop successful and non harmful regeneration methods xu and wang 2012 apart from the catalyst recovery and reusability another demand for the aops is the evaluation of their industrial applicability commonly limited by the high operational costs which usually involve the requirement for high energy consumption and expensive chemical

17239,aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria were first isolated more than 100 years ago and hydroxylamine is known to be an intermediate the enzymatic steps involving hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite are still under discussion for a long time it was assumed that hydroxylamine was directly converted to nitrite by a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase recent enzymatic evidences suggest that the actual product of hydroxylamine conversion is no and a third yet unknown enzyme further converts no to nitrite more recently ammonium oxidizing archaea and complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria were isolated and identified still the central nitrogen metabolism of these microorganisms presents to researchers the same puzzle how hydroxylamine is transformed to nitrite nitrogen losses in the form of no and n2o have been identified in all three types of aerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms and hydroxylamine is known to play a significant role in the formation yet the pathways and the factors promoting the greenhouse gas emissions are to be fully characterized hydroxylamine also plays a yet poorly understood role on anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and is known to inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria in this review the role of this elusive intermediate in the metabolism of different key players of the nitrogen cycle is discussed as well as the putative importance of hydroxylamine as a key nitrogen metabolite for microbial interactions within microbial communities and engineered systems overall for the first time putting together the acquired knowledge about hydroxylamine and the nitrogen cycle over the years in a review setting potential hypothesis and highlighting possible next steps for research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords intermediate ammonium oxidation nitrite oxidation anammox n2o emissions 1 hydroxylamine in the nitrogen cycle nitrogen is one of the essential elements on earth widely present in the environment as well as in living organisms the biggest reservoir of nitrogen on earth is dinitrogen gas n2 but it is too inert for most of living organisms to be directly incorporated into cellular structures kuypers et al 2018 microorganisms involved in the nitrogen cycle have different enzymes that catalyse all sorts of nitrogen conversions for example nitrogen fixers are able to transform dinitrogen gas to ammonium which makes nitrogen bioavailable to other microorganisms and other forms of life traditionally nitrogen cycle conversions have been classified in assimilation ammonification nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and nitrogen fixation see some of them in fig 1 a however new microbial conversions have been discovered expanding the traditional processes fig 1b microbial conversions are responsible for the major fraction of the nitrogen fluxes between different nitrogen reservoirs on earth kuypers et al 2018 since the discovery of the haber bosch process which transforms dinitrogen gas to ammonium to produce fertilizers human intervention generated a large anthropogenic nitrogen flux on earth hampering the natural equilibrium eutrophication of waters and increased nitrous oxide emissions are typical examples of human generated problems related to the nitrogen cycle to mitigate such problems engineered systems like biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps are used where ammonium dissolved in water is transformed to dinitrogen gas using different nitrogen microbial conversions van loosdrecht and jetten 1998 thus detailed knowledge of the nitrogen cycle microorganisms is crucial to further understand both natural and anthropogenic nitrogen fluxes and avoid possible environmental problems hydroxylamine is an inorganic highly reactive compound that is intermediate or side metabolite in different nitrogen cycle microorganisms fig 1b c hydroxylamine impacts no and n2o emissions by aerobic ammonium oxidizers microorganisms the impact of this compound in other microorganisms of the nitrogen cycle is little studied to the best of our knowledge this review is the first to target the current knowledge about the role of hydroxylamine in the different communities of the nitrogen cycle the review aims to assess the current state of the art on the role of hydroxylamine in the conversions by the various microbial groups participating in the nitrogen cycle with a special focus on wastewater treatment processes the level of understanding and research related to hydroxylamine and the microorganisms transforming nitrogen is not the same for each microbial process in the nitrogen cycle aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms are presented sections 2 to 5 as they are known to harbour hydroxylamine conversion capacity in their genomic inventory a wide range of studies investigated the role of hydroxylamine on ammonium oxidation bacteria and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria sections 2 and 5 respectively less information is available regarding the role of hydroxylamine in more recently discovered microorganisms such as ammonium oxidizing archaea or comammox sections 3 and 4 respectively nitrite oxidizing bacteria are not able to transform hydroxylamine but the inhibition of nitrite oxidizers by hydroxylamine might be of relevance when shaping nitrogen cycle communities this is analysed in section 6 the impact of hydroxylamine on other nitrogen cycle microorganisms such as denitrifiers or dissimilatory nitrate reducers to ammonium dnra organisms has been hardly investigated therefore only a brief analysis was included in section 7 in this section also other microorganisms that might be relevant for wastewater treatment are mentioned finally the bottlenecks for hydroxylamine measurement its role as a putative interaction compound in microbial nitrogen cycling communities and research challenges regarding this compound are discussed in the last sections sections 8 to 10 2 ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are able to transform ammonium to nitrite with oxygen as electron acceptor these microorganisms are aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria comprised in the beta and gamma subdivision of proteobacteria teske et al 1994 aob catabolism consists of the conversion of ammonium to nitrite as electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor as in eq 1 in aob this reaction is divided in two steps first the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo catalyses the oxidation of nh4 to nh2oh eq 2 afterwards hydroxylamine is further converted to no2 by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao eq 3 see fig 2 a two of the electrons generated in this last step are used by amo to catalyse the first reaction whereas the rest is invested in energy generation yu and chandran 2010 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o 2 nh 4 o 2 2 h 2 e n h 2 oh h 2 o 3 n h 2 oh h 2 o no 2 5 h 4 e recently it was suggested that the product of hao is no instead of nitrite and that no is disproportionated abiotically or by an unknown enzyme to nitrite caranto and lancaster 2017 thus first ammonium is oxidized to hydroxylamine by amo eq 2 hydroxylamine to no by hao eq 4 and no to nitrite eq 5 by an uncharacterized enzyme a proteomic comparative study has recently suggested that nitrosocyanin ncya was highly expressed in 3 different aob strains and was proposed as this third missing enzyme stein 2019 see fig 2b nevertheless the activity of hao producing no has only been shown in vitro thus further confirmation of this pathway in vivo is needed in vivo metabolic studies in combination with transcriptomics proteomics studies could shed light into another putative enzyme being able to convert hydroxylamine to nitrite 4 n h 2 oh no 3 h 3 e 5 no h 2 o no 2 2 h 1 e beyond hydroxylamine as an intermediate in aob metabolism other putative roles of hydroxylamine are known hydroxylamine has been shown to transiently accumulate in aob planktonic or mixed cultures which might lead to interactions with other nitrogen communities the short and long term impact of hydroxylamine has been tested in aob without reaching definitive conclusions finally it is known to be a precursor to n2o emissions all these roles are discussed in depth in the following sections 2 1 hydroxylamine transient accumulation events since hydroxylamine first mention mumford 1914 as intermediate and identification by lees lees 1952 it has been shown that it can transiently accumulate in the bulk liquid during cultivation at concentrations from 0 003 up to 4 3 mg n l table 1 these accumulations were reported in a wide variety of nitrification systems and operation conditions for example when performing batch tests with axenic cultures liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 or nitrifying cultures yang and alleman 1992 when aob axenic chemostat cultures were switched from anoxic to aerobic conditions yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2018 or when partial nitrifying reactors were operated in sequencing batch mode hu et al 2017 su et al 2019b also hydroxylamine accumulated when a change of reactor load was imposed to a continuous partial nitrification airlift reactor leading to an increase of ammonium accumulation from 2 to 25 mg n l poot et al 2016 hu et al also observed hydroxylamine accumulation in a continuous reactor when imposing a change of load but higher load did not correlate with a change of the hydroxylamine accumulation peak hu et al 2017 overall all the mentioned experiments table 1 showed that switching aob cells from a resting state i e without low ammonium or oxygen to an active state i e with ammonium or oxygen triggered hydroxylamine accumulation indicating that hydroxylamine accumulation depended on the unbalanced coupling between the production and consumption of hydroxylamine by the designated enzymes thus if amo produces hydroxylamine faster than can be converted by hao and other consumption reactions or the recently proposed still unknown enzyme caranto and lancaster 2017 are able to consume hydroxylamine a metabolic imbalance is created leading to the observed hydroxylamine accumulation different studies point out that hydroxylamine accumulation can also be strain dependant for instance nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosospira multiformis accumulated hydroxylamine up to 11 and 31 µg n l respectively liu et al 2017 in contrast other aob strains such as nitrosomonas nitrosa nm90 and nitrosomonas communis did not show hydroxylamine accumulation in batch tests with the same initial ammonium concentrations liu et al 2017 the authors attributed the differences observed for hydroxylamine accumulation levels to differences in the ammonia consumption rates for example n multiformis showed the highest ammonium consumption rate also resulting in the highest hydroxylamine accumulation liu et al 2017 nevertheless n communis had the fastest ammonium uptake rate but no hydroxylamine accumulation was detected which might be due to a more efficient hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite by hao liu et al 2017 another study indicating that hydroxylamine accumulation is strain dependant and might also depend on the surrounding nitrogen community was performed by stüven and coworkers stüven et al 1992 for instance nitrosovibrio did not accumulate hydroxylamine when it was cultured alone and yet hydroxylamine accumulation 5 6 23 8 µg n l occurred when it was cultured together with the nob nitrobacter stüven et al 1992 contrarily in the same set of experiments nitrosomonas europaea showed hydroxylamine accumulation 2 8 15 4 µg n l when it was cultured alone but in co culture with nitrobacter lower hydroxylamine levels where reported 5 6 to less than 2 8 µg n l stüven et al 1992 this is the only study that point towards a possible impact of side communities to the hydroxylamine accumulation behaviour of aob strains the differential behaviour related to hydroxylamine accumulation when aob was cultured alone or together with nob might be due to a possible competition strategy to avoid nob growth in the co culture or to promote it to avoid product inhibition thus far the impact of side communities on hydroxylamine accumulation has been little studied and it is still not fully understood the unbalance between hydroxylamine production and consumption leading to hydroxylamine accumulation might have different explanations i the turnover of hao or the enzyme responsible of hydroxylamine consumption is smaller than the capacity of amo to produce hydroxylamine genetic differences between different species in the hydroxylamine production and consumption enzymes could explain the different hydroxylamine accumulation dynamics observed between species ii ph can be another factor that might cause hydroxylamine build up as ph has an impact on both the dissociation of ammonium hydroxylamine as well as it has a strong impact on the enzymes rates su et al 2019b for instance ammonium consumption is strongly impacted by acidification while hydroxylamine oxidation is barely affected frijlink et al 1992 this could be of importance in biofilm like systems where strong ph gradients can occur and ph is more acidic in the internal part of the granule de beer et al 1993 gieseke et al 2006 poot et al 2016 schreiber et al 2009 uemura et al 2011 winkler et al 2011 future studies might shed more light on the difference in balancing the production and consumption of hydroxylamine in different aob for example comparative transcriptomic proteomic between aob strains studies focused on enzymatic activities and affinities comparison or research focused on characterizing external factors promoting hydroxylamine accumulation 2 2 effect of hydroxylamine dosing in ammonium oxidizing bacteria several studies have investigated the effect of externally added hydroxylamine on ammonium oxidizing bacteria table 2 since hydroxylamine first discovery as intermediate of nitrification one of the initial questions was if hydroxylamine could be used for growth two parallel studies have shown that different species of aob are able to use hydroxylamine mixotrophically together with ammonium for growth böttcher and koops 1994 de bruijn et al 1995 both studies böttcher and koops 1994 de bruijn et al 1995 reported a higher experimental growth yield than the theoretically expected when using a mixture of hydroxylamine and ammonium as substrate so far it is not fully understood why and how hydroxylamine boosts the growth in addition to our knowledge it is still not shown if aob can grow on hydroxylamine as single substrate other studies have focused on the short term effect of externally added hydroxylamine to ammonium oxidation using batch tests or respirometry tests when providing ammonium to an aob batch culture usually there is a lag period or so called acceleration phase which is the time that the culture needs to switch from a slower ammonium consumption to maximum consumption rate chandran and smets 2008 different studies showed that externally added hydroxylamine accelerated this initial ammonium uptake rate chandran and smets 2008 de bruijn et al 1995 harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 the externally added hydroxylamine to a biofilm system led to disaggregation from microcolonies to scattered cells harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 based on these results two different hypotheses on why hydroxylamine accelerates the ammonium uptake rate were proposed chandran and smets 2008 harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 i hydroxylamine impacts the cell morphology scattering the cells and having a higher cell area available so an increased mass transfer leading to higher ammonium uptakes ii electrons obtained in the hydroxylamine transformation to nitrite are recirculated to amo enzyme which triggers its activity increasing ammonium consumption conventional nitrogen removal in wwtps was traditionally performed by combination of nitrification and denitrification processes since the discovery of anammox the possibility to combine partial nitrification with anammox has been intensively studied partial nitrification anammox technologies offer the opportunity to lower wwtps costs however one of the bottlenecks for its implementation is the stable operation of partial nitrification and efficient repression of nob cao et al 2017 hydroxylamine has been used to recover partial nitrification in reactors where nitrate started to accumulate wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 in these studies hydroxylamine dosing combined with proper reactor operation triggered the stabilization of partial nitrification in both studies the activity of aob was not hampered whereas nob were inhibited as nitrate stopped accumulating in the reactor wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 a rapid start up of partial nitrification reactors was also achieved by hydroxylamine addition for example intermittent dosing of hydroxylamine in up flow biofilm reactor okabe et al 2011 or sbr li et al 2019a li et al 2019b helped to speeding up the start up of a partial nitritation process a stable partial nitritation was maintained only if after stopping hydroxylamine dosage a proper reactor control was implemented li et al 2019a overall hydroxylamine showed to be efficient in inhibiting nitrite oxidation to nitrate see next section not damaging and even promoting aob activity in most of the studies böttcher and koops 1994 de bruijn et al 1995 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 however there are other studies that claim that long term exposure to hydroxylamine hampered aob activity harper et al 2009 and even an inhibition model for aob has been proposed wan et al 2016 in addition the observed negative effect of hydroxylamine on mixed cultures biofilm like structures harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 will not be desirable in certain operational modes which rely on biofilm systems i e granule biofilm carriers most of the long term hydroxylamine studies have been performed using a pulse feeding strategy which leads to initially high hydroxylamine concentrations table 2 furthermore hydroxylamine feeding was mostly added temporarily for a start up period or to promote partial nitritation these exposures to sudden high hydroxylamine concentrations are not likely to occur in natural environments thus far the only study with continuous and limiting hydroxylamine concentration was performed by de bruijn et al 1995 with nitrosomonas europaea using hydroxylamine limiting conditions can help to understand the mechanisms i e over or under regulation of genes proteins by which hydroxylamine is promoting or hampering aob activity in nitrification environments without the potential inhibitive effects of hydroxylamine 2 3 n2o production from hydroxylamine in addition to the regular ammonia oxidation metabolism two possible pathways have been proposed in order to explain the nitrogen loss in form of nitric or nitrous oxide gasses during nitritation i nitrifier denitrification which involves the reduction of no2 to no and n2o by a nitrite reductase nir and nitric oxide reductase nor respectively it has been suggested that this pathway is predominant at low oxygen concentrations kozlowski et al 2014 ii hydroxylamine oxidation that involves the oxidation of nh2oh to no by hao then no can be further converted to n2o by nor n2o production through this pathway is thought to be favoured at higher o2 concentrations hooper and terry 1979 klotz and stein 2011 kozlowski et al 2014 fig 3 however recent studies have highlighted the occurrence and contribution of other pathways to the total n2o emissions caranto et al 2016 soler jofra et al 2016 terada et al 2017 most of these new proposed pathways have hydroxylamine as substrate briefly caranto et al showed that the cytochrome p460 of hao can directly produce n2o from hydroxylamine caranto et al 2016 besides biological conversion hydroxylamine has been shown to react chemically by either disproportionation or with medium components such as fe mn or hno2 resulting in n2o formation see heil et al 2015 schreiber et al 2012 for detailed reactions two different studies showed independently the occurrence of a chemical reaction between nitrite and hydroxylamine at conditions relevant for wastewater treatment harper et al 2015 soler jofra et al 2016 furthermore the chemical n2o production rate by the reaction of hydroxylamine and nitrite or the protonated form nitrous acid was comparable to the biological n2o production rates soler jofra et al 2018 terada et al 2017 contradicting results were presented by su and co workers su et al 2019a proposing that abiotic reactions would only be relevant at acidic ph all mentioned studies soler jofra et al 2018 soler jofra et al 2016 su et al 2019a terada et al 2017 were performed with different medium compositions and the impact of different compounds to the putative final reported rates is yet unknown for instance performing the same test with demineralized water or synthetic medium increased the hydroxylamine disproportionation by 2 to 22 fold su et al 2019a however abiotic tests containing both free nitrous acid and hydroxylamine were only performed with demineralized water at neutral ph su et al 2019a at ph 8 when free nitrous acid concentration is really low the reaction rate increased by at least one order of magnitude when using medium instead of demineralized water su et al 2019a thus from our point of view it is unclear if ph and or medium compounds are both important when determining the chemical reaction rate consequently we suggest that the kinetic characterization of hydroxylamine abiotic reactions and the impact of different environmental conditions i e trace elements concentrations iron and others is of relevance to understand this process properly even more importantly the impact of a real wastewater matrix into such reactions is yet to be studied from an engineering point of view n2o mitigation strategies in wastewater treatment have already been implemented even if the actual conversions behind the emissions are not fully understood kampschreur et al 2008 to improve these strategies a more in depth understanding of the pathways contributing to the total n2o emissions is needed this would help to identify the factors promoting n2o emissions and to include this knowledge in the design of wastewater treatment process instead of applying mitigation strategies after operation started the challenge is to develop a methodology that allows to identify the pathways contribution to the total n2o emissions as well as studying the factors impacting them the large number of compounds and microbial groups involved combined with potential chemical conversions makes this a difficult task for example implementing a comprehensive approach including a combination of 15n tracer studies natural isotope signatures modelling and transcriptomics proteomics might be needed to be able to fully differentiate between pathways duan et al 2017 overall hydroxylamine has been shown for years to be a promotor of n2o emissions which has a 300 fold larger warming potential than that of co2 thus further understanding the factors promoting n2o emissions from hydroxylamine will help in the design of mitigation strategies 3 ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa were firstly identified using genomic tools as the detected amo gene was corresponding with an archaeon scaffold treusch et al 2005 venter et al 2004 later the first isolation of an aoa microorganisms demonstrated its abilities to oxidize ammonium to nitrite könneke et al 2005 aoa might play an important role in nitrification in environments such as the oceans and soils where substrates are usually found at low concentrations and aoa high ammonium affinities allow its survival stahl and de la torre 2012 wuchter et al 2006 also nitrifying drinking water filters are often reported to contain aoa erguder et al 2009 kasuga et al 2010 van der wielen et al 2009 due to their phylogenetic differences with other archaea aoa were proposed to be classified inside a new phylum in the archaea domain thaumarchaeota brochier armanet et al 2008 the first pure culture aoa was obtained 12 years ago könneke et al 2005 as their bacterial counterparts its central nitrogen metabolism is still under discussion for instance amo enzyme is conserved in all known aoa but no hao homologues have been identified hatzenpichler 2012 lancaster et al 2018 stein 2019 vajrala et al 2013 thus the conversion of ammonium to hydroxylamine eq 2 has been proposed to be conserved and catalysed by the archaeal amo enzyme the further conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite is under consideration as it occurs with aob and comammox the fact that no hao homologues have been detected in the aoa genome led to two possible central nitrogen metabolic models stein 2019 i a copper complex uses no and nh2oh to form two molecules of nitrite nirk enzyme is involved in the transformation of nitrite to no fig 4 a ii two enzymes consecutively oxidize nh2oh to no and no to nitrite proposed to be mediated by nirk or an uncharacterized copper complex fig 4b to the yet not fully resolved hydroxylamine to nitrite conversion pathway it must be added the lack of cytochrome c type proteins usually performing the electron transportation in aob respiration instead a copper based electron transport system has been postulated as a high number of protein copper domains have been identified in the genome stahl and de la torre 2012 walker et al 2010 regarding no and n2o emissions aoa are not capable to perform nitrifier denitrification kozlowski et al 2016b stieglmeier et al 2014 as no n2o was formed with limited oxygen supply isotopic signature also suggested that the nitrogen found in n2o comes from both ammonium and nitrite stieglmeier et al 2014 thus n2o production was linked to ammonium conversion and proposed that hydroxylamine or n intermediates abiotically react leading to n2o kozlowski et al 2016a stieglmeier et al 2014 due to its relatively recent identification few experiments used or measured hydroxylamine in aoa cultures so far externally added hydroxylamine has been used to demonstrate its role as intermediate and postulate that hydroxylamine oxidation is coupled to atp generation in nitrosopumilus maritimus vajrala et al 2013 in addition externally added hydroxylamine concentrations of 14 m n l showed to completely inhibit n maritimus vajrala et al 2013 which indicates a higher sensitivity to hydroxylamine exposure of aoa to that observed in aob table 2 nevertheless to our knowledge no other studies of batch or continuous exposure to externally added hydroxylamine of other aoa strains have been reported yet thus a differential behaviour of aoa strains to hydroxylamine exposure remains to be investigated hydroxylamine transient accumulation has been shown to occur in aoa cultures also pointing towards a differential strain behaviour towards hydroxylamine accumulation liu et al 2017 for example n gragensis only released hydroxylamine 4 6 μg n l when incubated with 28 mg n l ammonium but not with 7 mg n l n uzonensis produced hydroxylamine with both ammonium initial concentrations of 7 and 28 mg n l and reached higher concentrations 4 8 μg n l when incubated with the higher ammonium concentrations contrarily n viennensis and ca n sp nd2 did not produce hydroxylamine thus the hydroxylamine accumulation strain dependency observed in aob seems to also be a differential strain trait of aoa overall the recent identification and isolation of aoa presents still unresolved questions such as the central nitrogen metabolism further characterization of the no n2o emissions or the differential strain response to hydroxylamine accumulation and exposure 4 complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria comammox since nitrification first discovery it was always thought that ammonium oxidation to nitrate involved a two step microbial conversion involving aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob complete ammonium oxidation to nitrate by a single microorganism was predicted thermodynamically possible costa et al 2006 but overlooked for years until two independent studies demonstrated its existence daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 complete ammonium oxidating comammox bacteria were first identified in two parallel studies demonstrating that they have all the cell machinery to oxidize ammonium to nitrite and further to nitrate daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 mainly two reasons prevented comammox identification for so many years i aob dedicated qpcr primers targeting amo gene were not covering the comammox amoa gene due to only ca 60 amino acid identity ii 16s rrna sequencing does not allow to distinguish comammox from nob thus comammox were usually misclassified as canonical nob lawson and lücker 2018 the current running hypothesis for the central metabolism of comammox is postulated to involve amo hao and nxr enzymes as copies of all the genes encoding for these enzymes have been found in the genome daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 thus ammonium is first transformed to hydroxylamine by amo hydroxylamine is further oxidized to nitrite by hao and finally nitrite is converted to nitrate by nxr fig 5 a as well as for aob and aoa the occurrence of a third intermediate step involving hao converting nh2oh only to no and a further conversion of no to nitrite is under discussion kits et al 2019 fig 5b as discussed previously ncya has been hypothesised to be a lacking third enzyme for aob however yet no ncya encoding gene has been found in the available comammox genomic data camejo et al 2017 kits et al 2019 palomo et al 2018 thus the hypothesis of comammox encoding a no oxidoreductase in the genome has not been confirmed yet the first kinetic analysis of the first isolate nitrospira inopinata kits et al 2017 showed a low ammonium half saturation coefficient high affinity for ammonium and a high growth yield compared to that of aob or aoa this is in agreement with the theoretical higher growth yield prediction costa et al 2006 as well as the comammox distribution in the environment lawson and lücker 2018 as comammox has been detected at substrate depleted zones lawson and lücker 2018 thus low ammonium affinity constant and high growth yield allows them to thrive in such minimal environments due to its recent discovery little is known about the role of hydroxylamine besides being involved as intermediate in the central metabolism regarding hydroxylamine transient accumulation liu and co workers showed hydroxylamine accumulation in batch like experiments up to 6 μg n l even calculated hydroxylamine accumulation could have been up to 25 to 132 μg n l depending on the initial ammonium concentration used liu et al 2017 a recent study also postulated towards abiotically formed n2o from hydroxylamine as the main comammox emission source kits et al 2019 overall due to its novelty and recent discovery there is plenty of room for research to further understand the hydroxylamine role in comammox metabolism among others the characterization of hydroxylamine build up in cultures the impact of externally added hydroxylamine in the metabolism or the involvement of hydroxylamine in n2o emissions 5 anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox ammonium conversion without oxygen even predicted thermodynamically favourable broda 1977 was thought inexistent until the discovery of anammox mulder et al 1995 anammox bacteria are able to transform ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas autotrophically and anoxically jetten et al 1998 the central metabolism of anammox has been a hot topic of research since its discovery hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016 strous et al 1998 van de graaf et al 1997 among others hydroxylamine was initially hypothesized to be an intermediate of the anammox conversion as when it was added to anammox cultures hydrazine accumulated jetten et al 1998 van de graaf et al 1997 since then hydroxylamine addition hydrazine accumulation experiments have been used as characteristic activity tests to demonstrate anammox activity in enrichment cultures egli et al 2001 jetten et al 1998 among others later no was proposed to be intermediate of the central nitrogen metabolism instead of hydroxylamine kartal et al 2011 the current hypothesis for the anammox nitrogen metabolism consists of three reactions first a nitrite oxidase nir enzyme converts nitrite to no eq 6 then no reacts with nh4 and form hydrazine n2h4 eq 7 catalysed by hydrazine synthase hzs finally hydrazine dehydrogenase hds further converts hydrazine to dinitrogen gas eq 8 fig 6 6 no 2 2 h e no h 2 o 7 no nh 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o 8 n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e 5 1 the yet unknown role of hydroxylamine in anammox bacteria hydroxylamine role in the anammox metabolism is still not fully understood for instance not all anammox strains i e ca brocadia spp encode the nir enzyme oshiki et al 2015 consequently either another enzyme like the one encoded in the gene kustc0458 is doing the job hu et al 2019 or hydroxylamine is involved in the pathway oshiki et al 2016 another surprising and characteristic trait is that hydroxylamine oxidase hox which converts hydroxylamine to no is one of the most highly expressed enzymes in anammox hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 thus anammox is investing energy and nutrients on keeping a high hox protein content in the cell which is puzzling if hydroxylamine does not have an important role in the metabolism fig 6 the only hypothesis to explain this high hox expression is that hzs enzyme can leak hydroxylamine and hox is able to transform any leaking of hydroxylamine back to no dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 precisely it is proposed that in hzs catalytic centre no is actually transformed to hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine is reacting with ammonium to form hydrazine dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 another explanation for this high hox expression is that hydroxylamine might be important in anammox like environments overall the role of hydroxylamine in the anammox metabolism remains as yet poorly understood externally added hydroxylamine in form of batch tests had different outcomes table 3 i when hydroxylamine was added accumulation of hydrazine occurs which has been used to demonstrate anammox activity egli et al 2001 jetten et al 1998 ii hydroxylamine has been shown to boost the anammox activity hu et al 2011 zekker et al 2012 iii hydroxylamine addition allowed to characterize anammox hydroxylamine metabolism van de graaf et al 1997 van der star et al 2008 hydroxylamine anammox metabolism occurs via disproportionation to ammonium and dinitrogen gas eq 9 however during this disproportionation hydrazine accumulation occurs the accumulation is due to an imbalance between the two reactions involved in hydroxylamine disproportionation that produce eq 10 and consumes hydrazine eq 11 respectively van der star et al 2008 9 3 n h 2 oh h nh 4 n 2 3 h 2 o 10 nh 4 n h 2 oh n 2 h 4 h 2 o h 11 2 n h 2 oh

showed to decrease the stoichiometric nitrate needed for growth and reported no negative impact on the anammox community soler jofra et al 2020 thus anammox could use hydroxylamine and survive in environments where it is present 6 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria perform the second step of nitrification catalysing the conversion of nitrite to nitrate with oxygen as electron acceptor up to date 7 genera have been described belonging to 6 different phyla in α β γ proteobacteria daims et al 2016 nob couple the nitrite oxidation to nitrate as electron donor eq 12 with oxygen respiration as electron acceptor eq 13 resulting in nob central nitrogen catabolism eq 14 nitrite oxidation to nitrate is catalysed by nitrite oxidoreductase nxr a membrane bound enzyme that was first isolated and characterized in nitrobacter by meincke et al 1992 fig 7 a 12 no 2 h 2 o no 3 2 h 2 e 13 0 5 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 14 no 2 0 5 o 2 no 3 6 1 hydroxylamine inhibits nob hydroxylamine is not an intermediate in nob metabolism but nob communities usually are found close to aob which are able to leak hydroxylamine table 1 hydroxylamine concentrations from 0 2 to 20 mg n l have been reported as a potent inhibitor of nob table 4 for instance castignetti and gunner 1982 reported inhibition of nitrobacter agilis by hydroxylamine at concentration of 5 mg nh2ohn l stuven et al 1992 also reported hydroxylamine inhibition of nitrobacter at concentrations of 1 mg nh2ohn l later hao and chen 1994 demonstrated hydroxylamine inhibition in nob by measuring nitrite build up in complete nitrification submerged filters by the addition of 2 5 5 mg n l moreover more than 30 days were needed to recover regular operation hao and chen 1994 concentration of less than 0 2 mg nnh2oh l were reported to inhibit nob by blackburne and co workers blackburne et al 2004 another indication that supports strong nob inhibition by hydroxylamine is the general trend observed that full nitrification fails accumulating nitrite when hydroxylamine is added to the system harper et al 2009 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 as discussed before hydroxylamine external addition in nitrification systems is used to inhibit nob either to obtain a stable partial nitrification operation or to achieve a rapid start up of a partial nitrification reactor li et al 2019a li et al 2019b wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 however the mechanism of hydroxylamine inhibition in nob is still unknown i e if it is affecting the gene expression interfering with cell compounds some studies refer to a reversible inhibition as far as full nitrification is restored with time after hydroxylamine exposure li et al 2019b wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 the only hypothetical theory is that the un protonated form of hydroxylamine can diffuse through the membrane and affect the gene expression yang and alleman 1992 specifically in a later study wang and co workers reported a decrease in nxra a gene related with nob wang et al 2016 another interesting observation is that nitrospira and nitrobacter might be differentially inhibited by hydroxylamine impacting more nitrospira than nitrobacter li et al 2019b in full nitrification and partial nitrification processes aob and nob populations are usually clustered together thus understanding further the impact of hydroxylamine on nob activity is vital as aob have been shown to transiently accumulate this compound addition of hydroxylamine has already been shown to promote a partial nitritation system over full nitrification wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 further understanding of this process hydroxylamine accumulation and effect on nob could contribute to avoid nob proliferation in partial nitritation anammox systems and further understand microbial community interactions 7 other wastewater treatment related microorganisms and their interactions with hydroxylamine aob aoa anammox and comammox are recognized consumers of hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine metabolism has been dedicatedly studied but still unknowns remain the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria by hydroxylamine has been dedicatedly studied particularly with the growing interest of implementing partial nitritation conversely heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria play a crucial role in engineered systems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps transforming nitrate to dinitrogen gas through nitrite no and n2o see fig 7b there is only very limited information on the impact of hydroxylamine on denitrifying bacteria a recent study showed that nitrite accumulation was favoured when dosing hydroxylamine to a complete denitrification reactor zhang et al 2020 batch tests with hydroxylamine dosing from 2 21 mg n l were also performed nitrate consumption seemed to be promoted at low hydroxylamine concentrations dosages 2 8 mg n l whereas nearly any nitrate consumption was observed during the first 20 min when hydroxylamine concentrations were higher than 14 mg n l interestingly nitrite accumulation was always higher when hydroxylamine was added in the batch tests nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir activity were also measured after hydroxylamine exposure showing a grater increase in nar activity than nir for increasing hydroxylamine doses the difference in enzymatic activities might explain the nitrite accumulation this was in agreement with the gene expression as napa expressions was up to 2 76 fold increased when hydroxylamine was dosed zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the impact of hydroxylamine on the subsequent steps no and n2o conversions was not investigated also the fact that ph 9 was used in this study might have impacted the results as hydroxylamine is mainly unprotonated thus it is able to diffuse through the membranes overall more studies confirming the observed trends by zhang et al 2020 would be needed specially performed at more usual ph 7 8 for wastewater treatment hydroxylamine usage capacity of dissimilatory nitrate reducers to ammonia dnra see fig 7c has been hypothesised based on the hydroxylamine detoxification capacity of some of their enzymes onr or εhao haase et al 2017 simon and klotz 2013 and hydroxylamine has been proposed as intermediate for nautilia profundicola hanson et al 2013 for both denitrifiers and dnra bacteria few studies are available and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of hydroxylamine finally it is worth mentioning other microorganisms that are able to use hydroxylamine and that might be involved in wastewater treatment engineered processes even not considered directly as part of the nitrogen cycle for instance heterotrophic aerobic bacteria with nitrification or and denitrification activity the pathway for nitrification encoded in these microorganisms includes hydroxylamine as intermediate stein 2011 for example photobacteriu sp liu et al 2019 alcaligenes faecalis joo et al 2005 sorokin 1989 sorokin and dubinina 1986 pseudomonas jetten et al 1997 or enterobacter padhi et al 2017 methanotrophs are also well known to have hydroxylamine oxidation capacity which is involved in nitrous and nitric oxide production by those microorganisms campbell et al 2011 stein and klotz 2011 versantvoort et al 2020 overall hydroxylamine oxidation capacity is widespread within microorganisms of the nitrogen cycle and others involved in wastewater treatment whereas it is also known to inhibit some of them to achieve a comprehensive picture of its role when shaping microbial communities further investigation on this compound in relation to the diverse n cycle conversion is needed 8 hydroxylamine presence might shape microbial communities and biofilms dynamics all of the microorganisms discussed in the present review are known to be found close together in the natural environment i e ocean soils and engineered systems where they typically grow in biofilms or aggregates i e wwtps kuypers et al 2018 thus microbial interactions between different communities occur and usually microbes rely on these interactions to get their substrate or to avoid product inhibition i e aob nob interactions in engineered systems such as wwtps the interaction between aob and nob and denitrifiers have been conventionally used to remove nitrogen from wastewater more recently other players such as anammox comammox or aoa have been added to the already complex community interactions in these kind of engineered systems microorganisms are usually found forming aggregates either as activated sludge granules or attached biofilms as we have seen in this review and according to literature aob aoa and comammox can leak hydroxylamine and it can be related to fluctuations of substrate oxygen in wwtps substrate fluctuations are usual but also within biofilm systems strong gradients occur thus fluctuations of substrate oxygen can be enhanced by the biofilm structure i e some cells that have been under starvation receive substrates when there is an increase in the bulk liquid concentration consequently hydroxylamine build up can be enhanced within a biofilm system this fact has already been proposed by mathematical simulations sabba et al 2015 another important factor that can impact hydroxylamine accumulation and usage by microorganisms is ph in a biofilm a ph gradient is generated with a more acidic ph in the inner core of the granule de beer et al 1993 poot et al 2016 schreiber et al 2009 uemura et al 2011 winkler et al 2011 acidic ph has been shown to strongly impact ammonium oxidation by nitrosomonas whereas hydroxylamine oxidation was barely affected frijlink et al 1992 this fact might favour hydroxylamine usage over ammonium by aob in inner layers of a biofilm system overall hydroxylamine build up due to aerobic ammonium oxidazing microorganisms can have an impact in other microbial communities such as anammox nob denitrifiers or the same neighbour clusters of aerobic ammonia oxidizers furthermore hydroxylamine can also trigger n2o emissions as it has been discussed thus hydroxylamine might have a yet not fully understood role when shaping microbial communities 9 hydroxylamine measurement the bottleneck in wastewater treatment related research hydroxylamine measurements are almost absent this is due to two factors i hydroxylamine available measurement techniques are laborious and really time consuming ii being usually an intermediate the method should be sensitive enough for the expected low concentrations nevertheless the fact that hydroxylamine is mutagenic and toxic compound for humans microorganisms and animals has brought the need of its adequate quantitative measurement in different fields kolasa and wardencki 1974 focusing on the measurements of hydroxylamine in water samples there are mainly two extended techniques used fig 8 i spectrophotometric technique based on the production of indooxine from the reaction of 8 quinolinol with hydroxylamine in presence of carbonate and ethyl alcohol which develops a green colour frear and burrell 1955 ii gas chromatography gc based method which relays on the measurement of n2o formed during the transformation of hydroxylamine to n2o catalysed by fe3 in sealed vials butler and gordon 1986 liu et al 2014 both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages briefly the spectrophotometric based technique can be easily implemented as it is a reactive based methodology which needs of general present laboratory equipment spectrophotometer water bath and pyrex tubes the use of a fume hood is necessary due to the toxicity of the chemicals used and it is a quite laborious method the gc based method has a lower detection range ca 0 001 mg n l than that of the spectrophotometric method ca 0 035 mg n l which might be useful for applications were concentrations of hydroxylamine are actually low however the need for a gc with an n2o detection method and ideally an autosampler might limit its implementation in many laboratories also a good determination of the n2o already present in the sample is crucial for an accurate hydroxylamine quantification liu et al 2014 both methods are known to be impacted by interferences like ph and salinity butler and gordon 1986 these interferences impact a lot the n2o recovery from hydroxylamine in the gc method thus a good pre treatment depending on the sample is needed liu et al 2014 independently of the method used pre treatment of samples and rapid analysis is generally extensive due to the high reactivity of hydroxylamine for example addition of sulfamic acid to the sample is used in both measurement techniques liu et al 2014 soler jofra et al 2016 with two purposes i acidify the sample to stabilize hydroxylamine and ii remove nitrite from the sample which has been shown to react with hydroxylamine and interferes in both methods liu et al 2014 soler jofra et al 2016 nevertheless time from sample collection to its analysis is still crucial long time storage is not possible the complexity of hydroxylamine measurement is one of the main limitations for understanding the role of this compound in the nitrogen cycle and n2o emissions thus developing of commercial available hydroxylamine sensors might be crucial for future research some preliminary results on the development of a hydroxylamine sensor have been reported foroughi et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 among others however to our knowledge there are no initiatives to have such sensors commercially available if such sensors would become available as happened for no and n2o sensors or an easier measurement method technique is developed it would boost hydroxylamine related research and our understanding of the nitrogen cycle 10 conclusions and future outlook here the current understanding of the role of hydroxylamine in the nitrogen cycle with special focus on the microbial communities involved in wastewater treatment has been presented hydroxylamine conversion is widespread within different nitrogen cycle microorganisms whereas some are negatively impacted by it we have highlighted that there are plenty of questions and unknowns about the role of hydroxylamine in the nitrogen cycle the key gap of knowledges are summarized as follows clarification on how hydroxylamine is converted to nitrite by aoa aob and comammox is needed so far there are biocatalytic evidences that hao transforms hydroxylamine to no in aob aoa do not harbour hao in their genome thus a different transformation of hydroxylamine has been proposed comammox pathway for this conversion is still to be mapped overall it will be interesting to assess if aerobic ammonia oxidizers have evolved differently on how to deal with the conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite transient accumulation of hydroxylamine is usually linked to a switch from low to maximum activity i e anoxic aerobic cycles batch tests sbr reactors the turnover of the differential enzymes involved in the transformation might be crucial in addition it seems to be a strain dependant trait ph might have a crucial role on hydroxylamine usage first because it affects the equilibrium between the protonated and unprotonated hydroxylamine form secondly because ammonium oxidation rate is highly impacted by ph whereas hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite is not thus ph being a potential contributor to hydroxylamine accumulation transient hydroxylamine accumulations seems also to be strain dependant in aerobic ammonium oxidizers as well as it differs between aob aoa and comammox differences on enzymatic level are hypothesised to the responsible for such observations hydroxylamine is involved in n2o emissions in aoa aob and comammox factors promoting n2o emissions from hydroxylamine are still to be fully understood anammox is known to be able to use hydroxylamine as substrate it is also proposed to be intermediate in ca brocadia whereas no is proposed to be the intermediate in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis nevertheless in ca kuenenia stuttgartinesis there is a high overexpression of hox an enzyme hypothesised to transform the leaking hydroxylamine from hzs to no thus the role of hydroxylamine in anammox is yet to be understood ph also impacts the equilibrium between the unprotonated free hydroxylamine and protonated form of hydroxylamine thus free hydroxylamine has the capacity to diffuse through the bacterial membranes this is hypothesised to be the cause of nob inhibition by hydroxylamine however it is yet to be demonstrated a similar inhibition mechanism might impact denitrifiers leading to nitrite accumulation overall there are a wide range of topics to be investigated regarding hydroxylamine and the nitrogen cycle below we provide some crucial points and recommendations for future research that will broaden our understanding of hydroxylamine developing an easy implemented hydroxylamine measurement technique would totally facilitate hydroxylamine related research either the use of sensors or an improved measuring technique that is not extremely labour intensive would lead to widespread hydroxylamine measurements in nitrogen related research developing an integrated research approach including a combination of transcriptomics proteomics enzymology and 15n tracer studies could help to further understand the mechanisms involved in hydroxylamine conversion and transient accumulation such an integrated approach will be crucial to map hydroxylamine conversion pathways as well as studying such conversions in microbial communities understanding hydroxylamine enzymatic conversions will help also on understanding no n2o production pathways thus helping on the design of mitigation strategies to conclude the main focus of nitrogen cycle research has usually been the substrates and end products of the microbial conversions more recently due to the urge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intermediates such as no and n2o started to be extensively studied the complexity of intermediate reactions and the lack of easily implemented techniques and methods for the usual low concentration measurements results in a hard topic of study nevertheless the central role of hydroxylamine as intermediate in the nitrogen cycle and its relation to n2o formation urges more

17239,aerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria were first isolated more than 100 years ago and hydroxylamine is known to be an intermediate the enzymatic steps involving hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite are still under discussion for a long time it was assumed that hydroxylamine was directly converted to nitrite by a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase recent enzymatic evidences suggest that the actual product of hydroxylamine conversion is no and a third yet unknown enzyme further converts no to nitrite more recently ammonium oxidizing archaea and complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria were isolated and identified still the central nitrogen metabolism of these microorganisms presents to researchers the same puzzle how hydroxylamine is transformed to nitrite nitrogen losses in the form of no and n2o have been identified in all three types of aerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms and hydroxylamine is known to play a significant role in the formation yet the pathways and the factors promoting the greenhouse gas emissions are to be fully characterized hydroxylamine also plays a yet poorly understood role on anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and is known to inhibit nitrite oxidizing bacteria in this review the role of this elusive intermediate in the metabolism of different key players of the nitrogen cycle is discussed as well as the putative importance of hydroxylamine as a key nitrogen metabolite for microbial interactions within microbial communities and engineered systems overall for the first time putting together the acquired knowledge about hydroxylamine and the nitrogen cycle over the years in a review setting potential hypothesis and highlighting possible next steps for research graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords intermediate ammonium oxidation nitrite oxidation anammox n2o emissions 1 hydroxylamine in the nitrogen cycle nitrogen is one of the essential elements on earth widely present in the environment as well as in living organisms the biggest reservoir of nitrogen on earth is dinitrogen gas n2 but it is too inert for most of living organisms to be directly incorporated into cellular structures kuypers et al 2018 microorganisms involved in the nitrogen cycle have different enzymes that catalyse all sorts of nitrogen conversions for example nitrogen fixers are able to transform dinitrogen gas to ammonium which makes nitrogen bioavailable to other microorganisms and other forms of life traditionally nitrogen cycle conversions have been classified in assimilation ammonification nitrification denitrification anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox and nitrogen fixation see some of them in fig 1 a however new microbial conversions have been discovered expanding the traditional processes fig 1b microbial conversions are responsible for the major fraction of the nitrogen fluxes between different nitrogen reservoirs on earth kuypers et al 2018 since the discovery of the haber bosch process which transforms dinitrogen gas to ammonium to produce fertilizers human intervention generated a large anthropogenic nitrogen flux on earth hampering the natural equilibrium eutrophication of waters and increased nitrous oxide emissions are typical examples of human generated problems related to the nitrogen cycle to mitigate such problems engineered systems like biological wastewater treatment plants wwtps are used where ammonium dissolved in water is transformed to dinitrogen gas using different nitrogen microbial conversions van loosdrecht and jetten 1998 thus detailed knowledge of the nitrogen cycle microorganisms is crucial to further understand both natural and anthropogenic nitrogen fluxes and avoid possible environmental problems hydroxylamine is an inorganic highly reactive compound that is intermediate or side metabolite in different nitrogen cycle microorganisms fig 1b c hydroxylamine impacts no and n2o emissions by aerobic ammonium oxidizers microorganisms the impact of this compound in other microorganisms of the nitrogen cycle is little studied to the best of our knowledge this review is the first to target the current knowledge about the role of hydroxylamine in the different communities of the nitrogen cycle the review aims to assess the current state of the art on the role of hydroxylamine in the conversions by the various microbial groups participating in the nitrogen cycle with a special focus on wastewater treatment processes the level of understanding and research related to hydroxylamine and the microorganisms transforming nitrogen is not the same for each microbial process in the nitrogen cycle aerobic and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing microorganisms are presented sections 2 to 5 as they are known to harbour hydroxylamine conversion capacity in their genomic inventory a wide range of studies investigated the role of hydroxylamine on ammonium oxidation bacteria and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria sections 2 and 5 respectively less information is available regarding the role of hydroxylamine in more recently discovered microorganisms such as ammonium oxidizing archaea or comammox sections 3 and 4 respectively nitrite oxidizing bacteria are not able to transform hydroxylamine but the inhibition of nitrite oxidizers by hydroxylamine might be of relevance when shaping nitrogen cycle communities this is analysed in section 6 the impact of hydroxylamine on other nitrogen cycle microorganisms such as denitrifiers or dissimilatory nitrate reducers to ammonium dnra organisms has been hardly investigated therefore only a brief analysis was included in section 7 in this section also other microorganisms that might be relevant for wastewater treatment are mentioned finally the bottlenecks for hydroxylamine measurement its role as a putative interaction compound in microbial nitrogen cycling communities and research challenges regarding this compound are discussed in the last sections sections 8 to 10 2 ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob are able to transform ammonium to nitrite with oxygen as electron acceptor these microorganisms are aerobic chemolithoautotrophic bacteria comprised in the beta and gamma subdivision of proteobacteria teske et al 1994 aob catabolism consists of the conversion of ammonium to nitrite as electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor as in eq 1 in aob this reaction is divided in two steps first the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase amo catalyses the oxidation of nh4 to nh2oh eq 2 afterwards hydroxylamine is further converted to no2 by hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao eq 3 see fig 2 a two of the electrons generated in this last step are used by amo to catalyse the first reaction whereas the rest is invested in energy generation yu and chandran 2010 1 nh 4 1 5 o 2 no 2 2 h h 2 o 2 nh 4 o 2 2 h 2 e n h 2 oh h 2 o 3 n h 2 oh h 2 o no 2 5 h 4 e recently it was suggested that the product of hao is no instead of nitrite and that no is disproportionated abiotically or by an unknown enzyme to nitrite caranto and lancaster 2017 thus first ammonium is oxidized to hydroxylamine by amo eq 2 hydroxylamine to no by hao eq 4 and no to nitrite eq 5 by an uncharacterized enzyme a proteomic comparative study has recently suggested that nitrosocyanin ncya was highly expressed in 3 different aob strains and was proposed as this third missing enzyme stein 2019 see fig 2b nevertheless the activity of hao producing no has only been shown in vitro thus further confirmation of this pathway in vivo is needed in vivo metabolic studies in combination with transcriptomics proteomics studies could shed light into another putative enzyme being able to convert hydroxylamine to nitrite 4 n h 2 oh no 3 h 3 e 5 no h 2 o no 2 2 h 1 e beyond hydroxylamine as an intermediate in aob metabolism other putative roles of hydroxylamine are known hydroxylamine has been shown to transiently accumulate in aob planktonic or mixed cultures which might lead to interactions with other nitrogen communities the short and long term impact of hydroxylamine has been tested in aob without reaching definitive conclusions finally it is known to be a precursor to n2o emissions all these roles are discussed in depth in the following sections 2 1 hydroxylamine transient accumulation events since hydroxylamine first mention mumford 1914 as intermediate and identification by lees lees 1952 it has been shown that it can transiently accumulate in the bulk liquid during cultivation at concentrations from 0 003 up to 4 3 mg n l table 1 these accumulations were reported in a wide variety of nitrification systems and operation conditions for example when performing batch tests with axenic cultures liu et al 2017 stüven et al 1992 or nitrifying cultures yang and alleman 1992 when aob axenic chemostat cultures were switched from anoxic to aerobic conditions yu and chandran 2010 yu et al 2018 or when partial nitrifying reactors were operated in sequencing batch mode hu et al 2017 su et al 2019b also hydroxylamine accumulated when a change of reactor load was imposed to a continuous partial nitrification airlift reactor leading to an increase of ammonium accumulation from 2 to 25 mg n l poot et al 2016 hu et al also observed hydroxylamine accumulation in a continuous reactor when imposing a change of load but higher load did not correlate with a change of the hydroxylamine accumulation peak hu et al 2017 overall all the mentioned experiments table 1 showed that switching aob cells from a resting state i e without low ammonium or oxygen to an active state i e with ammonium or oxygen triggered hydroxylamine accumulation indicating that hydroxylamine accumulation depended on the unbalanced coupling between the production and consumption of hydroxylamine by the designated enzymes thus if amo produces hydroxylamine faster than can be converted by hao and other consumption reactions or the recently proposed still unknown enzyme caranto and lancaster 2017 are able to consume hydroxylamine a metabolic imbalance is created leading to the observed hydroxylamine accumulation different studies point out that hydroxylamine accumulation can also be strain dependant for instance nitrosomonas europaea and nitrosospira multiformis accumulated hydroxylamine up to 11 and 31 µg n l respectively liu et al 2017 in contrast other aob strains such as nitrosomonas nitrosa nm90 and nitrosomonas communis did not show hydroxylamine accumulation in batch tests with the same initial ammonium concentrations liu et al 2017 the authors attributed the differences observed for hydroxylamine accumulation levels to differences in the ammonia consumption rates for example n multiformis showed the highest ammonium consumption rate also resulting in the highest hydroxylamine accumulation liu et al 2017 nevertheless n communis had the fastest ammonium uptake rate but no hydroxylamine accumulation was detected which might be due to a more efficient hydroxylamine conversion to nitrite by hao liu et al 2017 another study indicating that hydroxylamine accumulation is strain dependant and might also depend on the surrounding nitrogen community was performed by stüven and coworkers stüven et al 1992 for instance nitrosovibrio did not accumulate hydroxylamine when it was cultured alone and yet hydroxylamine accumulation 5 6 23 8 µg n l occurred when it was cultured together with the nob nitrobacter stüven et al 1992 contrarily in the same set of experiments nitrosomonas europaea showed hydroxylamine accumulation 2 8 15 4 µg n l when it was cultured alone but in co culture with nitrobacter lower hydroxylamine levels where reported 5 6 to less than 2 8 µg n l stüven et al 1992 this is the only study that point towards a possible impact of side communities to the hydroxylamine accumulation behaviour of aob strains the differential behaviour related to hydroxylamine accumulation when aob was cultured alone or together with nob might be due to a possible competition strategy to avoid nob growth in the co culture or to promote it to avoid product inhibition thus far the impact of side communities on hydroxylamine accumulation has been little studied and it is still not fully understood the unbalance between hydroxylamine production and consumption leading to hydroxylamine accumulation might have different explanations i the turnover of hao or the enzyme responsible of hydroxylamine consumption is smaller than the capacity of amo to produce hydroxylamine genetic differences between different species in the hydroxylamine production and consumption enzymes could explain the different hydroxylamine accumulation dynamics observed between species ii ph can be another factor that might cause hydroxylamine build up as ph has an impact on both the dissociation of ammonium hydroxylamine as well as it has a strong impact on the enzymes rates su et al 2019b for instance ammonium consumption is strongly impacted by acidification while hydroxylamine oxidation is barely affected frijlink et al 1992 this could be of importance in biofilm like systems where strong ph gradients can occur and ph is more acidic in the internal part of the granule de beer et al 1993 gieseke et al 2006 poot et al 2016 schreiber et al 2009 uemura et al 2011 winkler et al 2011 future studies might shed more light on the difference in balancing the production and consumption of hydroxylamine in different aob for example comparative transcriptomic proteomic between aob strains studies focused on enzymatic activities and affinities comparison or research focused on characterizing external factors promoting hydroxylamine accumulation 2 2 effect of hydroxylamine dosing in ammonium oxidizing bacteria several studies have investigated the effect of externally added hydroxylamine on ammonium oxidizing bacteria table 2 since hydroxylamine first discovery as intermediate of nitrification one of the initial questions was if hydroxylamine could be used for growth two parallel studies have shown that different species of aob are able to use hydroxylamine mixotrophically together with ammonium for growth böttcher and koops 1994 de bruijn et al 1995 both studies böttcher and koops 1994 de bruijn et al 1995 reported a higher experimental growth yield than the theoretically expected when using a mixture of hydroxylamine and ammonium as substrate so far it is not fully understood why and how hydroxylamine boosts the growth in addition to our knowledge it is still not shown if aob can grow on hydroxylamine as single substrate other studies have focused on the short term effect of externally added hydroxylamine to ammonium oxidation using batch tests or respirometry tests when providing ammonium to an aob batch culture usually there is a lag period or so called acceleration phase which is the time that the culture needs to switch from a slower ammonium consumption to maximum consumption rate chandran and smets 2008 different studies showed that externally added hydroxylamine accelerated this initial ammonium uptake rate chandran and smets 2008 de bruijn et al 1995 harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 the externally added hydroxylamine to a biofilm system led to disaggregation from microcolonies to scattered cells harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 based on these results two different hypotheses on why hydroxylamine accelerates the ammonium uptake rate were proposed chandran and smets 2008 harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 i hydroxylamine impacts the cell morphology scattering the cells and having a higher cell area available so an increased mass transfer leading to higher ammonium uptakes ii electrons obtained in the hydroxylamine transformation to nitrite are recirculated to amo enzyme which triggers its activity increasing ammonium consumption conventional nitrogen removal in wwtps was traditionally performed by combination of nitrification and denitrification processes since the discovery of anammox the possibility to combine partial nitrification with anammox has been intensively studied partial nitrification anammox technologies offer the opportunity to lower wwtps costs however one of the bottlenecks for its implementation is the stable operation of partial nitrification and efficient repression of nob cao et al 2017 hydroxylamine has been used to recover partial nitrification in reactors where nitrate started to accumulate wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 in these studies hydroxylamine dosing combined with proper reactor operation triggered the stabilization of partial nitrification in both studies the activity of aob was not hampered whereas nob were inhibited as nitrate stopped accumulating in the reactor wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 a rapid start up of partial nitrification reactors was also achieved by hydroxylamine addition for example intermittent dosing of hydroxylamine in up flow biofilm reactor okabe et al 2011 or sbr li et al 2019a li et al 2019b helped to speeding up the start up of a partial nitritation process a stable partial nitritation was maintained only if after stopping hydroxylamine dosage a proper reactor control was implemented li et al 2019a overall hydroxylamine showed to be efficient in inhibiting nitrite oxidation to nitrate see next section not damaging and even promoting aob activity in most of the studies böttcher and koops 1994 de bruijn et al 1995 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 however there are other studies that claim that long term exposure to hydroxylamine hampered aob activity harper et al 2009 and even an inhibition model for aob has been proposed wan et al 2016 in addition the observed negative effect of hydroxylamine on mixed cultures biofilm like structures harper et al 2009 kindaichi et al 2004 will not be desirable in certain operational modes which rely on biofilm systems i e granule biofilm carriers most of the long term hydroxylamine studies have been performed using a pulse feeding strategy which leads to initially high hydroxylamine concentrations table 2 furthermore hydroxylamine feeding was mostly added temporarily for a start up period or to promote partial nitritation these exposures to sudden high hydroxylamine concentrations are not likely to occur in natural environments thus far the only study with continuous and limiting hydroxylamine concentration was performed by de bruijn et al 1995 with nitrosomonas europaea using hydroxylamine limiting conditions can help to understand the mechanisms i e over or under regulation of genes proteins by which hydroxylamine is promoting or hampering aob activity in nitrification environments without the potential inhibitive effects of hydroxylamine 2 3 n2o production from hydroxylamine in addition to the regular ammonia oxidation metabolism two possible pathways have been proposed in order to explain the nitrogen loss in form of nitric or nitrous oxide gasses during nitritation i nitrifier denitrification which involves the reduction of no2 to no and n2o by a nitrite reductase nir and nitric oxide reductase nor respectively it has been suggested that this pathway is predominant at low oxygen concentrations kozlowski et al 2014 ii hydroxylamine oxidation that involves the oxidation of nh2oh to no by hao then no can be further converted to n2o by nor n2o production through this pathway is thought to be favoured at higher o2 concentrations hooper and terry 1979 klotz and stein 2011 kozlowski et al 2014 fig 3 however recent studies have highlighted the occurrence and contribution of other pathways to the total n2o emissions caranto et al 2016 soler jofra et al 2016 terada et al 2017 most of these new proposed pathways have hydroxylamine as substrate briefly caranto et al showed that the cytochrome p460 of hao can directly produce n2o from hydroxylamine caranto et al 2016 besides biological conversion hydroxylamine has been shown to react chemically by either disproportionation or with medium components such as fe mn or hno2 resulting in n2o formation see heil et al 2015 schreiber et al 2012 for detailed reactions two different studies showed independently the occurrence of a chemical reaction between nitrite and hydroxylamine at conditions relevant for wastewater treatment harper et al 2015 soler jofra et al 2016 furthermore the chemical n2o production rate by the reaction of hydroxylamine and nitrite or the protonated form nitrous acid was comparable to the biological n2o production rates soler jofra et al 2018 terada et al 2017 contradicting results were presented by su and co workers su et al 2019a proposing that abiotic reactions would only be relevant at acidic ph all mentioned studies soler jofra et al 2018 soler jofra et al 2016 su et al 2019a terada et al 2017 were performed with different medium compositions and the impact of different compounds to the putative final reported rates is yet unknown for instance performing the same test with demineralized water or synthetic medium increased the hydroxylamine disproportionation by 2 to 22 fold su et al 2019a however abiotic tests containing both free nitrous acid and hydroxylamine were only performed with demineralized water at neutral ph su et al 2019a at ph 8 when free nitrous acid concentration is really low the reaction rate increased by at least one order of magnitude when using medium instead of demineralized water su et al 2019a thus from our point of view it is unclear if ph and or medium compounds are both important when determining the chemical reaction rate consequently we suggest that the kinetic characterization of hydroxylamine abiotic reactions and the impact of different environmental conditions i e trace elements concentrations iron and others is of relevance to understand this process properly even more importantly the impact of a real wastewater matrix into such reactions is yet to be studied from an engineering point of view n2o mitigation strategies in wastewater treatment have already been implemented even if the actual conversions behind the emissions are not fully understood kampschreur et al 2008 to improve these strategies a more in depth understanding of the pathways contributing to the total n2o emissions is needed this would help to identify the factors promoting n2o emissions and to include this knowledge in the design of wastewater treatment process instead of applying mitigation strategies after operation started the challenge is to develop a methodology that allows to identify the pathways contribution to the total n2o emissions as well as studying the factors impacting them the large number of compounds and microbial groups involved combined with potential chemical conversions makes this a difficult task for example implementing a comprehensive approach including a combination of 15n tracer studies natural isotope signatures modelling and transcriptomics proteomics might be needed to be able to fully differentiate between pathways duan et al 2017 overall hydroxylamine has been shown for years to be a promotor of n2o emissions which has a 300 fold larger warming potential than that of co2 thus further understanding the factors promoting n2o emissions from hydroxylamine will help in the design of mitigation strategies 3 ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa ammonium oxidizing archaea aoa were firstly identified using genomic tools as the detected amo gene was corresponding with an archaeon scaffold treusch et al 2005 venter et al 2004 later the first isolation of an aoa microorganisms demonstrated its abilities to oxidize ammonium to nitrite könneke et al 2005 aoa might play an important role in nitrification in environments such as the oceans and soils where substrates are usually found at low concentrations and aoa high ammonium affinities allow its survival stahl and de la torre 2012 wuchter et al 2006 also nitrifying drinking water filters are often reported to contain aoa erguder et al 2009 kasuga et al 2010 van der wielen et al 2009 due to their phylogenetic differences with other archaea aoa were proposed to be classified inside a new phylum in the archaea domain thaumarchaeota brochier armanet et al 2008 the first pure culture aoa was obtained 12 years ago könneke et al 2005 as their bacterial counterparts its central nitrogen metabolism is still under discussion for instance amo enzyme is conserved in all known aoa but no hao homologues have been identified hatzenpichler 2012 lancaster et al 2018 stein 2019 vajrala et al 2013 thus the conversion of ammonium to hydroxylamine eq 2 has been proposed to be conserved and catalysed by the archaeal amo enzyme the further conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite is under consideration as it occurs with aob and comammox the fact that no hao homologues have been detected in the aoa genome led to two possible central nitrogen metabolic models stein 2019 i a copper complex uses no and nh2oh to form two molecules of nitrite nirk enzyme is involved in the transformation of nitrite to no fig 4 a ii two enzymes consecutively oxidize nh2oh to no and no to nitrite proposed to be mediated by nirk or an uncharacterized copper complex fig 4b to the yet not fully resolved hydroxylamine to nitrite conversion pathway it must be added the lack of cytochrome c type proteins usually performing the electron transportation in aob respiration instead a copper based electron transport system has been postulated as a high number of protein copper domains have been identified in the genome stahl and de la torre 2012 walker et al 2010 regarding no and n2o emissions aoa are not capable to perform nitrifier denitrification kozlowski et al 2016b stieglmeier et al 2014 as no n2o was formed with limited oxygen supply isotopic signature also suggested that the nitrogen found in n2o comes from both ammonium and nitrite stieglmeier et al 2014 thus n2o production was linked to ammonium conversion and proposed that hydroxylamine or n intermediates abiotically react leading to n2o kozlowski et al 2016a stieglmeier et al 2014 due to its relatively recent identification few experiments used or measured hydroxylamine in aoa cultures so far externally added hydroxylamine has been used to demonstrate its role as intermediate and postulate that hydroxylamine oxidation is coupled to atp generation in nitrosopumilus maritimus vajrala et al 2013 in addition externally added hydroxylamine concentrations of 14 m n l showed to completely inhibit n maritimus vajrala et al 2013 which indicates a higher sensitivity to hydroxylamine exposure of aoa to that observed in aob table 2 nevertheless to our knowledge no other studies of batch or continuous exposure to externally added hydroxylamine of other aoa strains have been reported yet thus a differential behaviour of aoa strains to hydroxylamine exposure remains to be investigated hydroxylamine transient accumulation has been shown to occur in aoa cultures also pointing towards a differential strain behaviour towards hydroxylamine accumulation liu et al 2017 for example n gragensis only released hydroxylamine 4 6 μg n l when incubated with 28 mg n l ammonium but not with 7 mg n l n uzonensis produced hydroxylamine with both ammonium initial concentrations of 7 and 28 mg n l and reached higher concentrations 4 8 μg n l when incubated with the higher ammonium concentrations contrarily n viennensis and ca n sp nd2 did not produce hydroxylamine thus the hydroxylamine accumulation strain dependency observed in aob seems to also be a differential strain trait of aoa overall the recent identification and isolation of aoa presents still unresolved questions such as the central nitrogen metabolism further characterization of the no n2o emissions or the differential strain response to hydroxylamine accumulation and exposure 4 complete ammonium oxidizing bacteria comammox since nitrification first discovery it was always thought that ammonium oxidation to nitrate involved a two step microbial conversion involving aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob complete ammonium oxidation to nitrate by a single microorganism was predicted thermodynamically possible costa et al 2006 but overlooked for years until two independent studies demonstrated its existence daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 complete ammonium oxidating comammox bacteria were first identified in two parallel studies demonstrating that they have all the cell machinery to oxidize ammonium to nitrite and further to nitrate daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 mainly two reasons prevented comammox identification for so many years i aob dedicated qpcr primers targeting amo gene were not covering the comammox amoa gene due to only ca 60 amino acid identity ii 16s rrna sequencing does not allow to distinguish comammox from nob thus comammox were usually misclassified as canonical nob lawson and lücker 2018 the current running hypothesis for the central metabolism of comammox is postulated to involve amo hao and nxr enzymes as copies of all the genes encoding for these enzymes have been found in the genome daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 thus ammonium is first transformed to hydroxylamine by amo hydroxylamine is further oxidized to nitrite by hao and finally nitrite is converted to nitrate by nxr fig 5 a as well as for aob and aoa the occurrence of a third intermediate step involving hao converting nh2oh only to no and a further conversion of no to nitrite is under discussion kits et al 2019 fig 5b as discussed previously ncya has been hypothesised to be a lacking third enzyme for aob however yet no ncya encoding gene has been found in the available comammox genomic data camejo et al 2017 kits et al 2019 palomo et al 2018 thus the hypothesis of comammox encoding a no oxidoreductase in the genome has not been confirmed yet the first kinetic analysis of the first isolate nitrospira inopinata kits et al 2017 showed a low ammonium half saturation coefficient high affinity for ammonium and a high growth yield compared to that of aob or aoa this is in agreement with the theoretical higher growth yield prediction costa et al 2006 as well as the comammox distribution in the environment lawson and lücker 2018 as comammox has been detected at substrate depleted zones lawson and lücker 2018 thus low ammonium affinity constant and high growth yield allows them to thrive in such minimal environments due to its recent discovery little is known about the role of hydroxylamine besides being involved as intermediate in the central metabolism regarding hydroxylamine transient accumulation liu and co workers showed hydroxylamine accumulation in batch like experiments up to 6 μg n l even calculated hydroxylamine accumulation could have been up to 25 to 132 μg n l depending on the initial ammonium concentration used liu et al 2017 a recent study also postulated towards abiotically formed n2o from hydroxylamine as the main comammox emission source kits et al 2019 overall due to its novelty and recent discovery there is plenty of room for research to further understand the hydroxylamine role in comammox metabolism among others the characterization of hydroxylamine build up in cultures the impact of externally added hydroxylamine in the metabolism or the involvement of hydroxylamine in n2o emissions 5 anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox ammonium conversion without oxygen even predicted thermodynamically favourable broda 1977 was thought inexistent until the discovery of anammox mulder et al 1995 anammox bacteria are able to transform ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas autotrophically and anoxically jetten et al 1998 the central metabolism of anammox has been a hot topic of research since its discovery hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 oshiki et al 2016 strous et al 1998 van de graaf et al 1997 among others hydroxylamine was initially hypothesized to be an intermediate of the anammox conversion as when it was added to anammox cultures hydrazine accumulated jetten et al 1998 van de graaf et al 1997 since then hydroxylamine addition hydrazine accumulation experiments have been used as characteristic activity tests to demonstrate anammox activity in enrichment cultures egli et al 2001 jetten et al 1998 among others later no was proposed to be intermediate of the central nitrogen metabolism instead of hydroxylamine kartal et al 2011 the current hypothesis for the anammox nitrogen metabolism consists of three reactions first a nitrite oxidase nir enzyme converts nitrite to no eq 6 then no reacts with nh4 and form hydrazine n2h4 eq 7 catalysed by hydrazine synthase hzs finally hydrazine dehydrogenase hds further converts hydrazine to dinitrogen gas eq 8 fig 6 6 no 2 2 h e no h 2 o 7 no nh 4 2 h 3 e n 2 h 4 h 2 o 8 n 2 h 4 n 2 4 h 4 e 5 1 the yet unknown role of hydroxylamine in anammox bacteria hydroxylamine role in the anammox metabolism is still not fully understood for instance not all anammox strains i e ca brocadia spp encode the nir enzyme oshiki et al 2015 consequently either another enzyme like the one encoded in the gene kustc0458 is doing the job hu et al 2019 or hydroxylamine is involved in the pathway oshiki et al 2016 another surprising and characteristic trait is that hydroxylamine oxidase hox which converts hydroxylamine to no is one of the most highly expressed enzymes in anammox hu et al 2019 kartal et al 2011 thus anammox is investing energy and nutrients on keeping a high hox protein content in the cell which is puzzling if hydroxylamine does not have an important role in the metabolism fig 6 the only hypothesis to explain this high hox expression is that hzs enzyme can leak hydroxylamine and hox is able to transform any leaking of hydroxylamine back to no dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 precisely it is proposed that in hzs catalytic centre no is actually transformed to hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine is reacting with ammonium to form hydrazine dietl et al 2015 kartal and keltjens 2016 another explanation for this high hox expression is that hydroxylamine might be important in anammox like environments overall the role of hydroxylamine in the anammox metabolism remains as yet poorly understood externally added hydroxylamine in form of batch tests had different outcomes table 3 i when hydroxylamine was added accumulation of hydrazine occurs which has been used to demonstrate anammox activity egli et al 2001 jetten et al 1998 ii hydroxylamine has been shown to boost the anammox activity hu et al 2011 zekker et al 2012 iii hydroxylamine addition allowed to characterize anammox hydroxylamine metabolism van de graaf et al 1997 van der star et al 2008 hydroxylamine anammox metabolism occurs via disproportionation to ammonium and dinitrogen gas eq 9 however during this disproportionation hydrazine accumulation occurs the accumulation is due to an imbalance between the two reactions involved in hydroxylamine disproportionation that produce eq 10 and consumes hydrazine eq 11 respectively van der star et al 2008 9 3 n h 2 oh h nh 4 n 2 3 h 2 o 10 nh 4 n h 2 oh n 2 h 4 h 2 o h 11 2 n h 2 oh n 2 h 4 2 h 2 nh 4 n 2 2 h 2 o co metabolisation of other substrates with hydroxylamine impacts its metabolism soler jofra et al 2020 continuous and limiting addition of hydroxylamine to anammox showed to decrease the stoichiometric nitrate needed for growth and reported no negative impact on the anammox community soler jofra et al 2020 thus anammox could use hydroxylamine and survive in environments where it is present 6 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria perform the second step of nitrification catalysing the conversion of nitrite to nitrate with oxygen as electron acceptor up to date 7 genera have been described belonging to 6 different phyla in α β γ proteobacteria daims et al 2016 nob couple the nitrite oxidation to nitrate as electron donor eq 12 with oxygen respiration as electron acceptor eq 13 resulting in nob central nitrogen catabolism eq 14 nitrite oxidation to nitrate is catalysed by nitrite oxidoreductase nxr a membrane bound enzyme that was first isolated and characterized in nitrobacter by meincke et al 1992 fig 7 a 12 no 2 h 2 o no 3 2 h 2 e 13 0 5 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 14 no 2 0 5 o 2 no 3 6 1 hydroxylamine inhibits nob hydroxylamine is not an intermediate in nob metabolism but nob communities usually are found close to aob which are able to leak hydroxylamine table 1 hydroxylamine concentrations from 0 2 to 20 mg n l have been reported as a potent inhibitor of nob table 4 for instance castignetti and gunner 1982 reported inhibition of nitrobacter agilis by hydroxylamine at concentration of 5 mg nh2ohn l stuven et al 1992 also reported hydroxylamine inhibition of nitrobacter at concentrations of 1 mg nh2ohn l later hao and chen 1994 demonstrated hydroxylamine inhibition in nob by measuring nitrite build up in complete nitrification submerged filters by the addition of 2 5 5 mg n l moreover more than 30 days were needed to recover regular operation hao and chen 1994 concentration of less than 0 2 mg nnh2oh l were reported to inhibit nob by blackburne and co workers blackburne et al 2004 another indication that supports strong nob inhibition by hydroxylamine is the general trend observed that full nitrification fails accumulating nitrite when hydroxylamine is added to the system harper et al 2009 wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 as discussed before hydroxylamine external addition in nitrification systems is used to inhibit nob either to obtain a stable partial nitrification operation or to achieve a rapid start up of a partial nitrification reactor li et al 2019a li et al 2019b wang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 however the mechanism of hydroxylamine inhibition in nob is still unknown i e if it is affecting the gene expression interfering with cell compounds some studies refer to a reversible inhibition as far as full nitrification is restored with time after hydroxylamine exposure li et al 2019b wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 the only hypothetical theory is that the un protonated form of hydroxylamine can diffuse through the membrane and affect the gene expression yang and alleman 1992 specifically in a later study wang and co workers reported a decrease in nxra a gene related with nob wang et al 2016 another interesting observation is that nitrospira and nitrobacter might be differentially inhibited by hydroxylamine impacting more nitrospira than nitrobacter li et al 2019b in full nitrification and partial nitrification processes aob and nob populations are usually clustered together thus understanding further the impact of hydroxylamine on nob activity is vital as aob have been shown to transiently accumulate this compound addition of hydroxylamine has already been shown to promote a partial nitritation system over full nitrification wang et al 2015 xu et al 2012 further understanding of this process hydroxylamine accumulation and effect on nob could contribute to avoid nob proliferation in partial nitritation anammox systems and further understand microbial community interactions 7 other wastewater treatment related microorganisms and their interactions with hydroxylamine aob aoa anammox and comammox are recognized consumers of hydroxylamine and hydroxylamine metabolism has been dedicatedly studied but still unknowns remain the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria by hydroxylamine has been dedicatedly studied particularly with the growing interest of implementing partial nitritation conversely heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria play a crucial role in engineered systems such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps transforming nitrate to dinitrogen gas through nitrite no and n2o see fig 7b there is only very limited information on the impact of hydroxylamine on denitrifying bacteria a recent study showed that nitrite accumulation was favoured when dosing hydroxylamine to a complete denitrification reactor zhang et al 2020 batch tests with hydroxylamine dosing from 2 21 mg n l were also performed nitrate consumption seemed to be promoted at low hydroxylamine concentrations dosages 2 8 mg n l whereas nearly any nitrate consumption was observed during the first 20 min when hydroxylamine concentrations were higher than 14 mg n l interestingly nitrite accumulation was always higher when hydroxylamine was added in the batch tests nitrate reductase nar and nitrite reductase nir activity were also measured after hydroxylamine exposure showing a grater increase in nar activity than nir for increasing hydroxylamine doses the difference in enzymatic activities might explain the nitrite accumulation this was in agreement with the gene expression as napa expressions was up to 2 76 fold increased when hydroxylamine was dosed zhang et al 2020 nevertheless the impact of hydroxylamine on the subsequent steps no and n2o conversions was not investigated also the fact that ph 9 was used in this study might have impacted the results as hydroxylamine is mainly unprotonated thus it is able to diffuse through the membranes overall more studies confirming the observed trends by zhang et al 2020 would be needed specially performed at more usual ph 7 8 for wastewater treatment hydroxylamine usage capacity of dissimilatory nitrate reducers to ammonia dnra see fig 7c has been hypothesised based on the hydroxylamine detoxification capacity of some of their enzymes onr or εhao haase et al 2017 simon and klotz 2013 and hydroxylamine has been proposed as intermediate for nautilia profundicola hanson et al 2013 for both denitrifiers and dnra bacteria few studies are available and no conclusions can be drawn regarding the impact of hydroxylamine finally it is worth mentioning other microorganisms that are able to use hydroxylamine and that might be involved in wastewater treatment engineered processes even not considered directly as part of the nitrogen cycle for instance heterotrophic aerobic bacteria with nitrification or and denitrification activity the pathway for nitrification encoded in these microorganisms includes hydroxylamine as intermediate stein 2011 for example photobacteriu sp liu et al 2019 alcaligenes faecalis joo et al 2005 sorokin 1989 sorokin and dubinina 1986 pseudomonas jetten et al 1997 or enterobacter padhi et al 2017 methanotrophs are also well known to have hydroxylamine oxidation capacity which is involved in nitrous and nitric oxide production by those microorganisms campbell et al 2011 stein and klotz 2011 versantvoort et al 2020 overall hydroxylamine oxidation capacity is widespread within microorganisms of the nitrogen cycle and others involved in wastewater treatment whereas it is also known to inhibit some of them to achieve a comprehensive picture of its role when shaping microbial communities further investigation on this compound in relation to the diverse n cycle conversion is needed 8 hydroxylamine presence might shape microbial communities and biofilms dynamics all of the microorganisms discussed in the present review are known to be found close together in the natural environment i e ocean soils and engineered systems where they typically grow in biofilms or aggregates i e wwtps kuypers et al 2018 thus microbial interactions between different communities occur and usually microbes rely on these interactions to get their substrate or to avoid product inhibition i e aob nob interactions in engineered systems such as wwtps the interaction between aob and nob and denitrifiers have been conventionally used to remove nitrogen from wastewater more recently other players such as anammox comammox or aoa have been added to the already complex community interactions in these kind of engineered systems microorganisms are usually found forming aggregates either as activated sludge granules or attached biofilms as we have seen in this review and according to literature aob aoa and comammox can leak hydroxylamine and it can be related to fluctuations of substrate oxygen in wwtps substrate fluctuations are usual but also within biofilm systems strong gradients occur thus fluctuations of substrate oxygen can be enhanced by the biofilm structure i e some cells that have been under starvation receive substrates when there is an increase in the bulk liquid concentration consequently hydroxylamine build up can be enhanced within a biofilm system this fact has already been proposed by mathematical simulations sabba et al 2015 another important factor that can impact hydroxylamine accumulation and usage by microorganisms is ph in a biofilm a ph gradient is generated with a more acidic ph in the inner core of the granule de beer et al 1993 poot et al 2016 schreiber et al 2009 uemura et al 2011 winkler et al 2011 acidic ph has been shown to strongly impact ammonium oxidation by nitrosomonas whereas hydroxylamine oxidation was barely affected frijlink et al 1992 this fact might favour hydroxylamine usage over ammonium by aob in inner layers of a biofilm system overall hydroxylamine build up due to aerobic ammonium oxidazing microorganisms can have an impact in other microbial communities such as anammox nob denitrifiers or the same neighbour clusters of aerobic ammonia oxidizers furthermore hydroxylamine can also trigger n2o emissions as it has been discussed thus hydroxylamine might have a yet not fully understood role when shaping microbial communities 9 hydroxylamine measurement the bottleneck in wastewater treatment related research hydroxylamine measurements are almost absent this is due to two factors i hydroxylamine available measurement techniques are laborious and really time consuming ii being usually an intermediate the method should be sensitive enough for the expected low concentrations nevertheless the fact that hydroxylamine is mutagenic and toxic compound for humans microorganisms and animals has brought the need of its adequate quantitative measurement in different fields kolasa and wardencki 1974 focusing on the measurements of hydroxylamine in water samples there are mainly two extended techniques used fig 8 i spectrophotometric technique based on the production of indooxine from the reaction of 8 quinolinol with hydroxylamine in presence of carbonate and ethyl alcohol which develops a green colour frear and burrell 1955 ii gas chromatography gc based method which relays on the measurement of n2o formed during the transformation of hydroxylamine to n2o catalysed by fe3 in sealed vials butler and gordon 1986 liu et al 2014 both techniques have their advantages and disadvantages briefly the spectrophotometric based technique can be easily implemented as it is a reactive based methodology which needs of general present laboratory equipment spectrophotometer water bath and pyrex tubes the use of a fume hood is necessary due to the toxicity of the chemicals used and it is a quite laborious method the gc based method has a lower detection range ca 0 001 mg n l than that of the spectrophotometric method ca 0 035 mg n l which might be useful for applications were concentrations of hydroxylamine are actually low however the need for a gc with an n2o detection method and ideally an autosampler might limit its implementation in many laboratories also a good determination of the n2o already present in the sample is crucial for an accurate hydroxylamine quantification liu et al 2014 both methods are known to be impacted by interferences like ph and salinity butler and gordon 1986 these interferences impact a lot the n2o recovery from hydroxylamine in the gc method thus a good pre treatment depending on the sample is needed liu et al 2014 independently of the method used pre treatment of samples and rapid analysis is generally extensive due to the high reactivity of hydroxylamine for example addition of sulfamic acid to the sample is used in both measurement techniques liu et al 2014 soler jofra et al 2016 with two purposes i acidify the sample to stabilize hydroxylamine and ii remove nitrite from the sample which has been shown to react with hydroxylamine and interferes in both methods liu et al 2014 soler jofra et al 2016 nevertheless time from sample collection to its analysis is still crucial long time storage is not possible the complexity of hydroxylamine measurement is one of the main limitations for understanding the role of this compound in the nitrogen cycle and n2o emissions thus developing of commercial available hydroxylamine sensors might be crucial for future research some preliminary results on the development of a hydroxylamine sensor have been reported foroughi et al 2014 zhang et al 2010 among others however to our knowledge there are no initiatives to have such sensors commercially available if such sensors would become available as happened for no and n2o sensors or an easier measurement method technique is developed it would boost hydroxylamine related research and our understanding of the nitrogen cycle 10 conclusions and future outlook here the current understanding of the role of hydroxylamine in the nitrogen cycle with special focus on the microbial communities involved in wastewater treatment has been presented hydroxylamine conversion is widespread within different nitrogen cycle microorganisms whereas some are negatively impacted by it we have highlighted that there are plenty of questions and unknowns about the role of hydroxylamine in the nitrogen cycle the key gap of knowledges are summarized as follows clarification on how hydroxylamine is converted to nitrite by aoa aob and comammox is needed so far there are biocatalytic evidences that hao transforms hydroxylamine to no in aob aoa do not harbour hao in their genome thus a different transformation of hydroxylamine has been proposed comammox pathway for this conversion is still to be mapped overall it will be interesting to assess if aerobic ammonia oxidizers have evolved differently on how to deal with the conversion of hydroxylamine to nitrite transient accumulation of hydroxylamine is usually linked to a switch from low to maximum activity i e anoxic aerobic cycles batch tests sbr reactors the turnover of the differential enzymes involved in the transformation might be crucial in addition it seems to be a strain dependant trait ph might have a crucial role on hydroxylamine usage first because it affects the equilibrium between the protonated and unprotonated hydroxylamine form secondly because ammonium oxidation rate is highly impacted by ph whereas hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite is not thus ph being a potential contributor to hydroxylamine accumulation transient hydroxylamine accumulations seems also to be strain dependant in aerobic ammonium oxidizers as well as it differs between aob aoa and comammox differences on enzymatic level are hypothesised to the responsible for such observations hydroxylamine is involved in n2o emissions in aoa aob and comammox factors promoting n2o emissions from hydroxylamine are still to be fully understood anammox is known to be able to use hydroxylamine as substrate it is also proposed to be intermediate in ca brocadia whereas no is proposed to be the intermediate in ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis nevertheless in ca kuenenia stuttgartinesis there is a high overexpression of hox an enzyme hypothesised to transform the leaking hydroxylamine from hzs to no thus the role of hydroxylamine in anammox is yet to be understood ph also impacts the equilibrium between the unprotonated free hydroxylamine and protonated form of hydroxylamine thus free hydroxylamine has the capacity to diffuse through the bacterial membranes this is hypothesised to be the cause of nob inhibition by hydroxylamine however it is yet to be demonstrated a similar inhibition mechanism might impact denitrifiers leading to nitrite accumulation overall there are a wide range of topics to be investigated regarding hydroxylamine and the nitrogen cycle below we provide some crucial points and recommendations for future research that will broaden our understanding of hydroxylamine developing an easy implemented hydroxylamine measurement technique would totally facilitate hydroxylamine related research either the use of sensors or an improved measuring technique that is not extremely labour intensive would lead to widespread hydroxylamine measurements in nitrogen related research developing an integrated research approach including a combination of transcriptomics proteomics enzymology and 15n tracer studies could help to further understand the mechanisms involved in hydroxylamine conversion and transient accumulation such an integrated approach will be crucial to map hydroxylamine conversion pathways as well as studying such conversions in microbial communities understanding hydroxylamine enzymatic conversions will help also on understanding no n2o production pathways thus helping on the design of mitigation strategies to conclude the main focus of nitrogen cycle research has usually been the substrates and end products of the microbial conversions more recently due to the urge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intermediates such as no and n2o started to be extensively studied the complexity of intermediate reactions and the lack of easily implemented techniques and methods for the usual low concentration measurements results in a hard topic of study nevertheless the central role of hydroxylamine as intermediate in the nitrogen cycle and its relation to n2o formation urges more attention for this compound in future research projects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
