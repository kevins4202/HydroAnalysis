3525,blue water irrigation water and green water rainwater constitute the indispensable inputs in crop production and they virtually flow through crop trade the valuation of water for crops is becoming essential for providing not only guidance in measuring both the biophysical and economic sustainability of agricultural water resources but also crucial information for investors and authorities engaged in water allocations however valuation of green water has been severely disregarded here taking the yellow river basin as the study case we show the feasibility of estimating the value of green water for crop production considering the costs in production processes in addition to blue water valuation thus the volume versus value of blue and green water consumed in crop production as well as that of corresponding virtual water vw flows related to crop transfers within the basin are comparable fourteen major crops in current three typical years and four scenarios for the year 2050 under climate socio economic changes are examined results show that value of blue water was approximately 3 times that of green water for irrigated crops whereas at similar level to the value of green water for rain fed crops visible trade offs between the regional volume and value of water used in crop production and that of the intra national vw flows exist in terms of magnitude in time and space as well as the structure by crops the total volumes of the water footprint wf i e water consumption in crop production and vw exports changed little over years however the corresponding total water values was tripled and seven folded respectively due to apple production expansions wheat was the biggest contributor in volume of vw export while apple accounted the most in value of vw export of the basin the considered scenarios for 2050 suggested that the reduced values of crop related wf and vw flows were more sensitive than the corresponding water quantity this study implies the importance of managing the internal trade offs or mutual effects between water resources and economic returns keywords water value blue water green water spatial and temporal variations future scenarios 1 introduction across the natural social and economic systems in the anthropocene water flows physically through the hydrosphere as well as virtually into the trades among different places d

populous but water poor countries dalin et al 2017 as an indispensable input and natural capital in crop production water resources are consumed to generate economic value garrick et al 2017 the products have economic value while the blue water withdrawal together with other inputs have costs in order to obtain greater economic benefits or income the water consumers i e peasants could consume relatively more water despite improved efficiency in water use grafton et al 2018 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 valuing water in crop production and trade is becoming essential to provide not only guidance of measuring both biophysical and economic sustainability of agricultural water resources fenichel et al 2016 but also crucial information for investors and authorities engaged in land and water allocations d odorico et al 2020 savenije and van der zaag 2020 the value of each drop of agricultural water resources is a measure of the net economic benefit or the marginal value produced by the drop of water in consideration of the market value of the agricultural production outputs minus the cost of obtaining water during production bierkens et al 2019 d odorico et al 2020 the majority of studies available have improved the estimation of the value of blue water in agricultural production in space and time cai et al 2003 analysed the relationship between the volume and net economic benefits of irrigation water in the maipo river basin in an integrated economic hydrologic modelling framework the results of this case study indicated that higher water prices may result in higher levels of irrigation efficiency whereas higher costs of implementing technologies or measures to improve physical water efficiency could result in lower incomes for farmers bierkens et al 2019 quantified the country specific value of irrigation water for five staple crops and revealed the economic inefficiency of irrigation water use especially for that abstracting nonrenewable groundwater at a higher spatial resolution of 10 km at the global scale d odorico et al 2020 estimated the value of irrigation water for growing sixteen major crops through a mechanistic biophysical algorithm and showed unsustainability of current crop distribution in terms of agricultural water value maximization both the above latest studies show the visible potential of blue water saving and economic benefit gaining at current croplands however the economic valuation of green water which is the rainwater and represents over eighty percent of consumptive agricultural water resources in either globe hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 or major agricultural nations zhuo et al 2016a has been severely disregarded chouchane et al 2015 and yang et al 2021 conducted the estimation of the crop green and blue economic water productivities separately for the case of tunisia and china respectively the economic water productivity in usd m3 is measured as the ratio of the product value usd kg to the water consumed in production m3 kg and is comparable to water productivity kg m3 but the economic water productivity index excludes the cost in the production although hoekstra et al 2001 estimated the value of green water for the zambezi basin only the total amount was presented the comparisons with blue water values as well as the contributions of diverse products were not shown although grammatikopoulou et al 2020 highlighted the importance of green water valuation in agriculture the case for rain fed cereal production in the czech republic lacks information about the differences between green and blue water values in irrigated agriculture in addition previous studies novo et al 2009 schwarz et al 2015 on the economic value of vw flows have focused on international crop trade and intra national crop transfers have not been analysed in order to fill the aforementioned knowledge gaps taking the yellow river basin yrb as the study case the current study estimates for the first time the value of green water used in crop production considering costs at croplands in addition to a comprehensive valuation of blue water thus the corresponding values of both blue and green vw flows related to either international or intra national crop transfers are comparable three selected typical years 2003 2006 and 2013 which were wet dry and average respectively and four possible scenarios for the year 2050 in response to climate and socio economic changes are examined the differences in values of water between irrigated and rain fed agriculture are recorded the trade offs between the volume and value of physical and virtual water flows are further identified the yrb was selected as the study area because of its representativeness first the sustainable water management of this basin from its biggest water user agriculture is becoming increasingly challenging the yrb is the second largest river basin in china with a drainage area of 795 103 km2 yrcc 2014 with only 2 of the national water resources 13 of national grain is produced in this basin yrcc 2014 mwr 1999 currently irrigation accounts for 68 6 of total blue water consumption in the basin 2018 yrcc 2019 second the basin spreads across nine provinces qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong with varied levels of economy fig 1 the highest provincial per capita gross domestic product gdp in shandong was 2 1 times higher than the lowest in gansu province 2019 nbsc 2020 third the basin is part of the vw networks related to either the intra national or international crop transfers feng et al 2012 cai et al 2009 yin et al 2016 zhuo et al 2020 for the three selected typical years and the scenarios for year 2050 crop by crop we calculated simultaneously the economic values of green and blue water use in crop production as well as of the international and domestic related vw flows of the yrb fourteen crops table 4 were selected accounting for approximately 77 of the harvested area and 84 of crop production in 2013 nbsc 2020 2 methods and data 2 1 valuation of green and blue water in crop production the value of green and blue water separately in crop production is estimated at provincial levels by crops within the yrb for each considered year the algorithm is consistent with the mechanistic biophysical method for the valuation of blue water for crops proposed by d odorico et al 2020 for irrigated crop i the value per unit volume of blue irrigation water supply v b i r i usd m3 is calculated as 1 v b i r i y ir i y

c i f c i pr e r f i the producer price and cost of each considered crop per province per year were obtained from the compilation of national agricultural product cost and income data for the considered years ndrc 2004 2007 2014 see tables s2 and s3 the price of irrigation water per province was obtained from mao 2005 see table s4 2 2 valuation of vw flows related to crops based on the estimates of valuation of water in crop production within the yrb the current analysis evaluates the value of green and blue vw exports related to crops per province in the basin by dividing the international and intra national crop transfers following novo et al 2009 taking the blue vw exports as an example the total economic value of the blue vw exports related to a crop i of a province in a certain year vvwb i usd y equals to the product of the value per cubic metre of blue water for producing the crop in the province vb ir i usd m3 and the corresponding volume of blue vw exports vweb

cropping period is defined using the corresponding water balance for the region as follows 5 p r i i r s i r f i wf g p r o d i wf b i p r o d i where pr i m3 y refers to the precipitation over the cropping field which is the green water supply for growing crop i irs i m3 y is the irrigation water supply wf g p r o d i m3 y is the green wf of producing crop i wf b i p r o d i m3 y is the blue wf of producing crop i and rf i m3 y represents the remainder of the inflows from precipitation and irrigation that are not included in the wf including surface runoff drainage and percolation the annual total green and blue wfs of crop production at the field level measure the green and blue evapotranspiration et from croplands over the cropping period hoekstra et al 2011 wf accounting was carried out at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5 arc minute 7 4 km 9 3 km at the latitude of the yrb by following the wf assessment framework by hoekstra et al 2011 and using the fao aquacrop plug in program version 4 0 steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the calculation methods and data sources used for field wf accounting for crop production are detailed in the study by zhuo et al 2016b the regional blue wf related to crop production consists of the blue wf at the field level wf b f p r o d i m3 y and the blue wf reflects evaporative losses of the irrigation supply network wf b e p r o d i m3 y schyns et al 2014 cao et al 2014 6 wf b p r o d i wf b f p r o d i wf b e p r o d i the blue wf of the irrigation supply network is estimated based on the evaporation loss coefficient α of the irs i according to the efficiencies of irrigation canals and fields 7 wf b e p r o d i α i r s i the α for each province in china is obtained from the study by cao et al 2014 which is estimated according to the code for design of irrigation and drainage engineering mwr 1999 and widely accepted as the official reference for irrigation engineering designers in china li 2006 the pr of the croplands during each considered year was obtained from the 30 arc minute monthly cru ts 3 10 dataset harris et al 2014 the irs from the surface water and groundwater supply distributed to each province per year is derived from the annual water resource bulletins for the yrb produced by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc 2014 regarding the vw flow estimation both the international and domestic inter provincial crop trades were considered in the current analyses for the yrb vw exports v w e i m3 y related to a considered crop i of each province equals to the product of the export quantity e e i t y and the corresponding wf of producing a unit mass of the crop u wf prod e i m3 t in exporting province e 8 v w e i e e e i uwf prod e i the international trade and crop consumption data were derived from faostat fao 2020 and downscaled to the provincial level following the methods in ma et al 2006 the domestic inter provincial crop trade volumes are estimated by the linear optimization model taking the minimum transportation cost as the optimization objective and the annual food balance in each province as constraint conditions dalin et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhuo et al 2019 gao et al 2020 we then downscaled to the provinces located partly within the basin by the population distribution the population of the yrb shared by each province is estimated according to the county level statistics of each province cyfd 2017 2 4 scenario setup for 2050 to investigate the responses of volume and values of crop related wfs and vw flows under possible climate and socio economic changes in the yrb we carried out scenario analysis for the yrb as a whole for the year 2050 by considering four key changing factors 1 climate 2 population growth 3 technology and 4 diet the green and blue wfs of crop production in the yrb were simulated at 5 by 5 arc minute grid level driven by the outputs of global climate models gcms along with the effects of technology on yield increase and improved irrigation network efficiency the vw balances related to each considered crop driven by were estimated considering yrb as a whole to be driven by the population growth diet change and the changes in crop production considering the average year 2013 as the baseline year we set four scenarios s1 s4 for yrb in consistence with the four scenarios set by zhuo et al 2016c for mainland china the scenarios were built on the scenario matrix of the shared socio economic pathways ssps o neill et al 2012 and the representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 as approved in the 5th ipcc assessment report ipcc 2014 in order to represents scenarios under varied levels of climate changes and socio economic developments s1 and s2 combine climate scenarios forced by rcp2 6 with ssp1 and ssp2 respectively s3 and s4 combine climate scenarios forced by rcp8 5 with ssp2 and ssp3 respectively table 1 lists the main levels or relative changes in key driving factors compared to their baseline values rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 refer to the lowest and highest climate change impacts below the 10th percentile and 90th percentile respectively of the reference emission range in the ipcc 2014 moss et al 2010 combining the characteristics of corresponding ssp and rcp under each scenario the most sustainable s1 represents a world under relative satisfied progress towards sustainability with relative low challenges to both climate change mitigation and adaptation s2 and s3 represent two scenarios under the middle of the road trends of socioeconomic changes which continuing the current decadal developments with relatively low and high climate change levels respectively s4 represent a relative worse condition under which there are large challenges in both respects of climate change and socioeconomic change additional details on the selection of the considered quadrants for scenarios in the matrix can be found in the study by zhuo et al 2016c scenarios were run under climate change projections by four gcms namely canesm2 canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis gfdl cm3 noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory giss e2 r nasa goddard institute for space studies and mpi esm mr max planck institute for meteorology which span the full range of projections for china on precipitation over the cropping seasons zhuo et al 2016c within the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the former two gcms represent relatively wetter climates whereas the latter two project relatively drier climates in the yrb table 1 the downscaled gcm outputs at 5 by 5 arc minute resolution driving the wf assessment of crop production were obtained from ramirez villegas and jarvis 2010 the population scenarios with increasing levels of population growth from ssp1 to ssp2 were obtained from iiasa 2013 the scenarios on crop yield increase through technological development are in line with the findings by zhuo et al 2016c who set the increasing levels per ssp according to global 2000 2050 scenarios by de fraiture et al 2007 and the findings of a linear increasing trend the improvements in irrigation network efficiency compared to the baseline year are set from 10 to 30 from ssp3 to ssp1 the diet scenario for each ssp table 2 is selected from the east asia scenarios by erb et al 2009 3 results 3 1 volume versus value of green and blue water for crop production in the yrb table 3 lists the volume versus values of water in crop production per selected year 2003 2006 and 2013 which were wet dry and average respectively for the yrb as a whole over the considered years the annual total volume of wf change little with an average level of 61 billion m3 y of which blue water contributed 34 thanks to the reductions in wf per unit mass of the most crops see table 4 wheat was the biggest contributor to the basin s total crop wf by 36 however apples accounted the most by 42 in total value of water for croplands till 2013 with doubled apple production with tripled market value table s2 the total value of water in crop production in the yrb has reached to 7 3 billion usd y 2 5 times the 2006 s level that blue water contributed to 26 this is also the main reason of much higher value of water for crops in 2013 compared to the wet year of 2003 28 less precipitation occurred over croplands in the dry year of 2006 it resulted in 25 and 20 more irrigation withdrawals and blue wf of crop production respectively within one year the value of water for crops differs among water colours as well as among cropping methods table 4 for irrigated crops the value of blue water was around 3 times the value of green water whereas the value of green water for rain fed crops was at similar level of corresponding blue water value at a same year water used for different crop types has different values within a same place in the yrb water for tomatoes and apples had higher values than water for the other crops see table 4 because of the low market price of wheat and higher cost for growing rapeseed table s3 both intensive green and blue water for wheat as well as the green water for rapeseed have generated net costs till the year 2013 with much smaller unit wf than other considered grain crops values of water for potatoes were relatively high among the nine provinces that contain the yrb there was high spatial heterogeneity in values of water used in crop production because of variation in cropping structure as well as the economic water productivities per crop fig 2 see also table s2 shaanxi province is the biggest apple producer fig 2d so that had higher value of both green and blue water than most of the other provinces with a relatively higher price and lower cost in planting barley and potatoes in qinghai see tables s2 and s3 the value of green water there was higher among provinces 3 2 volume versus value of crop related virtual water flows of the yrb summing up the net vw imports related to the considered crops the yrb was a net vw importer of 15 billion m3 y in 2013 the vw imports related to rice which were almost 8 times the total net annual vw imports of the basin defined the role of the basin as a net vw importer annually the crop related vw export accounted for 42 of the total wf of production in the yrb domestic vw exports to other places within china accounted for 96 of the total vw exports total crop export volume of crops increased by 62 while the corresponding total vw exports even decreased table 5 slightly because of the reduced unit wf of crops table 4 on the other hand with over double exports of apples by 2 75 times from 2003 to 2013 maize by 2 46 times sunflower by 2 26 times and groundnuts by 2 13 times the total value of crop vw exports of the yrb was almost seven folded accounting for 73 of total value of water for crop production within the basin given the high green water intensity in high valued crops green vw exports contribute over eighty percent of basin s total value of vw exports fig 3 shows visible differences in terms of crop contributions to the volume and value of vw exports of each province within the yrb taking the year 2013 for instance wheat and maize were the biggest contributors to the total vw exports by 32 and 25 respectively however the apple and potato were the biggest contributors to the corresponding value of vw exports by 68 and 15 respectively among the provinces henan province the biggest wheat exporter in the basin accounted for the most as 23 of total vw exports whereas shaanxi province made more value of vw exports as the biggest apple exporter 3 3 scenarios for 2050 table 6 shows the responses in volume and value of crop related wfs and vw flows of the yrb in the climate socio economic scenarios for 2050 as compared to the baseline year 2013 s levels with the consistent levels of cost price and water price in crop production as mainly driven by the low crop economic productivity in shanxi sichuan and shaanxi provinces with higher yield levels the value of green and blue water for irrigated crops decreased at higher levels than the corresponding water consumption levels in s1 s4 with the increments in the production of crops like wheat by 60 85 and rapeseed by 106 161 with low value or even net cost of water for croplands whereas the decreases in high water valued crop production including apples by 8 29 and tomatoes by 48 56 the overall average value per drop of green and blue water for crops in scenarios became net costs fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the relative changes in the annual green and blue wf in m3 y of crop production by year 2050 as compared to 2013 forced by rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively it can be clearly seen that the increases in blue wfs mainly happened in the south basin especially in shanxi henan and shandong provinces i e the lower reaches where the precipitation tended to decrease see figure s2 while the et0 increased see figure s3 while the increased green wfs mostly happened in the places where blue wf decreased with relatively greater precipitation as projected see figure s2 we considered only the increased irrigation network efficiencies in responses in the responses in the amount of annual irrigation blue water withdrawal the blue water abstraction decreased in s1 s4 by 25 15 thanks to the improvements in irrigation network efficiencies of 30 10 even though the increased blue wfs consequently as driven by the increases in crop productivity and the reduced rates of population growth the crop related net vw imports of the yrb decrease drastically and the yrb becomes a bigger net vw exporter however with total net cost of the total vw exports in all the scenarios 4 discussion through the case for the yrb the current study reveals that trade offs exist between the volume and value of green and blue wfs in crop production as well as the volume and value of crop related vw flows as shown in fig 5 with the 2013 data in the study case the directions of values of the physical water and vw are inversely related to the corresponding water flows hoekstra et al 2001 savenije and van der zaag 2020 farmers consume water in crop production while receiving economic net benefits a vw exporter consumes local water resources in producing crops for exports and finally consumed in other places while gets income through the vw flows two phenomena shown in the current study highlight important aspects in water management for food production from the internal water economic effecting mechanisms i blue water was found to be able to generate higher economic values back to farmers than green water at the same irrigated crop field according to jägermeyr et al 2017 the integration of rainwater management into the current irrigation system could register a net increase of 10 in food production without the specific cost of achieving green water the lower green water value implies the recommendations to increase green water use efficiency in irrigated field not only for saving more blue water but also enhancing economic feedbacks of rainwater ii with varying economic values among crops differences in cropping structures among provinces were found to have a significant impact on the total amount of water consumption zhuo et al 2016a as well as the spatial heterogeneity in the corresponding levels of the water values the phenomenon that wheat production in the yrb consumed a lot of water but generate small values shows again the importance of valuating the regional water supply for crop production pattern design the current study valuates for the first time the green water for crops accounting for the costs in production processes the attribution of crop yields to blue and green water is based on crop modelling with consideration of water stress effects although the weighted average crop yield levels were validated from the provincial statistics zhuo et al 2016b therefore uncertainties were generated during the simulations it is not possible to calibrate the results exactly for such a large basin scale but we highly recommend to take field measurements when implementing the algorithm at a small scale where the absolute figures of water values matter however for the current study objective we believe that the shown significant temporal and spatial variabilities in values of green and blue water for different types of crops in a same geographical region through the case for the yrb are valid regarding the green and blue wf and vw flow estimates some parameters including the crop calendars the evaporation loss coefficient settings for irrigation techniques were based on assumptions with data limitations which are also should be in caution when downscaling the test scales many researchers have focused on identifying the external natural or socio economic driving factors on the physical green and blue water consumption in crop production zhao et al 2015 zhao and chen 2014 tuninetti et al 2015 or on the associated vw flows dalin et al 2012 tamea et al 2014 wang et al 2016 therefore identifying the internal driving factors on the water consumption relevant to the generated economic benefits and values is highly recommended in the future as the very start the current study identified for example the impacts of crop production structure on the valuation of green and blue water for crops so that modifying crop production structure could be one of the suggested measures while being of long term effects to maximize the economic value of both crop wfs and vw flows with short term effects on the current cropping lands it has been proven quantitively that different tillage and irrigation strategies have been quantitatively proven to differ significantly in terms of their cost effectiveness chukalla et al 2017 reasonable costs and prices of water are effective stimulus measures that promote reductions in blue water withdrawals and consumption furthermore the combination of increased water prices or taxes with wf benchmarks could also be considered last but not least the current analysis shows alternative and feasible approaches to tackle two key methodological or conceptual flaws in measuring the sustainable development goal sdg 6 4 by 2030 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity un 2015 first the valuation of green water as comparable to blue water in agriculture based on wf and vw flow estimation enables drawing the whole picture on water use efficiency the sdg 6 4 1 indicator and net water scarcity the sdg 6 4 2 indicator related to agricultural sector effective indicators are shown to further investigate possible diverse measures to save and use more productively not only blue water resources the focus of the sdg 6 4 but also rainwater which is the only water resources for rain fed agriculture vanham and mekonnen 2021 vanham et al 2018 second the sdg 6 4 1 indicator is supposed to measure relationships between economic growth and water use however ignores the truth that the simple ratio of gross economic value added by sectors to water withdrawal hides complex integrations of natural and socioeconomic drivers hellegers and van halsema 2021 the shown values of blue and green water for each crop type in consideration of production costs with dividing irrigated and rain fed croplands in time and space is helpful to identify the share of crops the contribution of higher economic value per product the contribution of less water per crop or even the trade offs between economic benefits and the water productivities making up the eventual water use efficiencies credit authorship contribution statement la zhuo

3525,blue water irrigation water and green water rainwater constitute the indispensable inputs in crop production and they virtually flow through crop trade the valuation of water for crops is becoming essential for providing not only guidance in measuring both the biophysical and economic sustainability of agricultural water resources but also crucial information for investors and authorities engaged in water allocations however valuation of green water has been severely disregarded here taking the yellow river basin as the study case we show the feasibility of estimating the value of green water for crop production considering the costs in production processes in addition to blue water valuation thus the volume versus value of blue and green water consumed in crop production as well as that of corresponding virtual water vw flows related to crop transfers within the basin are comparable fourteen major crops in current three typical years and four scenarios for the year 2050 under climate socio economic changes are examined results show that value of blue water was approximately 3 times that of green water for irrigated crops whereas at similar level to the value of green water for rain fed crops visible trade offs between the regional volume and value of water used in crop production and that of the intra national vw flows exist in terms of magnitude in time and space as well as the structure by crops the total volumes of the water footprint wf i e water consumption in crop production and vw exports changed little over years however the corresponding total water values was tripled and seven folded respectively due to apple production expansions wheat was the biggest contributor in volume of vw export while apple accounted the most in value of vw export of the basin the considered scenarios for 2050 suggested that the reduced values of crop related wf and vw flows were more sensitive than the corresponding water quantity this study implies the

showed unsustainability of current crop distribution in terms of agricultural water value maximization both the above latest studies show the visible potential of blue water saving and economic benefit gaining at current croplands however the economic valuation of green water which is the rainwater and represents over eighty percent of consumptive agricultural water resources in either globe hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 or major agricultural nations zhuo et al 2016a has been severely disregarded chouchane et al 2015 and yang et al 2021 conducted the estimation of the crop green and blue economic water productivities separately for the case of tunisia and china respectively the economic water productivity in usd m3 is measured as the ratio of the product value usd kg to the water consumed in production m3 kg and is comparable to water productivity kg m3 but the economic water productivity index excludes the cost in the production although hoekstra et al 2001 estimated the value of green water for the zambezi basin only the total amount was presented the comparisons with blue water values as well as the contributions of diverse products were not shown although grammatikopoulou et al 2020 highlighted the importance of green water valuation in agriculture the case for rain fed cereal production in the czech republic lacks information about the differences between green and blue water values in irrigated agriculture in addition previous studies novo et al 2009 schwarz et al 2015 on the economic value of vw flows have focused on international crop trade and intra national crop transfers have not been analysed in order to fill the aforementioned knowledge gaps taking the yellow river basin yrb as the study case the current study estimates for the first time the value of green water used in crop production considering costs at croplands in addition to a comprehensive valuation of blue water thus the corresponding values of both blue and green vw flows related to either international or intra national crop transfers are comparable three selected typical years 2003 2006 and 2013 which were wet dry and average respectively and four possible scenarios for the year 2050 in response to climate and socio economic changes are examined the differences in values of water between irrigated and rain fed agriculture are recorded the trade offs between the volume and value of physical and virtual water flows are further identified the yrb was selected as the study area because of its representativeness first the sustainable water management of this basin from its biggest water user agriculture is becoming increasingly challenging the yrb is the second largest river basin in china with a drainage area of 795 103 km2 yrcc 2014 with only 2 of the national water resources 13 of national grain is produced in this basin yrcc 2014 mwr 1999 currently irrigation accounts for 68 6 of total blue water consumption in the basin 2018 yrcc 2019 second the basin spreads across nine provinces qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong with varied levels of economy fig 1 the highest provincial per capita gross domestic product gdp in shandong was 2 1 times higher than the lowest in gansu province 2019 nbsc 2020 third the basin is part of the vw networks related to either the intra national or international crop transfers feng et al 2012 cai et al 2009 yin et al 2016 zhuo et al 2020 for the three selected typical years and the scenarios for year 2050 crop by crop we calculated simultaneously the economic values of green and blue water use in crop production as well as of the international and domestic related vw flows of the yrb fourteen crops table 4 were selected accounting for approximately 77 of the harvested area and 84 of crop production in 2013 nbsc 2020 2 methods and data 2 1 valuation of green and blue water in crop production the value of green and blue water separately in crop production is estimated at provincial levels by crops within the yrb for each considered year the algorithm is consistent with the mechanistic biophysical method for the valuation of blue water for crops proposed by d odorico et al 2020 for irrigated crop i the value per unit volume of blue irrigation water supply v b i r i usd m3 is calculated as 1 v b i r i y ir i y rf i y ir i p ir i p c i f c i i r s i pw ir i r s i where y irr i and y rf i t ha refer to irrigated and rain fed yield level respectively of crop i in a certain province p ir i t y the production of

c i f c i pr e r f i the producer price and cost of each considered crop per province per year were obtained from the compilation of national agricultural product cost and income data for the considered years ndrc 2004 2007 2014 see tables s2 and s3 the price of irrigation water per province was obtained from mao 2005 see table s4 2 2 valuation of vw flows related to crops based on the estimates of valuation of water in crop production within the yrb the current analysis evaluates the value of green and blue vw exports related to crops per province in the basin by dividing the international and intra national crop transfers following novo et al 2009 taking the blue vw exports as an example the total economic value of the blue vw exports related to a crop i of a province in a certain year vvwb i usd y equals to the product of the value per cubic metre of blue water for producing the crop in the province vb ir i usd m3 and the corresponding volume of blue vw exports vweb i m3 y 4 vvw b i v b i r i vwe b i 2 3 quantifying crop related water footprints and virtual water flows the physical water flow associated with the production of crop i within a region over the cropping period is defined using the corresponding water balance for the region as follows 5 p r i i r s i r f i wf g p r o d i wf b i p r o d i where pr i m3 y refers to the precipitation over the cropping field which is the green water supply for growing crop i irs i m3 y is the irrigation water supply wf g p r o d i m3 y is the green wf of producing crop i wf b i p r o d i m3 y is the blue wf of producing crop i and rf i m3 y represents the remainder of the inflows from precipitation and irrigation that are not included in the wf including surface runoff drainage and percolation the annual total green and blue wfs of crop production at the field level measure the green and blue evapotranspiration et from croplands over the cropping period hoekstra et al 2011 wf accounting was carried out at a spatial resolution of 5 by 5 arc minute 7 4 km 9 3 km at the latitude of the yrb by following the wf assessment framework by hoekstra et al 2011 and using the fao aquacrop plug in program version 4 0 steduto et al 2009 raes et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 the calculation methods and data sources used for field wf accounting for crop production are detailed in the study by zhuo et al 2016b the regional blue wf related to crop production consists of the blue wf at the field level wf b f p r o d i m3 y and the blue wf reflects evaporative losses of the irrigation supply network wf b e p r o d i m3 y schyns et al 2014 cao et al 2014 6 wf b p r o d i wf b f p r o d i wf b e p r o d i the blue wf of the irrigation supply network is estimated based on the evaporation loss coefficient α of the irs i according to the efficiencies of irrigation canals and fields 7 wf b e p r o d i α i r s i the α for each province in china is obtained from the study by cao et al 2014 which is estimated according to the code for design of irrigation and drainage engineering mwr 1999 and widely accepted as the official reference for irrigation engineering designers in china li 2006 the pr of the croplands during each considered year was obtained from the 30 arc minute monthly cru ts 3 10 dataset harris et al 2014 the irs from the surface water and groundwater supply distributed to each province per year is derived from the annual water resource bulletins for the yrb produced by the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc 2014 regarding the vw flow estimation both the international and domestic inter provincial crop trades were considered in the current analyses for the yrb vw exports v w e i m3 y related to a considered crop i of each province equals to the product of the export quantity e e i t y and the corresponding wf of producing a unit mass of the crop u wf prod e i m3 t in exporting province e 8 v w e i e e e i uwf prod e i the international trade and crop consumption data were derived from faostat fao 2020 and downscaled to the provincial level following the methods in ma et al 2006 the domestic inter provincial crop trade volumes are estimated by the linear optimization model taking the minimum transportation cost as the optimization objective and the annual food balance in each province as constraint conditions dalin et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhuo et al 2019 gao et al 2020 we then downscaled to the provinces located partly within the basin by the population distribution the population of the yrb shared by each province is estimated according to the county level statistics of each province cyfd 2017 2 4 scenario setup for 2050 to investigate the responses of volume and values of crop related wfs and vw flows under possible climate and socio economic changes in the yrb we carried out scenario analysis for the yrb as a whole for the year 2050 by considering four key changing factors 1 climate 2 population growth 3 technology and 4 diet the green and blue wfs of crop production in the yrb were simulated at 5 by 5 arc minute grid level driven by the outputs of global climate models gcms along with the effects of technology on yield increase and improved irrigation network efficiency the vw balances related to each considered crop driven by were estimated considering yrb as a whole to be driven by the population growth diet change and the changes in crop production considering the average year 2013 as the baseline year we set four scenarios s1 s4 for yrb in consistence with the four scenarios set by zhuo et al 2016c for mainland china the scenarios were built on the scenario matrix of the shared socio economic pathways ssps o neill et al 2012 and the representative concentration pathways rcps van vuuren et al 2011 as approved in the 5th ipcc assessment report ipcc 2014 in order to represents scenarios under varied levels of climate changes and socio economic developments s1 and s2 combine climate scenarios forced by rcp2 6 with ssp1 and ssp2 respectively s3 and s4 combine climate scenarios forced by rcp8 5 with ssp2 and ssp3 respectively table 1 lists the main levels or relative changes in key driving factors compared to their baseline values rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 refer to the lowest and highest climate change impacts below the 10th percentile and 90th percentile respectively of the reference emission range in the ipcc 2014 moss et al 2010 combining the characteristics of corresponding ssp and rcp under each scenario the most sustainable s1 represents a world under relative satisfied progress towards sustainability with relative low challenges to both climate change mitigation and adaptation s2 and s3 represent two scenarios under the middle of the road trends of socioeconomic changes which continuing the current decadal developments with relatively low and high climate change levels respectively s4 represent a relative worse condition under which there are large challenges in both respects of climate change and socioeconomic change additional details on the selection of the considered quadrants for scenarios in the matrix can be found in the study by zhuo et al 2016c scenarios were run under climate change projections by four gcms namely canesm2 canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis gfdl cm3 noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory giss e2 r nasa goddard institute for space studies and mpi esm mr max planck institute for meteorology which span the full range of projections for china on precipitation over the cropping seasons zhuo et al 2016c within the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 the former two gcms represent relatively wetter climates whereas the latter two project relatively drier climates in the yrb table 1 the downscaled gcm outputs at 5 by 5 arc minute resolution driving the wf assessment of crop production were obtained from ramirez villegas and jarvis 2010 the population scenarios with increasing levels of population growth from ssp1 to ssp2 were obtained from iiasa 2013 the scenarios on crop yield increase through technological development are in line with the findings by zhuo et al 2016c who set the increasing levels per ssp according to global 2000 2050 scenarios by de fraiture et al 2007 and the findings of a linear increasing trend the improvements in irrigation network efficiency compared to the baseline year are set from 10 to 30 from ssp3 to ssp1 the diet scenario for each ssp table 2 is selected from the east asia scenarios by erb et al 2009 3 results 3 1 volume versus value of green and blue water for crop production in the yrb table 3 lists the volume versus values of water in crop production per selected year 2003 2006 and 2013 which were wet dry and average respectively for the yrb as a whole over the considered years the annual total volume of wf change little with an average level of 61 billion m3 y of which blue water contributed 34 thanks to the reductions in wf per unit mass of the most crops see table 4 wheat was the biggest contributor to the basin s total crop wf by 36 however apples accounted the most by 42 in total value of water for croplands till 2013 with doubled apple production with tripled market value table s2 the total value of water in crop production in the yrb has reached to 7 3 billion usd y 2 5 times the 2006 s level that blue water contributed to 26 this is also the main reason of much higher value of water for crops in 2013 compared to the wet year of 2003 28 less precipitation occurred over croplands in the dry year of 2006 it resulted in 25 and 20 more irrigation withdrawals and blue wf of crop production respectively within one year the value of water for crops differs among water colours as well as among cropping methods table 4 for irrigated crops the value of blue water was around 3 times the value of green water whereas the value of green water for rain fed crops was at similar level of corresponding blue water value at a same year water used for different crop types has different values within a same place in the yrb water for tomatoes and apples had higher values than water for the other crops see table 4 because of the low market price of wheat and higher cost for growing rapeseed table s3 both intensive green and blue water for wheat as well as the green water for rapeseed have generated net costs till the year 2013 with much smaller unit wf than other considered grain crops values of water for potatoes were relatively high among the nine provinces that contain the yrb there was high spatial heterogeneity in values of water used in crop production because of variation in cropping structure as well as the economic water productivities per crop fig 2 see also table s2 shaanxi province is the biggest apple producer fig 2d so that had higher value of both green and blue water than most of the other provinces with a relatively higher price and lower cost in planting barley and potatoes in qinghai see tables s2 and s3 the value of green water there was higher among provinces 3 2 volume versus value of crop related virtual water flows of the yrb summing up the net vw imports related to the considered crops the yrb was a net vw importer of 15 billion m3 y in 2013 the vw imports related to rice which were almost 8 times the total net annual vw imports of the basin defined the role of the basin as a net vw importer annually the crop related vw export accounted for 42 of the total wf of production in the yrb domestic vw exports to other places within china accounted for 96 of the total vw exports total crop export volume of crops increased by 62 while the corresponding total vw exports even decreased table 5 slightly because of the reduced unit wf of crops table 4 on the other hand with over double exports of apples by 2 75 times from 2003 to 2013 maize by 2 46 times sunflower by 2 26 times and groundnuts by 2 13 times the total value of crop vw exports of the yrb was almost seven folded accounting for 73 of total value of water for crop production within the basin given the high green water intensity in high valued crops green vw exports contribute over eighty percent of basin s total value of vw exports fig 3 shows visible differences in terms of crop contributions to the volume and value of vw exports of each province within the yrb taking the year 2013 for instance wheat and maize were the biggest contributors to the total vw exports by 32 and 25 respectively however the apple and potato were the biggest contributors to the corresponding value of vw exports by 68 and 15 respectively among the provinces henan province the biggest wheat exporter in the basin accounted for the most as 23 of total vw exports whereas shaanxi province made more value of vw exports as the biggest apple exporter 3 3 scenarios for 2050 table 6 shows the responses in volume and value of crop related wfs and vw flows of the yrb in the climate socio economic scenarios for 2050 as compared to the baseline year 2013 s levels with the consistent levels of cost price and water price in crop production as mainly driven by the low crop economic productivity in shanxi sichuan and shaanxi provinces with higher yield levels the value of green and blue water for irrigated crops decreased at higher levels than the corresponding water consumption levels in s1 s4 with the increments in the production of crops like wheat by 60 85 and rapeseed by 106 161 with low value or even net cost of water for croplands whereas the decreases in high water valued crop production including apples by 8 29 and tomatoes by 48 56 the overall average value per drop of green and blue water for crops in scenarios became net costs fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of the relative changes in the annual green and blue wf in m3 y of crop production by year 2050 as compared to 2013 forced by rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 respectively it can be clearly seen that the increases in blue wfs mainly happened in the south basin especially in shanxi henan and shandong provinces i e the lower reaches where the precipitation tended to decrease see figure s2 while the et0 increased see figure s3 while the increased green wfs mostly happened in the places where blue wf decreased with relatively greater precipitation as projected see figure s2 we considered only the increased irrigation network efficiencies in responses in the responses in the amount of annual irrigation blue water withdrawal the blue water abstraction decreased in s1 s4 by 25 15 thanks to the improvements in irrigation network efficiencies of 30 10 even though the increased blue wfs consequently as driven by the increases in crop productivity and the reduced rates of population growth the crop related net vw imports of the yrb decrease drastically and the yrb becomes a bigger net vw exporter however with total net cost of the total vw exports in all the scenarios 4 discussion through the case for the yrb the current study reveals that trade offs exist between the volume and value of green and blue wfs in crop production as well as the volume and value of crop related vw flows as shown in fig 5 with the 2013 data in the study case the directions of values of the physical water and vw are inversely related to the corresponding water flows hoekstra et al 2001 savenije and van der zaag 2020 farmers consume water in crop production while receiving economic net benefits a vw exporter consumes local water resources in producing crops for exports and finally consumed in other places while gets income through the vw flows two phenomena shown in the current study highlight important aspects in water management for food production from the internal water economic effecting mechanisms i blue water was found to be able to generate higher economic values back to farmers than green water at the same irrigated crop field according to jägermeyr et al 2017 the integration of rainwater management into the current irrigation system could register a net increase of 10 in food production without the specific cost of achieving green water the lower green water value implies the recommendations to increase green water use efficiency in irrigated field not only for saving more blue water but also enhancing economic feedbacks of rainwater ii with varying economic values among crops differences in cropping structures among provinces were found to have a significant impact on the total amount of water consumption zhuo et al 2016a as well as the spatial heterogeneity in the corresponding levels of the water values the phenomenon that wheat production in the yrb consumed a lot of water but generate small values shows again the importance of valuating the regional water supply for crop production pattern design the current study valuates for the first time the green water for crops accounting for the costs in production processes the attribution of crop yields to blue and green water is based on crop modelling with consideration of water stress effects although the weighted average crop yield levels were validated from the provincial statistics zhuo et al 2016b therefore uncertainties were generated during the simulations it is not possible to calibrate the results exactly for such a large basin scale but we highly recommend to take field measurements when implementing the algorithm at a small scale where the absolute figures of water values matter however for the current study objective we believe that the shown significant temporal and spatial variabilities in values of green and blue water for different types of crops in a same geographical region through the case for the yrb are valid regarding the green and blue wf and vw flow estimates some parameters including the crop calendars the evaporation loss coefficient settings for irrigation techniques were based on assumptions with data limitations which are also should be in caution when downscaling the test scales many researchers have focused on identifying the external natural or socio economic driving factors on the physical green and blue water consumption in crop production zhao et al 2015 zhao and chen 2014 tuninetti et al 2015 or on the associated vw flows dalin et al 2012 tamea et al 2014 wang et al 2016 therefore identifying the internal driving factors on the water consumption relevant to the generated economic benefits and values is highly recommended in the future as the very start the current study identified for example the impacts of crop production structure on the valuation of green and blue water for crops so that modifying crop production structure could be one of the suggested measures while being of long term effects to maximize the economic value of both crop wfs and vw flows with short term effects on the current cropping lands it has been proven quantitively that different tillage and irrigation strategies have been quantitatively proven to differ significantly in terms of their cost effectiveness chukalla et al 2017 reasonable costs and prices of water are effective stimulus measures that promote reductions in blue water withdrawals and consumption furthermore the combination of increased water prices or taxes with wf benchmarks could also be considered last but not least the current analysis shows alternative and feasible approaches to tackle two key methodological or conceptual flaws in measuring the sustainable development goal sdg 6 4 by 2030 substantially increase water use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity un 2015 first the valuation of green water as comparable to blue water in agriculture based on wf and vw flow estimation enables drawing the whole picture on water use efficiency the sdg 6 4 1 indicator and net water scarcity the sdg 6 4 2 indicator related to agricultural sector effective indicators are shown to further investigate possible diverse measures to save and use more productively not only blue water resources the focus of the sdg 6 4 but also rainwater which is the only water resources for rain fed agriculture vanham and mekonnen 2021 vanham et al 2018 second the sdg 6 4 1 indicator is supposed to measure relationships between economic growth and water use however ignores the truth that the simple ratio of gross economic value added by sectors to water withdrawal hides complex integrations of natural and socioeconomic drivers hellegers and van halsema 2021 the shown values of blue and green water for each crop type in consideration of production costs with dividing irrigated and rain fed croplands in time and space is helpful to identify the share of crops the contribution of higher economic value per product the contribution of less water per crop or even the trade offs between economic benefits and the water productivities making up the eventual water use efficiencies credit authorship contribution statement la zhuo

3526,recent increases in the incidences of wildfires have necessitated the development of methodologies to quantify the effect of these fires on streamflows climate variability has been cited as a major challenge in revealing the true contribution of disturbance to streamflow changes to address this we developed an annual budyko decomposition method for 1 statistical change detection of hydrologic signatures post fire 2 separating climate driven and fire driven changes in streamflow and 3 estimating hydrologic recovery timescales after fire we demonstrate the use of this methodology for 17 watersheds in southern california with high interannual variability in precipitation we show that while traditional metrics like changes in flow or runoff ratio might not detect a disturbance effect due to confounding climate signals the budyko framework can be used successfully for statistical change detection the budyko approach was also found to be robust in detecting changes in 5 highly burned catchments 40 burned area ratio while changes in less burned 2 and unburned catchments 10 were insignificant we further used the budyko approach to quantify the contribution of fire driven versus climate driven changes in streamflow and found that fire contributed to an average increase in streamflow on the order of 80 mm yr 1 though the effect varied greatly between years finally we estimated hydrologic recovery timescales that varied between 5 and 45 years for four burned catchments we found a significant linear relationship between recovery time and burned area at medium and high severity for our study catchments with about 4 years of recovery time per 10 of the watershed burned keywords wildfire hydrology climate budyko timeseries analysis runoff 1 introduction forested headwaters serve a critical societal function by providing drinking water for large portions of the population in north america and across the globe brown et al 2008 ernst 2004 the protection of these forests and associated ecosystem services is of paramount importance in the face of increased pressures from forest harvesting anderson lockaby 2011 global climate change seidl et al 2017 2016 and wildfires debano et al 1998 hallema et al 2018a robinne et al 2018 wildfires stand out as an ominous threat to water security bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2011 nunes et al 2018 rockström et al 2014 by changing streamflows they can result in increased erosion and decreased hillslope stability ryan et al 2011 wohl 2013 contributing to degraded water quality and aquatic ecosystem health at downstream locations basso et al 2020 rust et al 2019a the study of streamflow changes from wildfire is relatively new but hydrologists have been exploring the response of streamflow to disturbances like forest harvesting for more than half a century using paired catchment studies and before after control impact experiments baci see reviews by bosch hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 goeking tarboton 2020 the unpredictability of wildfire occurrence makes it difficult to apply these well established methodologies to distinguish between climate and fire effects on streamflow responses this is especially true in semi arid mediterranean ecosystems with significant year to year variability in climate mclauchlan et al 2020 the increasing incidence of extreme wildfires and degraded water quality in these regions cannon and degraff 2009 flannigan et al 2009 westerling et al 2014 has spurred numerous studies into how fire alters storm event and baseflow recession dynamics bart and tague 2017 soulis et al 2021 annual water yields bart and hope 2010 hallema et al 2018b 2017b wine and cadol 2016 as well as annual runoff ratios blount et al 2019 kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 however there still exists significant uncertainty on how wildfire affects annual water yield the general assumption is that streamflows increase after wildfire driven by suppressed evapotranspiration from vegetation mortality basso et al 2020 ice et al 2004 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 as well as other effects like increase in soil hydrophobicity decreasing infiltration and increasing overland flow to the stream beatty and smith 2013 robichaud 2000 however studies have also found that for low intensity fires that do not result in complete forest mortality the remaining vegetation may take advantage of either less nutrient or soil water competition increasing growth and increasing transpiration and thus decreasing streamflows biederman et al 2015 tague et al 2019 due to these different factors and a lack of paired catchment data decoupling the effects of climate versus wildfire remains challenging two recent large analyses of wildfire impacted catchments found a wide distribution of increases and decreases in post fire streamflows hallema et al 2018b saxe et al 2018 saxe et al document intra annual changes in flows in 82 watersheds in the western u s with burned area ratios bar in the range of 9 35 interquartile range median 16 outliers up to 98 they analyzed several hydrologic metrics high flows low flows runoff ratio baseflow index etc and found post fire responses to be highly variable with trends often difficult to discern they argue that variability in climate can outweigh any changes in rainfall partitioning to streamflow and evapotranspiration due to wildfire and this contributes to such apparent confounding effects hallema et al 2018b analyzed over 150 burned watersheds in the southern and western united states and used climate elasticity models cem sankarasubramanian et al 2001 to parse climate and fire effects on streamflow these authors showed that river flows changed in only 20 of watersheds where bar exceeded 19 however the challenge in their method lies in the detection of a statistically significant changepoint in streamflow prior to cem analysis in semi arid regions climate variability can be so dominant that a statistically significant change in streamflow might not be apparent immediately after fire furthermore their method focuses solely on evaluating changes in the mean hydrologic responses between the pre fire and post fire periods and thus the findings are sensitive to the number of years of data that is available after the fire saxe et al 2018 found that the effects of fire are greatest in the first few years following fire and that they dissipate over time this dissipation timescale also referred to as hydrologic recovery timescale is a function of vegetation growth dynamics and is critical for watershed managers for planning buttle et al 2018 heath et al 2014 kinoshita and hogue 2011 wagenbrenner et al 2021 no studies to date have developed transferable methodologies that can parse climate and fire effects adequately at the annual timescale and effectively quantify hydrologic recovery timescales the overall objective of our study is to address this gap by developing a new method for 1 statistical change detection to quantify the effect of fire on streamflows 2 parsing the effect of climate versus disturbance from annual streamflows post wildfire and 3 quantifying recovery timescales in wildfire impacted catchments our method is based on the budyko decomposition method first proposed by wang hejazi 2011 and adapted in this paper to the annual timescale for characterizing catchment recovery we test the robustness of the method by comparing it to more traditional approaches of analyzing effects of wildfire by quantifying changes in the mean annual streamflow and the runoff ratio our overall hypothesis is that a change detection methodology rooted in the budyko framework can be used to distinguish between hydrologic effects in burned and unburned catchments we provide a case study outlining the application of our method in several watersheds in southern california impacted by wildfires and compare them with unburned reference catchments in the same geographic area finally we conclude with lessons learned and future work 2 conceptual framework and objectives 2 1 rationale for the budyko decomposition method at the inter annual timescale catchments exhibit a strong relationship between climate energy and precipitation inputs and water exports evapotranspiration and streamflow the budyko curve budyko 1974 1961 developed using long term streamflow data from hundreds of catchments captures this relationship by plotting the water partitioning against the climatic controls fig 1 here climate is characterized by the ratio of energy to water inputs also known as the aridity index ai and is calculated as the potential evapotranspiration pet over precipitation p the water partition is characterized by the evaporative index ei and is calculated as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration aet over p fig 1 stresses that in the domain of low ai especially ai less than one ei responds almost linearly to changing ai whereas for high ai ei is almost insensitive to ai recent studies have used the budyko framework to differentiate between the effects of changing climate and landscape scale disturbances on streamflow jaramillo et al 2018 li et al 2018 mo et al 2018 shahid et al 2018 wang and hejazi 2011 wang and stephenson 2018 wu et al 2018 wang hejazi 2011 first presented this decomposition method and showed for 413 catchments from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 in the united states u s that changes in q due to climate between two 20 year periods were large 18 0 9 change in mean annual q and greater than changes due to human activity young et al 2019 found that the budyko framework performed similarly in attributing flow changes to disturbance and climate effects when compared against the more traditional paired catchment approach these studies demonstrate the successful application of the budyko decomposition method see also creed et al 2014 jones et al 2012 however they have been limited to examining changes across 10 to 20 year blocks of time and have not examined the response of catchments in the aftermath of single year disturbances like harvesting or wildfire here we expand on this prior work to assess the applicability of the budyko decomposition method to quantify the immediate response of catchment hydrology to events like wildfire and decouple climate from fire effects at the annual timescale the first step in this approach is to evaluate the applicability of the budyko model at the interannual timescale indeed while the traditional budyko hypothesis was developed at the multi decadal timescale a wealth of recent studies have documented the ability of the budyko curve to capture temporal variations in water balance demonstrating a remarkable space time symmetry carmona et al 2014 chen et al 2013 cheng et al 2011 donohue et al 2006 harman et al 2011 milly and dunne 2002 potter and zhang 2009 rice and emanuel 2019 sivapalan et al 2011 teng et al 2012 troch et al 2013 yang et al 2007 the biggest challenge in application of the budyko hypothesis at the inter annual time scale is the assumption of no change in catchment water storage that is fundamental to the original budyko method to evaluate the validity of this assumption rice emanuel 2019 analyzed interannual changes in watershed storage using ground based and remotely sensed data in 1000 watersheds across the contiguous u s for the 10 year period 2002 2011 they found that in arid catchments with greater evaporative partitioning high ei the size of the interannual storage changes were on average quite small relative to the magnitude of annual precipitation figure si 1 they further found that watersheds exhibited a positive correlation between the degree of forest cover and the fit to the budyko type curve at the interannual scale see also roderick farquhar 2011 implying that higher forest cover led to more budyko type behavior indicative of hydrologic steady state rice emanuel 2019 argue that this occurs because eco hydrologic feedbacks in forested watersheds reinforce steady state response by downregulating transpiration and decreasing hydrologic connectivity in arid conditions while increasing evapotranspiration and drainage during wet conditions given that the watersheds in our case study have both high ei and significant vegetative cover fig 2 tables si 1 si 2 we argue that it is reasonable to use budyko decomposition at the interannual timescale 2 2 objective 1 statistical change detection to quantify the effect of fire on streamflows we developed a novel approach for statistical change detection to quantify the effect of fire on streamflows the first step in this method is the translation of annual catchment data into budyko space given annual values of precipitation p streamflow q and potential evapotranspiration pet for a watershed the aet was calculated using the water balance equation aet p q which assumes that the carryover of storage between years is negligible compared to the annual fluxes of aet p and q this assumption has been often used in annual water balance studies milly 1994 sivapalan et al 2011 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 however to minimize the errors introduced by this assumption we aggregated the monthly values of p and q over the hydrological rather than the calendar year as proposed by the u s geological survey usgs and following the approaches by sivapalan et al 2011 and carmona et al 2014 there should be no major fire or other forest disturbance such as harvesting during this time period to avoid confounding effects a fu type budyko curve was then fit using data from the pre fire period to evaluate the ability of the budyko curve to capture interannual variability in water partitioning during the non disturbed period in the supporting information section si 2 2 we discuss the choice of the fu type curves figure si 2 and the robustness to this choice compared to other methods the fu curve fu 1981 is characterized by eq 1 1 ei i 1 ai i 1 ai i ω 1 ω the ω parameter was calibrated using nonlinear least squares regression to pre fire annual data time series of measured evaporative index ei i and measured aridity index ai i from each watershed using the stats and budyko packages in r hampton 2020 r core team 2020 the investr package greenwell and schubert kabban 2014 was used to calculate confidence and prediction intervals from the regression models the parameter ω is then used to create a timeseries of evaporative index ei i c as a function of the aridity index ai i we then used two different approaches to use the modeled ei i c for statistical change detection a budyko deviation approach and a covariate modelling approach 2 2 1 budyko deviation approach in the budyko deviation approach we assumed that in the absence of landscape disturbance like fire catchments move back and forth along a budyko type curve as a function of temporal variations in climate as captured by the aridity index ai our proposed decomposition method is described in fig 1 if a catchment moves from point a ai1 ei1 in the pre disturbance year to point b ai2 ei2 in the post disturbance year then this movement can be described as the sum of a climate component and a landscape disturbance component in the absence of any landscape disturbance the catchment would have moved from point a to point c along the budyko curve this movement describes the climate component of the change in streamflow and it has both a horizontal and a vertical component the effect of the landscape disturbance in the post disturbance year is then captured by the vertical distance between points b and c our change detection method relies on these vertical deviations from the predicted curve we defined our change metric as the annual vertical budyko deviation d i the difference between the modelled ei i c and measured ei i values in each year both pre and post fire 2 d i ei i c ei i the d i is represented in fig 1 as the vertical distance between points b and c we assessed the statistical significance of the changes in the distribution of d i using the nonparametric kolmogorov smirnov k s test the null hypothesis was that the distributions of these deviations were the same in the two equal length n years periods of time before and after the fire our alternative hypothesis was that the deviations were greater post fire the analysis was performed in both burned and unburned catchments to help confirm that the lack of an apparent response can be attributed to climatic differences we argue that the budyko deviation metric accounts for climatic variability and is thus a more robust detector of the effect of fire than more traditional metrics like the change in streamflow q or runoff ratio rr 2 2 2 covariate modelling approach the covariate modelling approach relies on well established statistical change detection methodologies using a climate covariate e g eaton et al 2010 zhang and wei 2012 to do this we modelled the time series of ei i as a function of a climate co variate ei i c as in zhang wei 2012 2014 and an exponentially decaying intervention effect 3 ei i ei i c d i m e x p j k i f j 0 1 i f j 0 0 where m and k are constants i is a counter for years and j counts years post fire exp x is the exponential function e x where when j 0 m e jk m for negative values of j the step function in brackets has a value of 0 removing the negative domain of the exponential function the constant m represents the magnitude of the response in the first post fire year while the decay coefficient k describes the rate of recovery here unlike in eq 1 both pre and post fire years are included in the model calibration the significance of the post fire response was assessed by the significance of the parameters m and k specifically we tested a null hypothesis where the climate co variate ei i c adequately predicts the hydrologic response during both the pre fire and post fire periods and the intervention effect as characterized by m has a statistically insignificant magnitude and an alternative hypothesis where the intervention effect has a statistically significant magnitude this approach was applied to both burned and unburned catchments to confirm whether the m parameter was controlled solely by fire effects models were fit using non linear least squares regression using the stats package in r r core team 2020 the best fit model was determined by minimizing the sum of the squared model residuals we assessed model appropriateness by comparing the model residuals from the pre and post fire time period using 2 sample kolmogorov smirnov k s test with a two directional alternative hypothesis stats package in r r core team 2020 an appropriate model confirmed the null hypothesis that the distributions of residuals were not significantly different p 0 1 in all cases the investr package greenwell and schubert kabban 2014 was used to calculate confidence and prediction intervals from the regression models in the budyko deviation approach we relied on a statistical test of the difference between two unordered populations of n years while in the covariate modelling approach we explicitly considered the ordering of the time series 2 2 3 benchmarking with other change metrics we compared our two approaches to more traditional change metrics as discussed in our review of the literature many studies apply statistical tests directly to the timeseries of q and rr to assess disturbance effects we averaged data for streamflow q runoff ratio rr and budyko deviation d for 10 years pre fire and 10 years post fire we report the difference in these 10 year averages with the capital letter δ e g δ d δ q and δ r r see eqs 4 6 4 δ d 1 n i 1 n d i 1 n j 1 n d j 5 δ q 1 10 i 1 10 q i 1 10 j 1 10 q j 6 δ r r 1 10 i 1 10 rr i 1 10 j 1 10 rr j in eqs 4 6 the subscript i is used for post fire years while the subscript j is used for pre fire years for these same 10 year periods of data we tested whether the two samples pre and post fire were statistically different using a 2 sample k s test with a one directional alternative hypothesis stats package in r r core team 2020 2 3 objective 2 parsing the effect of climate and disturbance from annual streamflows post wildfire based on our results from the first objective we would identify catchments in which fire has had a significant effect the next step of the analysis is to quantify the magnitudes of the streamflow change due to fire and climate in the fire impacted catchments to do this we assume that the budyko type curve models how annual evaporative index and thus streamflow would respond to climate in the absence of any catchment disturbance thus in any year i the climate component of the measured flow q i c can be described as a function of modelled evaporative index ei i c and measured precipitation p i 7 q i c 1 ei i c p i in every year both pre and post fire there is some deviation between observed annual flow q i and the modelled flow q i c we denote this deviation as q i f which represents the effect of landscape disturbances like fire 8 q i f q i c q i ei i c ei i p i which is equivalent to 9 q i f d i p i we then estimate the average change in streamflow due to climate effects δ q c and fire effects as δ q f over two n year time periods before and after fire where i is used for post fire years and j is used for pre fire years as 10 δ q c 1 n i 1 n q i c 1 n j 1 n q j c 11 δ q f 1 n i 1 n q i f 1 n j 1 n q j f such that 12 δ q δ q c δ q f we use the capital letter δ to denote change between time periods we also estimate an annual q change in each post fire year relative to the pre fire average to determine how climate and fire contributed to interannual variability of flow in the post fire series specifically the climate contribution of the flow change in the post fire years δ q i c and the fire contribution of the change δ q i f are estimated as 13 δ q i c q i c 1 n j 1 n q j c 14 δ q i f q i f 1 n j 1 n q j f such that 15 δ q i δ q i c δ q i f where the lowercase letter δ signifies change in reference to a specific year the letter i is used for post fire years and j is used for pre fire years note that the average of the pre fire j is used for pre fire years flow deviations q j f exhibits a similar property as d j such that the values 1 n j 1 n d j and 1 n j 1 n q j f are small but not necessarily zero 2 4 objective 3 quantifying recovery timescales in wildfire impacted catchments finally our last objective is to quantify the recovery timescale in wildfire impacted catchments to do this we use the decay coefficient k that was estimated using the covariate modelling approach in objective 1 we modelled recovery only catchments in which there is a significant fire effect as indicated by a significant m parameter since we use an exponential model to describe decay which means theoretically recovery time is infinity we chose an arbitrary threshold beyond which the effect was insignificant in size we chose a threshold of 90 of the magnitude of m catchment recovery t was defined by inverting the exponential decay coefficient k with units of time 1 and multiplying by a recovery threshold r such that l o g 1 r k provides the 90 recovery time t 90 when r 0 9 the parameter uncertainty of k from the nonlinear regression models were used to calculate the uncertainty on t 90 3 methods 3 1 case study southern california our proposed method is illustrated in a case study located in the forested areas of southern california surrounding the san bernardino area fig 2a b this region stood out as having a high concentration of usgs gaging stations and fires in particular water year wy 2004 had a record number of fires blackwell and tuttle 2003 this large number of fires offers the opportunity to study multiple affected catchments under the same sequence of climate and disturbance conditions criteria for selecting burned catchments were based off those of rust et al 2018 and saxe et al 2018 and are described in the supporting information section si 1 1 we began with 112 candidate catchments and selected for those dominated by forested or vegetated cover minimal urban land cover and with adequate periods of record including no large fires during the period of record except for wy 2004 as much of this region is under the management of the usfs we also confirmed that no harvesting activity took place in these catchments during the period of record u s forest service 2018 this led us to select 7 burned catchments and 10 unburned catchments to analyze table si 1 two of the catchments in our study devil canyon creek b1 and city creek b2 have both been studied with respect to streamflow effects after the 2004 water year fires bart 2016 bart and tague 2017 kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 the mountains of southern california are a diverse geologic and hydroclimatic mosaic soils are generally thin and easily erodible wells 1981 and are underlain by heavily faulted assemblages of igneous and metamorphic rocks morton and miller 2006 a strong orographic effect results in wet windward slopes and dry leeward slopes dropping to the deserts to the east this gradient results in a chaparral dominated ecosystem giving way to mixed conifer forest along mountain crests and piñon juniper woodlands in drier climates fig 2c barbour et al 2007 the fire recurrence period for this ecosystem is around 30 40 years keeley and fotheringham 2001 the burned and unburned catchments ranged in size from 1 400 ha to 48 000 ha all have 50 vegetated cover shrub and forest fig 2d and are generally steep 20 40 for the 7 burned catchments burned area ratio bar at a moderate or high severity ranged from 12 to 71 fig 2e the climate is mediterranean with regional rainfall is on average 720 400 mm yr 1 and potential evaporation is 1280 90 mm yr 1 table si 2 3 2 data sources and calculations streamflow q from usgs and climatic data prism climate group 2018 including precipitation p and temperature t were used to calculate the wy hydrologic budget for our catchments we analyzed data from water years 1982 beginning of prism availability to 2018 data from wy 1982 to 2003 were used to calibrate fu type budyko curves and data from wy 2004 to 2018 were used to calculate the post fire time series of d i data sources are in table si 3 methods for data retrieval are detailed in the supporting information section si 1 2 all data and code are provided in an online repository hampton 2021 pet was calculated using the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves samani 1985 see calculations in section si 1 3 there are two groups of methods available for estimating pet temperature based methods e g thornthwaite hamon and hargreaves samani and radiation based methods e g turc makkink and priestley taylor we did not have access to radiation data at our sites and thus used the temperature based hargreaves samani equation to ensure that this didn t bring bias into our results we analyzed the choice of our pet calculation method by assessing agreement between six pet methods as in lu et al 2005 see section si 2 1 and figures si 2 3 overall we found no effect of using a temperature versus radiation based pet formula in detecting budyko deviations figures si 4 5 following retrieval of annual climate and hydrologic data a single parameter version of the budyko curve by fu 1981 and the ω parameter was fit using nonlinear least squares regression to pre fire annual data from each watershed using the nls and budyko packages in r hampton 2020 r core team 2020 each of the 17 watersheds in our study was fit to a different fu type budyko curve that is a function of the physical properties of the specific watershed such as soil properties and vegetation type and coverage e g milly 1994 zhang et al 2001 2008 all available pre fire data wy 1982 2003 were used in the curve fitting process from the fu fit curves for each watershed the budyko deviations d i were then calculated for each year after fire following eq 2 annual flow was decomposed into a climate prediction eq 7 and fire deviation eqs 8 9 and total effect sizes were calculated following eqs 10 12 and 4 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 statistical change detection using the budyko framework we found that all 17 catchments in our study adhered reasonably well to their respective fu type budyko curves in the pre fire period 1982 2003 with mean absolute error of the budyko fits generally 0 1 units of ei table si 2 and the fu ω values ranging from 2 0 to 10 in an analysis of 1000 catchments across the u s rice and emanuel 2019 concluded that catchments with large inter annual changes in storage deviate below the original budyko curve see supporting information section si 1 4 figure si 1 thus the strong adherence of our data to the budyko curves in the pre fire years suggests that the assumption of hydrologic steady state at the annual timescale is appropriate in these catchments furthermore rice and emanuel argued that catchments with higher fu ω values that were closer to the ω of approximately 2 8 for the idealized budyko curve deviate the least from hydrologic steady state at the inter annual time scale given that our ω values median ω 2 6 table si 2 were at the higher end of the range of values explored by rice and emanuel it is thus reasonable to also assume steady state in our analysis while the pre fire year ei data strongly conformed to the budyko curve strong vertical deviations were apparent in the postfire years in the burned catchments but not in the unburned catchments fig 3 the deviations in the burned catchments fell below the fu type curves for several years after fire indicating an increase in streamflow possibly due to loss of vegetation and alteration of the surface soils during the fire we also see that for the two least burned catchments b6 and b7 there is very little deviation in budyko space these were the burned catchments with a burned area ratio bar of 20 while the other burned catchments had bar ranging from 45 to 97 fig 2e these results suggest that the budyko framework was able to qualitatively distinguish between burned and unburned catchments using the budyko deviation approach section 2 1 1 we found statistically significant change in budyko deviation fig 4 a for five of the highly burned catchments b1 b5 bar 40 while catchments b6 and b7 bar 25 experienced insignificant deviations the magnitude of the budyko deviations δ d ranged from 0 07 for catchment b3 to 0 16 for catchment b1 average value 0 12 in contrast for the unburned catchments there were no significant deviations in budyko space and the magnitude of δ d was much smaller fig 4a the significantly larger δ d values in the burned catchments compared to the unburned catchments highlights the ability of this approach to detect the effect of fire using the covariate modelling approach section 2 1 2 we modelled the ei time series using the climate co variate and the intervention effect which was characterized by the parameters m and k controlling the fire effect size and recovery time respectively we found that the m parameter was significant at the 10 confidence level for catchments b1 b5 the magnitude of m was also much higher in the five most highly burned catchments b1 b5 average 0 21 compared to the two least burned b6 b7 average 0 02 and unburned catchments average 0 01 fig 4b indeed where m was small it was also not significantly different from zero in the two less burned and unburned catchments an increase in the magnitude and significance of the m parameter in the five highly burned catchments highlights the effectiveness of the budyko framework in statistical change detection post fire having confirmed our hypothesis using two approaches significance of δ d and m we sought to test whether more traditional approaches of change detection could parse the same effects 4 2 method comparison to traditional approaches as stated above the much preferred baci approach is difficult to apply in wildfire impacted catchments due the unpredictability of large fires still many studies have used the wealth of data in the u s to analyze pre and post fire streamflow data to assess changes in q and rr blount et al 2019 hallema et al 2018b 2017a kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 saxe et al 2018 we observed similar magnitudes of average streamflow changes δ q between the burned and unburned sites ranging from 38 to 98 60 to 100 mm yr 1 in the burned catchments and ranging from 92 to 120 100 to 60 mm yr 1 in the unburned catchments fig 4c furthermore none of the changes in either the burned or unburned catchments were statistically significant p value 0 10 fig 4c this highlights that the flow changes observed were most likely driven by climatic changes in the post fire years and that metrics like the mean streamflow change is not always adequate to isolate the effects of fire driven due to climatic variability indeed annual p was lower in the 10 years after wy 2004 corresponding to increased aridity for many of the catchments figure si 7 this reduced p resulted in lower streamflow that confounded our ability to detect fire driven increases in streamflow from climate driven decrease indeed the climate and the streamflow are so variable between years in this ecozone that detection of any significant change is difficult thus any change attribution method relying on the detection of a significant q change point will conclude incorrectly that fire had no effect in these catchments possibly the most common metric that has been used for detecting changes following wildfire or any other disturbance is the runoff ratio rr e g biederman et al 2015 bladon et al 2019 blount et al 2019 kinoshita hogue 2015 we found the differences in rr to be somewhat more sensitive for comparison between the pre and post fire periods rr for devil canyon creek b1 usgs gage 11063680 experienced a significant increase at the 1 confidence level while catchments b2 and b3 experienced a significant increase at the 5 level fig 4d notably in their study of catchment b1 kinoshita hogue 2015 observed increases of rr of similar magnitudes as ours for devil canyon creek according to our calculations all other changes in rr in burned and unburned catchments were statistically insignificant except for a small increase of 0 02 units for catchment ub3 p 0 08 thus only three of the seven burned catchments show a statistically significant increase in the distribution of runoff ratios between the pre fire and the post fire periods while almost all of the unburned catchments showed no statistically significant difference this highlights the challenges in detecting significant changes in this ecozone with high climate variability the distribution of streamflow values showed no significant differences between pre and post fire periods while the runoff ratio was only able to detect change in three of the most burned catchments in contrast the budyko metrics δ d and m increased significantly i e decreased ei attributed to disturbance for the 5 most highly burned sites thus in moving from a series of annual discharge data and runoff ratio to budyko deviation we increased thedetectability of the disturbance effect in the hydrologic time series 4 3 quantifying the contribution of fire and climate to streamflow change next we used the budyko decomposition method to isolate the contributions of fire and climate to the annual q time series we focused on catchments b1 b5 since no significant changes were observed in b6 and b7 we used the movement of points along the budyko type curves as the climate component eq 7 and the vertical budyko deviations captured by the d values as the fire component eqs 8 9 across catchments b1 b5 fire resulted in average increases in flow δ q f ranging from 43 to 111 mm yr 1 fig 5 a in catchments b1 b4 the post fire years were drier than the pre fire years p decrease ranged from 35 to 110 mm yr 1 figure si 7 and thus climate contributed to a decrease in flow in the post fire years with δ q c ranging from 6 to 30 mm yr 1 fig 5a the larger values of δ q f compared to δ q c translated to net flow increases δ q from 30 to 80 mm yr 1 across catchments b1 b4 fig 5a in contrast in catchment b5 mean rainfall was not significantly different between pre and post fire years and thus both climate and fire led to increases in flow fig 5a it is important to note that the contribution of fire to streamflow is estimated as the difference between the vertical budyko deviations between the pre fire and the post fire years and thus the analysis implicitly considers climate and other factors that contribute to deviations in the absence of fire the contributions of fire and climate to streamflows varied between wet and dry years fig 5b in wetter years wy 2005 2 years after fire climate controlled most of the change in flow this is possibly because in these very wet years the rain events were so large that soil saturation and overland flow overwhelmed the effect of the reduced evapo transpiration rates due to vegetation mortality coombs melack 2013 studied the same region as this study and found that in wy 2005 annual runoff was not dissimilar between burned and unburned catchments in the two wettest years wy 2005 and wy 2011 climate amplified the effect of fire i e both fire and climate effects were positive for most of the catchments in contrast for the drier years wy 2004 wy 2006 2010 wy 2012 2016 we found the effects of climate and fire to be of similar magnitude with climate often counteracting the effects of fire fig 5b in these years the net change in flow is often negative dark black bars and thus not accounting for climate makes it appear that fire has led to a decrease in flow herein lies the strength of our method that decouples the climate from the fire signal and allows us to understand how these two components amplify or counteract each other in wet and dry years of course while the differences between the wet and dry years are apparent from the results there are further nuances in the year to year relative contributions of fire and climate across the five catchments these differences are affected by local scale factors such as rainfall seasonality adjacency of the fire to the stream e g bart 2016 bart and tague 2017 subsurface geology etc that is beyond the scope of current work in the next section we explore whether we can quantitatively evaluate the recovery of this hydrologic disturbance effect to pre fire conditions 4 4 quantifying hydrologic recovery timescales the annual data from the 5 most burned catchments show significant deviation from pre fire conditions fig 4 fig 3 shows that for many of the burned catchments annual points appear to gravitate back to the pre fire budyko curve after several years of strong deviations fig 6 a shows the time series of d for the five most burned catchments and the modelled values of d using eq 3 this decaying effect is apparent in the models for catchments b1 b2 and b4 b5 with varying recovery times back to pre fire conditions catchment b3 did not experience a strong recovery pattern like the others fig 3 fig 6a and indeed had the lowest δ d effect size 0 07 fig 4a of the burned catchments with bar 40 the decay coefficients for the b1 b2 and b4 b5 models were transformed into recovery times as described in section 2 3 t 90 log 0 1 k we estimated 90 recovery times as 43 years confidence interval 23 298 years for catchment b1 15 10 27 years for b2 9 6 5 1 85 years for b4 and 3 8 2 3 9 9 years for b5 fig 6b we estimated 90 recovery times as 43 years confidence 23 298 years for catchment b1 15 10 27 years for b2 9 6 5 1 85 years for b4 and 3 8 2 3 9 9 years for b5 fig 6b bart and tague 2017 used remotely sensed vegetation data to estimate vegetation recovery in catchment b2 and found a 90 recovery timescale of 8 8 years which is slightly lower than our estimate of 15 years it is important to remember however that vegetation recovery and hydrologic recovery can occur on very different timescales note also that b1 has the longest recovery time and the greatest uncertainty in its estimate given that we have only 15 years of data in contrast recovery time estimates for catchments b4 and b5 are more compatible with the timescales of analysis and thus uncertainties are lower while this is a promising approach to estimate recovery times across large scales with varying availability and quality of data future work needs to focus on validating these estimates with longer timeseries of flow and vegetation data analysis of hydrologic recovery times in post fire landscapes is often limited by availability of long enough flow time series after fire this leaves considerable uncertainty of how long it can take for streamflow to recover after fire our longer recovery times are however not inconsistent with other studies using longer timeseries in the same region a study using 66 years of streamflow data from the san dimas experimental forest in california found that the effects of fire on streamflows can last as many as 20 years meixner and wohlgemuth 2003 similarly a recent study in the pacific northwest found no evidence of hydrologic recovery 35 years after fire niemeyer et al 2020 in a recent review of hydrologic recovery after fire in mediterranean climates wagenbrenner et al 2021 found that among 38 burned study 42 of sites recovered within 5 years after fire while 5 of the sites had recovery times between 5 and 10 years in contrast 53 of the sites did not recover during the monitoring period of 4 10 years making it difficult to estimate recovery times appropriately in an analysis including catchment b2 from our study bart and tague 2017 showed that the impact of fire on stream baseflow recession rates and the recovery of this metric post fire were correlated with the impact on and recovery of vegetation in the stream riparian zone these authors found that modelled post fire vegetation recovery with a 90 recovery timescale of 8 8 years adequately predicted recovery of baseflow recession rates recovery timescales appear to be a function of type intensity and distribution of disturbance as well as climatic factors and these factors have not been significantly explored across systems 4 5 correlation of effect sizes and burn severity for the 7 burned sites we investigated whether bar correlated with the average budyko deviation for the 10 years post fire δ d this relationship relatively weak for b1 b7 p 0 07 r2 0 41 and appeared to have no strength among the 5 burned catchments with significant changes in δ d b1 b5 p 0 56 this lack of correlation is similarly found in the results of saxe et al 2018 and hallema et al 2018b who also found little to no correlation between bar and percent changes in flow we did however see a threshold pattern where sites burned with 40 area showed significant budyko deviations b1 b5 further in contrast to the lack of a relationship between bar and effect size we found a strong linear relationship between the recovery timescale and the percent of the watershed burned at moderate and high severity fig 6b p 0 03 this recovery and burn relationship corresponded to a slope of about 4 1 years of recovery per 10 burned note in fig 6b that there is uncertainty around the individual estimates of k and the corresponding recovery times t 90 and there is large uncertainty around the linear regression itself the longer recovery times of the watershed areas with greater bar at moderate and high severity most likely arises due to the persistence of detectable effects in the streamflow signal that increases with increasing disturbed area this pattern should be tested with larger populations of disturbed forested catchments further study should explore whether this hydrologic recovery is correlated to ground or satellite based measurements of vegetation recovery or soil infiltration rates 4 6 limitations and future work evaluation of the effect of a disturbance like wildfire on hydrologic response is complex because of the significant year to year variability in flow which makes the analysis extremely sensitive to the number of years of post fire data that is available our analysis was based on a 16 year time series of post fire data and even though time series like budyko deviation d have less variability than q ai or ei our statistical tests could still be influenced by the exact choice of years of data available our analysis would be increasingly robust to these climatic variations with increased data availability but for this region of southern california the high incidences of fire meant that we could isolate only a small timeframe that had only one fire in all the study catchments our estimate of hydrologic recovery timescale is limited by the small timeframe of postfire data and the significant budyko deviations over this time period future work could examine how these budyko deviations dissipate over time and whether catchments do indeed return to their pre fire budyko curve consistently capturing this effect statistically and correlating recovery with satellite products for vegetation indices and soil moisture would add more certainty to such findings since we did not have access to site measured data including p and radiation we instead relied on large 4 kilometer gridded spatial data for p and temperature to satisfy the requirements for the budyko limiting our ability to capture gradients in climate variables over elevation and with respect to windward and leeward slopes further access only to temperature data limited us in our choice of pet calculation methods nonetheless we performed a comparative analysis in nearby data rich catchments on whether using a temperature versus radiation based pet methods would affect the results of our budyko analysis and found no significant difference between the two method groups section si 2 1 however future estimates could be refined with access to radiation data additionally we rely on the assumption of hydrologic steady state at the annual time scale however as we have argued in section 2 of this paper given that recent studies have provided evidence of the budyko curve being applicable at the interannual timescale this is a reasonable assumption furthermore we find that our catchments have high fu ω values and the budyko curve can capture the interannual variability in data reasonably well across a decadal timescale proving as per by rice and emanuel 2019 that interannual changes in storage is not significant of course there are significant changes that occur both to the vegetation and the soil properties in the post fire period that might bring into question the validity of the budyko assumption however our finding of the distinctly different responses in the budyko space between the burned and unburned catchments highlights that the budyko framework might still be adequate for use in change detection indeed the budyko deviation approach has also been used for change detection in other scenarios involving land use transition for example conversion of prairies to cropland wang and hejazi 2011 ye et al 2012 that said the thin soils and heavily faulted basement rocks in this area of california may facilitate changes in interactions with deep groundwater following fire as discussed for devil canyon creek catchment b1 by jung et al 2009 in the future we could use improved satellite derived et products e g poon kinoshita 2018 to specifically estimate any changes in storage as p minus q minus aet all this highlights the need for continued intensive field studies of altered moisture fluxes and water storage at the landscape scale after fire we used satellite derived fire severity products mtbs eidenshink et al 2007 to quantify barin each watershed following the approaches of two recent large studies in the western u s hallema et al 2018b saxe et al 2018 however these products have limitations in identifying differences in burn severity between sites differing in pre fire forest composition and structure harvey et al 2019 kolden et al 2015 future work would involve the use of more sophisticated satellite products for this purpose it is also important to note that the relationship identified between the burn severity and hydrologic recovery is specific to the five catchments analyzed in the study future work would involve expanding the analysis across larger geographic scales similar to the work of hallema et al 2018b and saxe et al 2018 to quantify the relative contributions of fire and climate to streamflow we also acknowledge that many other on the ground factors could influence the relationship between fire and hydrologic change including fire severity fire proximity to the riparian area and catchment topography elevation and geology e g feikema et al 2013 rust et al 2019b again we stress the need for continued study at the local scale on how we can better characterize high or low severity as an ecohydrological effect additionally incorporation of other datasets such as vegetation indices e g paci et al 2017 may help characterize disturbance magnitudes and recovery timescales 5 conclusions in this study we developed a novel methodology based on the budyko framework to quantify the relative contributions of climate and fire disturbance on annual streamflow time series and we used this information to characterize hydrologic recovery timescales this study moves us towards addressing some of the unsolved problems in hydrology summarized by blöschl et al 2019 what are the impacts of land cover change and soil disturbances on water and energy fluxes at the land surface and what causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoff evaporation subsurface water and material fluxes and their sensitivity to their controls e g aridity our results add to a growing number of studies documenting flow increases following wildfire importantly we have added to a subset of studies that differentiate between climate related flow changes and those attributed to forest disturbance with the novel aspect of using the budyko framework at the annual timescale and explicitly quantifying the hydrologic recovery time in a study region like ours where annual p and ai were highly variable due in large part to the el niño southern oscillation schonher and nicholson 1989 previous methods of comparing either annual streamflow or runoff ratio between pre and post fire years can be confounded by climate variability we argue that while traditional metrics like changes in the mean annual flow and the annual runoff ratio were not statistically different between pre fire and post fire years fig 4c d the effect of fire following water year 2004 manifested as statistically significant differences in the budyko deviations in five of the most severely burned catchments fig 4a b importantly budyko deviations were not statistically different for the unburned catchments between pre and post fire years lending credence to the hypothesis that it was the fire in the burned catchments that led to the observed deviations the budyko decomposition method expanded upon in this study allows us to collapse climate variability and explicitly isolate the effect of fire analyzing 20 years of pre and post fire data we showed that fire on the average increased flow by 80 mm yr 1 that was counterbalanced by a general drying over this time period and 10 20 mm yr 1 flow decrease due to climate alone we then modelled the time series of ei and estimated hydrologic recovery timescales which ranged between 3 and 43 years in the study catchments although other studies have quantified effects of fires on streamflow these have primarily focused on average effects for 10 to 20 year time blocks between pre and post fire years here we explicitly captured recovery timescales at an annual resolution we showed persistence of budyko deviations d out to past ten years post fire fig 6a and hydrologic recovery captured by the deviation series that correlated significantly with catchment burned area fig 6b we found that for every 10 burned at moderate and high severity hydrologic recovery was pushed back approximately 4 years p 0 03 thus we showed that the budyko framework can be used to decouple fire versus climate effects on streamflow patterns after wildfire and to effectively quantify hydrologic recovery timescales our finding of increased flow after wildfires similar to the results of previous studies in the chaparral ecosystems of southern california kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 loáiciga et al 2001 meixner and wohlgemuth 2003 has significant impact with respect to water supplies this could mean more water available to parched areas of the world especially california as noted by meixner wohlgemuth 2003 however as has been shown in numerous studies flow increases are often accompanied by changing hydrologic signatures e g flashiness flood frequency resulting in increased erosion suspended sediments burke et al 2013 as well as increased nutrient loads smith et al 2012 all these threaten water security martin 2016 almost certainly more than increased water supply might alleviate stress further increased flows are generally transient and likely rob down wind areas of precipitation from local evapotranspiration kirchner et al 2020 this is the first presentation of results demonstrating that the hydrologic effects and recovery from wildfire can be captured using the budyko decomposition method wang hejazi 2011 deforestation studies involving forest harvesting far outnumber wildfire studies despite the hazards involved with fire this use of open datasets to conduct this analysis could be leveraged to greatly enhance our understanding of the variety of hydrologic effects of forest disturbance including both harvesting and fire and can be applied across arid to humid regions to differentiate climate forcings from disturbance related changes in annual streamflow given the wealth of streamflow data available in the contiguous united states falcone 2011 falcone et al 2010 there are countless opportunities to go backwards and reanalyze datasets with respect to nearby and relevant streamflow datasets coincident with changes in land cover including wildfire forest harvesting

3526,recent increases in the incidences of wildfires have necessitated the development of methodologies to quantify the effect of these fires on streamflows climate variability has been cited as a major challenge in revealing the true contribution of disturbance to streamflow changes to address this we developed an annual budyko decomposition method for 1 statistical change detection of hydrologic signatures post fire 2 separating climate driven and fire driven changes in streamflow and 3 estimating hydrologic recovery timescales after fire we demonstrate the use of this methodology for 17 watersheds in southern california with high interannual variability in precipitation we show that while traditional metrics like changes in flow or runoff ratio might not detect a disturbance effect due to confounding climate signals the budyko framework can be used successfully for statistical change detection the budyko approach was also found to be robust in detecting changes in 5 highly burned catchments 40 burned area ratio while changes in less burned 2 and unburned catchments 10 were insignificant we further used the budyko approach to quantify the contribution of fire driven versus climate driven changes in streamflow and found that fire contributed to an average increase in streamflow on the order of 80 mm yr 1 though the effect varied greatly between years finally we estimated hydrologic recovery timescales that varied between 5 and 45 years for four burned catchments we found a significant linear relationship between recovery time and burned area at medium and high severity for our study catchments with about 4 years of recovery time per 10 of the watershed burned keywords wildfire hydrology climate budyko timeseries analysis runoff 1

ecosystem health at downstream locations basso et al 2020 rust et al 2019a the study of streamflow changes from wildfire is relatively new but hydrologists have been exploring the response of streamflow to disturbances like forest harvesting for more than half a century using paired catchment studies and before after control impact experiments baci see reviews by bosch hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 goeking tarboton 2020 the unpredictability of wildfire occurrence makes it difficult to apply these well established methodologies to distinguish between climate and fire effects on streamflow responses this is especially true in semi arid mediterranean ecosystems with significant year to year variability in climate mclauchlan et al 2020 the increasing incidence of extreme wildfires and degraded water quality in these regions cannon and degraff 2009 flannigan et al 2009 westerling et al 2014 has spurred numerous studies into how fire alters storm event and baseflow recession dynamics bart and tague 2017 soulis et al 2021 annual water yields bart and hope 2010 hallema et al 2018b 2017b wine and cadol 2016 as well as annual runoff ratios blount et al 2019 kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 however there still exists significant uncertainty on how wildfire affects annual water yield the general assumption is that streamflows increase after wildfire driven by suppressed evapotranspiration from vegetation mortality basso et al 2020 ice et al 2004 maina and siirila woodburn 2020 as well as other effects like increase in soil hydrophobicity decreasing infiltration and increasing overland flow to the stream beatty and smith 2013 robichaud 2000 however studies have also found that for low intensity fires that do not result in complete forest mortality the remaining vegetation may take advantage of either less nutrient or soil water competition increasing growth and increasing transpiration and thus decreasing streamflows biederman et al 2015 tague et al 2019 due to these different factors and a lack of paired catchment data decoupling the effects of climate versus wildfire remains challenging two recent large analyses of wildfire impacted catchments found a wide distribution of increases and decreases in post fire streamflows hallema et al 2018b saxe et al 2018 saxe et al document intra annual changes in flows in 82 watersheds in the western u s with burned area ratios bar in the range of 9 35 interquartile range median 16 outliers up to 98 they analyzed several hydrologic metrics high flows low flows runoff ratio baseflow index etc and found post fire responses to be highly variable with trends often difficult to discern they argue that variability in climate can outweigh any changes in rainfall partitioning to streamflow and evapotranspiration due to wildfire and this contributes to such apparent confounding effects hallema et al 2018b analyzed over 150 burned watersheds in the southern and western united states and used climate elasticity models cem sankarasubramanian et al 2001 to parse climate and fire effects on streamflow these authors showed that river flows changed in only 20 of watersheds where bar exceeded 19 however the challenge in their method lies in the detection of a statistically significant changepoint in streamflow prior to cem analysis in semi arid regions climate variability can be so dominant that a statistically significant change in streamflow might not be apparent immediately after fire furthermore their method focuses solely on evaluating changes in the mean hydrologic responses between the pre fire and post fire periods and thus the findings are sensitive to the number of years of data that is available after the fire saxe et al 2018 found that the effects of fire are greatest in the first few years following fire and that they dissipate over time this dissipation timescale also referred to as hydrologic recovery timescale is a function of vegetation growth dynamics and is critical for watershed managers for planning buttle et al 2018 heath et al 2014 kinoshita and hogue 2011 wagenbrenner et al 2021 no studies to date have developed transferable methodologies that can parse climate and fire effects adequately at the annual timescale and effectively quantify hydrologic recovery timescales the overall objective of our study is to address this gap by developing a new method for 1 statistical change detection to quantify the effect of fire on streamflows 2 parsing the effect of climate versus disturbance from annual streamflows post wildfire and 3 quantifying recovery timescales in wildfire impacted catchments our method is based on the budyko decomposition method first proposed by wang hejazi 2011 and adapted in this paper to the annual timescale for characterizing catchment recovery we test the robustness of the method by comparing it to more traditional approaches of analyzing effects of wildfire by quantifying changes in the mean annual streamflow and the runoff ratio our overall hypothesis is that a change detection methodology rooted in the budyko framework can be used to distinguish between hydrologic effects in burned and unburned catchments we provide a case study outlining the application of our method in several watersheds in southern california impacted by wildfires and compare them with unburned reference catchments in the same geographic area finally we conclude with lessons learned and future work 2 conceptual framework and objectives 2 1 rationale for the budyko decomposition method at the inter annual timescale catchments exhibit a strong relationship between climate energy and precipitation inputs and water exports evapotranspiration and streamflow the budyko curve budyko 1974 1961 developed using long term streamflow data from hundreds of catchments captures this relationship by plotting the water partitioning against the climatic controls fig 1 here climate is characterized by the ratio of energy to water inputs also known as the aridity index ai and is calculated as the potential evapotranspiration pet over precipitation p the water partition is characterized by the evaporative index ei and is calculated as the ratio of actual evapotranspiration aet over p fig 1 stresses that in the domain of low ai especially ai less than one ei responds almost linearly to changing ai whereas for high ai ei is almost insensitive to ai recent studies have used the budyko framework to differentiate between the effects of changing climate and landscape scale disturbances on streamflow jaramillo et al 2018 li et al 2018 mo et al 2018 shahid et al 2018 wang and hejazi 2011 wang and stephenson 2018 wu et al 2018 wang hejazi 2011 first presented this decomposition method and showed for 413 catchments from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 in the united states u s that changes in q due to climate between two 20 year periods were large 18 0 9 change in mean annual q and greater than changes due to human activity young et al 2019 found that the budyko framework performed similarly in attributing flow changes to disturbance and climate effects when compared against the more traditional paired catchment approach these studies demonstrate the successful application of the budyko decomposition method see also creed et al 2014 jones et al 2012 however they have been limited to examining changes across 10 to 20 year blocks of time and have not examined the response of catchments in the aftermath of single year disturbances like harvesting or wildfire here we expand on this prior work to assess the applicability of the budyko decomposition method to quantify the immediate response of catchment hydrology to events like wildfire and decouple climate from fire effects at the annual timescale the first step in this approach is to evaluate the applicability of the budyko model at the interannual timescale indeed while the traditional budyko hypothesis was developed at the multi decadal timescale a wealth of recent studies have documented the ability of the budyko curve to capture temporal variations in water balance demonstrating a remarkable space time symmetry carmona et al 2014 chen et al 2013 cheng et al 2011 donohue et al 2006 harman et al 2011 milly and dunne 2002 potter and zhang 2009 rice and emanuel 2019 sivapalan et al 2011 teng et al 2012 troch et al 2013 yang et al 2007 the biggest challenge in application of the budyko hypothesis at the inter annual time scale is the assumption of no change in catchment water storage that is fundamental to the original budyko method to evaluate the validity of this assumption rice emanuel 2019 analyzed interannual changes in watershed storage using ground based and remotely sensed data in 1000 watersheds across the contiguous u s for the 10 year period 2002 2011 they found that in arid catchments with greater evaporative partitioning high ei the size of the interannual storage changes were on average quite small relative to the magnitude of annual precipitation figure si 1 they further found that watersheds exhibited a positive correlation between the degree of forest cover and the fit to the budyko type curve at the interannual scale see also roderick farquhar 2011 implying that higher forest cover led to more budyko type behavior indicative of hydrologic steady state rice emanuel 2019 argue that this occurs because eco hydrologic feedbacks in forested watersheds reinforce steady state response by downregulating transpiration and decreasing hydrologic connectivity in arid conditions while increasing evapotranspiration and drainage during wet conditions given that the watersheds in our case study have both high ei and significant vegetative cover fig 2 tables si 1 si 2 we argue that it is reasonable to use budyko decomposition at the interannual timescale 2 2 objective 1 statistical change detection to quantify the effect of fire on streamflows we developed a novel approach for statistical change detection to quantify the effect of fire on streamflows the first step in this method is the translation of annual catchment data into budyko space given annual values of precipitation p streamflow q and potential evapotranspiration pet for a watershed the aet was calculated using the water balance equation aet p q which assumes that the carryover of storage between years is negligible compared to the annual fluxes of aet p and q this assumption has been often used in annual water balance studies milly 1994 sivapalan et al 2011 yang et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 however to minimize the errors introduced by this assumption we aggregated the monthly values of p and q over the hydrological rather than the calendar year as proposed by the u s geological survey usgs and following the approaches by sivapalan et al 2011 and carmona et al 2014 there should be no major fire or other forest disturbance such as harvesting during this time period to avoid confounding effects a fu type budyko curve was then fit using data from the pre fire period to evaluate the ability of the budyko curve to capture interannual variability in water partitioning during the non disturbed period in the supporting information section si 2 2 we discuss the choice of the fu type curves figure si 2 and the robustness to this choice compared to other methods the fu curve fu 1981 is characterized by eq 1 1 ei i 1 ai i 1 ai i ω 1 ω the ω parameter was calibrated using nonlinear least squares regression to pre fire annual data time series of measured evaporative index ei i and measured aridity index ai i from each watershed using the stats and budyko packages in r hampton 2020 r core team 2020 the investr package greenwell and schubert kabban 2014 was used to calculate confidence and prediction intervals from the regression models the parameter ω is then used to create a timeseries of evaporative index ei i c as a function of the aridity index ai i we then used two different approaches to use the modeled ei i c for statistical change detection a budyko deviation approach and a covariate modelling approach 2 2 1 budyko deviation approach in the budyko deviation approach we assumed that in the absence of landscape disturbance like fire catchments move back and forth along a budyko type curve as a function of temporal variations in climate as captured by the aridity index ai our proposed decomposition method is described in fig 1 if a catchment moves from point a ai1 ei1 in the pre disturbance year to point b ai2 ei2 in the post disturbance year then this movement can be described as the sum of a climate component and a landscape disturbance component in the absence of any landscape disturbance the catchment would have moved from point a to point c along the budyko curve this movement describes the climate component of the change in streamflow and it has both a horizontal and a vertical component the effect of the landscape disturbance in the post disturbance year is then captured by the vertical distance between points b and c our change detection method relies on these vertical deviations from the predicted curve we defined our change metric as the annual vertical budyko deviation d i the difference between the modelled ei i c and measured ei i values in each year both pre and post fire 2 d i ei i c ei i the d i is represented in fig 1 as the vertical distance between points b and c we assessed the statistical significance of the changes in the distribution of d i using the nonparametric kolmogorov smirnov k s test the null hypothesis was that the distributions of these deviations were the same in the two equal length n years periods of time before and after the fire our alternative hypothesis was that the deviations were greater post fire the analysis was performed in both burned and unburned catchments to help confirm that the lack of an apparent response can be attributed to climatic differences we argue that the budyko deviation metric accounts for climatic variability and is thus a more robust detector of the effect of fire than more traditional metrics like the change in streamflow q or runoff ratio rr 2 2 2 covariate modelling approach the covariate modelling approach relies on well established statistical change detection methodologies using a climate covariate e g eaton et al 2010 zhang and wei 2012 to do this we modelled the time series of ei i as a function of a climate co variate ei i c as in zhang wei 2012 2014 and an exponentially decaying intervention effect 3 ei i ei i c d i m e x p j k i f j 0 1 i f j 0 0 where m and k are constants i is a counter for years and j counts years post fire exp x is the exponential function e x where when j 0 m e jk m for negative values of j the step function in brackets has a value of 0 removing the negative domain of the exponential function the constant m represents the magnitude of the response in the first post fire year while the decay coefficient k describes the rate of recovery here unlike in eq 1 both pre and post fire years are included in the model calibration the significance of the post fire response was assessed by the significance of the parameters m and k specifically we tested a null hypothesis where the climate co variate ei i c adequately predicts the hydrologic response during both the pre fire and post fire periods and the intervention effect as characterized by m has a statistically insignificant magnitude and an alternative hypothesis where the intervention effect has a statistically significant magnitude this approach was applied to both burned and unburned catchments to confirm whether the m parameter was controlled solely by fire effects models were fit using non linear least squares regression using the stats package in r r core team 2020 the best fit model was determined by minimizing the sum of the squared model residuals we assessed model appropriateness by comparing the model residuals from the pre and post fire time period using 2 sample kolmogorov smirnov k s test with a two directional alternative hypothesis stats package in r r core team 2020 an appropriate model confirmed the null hypothesis that the distributions of residuals were not significantly different p 0 1 in all cases the investr package greenwell and schubert kabban 2014 was used to calculate confidence and prediction intervals from the regression models in the budyko deviation approach we relied on a statistical test of the difference between two unordered populations of n years while in the covariate modelling approach we explicitly considered the ordering of the time series 2 2 3 benchmarking with other change metrics we compared our two approaches to more traditional change metrics as discussed in our review of the literature many studies apply statistical tests directly to the timeseries of q and rr to assess disturbance effects we averaged data for streamflow q runoff ratio rr and budyko deviation d for 10 years pre fire and 10 years post fire we report the difference in these 10 year averages with the capital letter δ e g δ d δ q and δ r r see eqs 4 6 4 δ d 1 n i 1 n d i 1 n j 1 n d j 5 δ q 1 10 i 1 10 q i 1 10 j 1 10 q j 6 δ r r 1 10 i 1 10 rr i 1 10 j 1 10 rr j in eqs 4 6 the subscript i is used for post fire years while the subscript j is used for pre fire years for these same 10 year periods of data we tested whether the two samples pre and post fire were statistically different using a 2 sample k s test with a one directional alternative hypothesis stats package in r r core team 2020 2 3 objective 2 parsing the effect of climate and disturbance from annual streamflows post wildfire based on our results from the first objective we would identify catchments in which fire has had a significant effect the next step of the analysis is to quantify the magnitudes of the streamflow change due to fire and climate in the fire impacted catchments to do this we assume that the budyko type curve models how annual evaporative index and thus streamflow would respond to climate in the absence of any catchment disturbance thus in any year i the climate component of the measured flow q i c can be described as a function of modelled evaporative index ei i c and measured precipitation p i 7 q i c 1 ei i c p i in every year both pre and post fire there is some deviation between observed annual flow q i and the modelled flow q i c we denote this deviation as q i f which represents the effect of landscape disturbances like fire 8 q i f q i c q i ei i c ei i p i which is equivalent to 9 q i f d i p i we then estimate the average change in streamflow due to climate effects δ q c and fire effects as δ q f over two n year time periods before and after fire where i is used for post fire years and j is used for pre fire years as 10 δ q c 1 n i 1 n q i c 1 n j 1 n q j c 11 δ q f 1 n i 1 n q i f 1 n j 1 n q j f such that 12 δ q δ q c δ q f we use the capital letter δ to denote change between time periods we also estimate an annual q change in each post fire year relative to the pre fire average to determine how climate and fire contributed to interannual variability of flow in the post fire series specifically the climate contribution of the flow change in the post fire years δ q i c and the fire contribution of the change δ q i f are estimated as 13 δ q i c q i c 1 n j 1 n q j c 14 δ q i f q i f 1 n j 1 n q j f such that 15 δ q i δ q i c δ q i f where the lowercase letter δ signifies change in reference to a specific year the letter i is used for post fire years and j is used for pre fire years note that the average of the pre fire j is used for pre fire years flow deviations q j f exhibits a similar property as d j such that the values 1 n j 1 n d j and 1 n j 1 n q j f are small but not necessarily zero 2 4 objective 3 quantifying recovery timescales in wildfire impacted catchments finally our last objective is to quantify the recovery timescale in wildfire impacted catchments to do this we use the decay coefficient k that was estimated using the covariate modelling approach in objective 1 we modelled recovery only catchments in which there is a significant fire effect as indicated by a significant m parameter since we use an exponential model to describe decay which means theoretically recovery time is infinity we chose an arbitrary threshold beyond which the effect was insignificant in size we chose a threshold of 90 of the magnitude of m catchment recovery t was defined by inverting the exponential decay coefficient k with units of time 1 and multiplying by a recovery threshold r such that l o g 1 r k provides the 90 recovery time t 90 when r 0 9 the parameter uncertainty of k from the nonlinear regression models were used to calculate the uncertainty on t 90 3 methods 3 1 case study southern california our proposed method is illustrated in a case study located in the forested areas of southern california surrounding the san bernardino area fig 2a b this region stood out as having a high concentration of usgs gaging stations and fires in particular water year wy 2004 had a record number of fires blackwell and tuttle 2003 this large number of fires offers the opportunity to study multiple affected catchments under the same sequence of climate and disturbance conditions criteria for selecting burned catchments were based off those of rust et al 2018 and saxe et al 2018 and are described in the supporting information section si 1 1 we began with 112 candidate catchments and selected for those dominated by forested or vegetated cover minimal urban land cover and with adequate periods of record including no large fires during the period of record except for wy 2004 as much of this region is under the management of the usfs we also confirmed that no harvesting activity took place in these catchments during the period of record u s forest service 2018 this led us to select 7 burned catchments and 10 unburned catchments to analyze table si 1 two of the catchments in our study devil canyon creek b1 and city creek b2 have both been studied with respect to streamflow effects after the 2004 water year fires bart 2016 bart and tague 2017 kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 the mountains of southern california are a diverse geologic and hydroclimatic mosaic soils are generally thin and easily erodible wells 1981 and are underlain by heavily faulted assemblages of igneous and metamorphic rocks morton and miller 2006 a strong orographic effect results in wet windward slopes and dry leeward slopes dropping to the deserts to the east this gradient results in a chaparral dominated ecosystem giving way to mixed conifer forest along mountain crests and piñon juniper woodlands in drier climates fig 2c barbour et al 2007 the fire recurrence period for this ecosystem is around 30 40 years keeley and fotheringham 2001 the burned and unburned catchments ranged in size from 1 400 ha to 48 000 ha all have 50 vegetated cover shrub and forest fig 2d and are generally steep 20 40 for the 7 burned catchments burned area ratio bar at a moderate or high severity ranged from 12 to 71 fig 2e the climate is mediterranean with regional rainfall is on average 720 400 mm yr 1 and potential evaporation is 1280 90 mm yr 1 table si 2 3 2 data sources and calculations streamflow q from usgs and climatic data prism climate group 2018 including precipitation p and temperature t were used to calculate the wy hydrologic budget for our catchments we analyzed data from water years 1982 beginning of prism availability to 2018 data from wy 1982 to 2003 were used to calibrate fu type budyko curves and data from wy 2004 to 2018 were used to calculate the post fire time series of d i data sources are in table si 3 methods for data retrieval are detailed in the supporting information section si 1 2 all data and code are provided in an online repository hampton 2021 pet was calculated using the hargreaves samani equation hargreaves samani 1985 see calculations in section si 1 3 there are two groups of methods available for estimating pet temperature based methods e g thornthwaite hamon and hargreaves samani and radiation based methods e g turc makkink and priestley taylor we did not have access to radiation data at our sites and thus used the temperature based hargreaves samani equation to ensure that this didn t bring bias into our results we analyzed the choice of our pet calculation method by assessing agreement between six pet methods as in lu et al 2005 see section si 2 1 and figures si 2 3 overall we found no effect of using a temperature versus radiation based pet formula in detecting budyko deviations figures si 4 5 following retrieval of annual climate and hydrologic data a single parameter version of the budyko curve by fu 1981 and the ω parameter was fit using nonlinear least squares regression to pre fire annual data from each watershed using the nls and budyko packages in r hampton 2020 r core team 2020 each of the 17 watersheds in our study was fit to a different fu type budyko curve that is a function of the physical properties of the specific watershed such as soil properties and vegetation type and coverage e g milly 1994 zhang et al 2001 2008 all available pre fire data wy 1982 2003 were used in the curve fitting process from the fu fit curves for each watershed the budyko deviations d i were then calculated for each year after fire following eq 2 annual flow was decomposed into a climate prediction eq 7 and fire deviation eqs 8 9 and total effect sizes were calculated following eqs 10 12 and 4 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 statistical change detection using the budyko framework we found that all 17 catchments in our study adhered reasonably well to their respective fu type budyko curves in the pre fire period 1982 2003 with mean absolute error of the budyko fits generally 0 1 units of ei table si 2 and the fu ω values ranging from 2 0 to 10 in an analysis of 1000 catchments across the u s rice and emanuel 2019 concluded that catchments with large inter annual changes in storage deviate below the original budyko curve see supporting information section si 1 4 figure si 1 thus the strong adherence of our data to the budyko curves in the pre fire years suggests that the assumption of hydrologic steady state at the annual timescale is appropriate in these catchments furthermore rice and emanuel argued that catchments with higher fu ω values that were closer to the ω of approximately 2 8 for the idealized budyko curve deviate the least from hydrologic steady state at the inter annual time scale given that our ω values median ω 2 6 table si 2 were at the higher end of the range of values explored by rice and emanuel it is thus reasonable to also assume steady state in our analysis while the pre fire year ei data strongly conformed to the budyko curve strong vertical deviations were apparent in the postfire years in the burned catchments but not in the unburned catchments fig 3 the deviations in the burned catchments fell below the fu type curves for several years after fire indicating an increase in streamflow possibly due to loss of vegetation and alteration of the surface soils during the fire we also see that for the two least burned catchments b6 and b7 there is very little deviation in budyko space these were the burned catchments with a burned area ratio bar of 20 while the other burned catchments had bar ranging from 45 to 97 fig 2e these results suggest that the budyko framework was able to qualitatively distinguish between burned and unburned catchments using the budyko deviation approach section 2 1 1 we found statistically significant change in budyko deviation fig 4 a for five of the highly burned catchments b1 b5 bar 40 while catchments b6 and b7 bar 25 experienced insignificant deviations the magnitude of the budyko deviations δ d ranged from 0 07 for catchment b3 to 0 16 for catchment b1 average value 0 12 in contrast for the unburned catchments there were no significant deviations in budyko space and the magnitude of δ d was much smaller fig 4a the significantly larger δ d values in the burned catchments compared to the unburned catchments highlights the ability of this approach to detect the effect of fire using the covariate modelling approach section 2 1 2 we modelled the ei time series using the climate co variate and the intervention effect which was characterized by the parameters m and k controlling the fire effect size and recovery time respectively we found that the m parameter was significant at the 10 confidence level for catchments b1 b5 the magnitude of m was also much higher in the five most highly burned catchments b1 b5 average 0 21 compared to the two least burned b6 b7 average 0 02 and unburned catchments average 0 01 fig 4b indeed where m was small it was also not significantly different from zero in the two less burned and unburned catchments an increase in the magnitude and significance of the m parameter in the five highly burned catchments highlights the effectiveness of the budyko framework in statistical change detection post fire having confirmed our hypothesis using two approaches significance of δ d and m we sought to test whether more traditional approaches of change detection could parse the same effects 4 2 method comparison to traditional approaches as stated above the much preferred baci approach is difficult to apply in wildfire impacted catchments due the unpredictability of large fires still many studies have used the wealth of data in the u s to analyze pre and post fire streamflow data to assess changes in q and rr blount et al 2019 hallema et al 2018b 2017a kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 saxe et al 2018 we observed similar magnitudes of average streamflow changes δ q between the burned and unburned sites ranging from 38 to 98 60 to 100 mm yr 1 in the burned catchments and ranging from 92 to 120 100 to 60 mm yr 1 in the unburned catchments fig 4c furthermore none of the changes in either the burned or unburned catchments were statistically significant p value 0 10 fig 4c this highlights that the flow changes observed were most likely driven by climatic changes in the post fire years and that metrics like the mean streamflow change is not always adequate to isolate the effects of fire driven due to climatic variability indeed annual p was lower in the 10 years after wy 2004 corresponding to increased aridity for many of the catchments figure si 7 this reduced p resulted in lower streamflow that confounded our ability to detect fire driven increases in streamflow from climate driven decrease indeed the climate and the streamflow are so variable between years in this ecozone that detection of any significant change is difficult thus any change attribution method relying on the detection of a significant q change point will conclude incorrectly that fire had no effect in these catchments possibly the most common metric that has been used for detecting changes following wildfire or any other disturbance is the runoff ratio rr e g biederman et al 2015 bladon et al 2019 blount et al 2019 kinoshita hogue 2015 we found the differences in rr to be somewhat more sensitive for comparison between the pre and post fire periods rr for devil canyon creek b1 usgs gage 11063680 experienced a significant increase at the 1 confidence level while catchments b2 and b3 experienced a significant increase at the 5 level fig 4d notably in their study of catchment b1 kinoshita hogue 2015 observed increases of rr of similar magnitudes as ours for devil canyon creek according to our calculations all other changes in rr in burned and unburned catchments were statistically insignificant except for a small increase of 0 02 units for catchment ub3 p 0 08 thus only three of the seven burned catchments show a statistically significant increase in the distribution of runoff ratios between the pre fire and the post fire periods while almost all of the unburned catchments showed no statistically significant difference this highlights the challenges in detecting significant changes in this ecozone with high climate variability the distribution of streamflow values showed no significant differences between pre and post fire periods while the runoff ratio was only able to detect change in three of the most burned catchments in contrast the budyko metrics δ d and m increased significantly i e decreased ei attributed to disturbance for the 5 most highly burned sites thus in moving from a series of annual discharge data and runoff ratio to budyko deviation we increased thedetectability of the disturbance effect in the hydrologic time series 4 3 quantifying the contribution of fire and climate to streamflow change next we used the budyko decomposition method to isolate the contributions of fire and climate to the annual q time series we focused on catchments b1 b5 since no significant changes were observed in b6 and b7 we used the movement of points along the budyko type curves as the climate component eq 7 and the vertical budyko deviations captured by the d values as the fire component eqs 8 9 across catchments b1 b5 fire resulted in average increases in flow δ q f ranging from 43 to 111 mm yr 1 fig 5 a in catchments b1 b4 the post fire years were drier than the pre fire years p decrease ranged from 35 to 110 mm yr 1 figure si 7 and thus climate contributed to a decrease in flow in the post fire years with δ q c ranging from 6 to 30 mm yr 1 fig 5a the larger values of δ q f compared to δ q c translated to net flow increases δ q from 30 to 80 mm yr 1 across catchments b1 b4 fig 5a in contrast in catchment b5 mean rainfall was not significantly different between pre and post fire years and thus both climate and fire led to increases in flow fig 5a it is important to note that the contribution of fire to streamflow is estimated as the difference between the vertical budyko deviations between the pre fire and the post fire years and thus the analysis implicitly considers climate and other factors that contribute to deviations in the absence of fire the contributions of fire and climate to streamflows varied between wet and dry years fig 5b in wetter years wy 2005 2 years after fire climate controlled most of the change in flow this is possibly because in these very wet years the rain events were so large that soil saturation and overland flow overwhelmed the effect of the reduced evapo transpiration rates due to vegetation mortality coombs melack 2013 studied the same region as this study and found that in wy 2005 annual runoff was not dissimilar between burned and unburned catchments in the two wettest years wy 2005 and wy 2011 climate amplified the effect of fire i e both fire and climate effects were positive for most of the catchments in contrast for the drier years wy 2004 wy 2006 2010 wy 2012 2016 we found the effects of climate and fire to be of similar magnitude with climate often counteracting the effects of fire fig 5b in these years the net change in flow is often negative dark black bars and thus not accounting for climate makes it appear that fire has led to a decrease in flow herein lies the strength of our method that decouples the climate from the fire signal and allows us to understand how these two components amplify or counteract each other in wet and dry years of course while the differences between the wet and dry years are apparent from the results there are further nuances in the year to year relative contributions of fire and climate across the five catchments these differences are affected by local scale factors such as rainfall seasonality adjacency of the fire to the stream e g bart 2016 bart and tague 2017 subsurface geology etc that is beyond the scope of current work in the next section we explore whether we can quantitatively evaluate the recovery of this hydrologic disturbance effect to pre fire conditions 4 4 quantifying hydrologic recovery timescales the annual data from the 5 most burned catchments show significant deviation from pre fire conditions fig 4 fig 3 shows that for many of the burned catchments annual points appear to gravitate back to the pre fire budyko curve after several years of strong deviations fig 6 a shows the time series of d for the five most burned catchments and the modelled values of d using eq 3 this decaying effect is apparent in the models for catchments b1 b2 and b4 b5 with varying recovery times back to pre fire conditions catchment b3 did not experience a strong recovery pattern like the others fig 3 fig 6a and indeed had the lowest δ d effect size 0 07 fig 4a of the burned catchments with bar 40 the decay coefficients for the b1 b2 and b4 b5 models were transformed into recovery times as described in section 2 3 t 90 log 0 1 k we estimated 90 recovery times as 43 years confidence interval 23 298 years for catchment b1 15 10 27 years for b2 9 6 5 1 85 years for b4 and 3 8 2 3 9 9 years for b5 fig 6b we estimated 90 recovery times as 43 years confidence 23 298 years for catchment b1 15 10 27 years for b2 9 6 5 1 85 years for b4 and 3 8 2 3 9 9 years for b5 fig 6b bart and tague 2017 used remotely sensed vegetation data to estimate vegetation recovery in catchment b2 and found a 90 recovery timescale of 8 8 years which is slightly lower than our estimate of 15 years it is important to remember however that vegetation recovery and hydrologic recovery can occur on very different timescales note also that b1 has the longest recovery time and the greatest uncertainty in its estimate given that we have only 15 years of data in contrast recovery time estimates for catchments b4 and b5 are more compatible with the timescales of analysis and thus uncertainties are lower while this is a promising approach to estimate recovery times across large scales with varying availability and quality of data future work needs to focus on validating these estimates with longer timeseries of flow and vegetation data analysis of hydrologic recovery times in post fire landscapes is often limited by availability of long enough flow time series after fire this leaves considerable uncertainty of how long it can take for streamflow to recover after fire our longer recovery times are however not inconsistent with other studies using longer timeseries in the same region a study using 66 years of streamflow data from the san dimas experimental forest in california found that the effects of fire on streamflows can last as many as 20 years meixner and wohlgemuth 2003 similarly a recent study in the pacific northwest found no evidence of hydrologic recovery 35 years after fire niemeyer et al 2020 in a recent review of hydrologic recovery after fire in mediterranean climates wagenbrenner et al 2021 found that among 38 burned study 42 of sites recovered within 5 years after fire while 5 of the sites had recovery times between 5 and 10 years in contrast 53 of the sites did not recover during the monitoring period of 4 10 years making it difficult to estimate recovery times appropriately in an analysis including catchment b2 from our study bart and tague 2017 showed that the impact of fire on stream baseflow recession rates and the recovery of this metric post fire were correlated with the impact on and recovery of vegetation in the stream riparian zone these authors found that modelled post fire vegetation recovery with a 90 recovery timescale of 8 8 years adequately predicted recovery of baseflow recession rates recovery timescales appear to be a function of type intensity and distribution of disturbance as well as climatic factors and these factors have not been significantly explored across systems 4 5 correlation of effect sizes and burn severity for the 7 burned sites we investigated whether bar correlated with the average budyko deviation for the 10 years post fire δ d this relationship relatively weak for b1 b7 p 0 07 r2 0 41 and appeared to have no strength among the 5 burned catchments with significant changes in δ d b1 b5 p 0 56 this lack of correlation is similarly found in the results of saxe et al 2018 and hallema et al 2018b who also found little to no correlation between bar and percent changes in flow we did however see a threshold pattern where sites burned with 40 area showed significant budyko deviations b1 b5 further in contrast to the lack of a relationship between bar and effect size we found a strong linear relationship between the recovery timescale and the percent of the watershed burned at moderate and high severity fig 6b p 0 03 this recovery and burn relationship corresponded to a slope of about 4 1 years of recovery per 10 burned note in fig 6b that there is uncertainty around the individual estimates of k and the corresponding recovery times t 90 and there is large uncertainty around the linear regression itself the longer recovery times of the watershed areas with greater bar at moderate and high severity most likely arises due to the persistence of detectable effects in the streamflow signal that increases with increasing disturbed area this pattern should be tested with larger populations of disturbed forested catchments further study should explore whether this hydrologic recovery is correlated to ground or satellite based measurements of vegetation recovery or soil infiltration rates 4 6 limitations and future work evaluation of the effect of a disturbance like wildfire on hydrologic response is complex because of the significant year to year variability in flow which makes the analysis extremely sensitive to the number of years of post fire data that is available our analysis was based on a 16 year time series of post fire data and even though time series like budyko deviation d have less variability than q ai or ei our statistical tests could still be influenced by the exact choice of years of data available our analysis would be increasingly robust to these climatic variations with increased data availability but for this region of southern california the high incidences of fire meant that we could isolate only a small timeframe that had only one fire in all the study catchments our estimate of hydrologic recovery timescale is limited by the small timeframe of postfire data and the significant budyko deviations over this time period future work could examine how these budyko deviations dissipate over time and whether catchments do indeed return to their pre fire budyko curve consistently capturing this effect statistically and correlating recovery with satellite products for vegetation indices and soil moisture would add more certainty to such findings since we did not have access to site measured data including p and radiation we instead relied on large 4 kilometer gridded spatial data for p and temperature to satisfy the requirements for the budyko limiting our ability to capture gradients in climate variables over elevation and with respect to windward and leeward slopes further access only to temperature data limited us in our choice of pet calculation methods nonetheless we performed a comparative analysis in nearby data rich catchments on whether using a temperature versus radiation based pet methods would affect the results of our budyko analysis and found no significant difference between the two method groups section si 2 1 however future estimates could be refined with access to radiation data additionally we rely on the assumption of hydrologic steady state at the annual time scale however as we have argued in section 2 of this paper given that recent studies have provided evidence of the budyko curve being applicable at the interannual timescale this is a reasonable assumption furthermore we find that our catchments have high fu ω values and the budyko curve can capture the interannual variability in data reasonably well across a decadal timescale proving as per by rice and emanuel 2019 that interannual changes in storage is not significant of course there are significant changes that occur both to the vegetation and the soil properties in the post fire period that might bring into question the validity of the budyko assumption however our finding of the distinctly different responses in the budyko space between the burned and unburned catchments highlights that the budyko framework might still be adequate for use in change detection indeed the budyko deviation approach has also been used for change detection in other scenarios involving land use transition for example conversion of prairies to cropland wang and hejazi 2011 ye et al 2012 that said the thin soils and heavily faulted basement rocks in this area of california may facilitate changes in interactions with deep groundwater following fire as discussed for devil canyon creek catchment b1 by jung et al 2009 in the future we could use improved satellite derived et products e g poon kinoshita 2018 to specifically estimate any changes in storage as p minus q minus aet all this highlights the need for continued intensive field studies of altered moisture fluxes and water storage at the landscape scale after fire we used satellite derived fire severity products mtbs eidenshink et al 2007 to quantify barin each watershed following the approaches of two recent large studies in the western u s hallema et al 2018b saxe et al 2018 however these products have limitations in identifying differences in burn severity between sites differing in pre fire forest composition and structure harvey et al 2019 kolden et al 2015 future work would involve the use of more sophisticated satellite products for this purpose it is also important to note that the relationship identified between the burn severity and hydrologic recovery is specific to the five catchments analyzed in the study future work would involve expanding the analysis across larger geographic scales similar to the work of hallema et al 2018b and saxe et al 2018 to quantify the relative contributions of fire and climate to streamflow we also acknowledge that many other on the ground factors could influence the relationship between fire and hydrologic change including fire severity fire proximity to the riparian area and catchment topography elevation and geology e g feikema et al 2013 rust et al 2019b again we stress the need for continued study at the local scale on how we can better characterize high or low severity as an ecohydrological effect additionally incorporation of other datasets such as vegetation indices e g paci et al 2017 may help characterize disturbance magnitudes and recovery timescales 5 conclusions in this study we developed a novel methodology based on the budyko framework to quantify the relative contributions of climate and fire disturbance on annual streamflow time series and we used this information to characterize hydrologic recovery timescales this study moves us towards addressing some of the unsolved problems in hydrology summarized by blöschl et al 2019 what are the impacts of land cover change and soil disturbances on water and energy fluxes at the land surface and what causes spatial heterogeneity and homogeneity in runoff evaporation subsurface water and material fluxes and their sensitivity to their controls e g aridity our results add to a growing number of studies documenting flow increases following wildfire importantly we have added to a subset of studies that differentiate between climate related flow changes and those attributed to forest disturbance with the novel aspect of using the budyko framework at the annual timescale and explicitly quantifying the hydrologic recovery time in a study region like ours where annual p and ai were highly variable due in large part to the el niño southern oscillation schonher and nicholson 1989 previous methods of comparing either annual streamflow or runoff ratio between pre and post fire years can be confounded by climate variability we argue that while traditional metrics like changes in the mean annual flow and the annual runoff ratio were not statistically different between pre fire and post fire years fig 4c d the effect of fire following water year 2004 manifested as statistically significant differences in the budyko deviations in five of the most severely burned catchments fig 4a b importantly budyko deviations were not statistically different for the unburned catchments between pre and post fire years lending credence to the hypothesis that it was the fire in the burned catchments that led to the observed deviations the budyko decomposition method expanded upon in this study allows us to collapse climate variability and explicitly isolate the effect of fire analyzing 20 years of pre and post fire data we showed that fire on the average increased flow by 80 mm yr 1 that was counterbalanced by a general drying over this time period and 10 20 mm yr 1 flow decrease due to climate alone we then modelled the time series of ei and estimated hydrologic recovery timescales which ranged between 3 and 43 years in the study catchments although other studies have quantified effects of fires on streamflow these have primarily focused on average effects for 10 to 20 year time blocks between pre and post fire years here we explicitly captured recovery timescales at an annual resolution we showed persistence of budyko deviations d out to past ten years post fire fig 6a and hydrologic recovery captured by the deviation series that correlated significantly with catchment burned area fig 6b we found that for every 10 burned at moderate and high severity hydrologic recovery was pushed back approximately 4 years p 0 03 thus we showed that the budyko framework can be used to decouple fire versus climate effects on streamflow patterns after wildfire and to effectively quantify hydrologic recovery timescales our finding of increased flow after wildfires similar to the results of previous studies in the chaparral ecosystems of southern california kinoshita and hogue 2015 2011 loáiciga et al 2001 meixner and wohlgemuth 2003 has significant impact with respect to water supplies this could mean more water available to parched areas of the world especially california as noted by meixner wohlgemuth 2003 however as has been shown in numerous studies flow increases are often accompanied by changing hydrologic signatures e g flashiness flood frequency resulting in increased erosion suspended sediments burke et al 2013 as well as increased nutrient loads smith et al 2012 all these threaten water security martin 2016 almost certainly more than increased water supply might alleviate stress further increased flows are generally transient and likely rob down wind areas of precipitation from local evapotranspiration kirchner et al 2020 this is the first presentation of results demonstrating that the hydrologic effects and recovery from wildfire can be captured using the budyko decomposition method wang hejazi 2011 deforestation studies involving forest harvesting far outnumber wildfire studies despite the hazards involved with fire this use of open datasets to conduct this analysis could be leveraged to greatly enhance our understanding of the variety of hydrologic effects of forest disturbance including both harvesting and fire and can be applied across arid to humid regions to differentiate climate forcings from disturbance related changes in annual streamflow given the wealth of streamflow data available in the contiguous united states falcone 2011 falcone et al 2010 there are countless opportunities to go backwards and reanalyze datasets with respect to nearby and relevant streamflow datasets coincident with changes in land cover including wildfire forest harvesting

3527,a major step in designing a subsurface drainage system is calculation of drainpipe spacing nearly all unsteady state drainpipe spacing equations use ratio of hydraulic conductivity k s to drainable porosity f in the form of κ k s f this work developed a novel inverse model based on bees algorithm to estimate the κ we examined the efficiency of the developed inverse model to appraise the κ using the existing data sets at laboratory and field scales for each data set we compared the performance of the developed inverse model with those of a dimensionless curve generated by the authors generalized dimensionless curve skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve being proportional to the data set skaggs s dimensionless curve a drainpipe discharge method and a direct method the results showed that the best statistical indicator values were achieved for each data set when the drainage equations utilized the κ deduced from the developed inverse model all the studied techniques performed the worst for skaggs et al s 1973 data at 57 5 hrs after drainage start for this data set the studied techniques were respectively ranked as the developed inverse model skaggs s dimensionless curve the generalized dimensionless curve and the direct method even in this worst case the global performance index was improved almost 93 when the drainage equation utilized the κ appraised by the developed inverse model instead of that appraised by skaggs s dimensionless curve the overall performance comparison of the three inverse techniques evaluated in this study revealed that the root mean square error and coefficient of determination related to the developed inverse model are the best ones followed by those related to skaggs s dimensionless curve and the developed inverse model respectively in summary the results revealed that compared to the other studied techniques the developed inverse model is the most efficient technique to estimate the κ which is promising for practical purposes at the laboratory and field scales keywords bees algorithm dimensionless curve direct method drainage discharge method inverse model 1 introduction an accurate calculation of a drainpipe spacing is quite critical to properly design a drainage system in reality the water flow towards the drainpipes is typically unsteady ritzema 1994 and consequently unsteady state equations are preferred to calculate the drainpipe spacing most if not all the unsteady state equations e g dumm 1964 kumar et al 1994 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 singh et al 2006 use saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and drainable porosity f in the form of k s f ratio which is hereafter denoted by κ the k s and f values can be determined directly in situ or in laboratory amoozegar and wilson 1999 morbidelli et al 2017 amoozegar 2020 moshayedi et al 2020 however the k s and f values obtained from the direct measurements are spatially variable soulis et al 2020 these variations are often so wide that assigning representative values to the k s and f for calculating drainpipe spacing is quite difficult sepaskhah and ataee 2004 in practice a large number of samples may be required to account for this spatial variability and to obtain reliable values of k s and f furthermore these direct measurements are costly time consuming relatively cumbersome labor intensive and impractical for large scale applications sepaskhah and ataee 2004 zhang and schaap 2019 this difficulty can be overcome by using the so called indirect methods pedo transfer functions ptfs zhang and schaap 2019 are one of the indirect methods to estimate the soil hydraulic properties from easily available soil data including the texture structure bulk density organic matter etc the main disadvantage of the ptfs is that their application is often restricted to a specific condition under which they have been developed vogeler et al 2019 inverse modeling method imm is an alternative indirect approach to obtain soil hydraulic parameters shps by back matching the observed data with simulation results minasny and mcbratney 2002 the previous studies have demonstrated that the imm can be applied as promising approach to obtain the shps e g kumar et al 1994 ritter et al 2003 samani et al 2007 mahbod and zand parsa 2010 mehdinejadiani et al 2013 sedaghatdoost et al 2018 and 2019 vogeler et al 2019 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 the imms typically use an optimization algorithm to find optimal values of parameters this is due to the fact that a manual calibration by trial and error is quite difficult especially in simultaneous estimation of several parameters ritter et al 2003 there are several classifications of the optimization algorithms in literature for example singh et al 2021 classified the optimization algorithms into deterministic local search and stochastic global search and korani and mouhoub 2021 categorized them into exact and approximate recent studies e g li et al 2018 sedaghatdoost et al 2018 sedaghatdoost et al 2019 sihag et al 2019 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 maroufi and mehdinejadiani 2021 recommend the metaheuristic algorithms as a subclass of approximate stochastic global search algorithms to develop the inverse models the metaheuristic algorithms are free from some disadvantages such as differentiability of objective function with respect to model parameters high dependency of algorithm convergence on initial guess of solution vector and high probability of sticking in local optima maroufi and mehdinejadiani 2021 nowadays researchers usually construct the inverse models based on population based metaheuristic algorithms these algorithms either mimic evolutionary process or imitate social behaviors of human animals and insects the first group is called evolutionary algorithms eas while the second one is called swarm intelligence algorithms sias elshaer and awad 2020 there is a large body of literature on the application of the metaheuristic algorithms to find the soil hydraulic properties for example abbaspour et al 2001 successfully applied ant colony optimization aco to inversely estimate the unsaturated shps mahbod and zand parsa 2010 developed eshpim2 model to inversely obtain the shps using genetic algorithm ga in field conditions they found that although the model was generally favorable to estimate the parameters it underestimated the k s zhang et al 2010 formulated a well performed inverse model using a micro ga for estimating the soil hydraulic properties azizpour et al 2012 fitted the glover dumm equation to the measured water table data at laboratory using an inverse model applying the ga which performed well in simultaneous estimation of optimal k s and f values an imm with the ga was presented by sedaghatdoost et al 2018 for appraising the shps in two subsurface drainage systems this imm estimated well the shps by minimizing the objective function which was based on the discrepancies between measured and simulated values of drainage discharge water table depth and drainage water salinity in another study sedaghatdoost et al 2019 compared the performances of the ga and pest optimization tool in identifying the most influential shps they found that the imm based on the ga outperformed that based on the pest sonkar et al 2018 developed an imm by coupling the ga with the numerical solution of richards equation to estimate the shps they evaluated the possibility to estimate the shps from the inverse procedure using synthetic soil moisture depletion data they concluded that the separately estimation of the shps is necessary prior to the estimation of the root water parameter mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 applied the imm to appraise the κ in analytical drainage equations they used particle swarm optimization pso as the optimization method in the imm according their findings the mentioned imm was capable of well estimating the κ bees algorithm ba is a sia which was introduced by pham et al 2006 the ba mimics the foraging behavior of the honey bees in nature to solve an optimization problem for details on this behavior the interested reader is refereed to pham et al 2006 and references therein pham and castellani 2009 and pham and castellani 2014 evaluated the performance of the ba on continuous function minimization benchmarks and they compared the results obtained by the ba with the results given by the ea pso and artificial bee colony abc the results of these studies indicated the strength of the ba in terms of accuracy learning speed and robustness in another research pham and castellani 2015 tested the ba on 18 custom made function minimization benchmarks and on four real world minimization tasks the results obtained on the benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the ba and the results obtained on the real world tasks confirmed the ability of the ba to solve complex real world optimization tasks the ba has been recently used for various soil and water optimization problems for example mehdinejadiani et al 2013 applied the ba as the optimization algorithm in an inverse model to estimate hydraulic dispersion coefficients kesin et al 2015 used the ba successfully in training artificial neural networks anns to develop a model which forecasted the water discharging from different types of rocks and predicted the water pollution sources a comparative study demonstrated that the imm based on the ba estimated transport parameters of spatial fractional advection dispersion equation much more accurately than the imm based on the ga mehdinejadiani 2017 bui et al 2018 presented three new hybrid artificial intelligence optimization models namely adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with cultural anfis ca bees anfis ba and invasive weed optimization anfis iwo algorithms for flood susceptibility mapping fsm in the haraz watershed iran they found that anfis ba had a better prediction capability followed by anfis iwo and anfis ca respectively a spatial modeling approach based on an anfis and several metaheuristic optimizations ba ga pso and imperialistic competitive algorithm ica was developed by rahmati et al 2020 to predict the spatial occurrence of drought in a region in southeastern queensland australia the results of this research indicated that the combination of the anfis and ba yielded the most accurate prediction of the drought to the authors best knowledge except the work conducted by mehdinejadiani et al 2013 to inversely estimate the hydraulic dispersion coefficients using the ba there is no another work on the deep evaluation of the ba efficiency to appraise the shps therefore we conducted this study with the following purposes 1 to develop an inverse model using the ba technique for estimating the κ 2 to compare the performance of the ba with those of other methods at laboratory and field scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of flow model boussinesq equation be is a partial differential equation governing the unsteady flow of water towards drainpipes kumar et al 1994 the linearized one dimensional be for a horizontal impervious layer in a homogeneous soil profile can be written as follows uziak and chieng 1989 1a h x t t κ d 2 h x t x 2 where x is the space variable l t is the time variable t h x t is the water table height above the drain level l κ is equal to k s f k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 f is the drainable porosity dimensionless and d is the average thickness of the water transmitting layer l which is calculated as follows uziak and chieng 1989 1b d h 0 2 d e where h 0 is the initial water table height above the drain level at the midpoint between the drainpipes l see fig 1 and d e is the hooghoudt s equivalent depth l note that in this study we calculated the d e value using eq 5a in mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 the linearized be has been analytically and numerically solved for the boundary and initial conditions corresponded to the water flow towards the drainpipes e g dumm 1964 kumar et al 1994 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 singh et al 2006 azizpour et al 2012 the previous studies e g singh et al 2006 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 have demonstrated that the analytical equation considering an elliptical water table profile as the initial condition is a promising drainage equation to simulate the unsteady flow of water towards drainpipes uziak and chieng 1989 derived the analytical equation for the elliptical initial water table profile as follows 2a h x t 4 h 0 1 e 1 h 0 d 2 n 1 3 5 1 n π 1 4 1 h 0 d 4 n π 2 n π 2 1 n 1 2 1 h 0 d 2 e 1 h 0 d 2 e α n 2 t s i n n π l x where d is the depth to the impervious layer below the drainpipes see fig 1 l is the drainpipe spacing l α κ π 2 d l 2 and the other variables are defined as before the water table height above the

2 e α n 2 t s i n n π 2 regarding to the available data we used eqs 2a or 2b to simulate the water table height above the drain level 2 2 estimation of κ in this paper we first appraised the κ using an inverse model based on the ba then we compared the results of the inverse model with those of a dimensionless curve generated by the authors gdc skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve being proportional to the data set skaggs s dc a drainpipe discharge method and a direct method these methods are detailed in the next subsections 2 2 1 development of inverse model in this subsection we describe the developed inverse model dim to estimate the κ the dim appraised the optimal κ value by minimizing an objective function the previous studies e g huang et al 2006 martinez et al 2010 typically used the root mean square error rmse as the objective function however mentaschi et al 2013 clearly showed that lower values of the rmse do not always imply the more accuracy of a mathematical model therefore one can conclude that the application of the rmse as the objective function in an inverse model does not always lead to find the global optimal parameters of the mathematical model to overcome this problem hanna and heinold 1985 proposed a statistical indicator as follows 3 hh i 1 n h i sim h i obs 2 i 1 n h i sim h i obs where h i sim and h i obs are the simulated and measured water table heights above the drain level at i th point respectively and n is the number of measurement points the use of hh allows to correctly interpret the performances of the mathematical model as a result one can infer that the application of the hh as the objective function in the inverse model can lead to find more accurate values of parameters of the mathematical model accordingtotheaforementioneddiscussion we used hh eq 3 as the objective function in the dim in this study the dim applied the ba to minimize the hh the ba initializes the optimization process by generating n pop random solutions uniformly distributed in search space each random solution κ i is generated using the following equation moradi et al 2011 4a κ i κ min r i κ max κ min where κ min and κ max are the minimum and maximum values of the solution respectively and r i is a random number in the range of 0 1 we considered the κ min and κ max values with respect to the minimum and maximum values of k s and f in different soil textures to this end we used the constraints of the k s and f presented by foodandagricultureorganizationof the united nations in 1980 fao 1980 table 1 shows the constraints of the k s and f and consequently the constraints of the κ which was used in the dim the algorithm evaluates the random solutions by calculating the hh it is clear that the lower the hh value the better the solution the ba selects the top n best solutions among of n pop random solutions as the best ones and chooses the first n elite solutions among of the best n best solutions as elite ones the ba performs a local search by dispatching n ep and n sp new solutions in the neighborhood of the elite and the other selected solutions respectively where n sp n ep note that the ba generates a new solution κ i in the neighborhood of a selected solution κ i as follows moradi et al 2011 4b κ i κ i n g h 2 r i n g h where ngh is the size of the local search neighborhood radius calculated as follows pham and castellani 2009 4c ngh κ max κ min the size of the ngh is kept constant as long as the local search leads to better new solutions in case thelocalsearchfailstoimprovethecurrent solution the size of the ngh is shrunk in this study we updated the size of the ngh as follows 4d ngh n 1 0 9 ngh n where n denotes the n th iteration of the ba main loop at the end of the local search the algorithm selects the fittest solution at each neighborhood after the local search the ba randomly generates n pop n best new solutions to perform a new global search in the next iteration then the algorithm continues the optimization process with the n pop n best generated new solutions and the n best selected ones from the local search in the n 1 th iteration this process continues until the stopping criterion is met fig 2 gives the flowchart of the ba in this study we considered the maximum number of iteration n max i t e r as the stopping criterion similar to the previous studies e g moradi et al 2011 mehdinejadiani 2017 some trials were made to properly set the control parameters of the ba we achieved this by manipulating the n pop n best n elite n ep n sp and n max i t e r table 2 lists the final parameters of the ba 2 2 2 construction of dimensionless curve the dimensionless curve technique is a simple inverse method applied to appraise the shps skaggs 1976 and kumar et al 1994 presented a series of dimensionless curves to estimate the κ and κ d respectively in this study we generated dimensionless curves hereafter called gdc by neglecting the terms related to n 1 in eq 2b in this case eq 2b can be simplified as follows 5a h l 2 t 4 h 0 1 e 1 h 0 d 2 1 π 1 4 1 h 0 d 4 π 2 π 2 1 h 0 d 2 e 1 h 0 d 2 e α t in order to create a dimensionless curve corresponding to a certain h 0 d value we calculated α t by considering various h l 2 t h 0 values in the range of 0 1 after generating the desirable dimensionless curve we first obtained the α t value at each time and then we computed the κ value at that time using the following formula 5b κ t t i α l 2 d π 2 t i for a comprehensive comparison in addition to the dimensionless curves constructed in this study we appraised the κ value using the dimensionless curves generated by skaggs 1976 he used a numerical solution based on a flat initial water table profile to construct a series of dimensionless curves fig 3 shows the dimensionless curves presented by skaggs 1976 note that the d d h 0 d in these curves for brevity we called the skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve as skaggs s dc in this study 2 2 3 drainpipe discharge method in this method the κ is estimated using drainpipe discharge per unit surface area to this end we used the following formula vlotman et al 2004 6 κ t t i 2 3 l 2 π 2 d l o g q t i 1 q t i where q t i is the drainpipe discharge per unit surface area at time t i 2 2 4 direct method there exist several laboratory and field methods to directly determine the k s including constant head method falling head method below water table methods and above water table methods ritzema 1994 also the f is determined by measuring the volume fraction of the pore space water drained from a soil sample taylor 1960 in this study we evaluated the κ values obtained from the dims by comparing them with those obtained from the direct measurements of the k s and f if available in literature 2 3 experimental data the practical efficiency of the aforementioned methods for estimating the κ was examined using water table data at laboratory and field scales at the laboratory scale the experimental data reported by mehdinejadiani et al 2013 and fathi 2005 were used mehdinejadiani et al 2013 measured water table profiles in a relatively homogeneous sandy soil at different times after drainage beginning they considered the distance between two adjacent drainpipes to be 4 m and conducted their experiments in a sandbox with 2 m in length 0 5 m in width and 1 1 m in height mehdinejadiani et al 2013 installed a corrugated pvc drainpipe with 0 5 m in length and 10 cm in diameter at the longitudinal end of the sandbox the drainpipe was pre wrapped with a locally manufactured synthetic envelope drainpipe pp450 and the center of the drainpipe was fixed at 30 cm above the bottom of the sandbox fathi 2005 measured the drainpipe discharges and the water tables at the midpoint between the drainpipes in a sandy clay loam soil with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 096 m day and an average drainable porosity of 0 023 cm3 cm3 at different times after drainage beginning he considered the space between the two adjacent drainpipes to be 1 84 m and carried out the experiments in a sandbox with 1 m in length 0 3 m in width and 0 8 m in height fathi 2005 installed a piece of a pvc drainpipe with 0 3 m in length and 8 cm in diameter at the longitudinal end of the sandbox the distance between the bottom of the sandbox and the center of the drainpipe was 11 cm at the field scale the water table data of h carroll austin farm near aurora north carolina skaggs et al 1973 and the sampla experimental farm located in haryana india kumar et al 1994 were used h carroll austin farm had a lumbee sandy loam soil with an average hydraulic conductivity of 4 2 cm hrs and an average drainable porosity of 0 075 cm3 cm3 in this farm the average depth of the impermeable layer was at 1 4 m of ground surface the farm s excess water was drained by drainpipes which were installed at the average depth of 1 m below the ground surface and spaced 30 m apart the drainpipes were made of clay with 30 cm in length and 12 5 cm in diameter the sampla experimental farm had a soil whose texture varied from sandy to sandy loam at different depths the average hydraulic conductivity and its drainable porosity were 3 6 m day and 0 14 cm3 cm3 respectively and the impermeable layer located at the average depth of 3 m below the ground surface this experimental farm was equipped with a subsurface drainage system whose drainpipes were placed at a distance of 50 m from each other and installed at the average depth of 1 75 m below the ground surface the drainpipes were made of concrete with 30 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter and surrounded by gravel envelope 2 3 1 estimation of κ and evaluation of model simulation capability in this subsection we first appraised the κ using the water table or drainage discharge data at some times and we then simulated the water table values using the estimated κ values at other times not used in estimating the κ indeed we separately obtained the κ using the dim the gdc skaggs s dc the drainpipe discharge method and the direct method then we compared the results of the various techniques it is necessary to mention that regarding the stochastic nature of the ba algorithm we executed the dim 10 times to estimate reliable κ values for each data set we analyzed the repeatability of the dim results for each data set and we used the mean of the κ values obtained by the dim for that data set in next analyses the κ value related to mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data was estimated using the measured water table profiles at times of 10 20 30 45 60 90 120 180 and 240 min after drainage start for fathi s 2005 data the κ value was separately estimated using the drainpipe discharge values at times of 10 14 37 46 87 106 154 177 209 231 265 285 325 348 384 400 and 414 min after drainage start and using the water table values at the midpoint between the drainpipes at times of 4 8 37 57 107 139 203 272 314 389 and 420 min after drainage start the κ value related to skaggs et al s 1973 data was obtained using the measured water table profiles at times of 34 5 77 2 and 127 hrs after drainage start for kumar et al s 1994 data the κ value was separately appraised using the drainpipe discharge values at times of 1 00 1 34 1 95 2 29 2 96 3 40 4 01 4 40 5 12 5 57 6 34 6 97 8 56 9 11 10 22 10 82 12 48 13 25 14 68 15 78 17 26 18 03 18 80 19 18 19 68 and 20 days after drainage start and using the water table values at the midpoint between the drainpipes at times of 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 and 19 days after drainage start it is necessary to mention that the desired dimensionless curves were generated according to subsection 2 2 2 fig 4 depicts the dimensionless curves generated for the used data series after estimating the κ using various techniques we evaluated the simulation capabilities of eqs 2a and 2b by comparing the simulated and measured values of water tables note that we used the κ values resulted from various techniques in eqs 2a and 2b as the input parameter the simulation capabilities of eqs 2a and 2b were examined using graphical displays and following statistical indicators stone 1993 gueymard 2014 sanikhani et al 2018 wang et al 2020 7a mbe 1 n i 1 n h i sim h i obs 7b rmse 1 n i 1 n h i sim h i obs 2 1 2 7c ts m b

to 0 and those of r2 nse wia and lce close to 1 indicate better performance of a model 3 results 3 1 repeatability of the dim estimations as mentioned in subsection 2 2 1 the dim applied the ba to estimate the optimal κ values with respect to the stochastic nature of the ba it is necessary to investigate the repeatability and consequently the reliability of the results deduced from the dim to this end the variances of the hh and κ values resulted from 10 times run of the dim for each data set were calculated as we know the smaller the variance the more repeatable and reliable the results maroufi and mehdinejadiani 2021 in this study we denoted the variances of the hh and κ by σ hh 2 and σ κ 2 respectively table 3 lists the σ hh 2 and σ κ 2 values as observed the σ hh 2 and σ κ 2 values are approximately equal to zero this means that the dim converges to a relatively constant κ value for each data set in different runs therefore the κ values resulted from the dim are repeatable and reliable for all the data set used in this work 3 2 estimated values of κ table 4 lists the mean κ values obtained by the studied techniques in this work it can be found from table 4 the mean κ values resulted from the five techniques generally differ with each other for each data series especially the mean κ value estimated by skaggs s dc for fathi s 2005 data is significantly different from those estimated by the other techniques these differences can be attributed to the drawbacks of skaggs s dc such as the lack of a dimensionless curve being appropriate to the experimental data the restriction of the existing dimensionless curve to a certain range of the h h 0 values or the assumption of flat initial water table profile in the numerical solution presented by skaggs 1975 for example the d h 0 d value is approximately 0 2 for fathi s 2005 data as can be seen in fig 3 the dimensionless curve corresponded to d h 0 d 0 2 does not give any value for the h h 0 values smaller than 0 2 this causes error in estimating the κ value for fathi s 2005 data 3 3 simulation results of the model using the estimated κ values the simulation ability of a model is a critical test for practical purposes tables 5 6 7 and 8 present the statistical indicators evaluating the performances of eqs 2a and 2b to simulate the water tables by utilizing the estimated κ values as mentioned earlier the simulation ability of the models was examined at times after drainage start which was not used in the estimation process of the κ for mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data the application of the κ resulted from the dim in eq 2a leads to much better values of the statistical indicators in comparison with those resulted from the gdc and skaggs s dc see table 5 the mbe values reveal that the κ values deduced from three techniques cause that eq 2a under simulates the water table heights at all times after drainage start however the mbe values corresponded to the dim are closer to zero followed by those corresponded to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively this implies that the application of the κ resulted from the dim in eq 2a as an input parameter much less leads to under simulate the water table profiles in comparison with those from skaggs s dc and the gdc fig 5 also confirms these findings according to the si values eq 2a acceptably simulates the water table heights using the κ value obtained by the dim at all times after drainage start while it reasonably simulates the water table heights using the κ values obtained by skaggs s dc and the gdc until 150 and 70 min after drainage start respectively in the worst case time of 110 min after drainage start the gpi value of eq 2a implying the global performance of the model becomes almost 9 times better when the κ yielded from the dim instead of that yielded from skaggs s dc is applied in eq 2a also the gpi value becomes almost 34 times better when the κ resulted from the dim instead of that resulted from the gdc is applied see table 5 in general it is inferred from table 5 that the dim appraises the κ value of the relatively homogeneous sandy soil much more accurately compared to skaggs s dc and the gdc this enables eq 2a that much better simulates the water table profiles fig 5 depicts this finding for fathi s 2005 data eq 2b achieves the best statistical indicator values when using the κ yielded from the dim while it attains the worst statistical indicator values when using the κ yielded from the direct method see table 6 the mbe values indicate that the application of the κ obtained by the dim causes that the eq 2b slightly over simulates the water table values the application of those obtained by the gdc skaggs s dc and the direct method causes that the eq 2b severely under simulates the water table values and the application of that obtained by the drainage discharge method causes that the eq 2b severely over simulates the water table values fig 6 also reflects these findings the si values imply that eq 2b performs as a perfect model by applying the κ resulted from the dim while it performs as a poor model by applying the κ resulted from the other techniques the gpi value corresponded to the dim is the closest one to 0 followed by the those corresponded to the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively overall the obtained results for fathi s 2005 data demonstrate that the dim is the most accurate approach to estimate the κ value followed by the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively for skaggs et al s 1973 data the statistical indicator values demonstrate that eq 2a gives the best simulation results by applying the κ yielded from the dim see table 7 it provides the better simulation results with the κ value estimated by skaggs s dc compared to those provided with the κ values estimated by the gdc and the direct method it is also found from table 7 that eq 2a produces the relatively similar simulation results by utilizing the κ values deduced from the gdc and the direct method the positive and negative mbe values imply that eq 2a over and under simulates the water table values respectively the closest mbe values to 0 are found when eq 2a uses the κ resulted from the dim while the farthest ones are found when eq 2a uses the κ yielded from the direct method and the gdc see table 7 fig 7 illustrates these over and under simulations the si values signify that eq 2a gives the fair results by applying the κ yielded from the dim at 57 5 hrs after drainage start while it gives poor results by applying the κ values stemmed from the other techniques as observed in table 7 eq 2a reaches the best gpi value by applying the κ come from the dim while it reaches the worst gpi values by applying the κ come from the direct method and the gdc the gpi values related to the state in which eq 2a applies the κ deduced from skaggs s dc are better than those related to the states in which eq 2a applies the κ values deduced from the direct method and the gdc taken as a whole the results suggest that the dim is the most proper technique for estimating the κ value in h carroll austin farm followed by skaggs s dc the direct method and the gdc respectively for kumar et al s 1994 data the closest values of the statistical indicators to their ideal values are observed when eq 2b simulates the water table heights using the κ derived from the dim see table 8 according to the mbe values eq 2b under simulates the water table heights by applying the κ raised from all the studied techniques nevertheless the least value of mbe is achieved using the κ value estimated by the dim followed by those achieved using the κ values resulted from the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively fig 8 also represents these findings based on the si values eq 2b well simulates the water table heights using the κ values raised from the dim the gdc and the drainage discharge method while it fairly simulates the water table heights using the κ value stemmed from skaggs s dc and poorly simulates them using the κ value yielded from the direct method as seen in table 8 the best gpi value is achieved by applying the κ value obtained from the dim in eq 2b followed by those achieved by applying the κ values obtained from the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively as a result the κ deduced from the dim is the most optimum value of the κ for sampla farm followed by those deduced from the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively 3 4 comparison of the inverse techniques this subsection compares the simulation capability of eqs 2a and 2b using the κ values obtained by the inverse techniques studied in this work i e dim gdc and skaggs s dc to this end we compared the whole water table heights measured with their counterparts simulated via eqs 2a or 2b by applying the κ values yielded from the dim the gdc and skaggs s dc fig 9 summarizes the statistical outcomes of the three inverse techniques for all data series and depicts them in the form of a taylor diagram as observed the rmse values of all the inverse techniques are lower than 0 1 however the rmse corresponded to the dim is the lowest one followed by those corresponded to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively also all three inverse techniques achieve the r2 values higher than 0 95 nevertheless the r2 corresponded to the dim is the closest one to 1 followed by the those related to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively these findings demonstrate that eqs 2a and 2b gives the most accurate water table heights with the κ values deduced from the dim followed by those given with the κ values deduced from skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively this signifies that the dim based on the ba is the most accurate technique to estimate the κ followed by skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively 4 discussion as mentioned in subsections 3 3 and 3 4 the dim significantly outperformed over the other techniques in estimating the κ at the laboratory and field scales on contrary to the dim the other two inverse techniques i e skaggs s dc and the gdc differently performed in various cases for example skaggs s dc was more accurate than the gdc in estimating the κ values related to mehdinejadiani et al 2013 and skaggs et al s 1973 data while the latter was more accurate than the former in estimating the κ values related to fathi 2005 and kumar et al s 1994 data even the performance of the gdc in estimating the κ related to skaggs et al s 1973 data was relatively similar to that of the direct method whose inefficiency was reported in the literature sepaskhah and ataee 2004 zhang and schaap 2019 soulis et al 2020 the substantial superiority of the dim over skaggs s dc and the gdc can be attributed to the following factors 1 the inverse model developed in this work applied the ba as an optimization algorithm to find the optimal κ value the ba is a metaheuristic algorithm also called stochastic algorithms the ba randomly generates initial solutions and then improves the quality of the selected solutions by an iterative local search this enables the dim to find the most optimum the κ value 2 the dim can select an objective function being proportional to the measured data this means that the dim can choose eqs 2a or 2b to calculate the water table values depending on whether the water table profiles or the water table heights at the midpoint between the drainpipes are available as the measured data however the two other inverse techniques i e skaggs s dc and the gdc utilize the numerical or analytical solutions that only calculate the water table heights at the midpoint between the drainpipes the application of eq 2a to the inverse modeling process outclasses over that of eq 2b from two viewpoints first eq 2a is capable of taking into consideration the vertical horizontal and radial flows occurring at different distances from drainpipe ritzema 1994 this capability causes the inverse model based on eq 2a estimates the κ value much more accurately than those based on eq 2a even in a homogeneous porous medium as observed for mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data second eq 2a is capable of taking into account the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the porous medium at different depths and distances from the drainpipes while eq 2b is only capable of taking into account the heterogeneity of the porous medium at the different depths of the midpoint between the drainpipes the effect of this capability was especially observed in the results obtained for skaggs et al s 1973 data 3 as observed the dim appraised the κ value much more accurately than the gdc in addition to the aforementioned reasons another reason of this superiority might be due to the omission of the terms with n 1 in eq 2b to generate the dimensionless curve indeed this omission considerably reduces the accuracy of eq 2b in simulating water table heights we show here that the omission of the terms with n 1 in eq 2b significantly reduces its accuracy to this end we applied eqs 2b and 5a to simulate mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data we utilized κ 28 344 m d a y as input parameter of eqs 2b and 5a and we simulated the water table heights at the midpoint between the drainpipes until 300 min after drainage start table 9 indicates that the statistical indicator values gravely deviate from their ideal values when we use eq 5a instead of eq 2b to simulate the water table heights as observed in the obtained results the dim and gdc appraised the κ more accurately than the drainage discharge method this supremacy might be ascribed to the fact that the inverse techniques take into account the flows above and below the drain level while the drainage discharge method neglects the flow above the drain level unlike the dim and the gdc skaggs s dc assessed the κ less accurately than the drainage discharge method this weaker performance can be related to the drawbacks of skaggs s dc mentioned in subsections 3 2 the results revealed that all techniques studied in this work were more efficient than the direct method to obtain the κ the reason for this is that the physical properties of a porous medium such as the heterogeneity the anisotropy and the presence of the preferential paths significantly influence the hydraulic properties of the porous medium the direct method as a point measurement technique moustafa 2004 is not capable to take into account the effects of the porous medium physical properties on estimating the k s and f while the other studied techniques can integrate the effect of the whole porous medium physical properties on estimating the κ another reason can be that the other studied techniques estimate the k s and f values simultaneously and dependently in the form of κ k s f while the direct method appraises them separately and independently a small error in estimating each parameter may result in the much larger error in the simulation of the water table heights 5 conclusion this work developed an inverse model based on the bees algorithm ba to estimate ratio of hydraulic conductivity k s to drainable porosity f in the form of κ k s f the developed inverse model dim obtained the κ optimal value by minimizing hanna and heinold s 1985 statistical indicator as an objective function we investigated the practical application of the dim in estimating the κ at laboratory and field scales we compared the performance of the dim with those of several traditional techniques including a dimensionless curve generated by the authors gdc skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve skaggs s dc drainage discharge method and direct method based on the statistical indicator values the drainage equations used in this study gave the best simulation results by applying the κ obtained from the dim for all used data sets for example the weakest simulation results were obtained for skaggs et al s 1973 data at time of 57 5 hrs after drainage start in this case the best simulation results were acquired by applying the κ value deduced from the dim in the drainage equation followed by those acquired by applying the κ values deduced from skaggs s dc the gdc and the direct method respectively the gpi index signifying the global performance of a model recuperates approximately 93 for the aforementioned case when the drainage equation utilizes the κ value obtained by the dim instead of that obtained by skaggs s dc also the graphical comparison of the whole measured water table heights with their simulated counterparts demonstrates that the values of the rmse and r2 corresponded to the dim are closer to their ideal values followed by those corresponded to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively to sum up the findings imply that the dim is the most accurate technique to estimate the optimal κ value among the other studied techniques therefore the inverse model based on the ba can be applied as a robust practical technique to appraise the optimal κ values

3527,a major step in designing a subsurface drainage system is calculation of drainpipe spacing nearly all unsteady state drainpipe spacing equations use ratio of hydraulic conductivity k s to drainable porosity f in the form of κ k s f this work developed a novel inverse model based on bees algorithm to estimate the κ we examined the efficiency of the developed inverse model to appraise the κ using the existing data sets at laboratory and field scales for each data set we compared the performance of the developed inverse model with those of a dimensionless curve generated by the authors generalized dimensionless curve skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve being proportional to the data set skaggs s dimensionless curve a drainpipe discharge method and a direct method the results showed that the best statistical indicator values were achieved for each data set when the drainage equations utilized the κ deduced from the developed inverse model all the studied techniques performed the worst for skaggs et al s 1973 data at 57 5 hrs after drainage start for this data set the studied techniques were respectively ranked as the developed inverse model skaggs s dimensionless curve the generalized dimensionless curve and the direct method even in this worst case the global performance index was improved almost 93 when the drainage equation utilized the κ appraised by the developed inverse model instead of that appraised by skaggs s dimensionless curve the overall performance comparison of the three inverse techniques evaluated in this study revealed that the root mean square error and coefficient of determination related to the developed inverse model are the best ones followed by those related to skaggs s dimensionless curve and the developed inverse model respectively in summary the results revealed that compared to the other studied techniques the developed inverse model is the most efficient technique to estimate the κ which is promising for practical purposes at the laboratory and field scales keywords bees algorithm dimensionless curve direct method drainage discharge method inverse model 1 introduction an accurate calculation of a drainpipe spacing is quite critical to properly design a drainage system in reality the water flow towards the drainpipes is typically unsteady ritzema 1994 and consequently unsteady state equations are preferred to calculate the drainpipe spacing most if not all the unsteady state equations e g dumm 1964 kumar et al 1994 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 singh et al 2006 use saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and drainable porosity f in the form of k s f ratio which is hereafter denoted by κ the k s and f values can be determined directly in situ or in laboratory amoozegar and wilson 1999 morbidelli et al 2017 amoozegar 2020 moshayedi et al 2020 however the k s and f values obtained from the direct measurements are spatially variable soulis et al 2020 these variations are often so wide that assigning representative values to the k s and f for calculating drainpipe spacing is quite difficult sepaskhah and ataee 2004 in practice a large number of samples may be required to account for this spatial variability and to obtain reliable values of k s and f furthermore these direct measurements are costly time consuming relatively cumbersome labor intensive and impractical for large scale applications sepaskhah and ataee 2004 zhang and schaap 2019 this difficulty can be overcome by using the so called indirect methods pedo transfer functions ptfs zhang and schaap 2019 are one of the indirect methods to estimate the soil hydraulic properties from easily available soil data including the texture structure bulk density organic matter etc the main disadvantage of the ptfs is that their application is often restricted to a specific condition under which they have been developed vogeler et al 2019 inverse modeling method imm is an alternative indirect approach to obtain soil hydraulic parameters shps by back matching the observed data with simulation results minasny and mcbratney 2002 the previous studies have demonstrated that the imm can be applied as promising approach to obtain the shps e g kumar et al 1994 ritter et al 2003 samani et al 2007 mahbod and zand parsa 2010 mehdinejadiani et al 2013 sedaghatdoost et al 2018 and 2019 vogeler et al 2019 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 the imms typically use an optimization algorithm to find optimal values of parameters this is due to the fact that a manual calibration by trial and error is quite difficult especially in simultaneous estimation of several parameters ritter et al 2003 there are several classifications of the optimization algorithms in literature for example singh et al 2021 classified the optimization algorithms into deterministic local search and stochastic global search and korani and mouhoub 2021 categorized them into exact and approximate recent studies e g li et al 2018 sedaghatdoost et al 2018 sedaghatdoost et al 2019 sihag et al 2019 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 maroufi and mehdinejadiani 2021 recommend the metaheuristic algorithms as a subclass of approximate stochastic global search algorithms to develop the inverse models the metaheuristic algorithms are free from some disadvantages such as differentiability of objective function with respect to model parameters high dependency of algorithm convergence on initial guess of solution vector and high probability of sticking in local optima maroufi and mehdinejadiani 2021 nowadays researchers usually construct the inverse models based on population based metaheuristic algorithms these algorithms either mimic evolutionary process or imitate social behaviors of human animals and insects the first group is called evolutionary algorithms eas while the second one is called swarm intelligence algorithms sias elshaer and awad 2020 there is a large body of literature on the application of the metaheuristic algorithms to find the soil hydraulic properties for example abbaspour et al 2001 successfully applied ant colony optimization aco to inversely estimate the unsaturated shps mahbod and zand parsa 2010 developed eshpim2 model to inversely obtain the shps using genetic algorithm ga in field conditions they found that although the model was generally favorable to estimate the parameters it underestimated the k s zhang et al 2010 formulated a well performed inverse model using a micro ga for estimating the soil hydraulic properties azizpour et al 2012 fitted the glover dumm equation to the measured water table data at laboratory using an inverse model applying the ga which performed well in simultaneous estimation of optimal k s and f values an imm with the ga was presented by sedaghatdoost et al 2018 for appraising the shps in two subsurface drainage systems this imm estimated well the shps by minimizing the objective function which was based on the discrepancies between measured and simulated values of drainage discharge water table depth and drainage water salinity in another study sedaghatdoost et al 2019 compared the performances of the ga and pest optimization tool in identifying the most influential shps they found that the imm based on the ga outperformed that based on the pest sonkar et al 2018 developed an imm by coupling the ga with the numerical solution of richards equation to estimate the shps they evaluated the possibility to estimate the shps from the inverse procedure using synthetic soil moisture depletion data they concluded that the separately estimation of the shps is necessary prior to the estimation of the root water parameter mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 applied the imm to appraise the κ in analytical drainage equations they used particle swarm optimization pso as the optimization method in the imm according their findings the mentioned imm was capable of well estimating the κ bees algorithm ba is a sia which was introduced by pham et al 2006 the ba mimics the foraging behavior of the honey bees in nature to solve an optimization problem for details on this behavior the interested reader is refereed to pham et al 2006 and references therein pham and castellani 2009 and pham and castellani 2014 evaluated the performance of the ba on continuous function minimization benchmarks and they compared the results obtained by the ba with the results given by the ea pso and artificial bee colony abc the results of these studies indicated the strength of the ba in terms of accuracy learning speed and robustness in another research pham and castellani 2015 tested the ba on 18 custom made function minimization benchmarks and on four real world minimization tasks the results obtained on the benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the ba and the results obtained on the real world tasks confirmed the ability of the ba to solve complex real world optimization tasks the ba has been recently used for various soil and water optimization problems for example mehdinejadiani et al 2013 applied the ba as the optimization algorithm in an inverse model to estimate hydraulic dispersion coefficients kesin et al 2015 used the ba successfully in training artificial neural networks anns to develop a model which forecasted the water discharging from different types of rocks and predicted the water pollution sources a comparative study demonstrated that the imm based on the ba estimated transport parameters of spatial fractional advection dispersion equation much more accurately than the imm based on the ga mehdinejadiani 2017 bui et al 2018 presented three new hybrid artificial intelligence optimization models namely adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis with cultural anfis ca bees anfis ba and invasive weed optimization anfis iwo algorithms for flood susceptibility mapping fsm in the haraz watershed iran they found that anfis ba had a better prediction capability followed by anfis iwo and anfis ca respectively a spatial modeling approach based on an anfis and several metaheuristic optimizations ba ga pso and imperialistic competitive algorithm ica was developed by rahmati et al 2020 to predict the spatial occurrence of drought in a region in southeastern queensland australia the results of this research indicated that the combination of the anfis and ba yielded the most accurate prediction of the drought to the authors best knowledge except the work conducted by mehdinejadiani et al 2013 to inversely estimate the hydraulic dispersion coefficients using the ba there is no another work on the deep evaluation of the ba efficiency to appraise the shps therefore we conducted this study with the following purposes 1 to develop an inverse model using the ba technique for estimating the κ 2 to compare the performance of the ba with those of other methods at laboratory and field scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of flow model boussinesq equation be is a partial differential equation governing the unsteady flow of water towards drainpipes kumar et al 1994 the linearized one dimensional be for a horizontal impervious layer in a homogeneous soil profile can be written as follows uziak and chieng 1989 1a h x t t κ d 2 h x t x 2 where x is the space variable l t is the time variable t h x t is the water table height above the drain level l κ is equal to k s f k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 f is the drainable porosity dimensionless and d is the average thickness of the water transmitting layer l which is calculated as follows uziak and chieng 1989 1b d h 0 2 d e where h 0 is the initial water table height above the drain level at the midpoint between the drainpipes l see fig 1 and d e is the hooghoudt s equivalent depth l note that in this study we calculated the d e value using eq 5a in mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 the linearized be has been analytically and numerically solved for the boundary and initial conditions corresponded to the water flow towards the drainpipes e g dumm 1964 kumar et al 1994 upadhyaya and chauhan 2000 upadhyaya and chauhan 2001 singh et al 2006 azizpour et al 2012 the previous studies e g singh et al 2006 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 have demonstrated that the analytical equation considering an elliptical water table profile as the initial condition is a promising drainage equation to simulate the unsteady flow of water towards drainpipes uziak and chieng 1989 derived the analytical equation for the elliptical initial water table profile as follows 2a h x t 4 h 0 1 e 1 h 0 d 2 n 1 3 5 1 n π 1 4 1 h 0 d 4 n π 2 n π 2 1 n 1 2 1 h 0 d 2 e 1 h 0 d 2 e α n 2 t s i n n π l x where d is the depth to the impervious layer below the drainpipes see fig 1 l is the drainpipe spacing l α κ π 2 d l 2 and the other variables are defined as before the water table height above the drain level at the midpoint between the drainpipes can be calculated by substituting x l 2 as follows 2b h l 2 t 4 h 0 1 e 1 h 0 d 2 n 1 3 5 1 n π 1 4 1 h 0 d 4 n π 2 n π 2 1 n 1 2 1 h 0 d 2 e 1 h 0 d 2 e α n 2 t s i n n π 2 regarding to the available data we used eqs 2a or 2b to simulate the water table height above the drain level 2 2 estimation of κ in this paper we first appraised the κ using an inverse model based on the ba then we compared the results of the inverse model with those of a dimensionless curve generated by the authors gdc skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve being proportional to the data set skaggs s dc a drainpipe discharge method and a direct method these methods are detailed in the next subsections 2 2 1 development of inverse model in this subsection we describe the developed inverse model dim to estimate the κ the dim appraised the optimal κ value by minimizing an objective function the previous studies e g huang et al 2006 martinez et al 2010 typically used the root mean square error rmse as the objective function however mentaschi et al 2013 clearly showed that lower values of the rmse do not always imply the more accuracy of a mathematical model therefore one can conclude that the application of the rmse as the objective function in an inverse model does not always lead to find the global optimal parameters of the mathematical model to overcome this problem hanna and heinold 1985 proposed a statistical indicator as follows 3 hh i 1 n h i sim h i obs 2 i 1 n h i sim h i obs where h i sim and h i obs are the simulated and measured water table heights above the drain level at i th point respectively and n is the number of measurement points the use of hh allows to correctly interpret the performances of the mathematical model as a result one can infer that the application of the hh as the objective function in the inverse model can lead to find more accurate values of parameters of the mathematical model accordingtotheaforementioneddiscussion we used hh eq 3 as the objective function in the dim in this study the dim applied the ba to minimize the hh the ba initializes the optimization process by generating n pop random solutions uniformly distributed in search space each random solution κ i is generated using the following equation moradi et al 2011 4a κ i κ min r i κ max κ min where κ min and κ max are the minimum and maximum values of the solution respectively and r i is a random number in the range of 0 1 we considered the κ min and κ max values with respect to the minimum and maximum values of k s and f in different soil textures to this end we used the constraints of the k s and f presented by foodandagricultureorganizationof the united nations in 1980 fao 1980 table 1 shows the constraints of the k s and f and consequently the constraints of the κ which was used in the dim the algorithm evaluates the random solutions by calculating the hh it is clear that the lower the hh value the better the solution the ba selects the top n best solutions among of n pop random solutions as the best ones and chooses the first n elite solutions among of the best n best solutions as elite ones the ba performs a local search by dispatching n ep and n sp new solutions in the neighborhood of the elite and the other selected solutions respectively where n sp n ep note that the ba generates a new solution κ i in the neighborhood of a selected solution κ i as follows moradi et al 2011 4b κ i κ i n g h 2 r i n g h where ngh is the size of the local search neighborhood radius calculated as follows pham and castellani 2009 4c ngh κ max κ min the size of the ngh is kept constant as long as the local search leads to better new solutions in case thelocalsearchfailstoimprovethecurrent solution the size of the ngh is shrunk in this study we updated the size of the ngh as follows 4d ngh n 1 0 9 ngh n where n denotes the n th iteration of the ba main loop at the end of the local search the algorithm selects the fittest solution at each neighborhood after the local search the ba randomly generates n pop n best new solutions to perform a new global search in the next iteration then the algorithm continues the optimization process with the n pop n best generated new solutions and the n best selected ones from the local search in the n 1 th iteration this process continues until the stopping criterion is met fig 2 gives the flowchart of the ba in this study we considered the maximum number of iteration n max i t e r as the stopping criterion similar to the previous studies e g moradi et al 2011 mehdinejadiani 2017 some trials were made to properly set the control parameters of the ba we achieved this by manipulating the n pop n best n elite n ep n sp and n max i t e r table 2 lists the final parameters of the ba 2 2 2 construction of dimensionless curve the dimensionless curve technique is a simple inverse method applied to appraise the shps skaggs 1976 and kumar et al 1994 presented a series of dimensionless curves to estimate the κ and κ d respectively in this study we generated dimensionless curves hereafter called gdc by neglecting the terms related to n 1 in eq 2b in this case eq 2b can be simplified as follows 5a h l 2 t 4 h 0 1 e 1 h 0 d 2 1 π 1 4 1 h 0 d 4 π 2 π 2 1 h 0 d 2 e 1 h 0 d 2 e α t in order to create a dimensionless curve corresponding to a certain h 0 d value we calculated α t by considering various h l 2 t h 0 values in the range of 0 1 after generating the desirable dimensionless curve we first obtained the α t value at each time and then we computed the κ value at that time using the following formula 5b κ t t i α l 2 d π 2 t i for a comprehensive comparison in addition to the dimensionless curves constructed in this study we appraised the κ value using the dimensionless curves generated by skaggs 1976 he used a numerical solution based on a flat initial water table profile to construct a series of dimensionless curves fig 3 shows the dimensionless curves presented by skaggs 1976 note that the d d h 0 d in these curves for brevity we called the skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve as skaggs s dc in this study 2 2 3 drainpipe discharge method in this method the κ is estimated using drainpipe discharge per unit surface area to this end we used the following formula vlotman et al 2004 6 κ t t i 2 3 l 2 π 2 d l o g q t i 1 q t i where q t i is the drainpipe discharge per unit surface area at time t i 2 2 4 direct method there exist several laboratory and field methods to directly determine the k s including constant head method falling head method below water table methods and above water table methods ritzema 1994 also the f is determined by measuring the volume fraction of the pore space water drained from a soil sample taylor 1960 in this study we evaluated the κ values obtained from the dims by comparing them with those obtained from the direct measurements of the k s and f if available in literature 2 3 experimental data the practical efficiency of the aforementioned methods for estimating the κ was examined using water table data at laboratory and field scales at the laboratory scale the experimental data reported by mehdinejadiani et al 2013 and fathi 2005 were used mehdinejadiani et al 2013 measured water table profiles in a relatively homogeneous sandy soil at different times after drainage beginning they considered the distance between two adjacent drainpipes to be 4 m and conducted their experiments in a sandbox with 2 m in length 0 5 m in width and 1 1 m in height mehdinejadiani et al 2013 installed a corrugated pvc drainpipe with 0 5 m in length and 10 cm in diameter at the longitudinal end of the sandbox the drainpipe was pre wrapped with a locally manufactured synthetic envelope drainpipe pp450 and the center of the drainpipe was fixed at 30 cm above the bottom of the sandbox fathi 2005 measured the drainpipe discharges and the water tables at the midpoint between the drainpipes in a sandy clay loam soil with an average hydraulic conductivity of 0 096 m day and an average drainable porosity of 0 023 cm3 cm3 at different times after drainage beginning he considered the space between the two adjacent drainpipes to be 1 84 m and carried out the experiments in a sandbox with 1 m in length 0 3 m in width and 0 8 m in height fathi 2005 installed a piece of a pvc drainpipe with 0 3 m in length and 8 cm in diameter at the longitudinal end of the sandbox the distance between the bottom of the sandbox and the center of the drainpipe was 11 cm at the field scale the water table data of h carroll austin farm near aurora north carolina skaggs et al 1973 and the sampla experimental farm located in haryana india kumar et al 1994 were used h carroll austin farm had a lumbee sandy loam soil with an average hydraulic conductivity of 4 2 cm hrs and an average drainable porosity of 0 075 cm3 cm3 in this farm the average depth of the impermeable layer was at 1 4 m of ground surface the farm s excess water was drained by drainpipes which were installed at the average depth of 1 m below the ground surface and spaced 30 m apart the drainpipes were made of clay with 30 cm in length and 12 5 cm in diameter the sampla experimental farm had a soil whose texture varied from sandy to sandy loam at different depths the average hydraulic conductivity and its drainable porosity were 3 6 m day and 0 14 cm3 cm3 respectively and the impermeable layer located at the average depth of 3 m below the ground surface this experimental farm was equipped with a subsurface drainage system whose drainpipes were placed at a distance of 50 m from each other and installed at the average depth of 1 75 m below the ground surface the drainpipes were made of concrete with 30 cm in length and 10 cm in diameter and surrounded by gravel envelope 2 3 1 estimation of κ and evaluation of model simulation capability in this subsection we first appraised the κ using the water table or drainage discharge data at some times and we then simulated the water table values using the estimated κ values at other times not used in estimating the κ indeed we separately obtained the κ using the dim the gdc skaggs s dc the drainpipe discharge method and the direct method then we compared the results of the various techniques it is necessary to mention that regarding the stochastic nature of the ba algorithm we executed the dim 10 times to estimate reliable κ values for each data set we analyzed the repeatability of the dim results for each data set and we used the mean of the κ values obtained by the dim for that data set in next analyses the κ value related to mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data was estimated using the measured water table profiles at times of 10 20 30 45 60 90 120 180 and 240 min after drainage start for fathi s 2005 data the κ value was separately estimated using the drainpipe discharge values at times of 10 14 37 46 87 106 154 177 209 231 265 285 325 348 384 400 and 414 min after drainage start and using the water table values at the midpoint between the drainpipes at times of 4 8 37 57 107 139 203 272 314 389 and 420 min after drainage start the κ value related to skaggs et al s 1973 data was obtained using the measured water table profiles at times of 34 5 77 2 and 127 hrs after drainage start for kumar et al s 1994 data the κ value was separately appraised using the drainpipe discharge values at times of 1 00 1 34 1 95 2 29 2 96 3 40 4 01 4 40 5 12 5 57 6 34 6 97 8 56 9 11 10 22 10 82 12 48 13 25 14 68 15 78 17 26 18 03 18 80 19 18 19 68 and 20 days after drainage start and using the water table values at the midpoint between the drainpipes at times of 4 5 7 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 and 19 days after drainage start it is necessary to mention that the desired dimensionless curves were generated according to subsection 2 2 2 fig 4 depicts the dimensionless curves generated for the used data series after estimating the κ using various techniques we evaluated the simulation capabilities of eqs 2a and 2b by comparing the simulated and measured values of water tables note that we used the κ values resulted from various techniques in eqs 2a and 2b as the input parameter the simulation capabilities of eqs 2a and 2b were examined using graphical displays and following statistical indicators stone 1993 gueymard 2014 sanikhani et al 2018 wang et al 2020 7a mbe 1 n i 1 n h i sim h i obs 7b rmse 1 n i 1 n h i sim h i obs 2 1 2 7c ts m b

to 0 and those of r2 nse wia and lce close to 1 indicate better performance of a model 3 results 3 1 repeatability of the dim estimations as mentioned in subsection 2 2 1 the dim applied the ba to estimate the optimal κ values with respect to the stochastic nature of the ba it is necessary to investigate the repeatability and consequently the reliability of the results deduced from the dim to this end the variances of the hh and κ values resulted from 10 times run of the dim for each data set were calculated as we know the smaller the variance the more repeatable and reliable the results maroufi and mehdinejadiani 2021 in this study we denoted the variances of the hh and κ by σ hh 2 and σ κ 2 respectively table 3 lists the σ hh 2 and σ κ 2 values as observed the σ hh 2 and σ κ 2 values are approximately equal to zero this means that the dim converges to a relatively constant κ value for each data set in different runs therefore the κ values resulted from the dim are repeatable and reliable for all the data set used in this work 3 2 estimated values of κ table 4 lists the mean κ values obtained by the studied techniques in this work it can be found from table 4 the mean κ values resulted from the five techniques generally differ with each other for each data series especially the mean κ value estimated by skaggs s dc for fathi s 2005 data is significantly different from those estimated by the other techniques these differences can be attributed to the drawbacks of skaggs s dc such as the lack of a dimensionless curve being appropriate to the experimental data the restriction of the existing dimensionless curve to a certain range of the h h 0 values or the assumption of flat initial water table profile in the numerical solution presented by skaggs 1975 for example the d h 0 d value is approximately 0 2 for fathi s 2005 data as can be seen in fig 3 the dimensionless curve corresponded to d h 0 d 0 2 does not give any value for the h h 0 values smaller than 0 2 this causes error in estimating the κ value for fathi s 2005 data 3 3 simulation results of the model using the estimated κ values the simulation ability of a model is a critical test for practical purposes tables 5 6 7 and 8 present the statistical indicators evaluating the performances of eqs 2a and 2b to simulate the water tables by utilizing the estimated κ values as mentioned earlier the simulation ability of the models was examined at times after drainage start which was not used in the estimation process of the κ for mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data the application of the κ resulted from the dim in eq 2a leads to much better values of the statistical indicators in comparison with those resulted from the gdc and skaggs s dc see table 5 the mbe values reveal that the κ values deduced from three techniques cause that eq 2a under simulates the water table heights at all times after drainage start however the mbe values corresponded to the dim are closer to zero followed by those corresponded to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively this implies that the application of the κ resulted from the dim in eq 2a as an input parameter much less leads to under simulate the water table profiles in comparison with those from skaggs s dc and the gdc fig 5 also confirms these findings according to the si values eq 2a acceptably simulates the water table heights using the κ value obtained by the dim at all times after drainage start while it reasonably simulates the water table heights using the κ values obtained by skaggs s dc and the gdc until 150 and 70 min after drainage start respectively in the worst case time of 110 min after drainage start the gpi value of eq 2a implying the global performance of the model becomes almost 9 times better when the κ yielded from the dim instead of that yielded from skaggs s dc is applied in eq 2a also the gpi value becomes almost 34 times better when the κ resulted from the dim instead of that resulted from the gdc is applied see table 5 in general it is inferred from table 5 that the dim appraises the κ value of the relatively homogeneous sandy soil much more accurately compared to skaggs s dc and the gdc this enables eq 2a that much better simulates the water table profiles fig 5 depicts this finding for fathi s 2005 data eq 2b achieves the best statistical indicator values when using the κ yielded from the dim while it attains the worst statistical indicator values when using the κ yielded from the direct method see table 6 the mbe values indicate that the application of the κ obtained by the dim causes that the eq 2b slightly over simulates the water table values the application of those obtained by the gdc skaggs s dc and the direct method causes that the eq 2b severely under simulates the water table values and the application of that obtained by the drainage discharge method causes that the eq 2b severely over simulates the water table values fig 6 also reflects these findings the si values imply that eq 2b performs as a perfect model by applying the κ resulted from the dim while it performs as a poor model by applying the κ resulted from the other techniques the gpi value corresponded to the dim is the closest one to 0 followed by the those corresponded to the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively overall the obtained results for fathi s 2005 data demonstrate that the dim is the most accurate approach to estimate the κ value followed by the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively for skaggs et al s 1973 data the statistical indicator values demonstrate that eq 2a gives the best simulation results by applying the κ yielded from the dim see table 7 it provides the better simulation results with the κ value estimated by skaggs s dc compared to those provided with the κ values estimated by the gdc and the direct method it is also found from table 7 that eq 2a produces the relatively similar simulation results by utilizing the κ values deduced from the gdc and the direct method the positive and negative mbe values imply that eq 2a over and under simulates the water table values respectively the closest mbe values to 0 are found when eq 2a uses the κ resulted from the dim while the farthest ones are found when eq 2a uses the κ yielded from the direct method and the gdc see table 7 fig 7 illustrates these over and under simulations the si values signify that eq 2a gives the fair results by applying the κ yielded from the dim at 57 5 hrs after drainage start while it gives poor results by applying the κ values stemmed from the other techniques as observed in table 7 eq 2a reaches the best gpi value by applying the κ come from the dim while it reaches the worst gpi values by applying the κ come from the direct method and the gdc the gpi values related to the state in which eq 2a applies the κ deduced from skaggs s dc are better than those related to the states in which eq 2a applies the κ values deduced from the direct method and the gdc taken as a whole the results suggest that the dim is the most proper technique for estimating the κ value in h carroll austin farm followed by skaggs s dc the direct method and the gdc respectively for kumar et al s 1994 data the closest values of the statistical indicators to their ideal values are observed when eq 2b simulates the water table heights using the κ derived from the dim see table 8 according to the mbe values eq 2b under simulates the water table heights by applying the κ raised from all the studied techniques nevertheless the least value of mbe is achieved using the κ value estimated by the dim followed by those achieved using the κ values resulted from the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively fig 8 also represents these findings based on the si values eq 2b well simulates the water table heights using the κ values raised from the dim the gdc and the drainage discharge method while it fairly simulates the water table heights using the κ value stemmed from skaggs s dc and poorly simulates them using the κ value yielded from the direct method as seen in table 8 the best gpi value is achieved by applying the κ value obtained from the dim in eq 2b followed by those achieved by applying the κ values obtained from the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively as a result the κ deduced from the dim is the most optimum value of the κ for sampla farm followed by those deduced from the gdc the drainage discharge method skaggs s dc and the direct method respectively 3 4 comparison of the inverse techniques this subsection compares the simulation capability of eqs 2a and 2b using the κ values obtained by the inverse techniques studied in this work i e dim gdc and skaggs s dc to this end we compared the whole water table heights measured with their counterparts simulated via eqs 2a or 2b by applying the κ values yielded from the dim the gdc and skaggs s dc fig 9 summarizes the statistical outcomes of the three inverse techniques for all data series and depicts them in the form of a taylor diagram as observed the rmse values of all the inverse techniques are lower than 0 1 however the rmse corresponded to the dim is the lowest one followed by those corresponded to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively also all three inverse techniques achieve the r2 values higher than 0 95 nevertheless the r2 corresponded to the dim is the closest one to 1 followed by the those related to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively these findings demonstrate that eqs 2a and 2b gives the most accurate water table heights with the κ values deduced from the dim followed by those given with the κ values deduced from skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively this signifies that the dim based on the ba is the most accurate technique to estimate the κ followed by skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively 4 discussion as mentioned in subsections 3 3 and 3 4 the dim significantly outperformed over the other techniques in estimating the κ at the laboratory and field scales on contrary to the dim the other two inverse techniques i e skaggs s dc and the gdc differently performed in various cases for example skaggs s dc was more accurate than the gdc in estimating the κ values related to mehdinejadiani et al 2013 and skaggs et al s 1973 data while the latter was more accurate than the former in estimating the κ values related to fathi 2005 and kumar et al s 1994 data even the performance of the gdc in estimating the κ related to skaggs et al s 1973 data was relatively similar to that of the direct method whose inefficiency was reported in the literature sepaskhah and ataee 2004 zhang and schaap 2019 soulis et al 2020 the substantial superiority of the dim over skaggs s dc and the gdc can be attributed to the following factors 1 the inverse model developed in this work applied the ba as an optimization algorithm to find the optimal κ value the ba is a metaheuristic algorithm also called stochastic algorithms the ba randomly generates initial solutions and then improves the quality of the selected solutions by an iterative local search this enables the dim to find the most optimum the κ value 2 the dim can select an objective function being proportional to the measured data this means that the dim can choose eqs 2a or 2b to calculate the water table values depending on whether the water table profiles or the water table heights at the midpoint between the drainpipes are available as the measured data however the two other inverse techniques i e skaggs s dc and the gdc utilize the numerical or analytical solutions that only calculate the water table heights at the midpoint between the drainpipes the application of eq 2a to the inverse modeling process outclasses over that of eq 2b from two viewpoints first eq 2a is capable of taking into consideration the vertical horizontal and radial flows occurring at different distances from drainpipe ritzema 1994 this capability causes the inverse model based on eq 2a estimates the κ value much more accurately than those based on eq 2a even in a homogeneous porous medium as observed for mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data second eq 2a is capable of taking into account the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the porous medium at different depths and distances from the drainpipes while eq 2b is only capable of taking into account the heterogeneity of the porous medium at the different depths of the midpoint between the drainpipes the effect of this capability was especially observed in the results obtained for skaggs et al s 1973 data 3 as observed the dim appraised the κ value much more accurately than the gdc in addition to the aforementioned reasons another reason of this superiority might be due to the omission of the terms with n 1 in eq 2b to generate the dimensionless curve indeed this omission considerably reduces the accuracy of eq 2b in simulating water table heights we show here that the omission of the terms with n 1 in eq 2b significantly reduces its accuracy to this end we applied eqs 2b and 5a to simulate mehdinejadiani et al s 2013 data we utilized κ 28 344 m d a y as input parameter of eqs 2b and 5a and we simulated the water table heights at the midpoint between the drainpipes until 300 min after drainage start table 9 indicates that the statistical indicator values gravely deviate from their ideal values when we use eq 5a instead of eq 2b to simulate the water table heights as observed in the obtained results the dim and gdc appraised the κ more accurately than the drainage discharge method this supremacy might be ascribed to the fact that the inverse techniques take into account the flows above and below the drain level while the drainage discharge method neglects the flow above the drain level unlike the dim and the gdc skaggs s dc assessed the κ less accurately than the drainage discharge method this weaker performance can be related to the drawbacks of skaggs s dc mentioned in subsections 3 2 the results revealed that all techniques studied in this work were more efficient than the direct method to obtain the κ the reason for this is that the physical properties of a porous medium such as the heterogeneity the anisotropy and the presence of the preferential paths significantly influence the hydraulic properties of the porous medium the direct method as a point measurement technique moustafa 2004 is not capable to take into account the effects of the porous medium physical properties on estimating the k s and f while the other studied techniques can integrate the effect of the whole porous medium physical properties on estimating the κ another reason can be that the other studied techniques estimate the k s and f values simultaneously and dependently in the form of κ k s f while the direct method appraises them separately and independently a small error in estimating each parameter may result in the much larger error in the simulation of the water table heights 5 conclusion this work developed an inverse model based on the bees algorithm ba to estimate ratio of hydraulic conductivity k s to drainable porosity f in the form of κ k s f the developed inverse model dim obtained the κ optimal value by minimizing hanna and heinold s 1985 statistical indicator as an objective function we investigated the practical application of the dim in estimating the κ at laboratory and field scales we compared the performance of the dim with those of several traditional techniques including a dimensionless curve generated by the authors gdc skaggs s 1976 dimensionless curve skaggs s dc drainage discharge method and direct method based on the statistical indicator values the drainage equations used in this study gave the best simulation results by applying the κ obtained from the dim for all used data sets for example the weakest simulation results were obtained for skaggs et al s 1973 data at time of 57 5 hrs after drainage start in this case the best simulation results were acquired by applying the κ value deduced from the dim in the drainage equation followed by those acquired by applying the κ values deduced from skaggs s dc the gdc and the direct method respectively the gpi index signifying the global performance of a model recuperates approximately 93 for the aforementioned case when the drainage equation utilizes the κ value obtained by the dim instead of that obtained by skaggs s dc also the graphical comparison of the whole measured water table heights with their simulated counterparts demonstrates that the values of the rmse and r2 corresponded to the dim are closer to their ideal values followed by those corresponded to skaggs s dc and the gdc respectively to sum up the findings imply that the dim is the most accurate technique to estimate the optimal κ value among the other studied techniques therefore the inverse model based on the ba can be applied as a robust practical technique to appraise the optimal κ values

3528,reservoirs represent a key component of the global carbon cycle however estimates of carbon dioxide co2 emissions from reservoirs remain poorly constrained due to the absence of spatially and temporally resolved measurements we performed high resolution monitoring of co2 emissions f co2 in a semiarid hard water reservoir to examine its seasonal and diel variability our results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon input plays a central role in sustaining the surface water co2 partial pressure pco2 which varies from 1076 to 4587 μatm although the reservoir is moderately to highly productive throughout the year it is a net co2 source with f co2 values in the range of 308 1753 mg c m 2 d 1 this high co2 efflux indicates that productive waters are not necessarily co2 sinks both pco2 and f co2 exhibit clear seasonal and diel patterns surface water pco2 is highest in march and presents a consistent diurnal nocturnal pattern with the daytime pco2 6 13 lower than the nighttime pco2 high co2 efflux is observed during the ice thaw period indicating the release of co2 that was accumulated during the winter co2 effluxes are typically higher during the nighttime driven by aquatic metabolism but episodic weather events e g rainfall and strong winds can significantly enhance co2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern our study also shows that using only daytime measurements to estimate daily co2 emissions would underestimate it by 9 25 hence future global assessments should incorporate co2 emissions from hard water reservoirs and account for their seasonal and diel variability keywords co2 emissions co2 partial pressure pco2 seasonal and diel variability hard water reservoir chinese loess plateau 1 introduction artificial reservoirs created by dams have different properties from natural systems e g lakes and ponds and play an important role in the global carbon c cycle colas et al 2020 webb et al 2019 however recent estimates of co2 emissions from global reservoirs are highly uncertain partly due to the difficulty in representing the spatial and temporal variability of co2 emissions from hard water reservoirs under different climates deemer et al 2016 finlay et al 2019 prairie et al 2018 prior studies on reservoir co2 emissions focused primarily on tropical and boreal soft water reservoirs demarty et al 2009 finlay et al 2015 guérin et al 2007 teodoru et al 2012 these reservoirs receive substantial inputs of terrestrial organic matter from their catchments with biological metabolism being the primary regulator in comparison relatively little is known about co2 emissions from hard water alkaline reservoirs which are numerous in dry environments they are characterized by strong evaporation and are largely influenced by groundwater inflow their co2 dynamics are not completely understood despite that alkaline reservoirs are globally abundant and serve as important carbon sources for the atmosphere as soft water reservoirs knoll et al 2013 rodriguez and casper 2018 these alkaline reservoirs have elevated dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations relative to soft water systems and show distinctly different carbon cycling processes finlay et al 2019 recent studies indicate that the magnitude of co2 fluxes in hard water systems is potentially driven by hydrological inputs of dic rather than by internal metabolism finlay et al 2015 stets et al 2009 a mechanistic understanding of the carbon processing of alkaline reservoirs and co2 emissions from them is essential to quantify their contribution to the global carbon budget outgassing of co2 from reservoir systems is regulated by multiple biotic processes e g respiration and photosynthesis and abiotic controls e g wind speed rainfall and solar radiation schneider et al 2020 webb et al 2019 the extent to which these factors affect co2 dynamics varies over different temporal scales some studies addressed temporal changes in dissolved co2 concentrations and subsequent emission using limited monitoring data or empirical models associated with uncertainty e g morales pineda et al 2014 spafford and risk 2018 accumulating evidence has suggested that co2 dynamics in reservoirs show pronounced diel patterns resulting from a combination of biological processes e g diel cycles of metabolic balance and short term hydrodynamic controls e g nighttime convection gomez gener et al 2021 xu et al 2019 yet previous measurements of reservoir co2 emissions have mostly been performed during the daytime which provide only a snapshot of the emission and cannot reflect its pattern over 24 h periods the upscaling of these daytime measurements for flux estimation would cause significant errors existing studies on diel variations in co2 emissions from reservoirs especially from hard water reservoirs are scarce and provide a limited understanding of diurnal nocturnal variability liu et al 2016 morales pineda et al 2014 although small lentic systems are disproportionately active with respect to carbon cycling because of their small flooded areas and high perimeter to surface area ratios the impacts of biotic and abiotic factors on their co2 emissions remain poorly understood holgerson and raymond 2016 prairie et al 2018 in this study we performed high resolution co2 flux measurements at a small hard water reservoir on the chinese loess plateau to examine its co2 emissions approximately 55 000 check dams with reservoir sizes ranging from 0 0001 to 30 km2 were constructed on the semiarid chinese loess plateau to reduce sediment loss wang et al 2016 while these reservoirs may have emitted large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere the magnitude of co2 emissions and the drivers involved remain unclear the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the seasonal and diel variability of reservoir co2 emissions and 2 explore the environmental controls on co2 partial pressure pco2 and co2 emissions we hypothesized that this hard water reservoir would be a net source of co2 with significant temporal seasonal and diel variability and that its drivers may differ from those observed in soft water lentic systems in which bacterial metabolism of allochthonous organic matter is typically the primary regulatory mechanism knoll et al 2013 webb et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the semiarid nangou catchment 36 54 n 36 59 n 108 23 e 108 26 e with an area of 11 km2 on the central chinese loess plateau fig 1 the region has a semiarid continental climate and the mean annual precipitation is only 450 mm over 75 of the precipitation occurs in the rainy season starting from june to september liu et al 2017 the geology of the catchment is dominated by quaternary loess and loess like deposits that are rich in carbonate minerals qu et al 2020 ran et al 2017 owing to the high erodibility of the loess deposits this catchment shows intense soil erosion which is a feature widely observed on the chinese loess plateau qu et al 2020 the vegetation cover in this catchment is sparse at 5 of the catchment area and the major land use type is dryland agriculture 68 of the catchment area the nangou reservoir 1461 m a s l was built at the catchment outlet in 1968 for trapping sediments and controlling soil erosion fig 1 as such its dam was designed without sluice gates the dam is 8 5 m high but the average water depth is only 1 7 m now maximum depth 2 4 m due to continuous accumulation of sediments the maximum water surface area is approximately 0 3 km2 in summer with an average depth of 1 9 m and the reservoir is ice covered from late november to mid march the reservoir water is clear throughout the year except during flooding when large quantities of sediment are discharged into the reservoir 2 2 field sampling and laboratory analysis to evaluate the seasonal and diel variations in co2 emissions in the nangou reservoir five sampling campaigns were performed in 2019 ice thaw march 14 19 spring may 22 27 summer july 5 10 and august 26 31 and autumn october 14 19 the first campaign in march 2019 was conducted two days after the ice started to thaw in each campaign the sampling started from 15 00 on the first day and ended at 12 00 noon on the last day the period from 09 00 to 18 00 was defined as daytime and the period from 21 00 to 06 00 of the next day as nighttime surface water pco2 and co2 emissions were measured in the middle of the reservoir fig 1 at 3 h intervals over five days in total we collected 200 measurements over the five campaigns furthermore vertical changes in pco2 and dissolved oxygen do in the water column were measured during the last three campaigns water at 50 cm intervals until the bottom was collected using a water sampler for analysis co2 emission was measured using a circular floating chamber surface area 0 08 m2 volume 17 1 l the freely drifting floating chamber was covered with reflective aluminum foil to reduce solar heating and the chamber edges extended 2 cm into the water to minimize artificial disruptions to near surface turbulence ran et al 2017 ran et al 2020 an infrared licor 850 co2 h2o gas analyzer licor inc usa was connected to the chamber deployed on the water surface through rubber polymer tubes to monitor co2 concentration inside it over time readings on the licor 850 gas analyzer were automatically recorded at 1 s intervals for 6 8 min to achieve a linear regression the licor 850 gas analyzer was calibrated daily using two standards with different co2 mixing ratios 500 and 2000 ppm we performed replicate deployments of the floating chamber to check for variability 5 for each co2 emission measurement we also determined the concurrent surface water pco2 using the headspace equilibrium technique müller et al 2015 ran et al 2017 we sampled 200 ml of water in a 400 ml conical flask with the remaining 200 ml filled with ambient air the flask was immediately closed with a lid and vigorously shaken for 2 min to equilibrate the gases in water and air then the equilibrated gas was connected to the licor 850 gas analyzer for co2 concentration measurements repeatability of triplicate surface water pco2 measurements was better than 2 the original surface water pco2 was finally calculated using the solubility constants for co2 from weiss 1974 and the headspace ratio headspace volume water volume during the last three campaigns using the headspace equilibrium technique the pco2 in the water column was measured to examine its spatial variability within a single system water samples 600 ml collected for the measurement of dissolved organic carbon doc and dic were filtered using 47 mm whatman gf f filters pore size 0 7 µm and stored at 4 c for laboratory analysis total alkalinity of the water was determined within 2 h of sampling by titration using 0 1 m hcl with methyl orange as the indicator the dic concentration was calculated from the

calibrated prior to measurement using standard buffers ph 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 the precisions of ph tw do and tds were 0 01 units 0 1 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 respectively the wind speed 2 m above the water surface was determined using a kestrel 1000 handheld anemometer kestrelinstruments boothwyn pa usa and corrected to a height of 10 m using the equation from alin et al 2011 rainfall information was retrieved from a weather station located 15 km southwest of the study site https www cma gov cn 2 3 determination of co2 emissions and statistical analyses the areal co2 emission f co2 was calculated

podgrajsek et al 2015 using the field measured f co2 the k value was back calculated using the following equation 2 k f c o 2 k h δ p c o 2 where kh is henry s constant for co2 at a given temperature and δpco2 is the difference between surface water pco2 and ambient air pco2 the k results were normalized to a schmidt number of 600 k600 to characterize co2 transfer at 20 c 2 4 statistical analyses analyses of the temporal variations of the environmental factors and co2 emissions were based on one way analysis of variance anova and mann whitneytests using spss v25 the normality of the data was examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test and if necessary data were normalized with thebox cox transformation method also in spss v25 whenever the anova test showed a significant difference α 0 05 among the means over different months or in the day night cycle different letters were used to indicate the differences in addition the relationships between pco2 and the environmental factors were estimated using generalized linear models glms using spss v25 the glm approach provides a flexible and rigorous formal framework to distinguish between possible predictor variables and responses 3

the year with the chl a ranging from 2 57 to 27 93 µg l 1 the average concentrations of chl a during the five seasons were 5 14 6 71 12 63 10 07 and 7 56 µg l 1 chl a showed a significant seasonal pattern p 0 05 with the highest values observed in summer july and august and the lowest in march table 1 and fig 2 the reservoir water had extremely high dic concentrations 69 4 99 7 mg l 1 with significant seasonal variations p 0 05 fig 2 the mean dic was 80 3 9 1 mg l 1 which was approximately 10 times that of the doc concentration table 1 in contrast to the seasonal variability all the environmental factors did not show a significant diel fluctuation p 0 05 except for tw in august which was substantially higher during the daytime p 0 05 fig 2 dissolved oxygen in the reservoir exhibited a clear diel cycle throughout the study period fig 3 do levels were the lowest during the early morning hours and highest between 15 00 and 18 00 3 2 temporal variability of pco2 and co2 emissions the pco2 varied from 1076 to 4587 μatm and exhibited pronounced seasonal variations fig 4 a and supplementary dataset the average pco2 values were 3369 573 1326 126 2394 305 2451 355 and 1660 174 μatm in march may july august and october respectively amounting to an average of 2240 788 μatm over the entire study period the highest pco2 was observed in march which was significantly higher than that in the other months p 0 05 mann whitney test while the lowest pco2 was measured in may 1076 1606 μatm the pco2 values in july and august were of a similar magnitude p 0 05 mann whitney test but considerably higher than that in october p 0 01 mann whitney test overall the surface water pco2 during the ice thaw period was on average 42 higher than that in the ice free period fig 4a the pco2 showed a consistent diurnal nocturnal pattern during all the five campaigns fig 4a the daytime pco2 was 6 13 lower than the nighttime pco2 the largest diurnal nocturnal variation was observed in august with a significant difference of 294 µatm p 0 05 mann whitney test whereas the lowest diurnal nocturnal variation was in may 75 µatm difference during the ice thaw period march the diurnal pco2 was on average 280 µatm lower than the nocturnal pco2 the lowest pco2 typically occurred at 15 00 or 18 00 while the highest was at 3 00 the seasonal pattern of the co2 emissions was different from that of the surface water pco2 fig 4b the average f co2 values in march 808 209 mg c m 2 d 1 and may 932 286 mg c m 2 d 1 were significantly higher than those in october 583 141 mg c m

average f co2 during the ice thaw period march was 8 higher than the average f co2 during the ice free period 748 262 mg c m 2 d 1 the f co2 values during the nighttime were 3 25 higher than those during the daytime in march may july and october fig 4b the largest diurnal nocturnal amplitude 25 was observed in march however the f co2 in august showed a contrasting diel variability with the daytime value being higher than that of the nighttime by 183 mg c m 2 d 1 23 this is inconsistent with the diurnal nocturnal pattern of the concurrent pco2 fig 4a high co2 effluxes i e 1200 mg c m 2 d 1 were observed in may and august but there was no detectable diel trend in these high f co2 values supplementary dataset overall the lowest f co2 was observed at 15 00 or 18 00 and the highest at 3 00 or 6 00 as an important driver of f co2 k600 varied from 1 3 to 19 3 cm h 1 with all the high k600 values 7 cm h 1 occurring in may mean 9 3 3 2 cm h 1 in comparison the average k600 in march july august and october was only 2 3 0 5 3 6 0 9 3 0 1 2 and 4 0 0 9 cm h 1 respectively 3 3 relationships of pco2 and f co2 with environmental factors the glm results indicated that surface water pco2 was influced by environmental factors but the responses differed significantly during different campaigns variations in pco2 during the five sampling campaigns were primarily related to biogeochemical indicators such as ph do chl a and doc table 2 among the six factors considered here dic was the only environmental driver that exhibited a positive control on co2 concentrations during all the five campaigns table 2 the trends in the relationships between pco2 and chl a doc and tw during the ice thaw season march were different from those in the ice free season i e may july august and october table 2 in particular the surface water pco2 showed a positive correlation with chl a in march but a negative correlation with chl a in the remaining campaigns especially in july and august p 0 01 overall pco2 showed a significant negative correlation with ph do and chl a p 0 01 and a positive correlation with dic supplementary table s1 moreover pco2 was negatively correlated with doc concentrations supplementary table s1 the glm results showed that 86 1 of the variance in pco2 was estimated by six predictors table 3 presents the overall relationship between f co2 and the environmental drivers during the entire study period the f co2 was significantly related to wind speed p 0 01 but there was no statistically significant relationship between f co2 and pco2 r 0 11 p 0

correlated with chl a table 3 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls on pco2 the substantially higher pco2 during the ice thaw period march was partially caused by accumulation of elevated respiratory derived co2 under ice we found a significant relationship between pco2 of march and chl a of august r 0 34 p 0 05 which provides evidence of legacy effects finlay et al 2019 large quantities of dissolved co2 were derived from the microbial metabolism of organic matter produced in the previous summer which is consistent with recent results observed in lakes denfeld et al 2016 macintyre et al 2018 stets et al 2009 the paired o2 co2 dynamics in march along the 1 1 line supplementary text s1 and fig s1 also suggested that the aquatic metabolism is probably an important driver of pco2 vachon et al 2020 the significant negative correlation between pco2 and do in march further indicated the contribution of metabolism by decomposing doc which showed a negative relationship with pco2 table 2 in addition the hypoxic conditions during winter table 1 is likely to have caused the accumulation of large amounts of methane ch4 under ice karlsson et al 2013 webb et al 2019 and the oxidation of ch4 may have contributed to the high pco2 during the ice thaw period however the paired o2 co2 departure cloud for march was significantly away from the 1 1 axis that represents aquatic metabolic activity supplementary fig s1 this reflects substantial contributions of external inputs of soil co2 through snowmelt flow or groundwater in sustaining high pco2 which aligns with the observed patterns in boreal landscapes tranvik et al 2009 vachon et al 2020 in comparison the negative correlation between pco2 and chl a during the ice free period particularly in summer july and august p 0 01 indicated the potential control of aquatic productivity this resulted in lower pco2 levels due to algal photosynthesis and higher doc contents in summer than in the other seasons table 1 the paired o2 co2 cloud departures in july and august approximately coincided with the 1 1 line supplementary fig s1 this further corroborated the control of phytoplankton uptake in modulating pco2 as is widely observed in autotrophic lentic systems mcdonald et al 2013 vachon et al 2020 yang et al 2015 nevertheless the relatively high pco2 in summer relative to spring and autumn fig 4a is different from that observed in soft water systems which typically show low pco2 in summer halbedel and koschorreck 2013 in the nangou reservoir the pco2 showed a strong positive correlation with dic and a weak response to proxies of planktonic metabolism doc and chl a table 2 this is probably due to the predominance of dic which accounts for 90 of the dissolved carbon the high alkalinity mean 6688 754 μmol l 1 of the water tended to create a strong carbonate buffering effect together with the simultaneous decrease in ph table 1 this carbonate buffering sustained continuous co2 oversaturation stets et al 2017 which coincides with the high explanatory power of dic 61 in regulating pco2 in contrast the combined autochthonous and allochthonous doc can only explain 1 of the pco2 variability for the ice free period it appears that on an annual basis the pco2 in the nangou reservoir was not as strongly linked to aquatic metabolism as in soft water reservoirs hanson et al 2003 mcdonald et al 2013 this can also be seen from the much stronger deviation of the paired o2 co2 departures away from the 1 1 line in the ice free period especially in october supplementary fig s1 clearly the finding here differs from recent observations in soft water low alkalinity ecosystems amaral et al 2018 the loading of dic largely from groundwater ran et al 2017 ran et al 2021 appears to be the dominant control on the seasonal pco2 changes in this semiarid reservoir future work is needed to quantitatively investigate the impact of groundwater derived dic inputs viewed in terms of the diel cycle the constantly lower diurnal pco2 fig 4a suggested a universal mechanism in regulating the diel pattern in contrast to humid and temperate reservoirs which show a pronounced seasonality in terrestrial inputs of organic carbon and or soil co2 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 webb et al 2019 external carbon in this semiarid reservoir is mostly derived from groundwater because of the small catchment size and short travel time of groundwater it is anticipated that the stable groundwater inflow was unlikely to have caused the significant diurnal nocturnal pattern as implied by the largely equal dic concentrations between the day night cycles and throughout the year fig 2f we hypothesize that the diurnal nocturnal variations were driven by autotrophic processes of the negative balance between plankton photosynthesis and community respiration in the water column the reduced pco2 during the daytime fig 4a was accompanied by an increase in water temperature fig 2b and stronger solar radiation both of which are related to enhanced photosynthesis bevelhimer et al 2016 spafford and risk 2018 this is further evidenced by the concurrent increase in do and chl a during the daytime fig 2c and d the nocturnal pco2 dynamics could be attributed to co2 production from planktonic and sedimentary bacterial respiration during nighttime amaral et al 2018 yang et al 2019 as a direct proxy of microbial respiration the declining do at night fig 3 indicated that organic matter was progressively consumed for co2 production amaral et al 2018 however there was no discernible difference in doc within the day night cycles p 0 05 and the nighttime doc concentrations were even somewhat higher in march and may fig 2e this suggests that direct co2 production via respiration probably played a minor role in mediating the higher nocturnal pco2 fig 4a the nangou reservoir trapped large quantities of particulate carbon that originated from the surrounding agricultural land sediment respiration of particulate carbon caused the buildup of co2 in the hypolimnion fig 5 especially during the ice cover period finlay et al 2019 the pco2 was consistently 15 53 higher at the reservoir bottom 200 220 cm than in the surface water 0 50 cm and the do declined quickly in response to the metabolic effects at the reservoir bottom fig 5 although the vertical δpco2 in this shallow reservoir is not as apparent as in deep lentic systems halbedel and koschorreck 2013 morales pineda et al 2014 nighttime cooling of the surface water can induce upwelling of deep co2 rich water the shallow water mean depth 1 7 m only also facilitates a rapid and full convective mixing thereby increasing the surface water pco2 as widely observed in small lakes e g åberg et al 2010 brothers et al 2017 4 2 drivers of seasonal and diel co2 emissions our high resolution data suggest that the nangou reservoir is exclusively a net co2 source to the atmosphere the magnitude of f co2 is collectively controlled by the pco2 gradient at the water air interface and the efficiency of gas transfer macintyre et al 2018 podgrajsek et al 2015 the high effluxes during the ice thaw period march were primarily driven by the high surface water pco2 fig 4 although the corresponding k600 1 5 3 3 cm h 1 was the lowest among the five campaigns on the other hand for the high f co2 in may it appears that the significantly higher k600 4 7 19 3 cm h 1 played a dominant role because of the small pco2 gradient across the water air interface fig 4 in contrast the magnitude of f co2 in summer was largely regulated by pco2 because of the comparable k600 whereas a slightly higher k600 in autumn reduced the f co2 differences between summer and autumn on a daily scale the diel f co2 pattern demonstrated pco2 changes which in return reveal the diel variations in photosynthesis respiration ratios fig 4 the higher nighttime effluxes except in august were related to the metabolic activity of aquatic ecosystems which resulted in the higher pco2 this is in line with previous diel variability of co2 flux in freshwater systems podgrajsek et al 2015 rocher ros et al 2020 the diel cycles of do and chl a fig 2c and d reflect the dominance of primary production during daytime and respiration during nighttime morales pineda et al 2014 moreover enhanced convective mixing due to nighttime surface water cooling can augment co2 emissions jonsson et al 2008 spafford and risk 2018 this is highly possible for the nangou reservoir with an average water depth of 1 7 m as discussed above the produced co2 at the reservoir bottom via respiration as shown in fig 5 could be easily entrained to the surface and led to a higher nocturnal f co2 liu et al 2016 this can also partially explain the largest diurnal nocturnal f co2 amplitude in march fig 4b which also registered the largest diel water temperature change 10 and thus the strongest nighttime cooling effect however we noted that episodic weather events can significantly disturb the diurnal nocturnal pattern lynch et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 several high wind and rainfall events were observed during august 28 30 fig 6 which generated pulses of high co2 emissions and eventually caused the inconsistent diurnal nocturnal pattern of f co2 in august fig 4b because the metabolic indicators e g do and chl a showed consistent diel cycles over the five campaigns figs 2 and 3 the higher diurnal f co2 indicated that metabolism was not likely to be a key driver of co2 emissions this was also confirmed by the weak relationship between do and f co2 although surface water pco2 displayed a significant negative correlation with do p 0 05 supplementary fig s2 an alternative explanation is that high effluxes occur during strong winds or rainfall events cole and caraco 1998 zappa et al 2007 recent laboratory experiments and field measurements indicate that raindrops can enhance turbulent mixing and water air gas exchange with their effect comparable to that of moderate winds zappa et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 studies have also suggested that enhanced hydrological inputs of terrestrial co2 to the reservoir during rainfall events may increase the co2 pool thus leading to the higher emission rates ojala et al 2011 rantakari and kortelainen 2005 vachon and del giorgio 2014 the f co2 during the rainfall period 9 00 12 00 on august 28 and 9 00 15 00 on august 30 was 44 higher than that in the no rainfall period fig 6 furthermore the significant dependence of f co2 on wind speeds r2 0 51 p 0 001 but a lesser dependence on pco2 r2 0 01 p 0 05 suggested that the gas transfer velocity played a more important role than δpco2 in controlling the emission flux supplementary fig s2 if the high wind hours 9 00 12 00 and 18 00 on august 29 fig 6 were considered together the f co2 values during these weather events were 80 higher than those under normal conditions consequently the f co2 in august was on average 23 higher during the daytime than during the nighttime this clearly indicates the importance of capturing episodic weather events in examining the diurnal nocturnal pattern of co2 emissions and estimating the daily co2 efflux guérin et al 2007 spafford and risk 2018 taken all measurements together table 3 f co2 was only significantly correlated with wind speed p 0 01 and two water quality indicators chl a and doc p 0 05 for both wind speed has the highest explanatory power among all the potential drivers examined and explains 29 of the overall variability in f co2 table 3 this probably stresses the dominance of gas transfer velocity in determining the magnitude of co2 emission rates because of the considerable co2 oversaturation 3 11 times that of atmospheric equilibrium in the nangou reservoir it is reasonable to conclude that its co2 emissions were not supply limited i e controlled by co2 availability instead the f co2 depended more on the gas transfer velocity and appeared to be transport limited i e controlled by near surface turbulence as suggested by recent findings from flowing streams schneider et al 2020 the negative response of f co2 to concurrent chl a and doc indicated the diel pattern of metabolism as discussed above and as observed in other studies amaral et al 2018 yang et al 2019 4 3 comparison with other reservoirs although the nangou reservoir is 51 years old our measurements indicate that it remains an important hotspot for co2 emission its surface water pco2 and f co2 values are similar to those reported from semiarid temperate and boreal reservoirs but they are marginally lower than those observed in sub tropical reservoirs table 4 this reveals the spatial variations in the availability of decomposable organic matter and co2 sources deemer et al 2016 sediments on the chinese loess plateau are characterized by low and highly refractory organic carbon and over the past decades proactive soil conservation has substantially reduced terrestrial organic carbon inputs into the reservoir qu et al 2020 yu et al 2019 therefore its seasonal co2 emissions were more likely sustained by the high dic loading like those reported in karst reservoirs pu et al 2020 wang et al 2011 while the diel cycle was mediated by the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems it is also noteworthy that the average f co2 from the nangou reservoir is significantly higher than our earlier observations in the chinese loess plateau i e wanggedu and hekoumiao table 4 this large flux difference is probably because our earlier measurements were conducted only during the daytime when the aquatic ecosystems displayed the strongest photosynthesis and accordingly caused the lowest co2 effluxes ran et al 2017 in comparison tropical reservoirs are typically surrounded by forest soils and peatlands with high terrestrial inputs of organic matter coupled with warmer ambient temperatures mineralization of these organic matter is the primary mechanism controlling their high co2 effluxes almeida et al 2016 pu et al 2020 finally the f co2 rates from our study reservoir were much higher than the global average measured from reservoirs lakes and ponds table 4 this further underscores the need to include semiarid reservoirs to correctly estimate the global co2 emission flux rodriguez and casper 2018 varol 2019 previous research has shown that reservoir age determines the co2 effluxes colas et al 2020 teodoru et al 2012 young reservoirs with newly flooded organic matter e g dead trees tend to degas more co2 and the rate declines exponentially over time and finally stabilizes after 15 years teodoru et al 2012 although we cannot examine the interannual changes of co2 efflux for the nangou reservoir comparing it with the geographically similar but younger wanggedu and hekoumiao reservoirs indicates that the efflux age relationship is not applicable for hard water reservoirs table 4 for example if the diurnal co2 emission data alone were used the f co2 values in the nangou reservoir were still 52 68 higher than those from the younger ones this is likely because the co2 emissions in this reservoir are more strongly associated with dic than doc which is in agreement with previous findings that dic inputs are critical in regulating co2 dynamics in hard water systems finlay et al 2009 this differs from soft water reservoirs where the decomposition of organic matter is the major source of dissolved co2 in contrast our results suggest that hard water reservoirs are co2 sources despite being net autotrophic knoll et al 2013 4 4 implications for the estimation of annual co2 emissions previous estimates of co2 emissions from inland waters often rely on sampling during the daytime and involve a simple extrapolation over an entire year e g deemer et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 our study explicitly indicated that measurements of co2 efflux from reservoirs at low temporal resolutions may cause considerable flux biases if we had sampled only at 15 00 each day the daily co2 efflux for the nangou reservoir would have been underestimated by 9 25 on a 5 d basis and the maximum bias could have been 56 the measurement of co2 emission involving diel variability plays a critical role in quantifying daily and annual co2 effluxes gomez gener et al 2021 yang et al 2019 for soft water systems where the diel co2 variability is primarily controlled by the day night cycles of metabolic activity the amplitude of f co2 variation and thus the estimation bias would have been even larger podgrajsek et al 2015 yang et al 2019 for example liu et al 2016 reported a 70 higher nocturnal co2 efflux compared to the daytime efflux in the ross barnett reservoir in central mississippi thus future sampling schemes must consider this diel variability to refine the estimation accuracy of daily carbon emissions from reservoirs or other lentic systems because the measurements were performed only at one site fig 1 the obtained f co2 and k results may have not reflected the spatial heterogeneity in co2 emissions from the entire reservoir given the small and shallow reservoir with potentially full mixing however it is reasonable to postulate that the spatial variations in both f co2 and k are likely small until recently carbon emissions from inland waters during the ice melting period have been largely overlooked we also noted the importance of co2 emissions during the ice thaw period for estimating the annual co2 efflux as a result of sediment respiration in winter the nangou reservoir may have accumulated large quantities of co2 under ice or within the ice as co2 bubbles this subsequently resulted in strong emissions during the ice thaw period when the reservoir system was reconnected with the atmosphere fig 4 a conservative estimate shows that the co2 emitted during the ice thaw period 1 week accounts for 11 of the annual flux this contribution is comparable to those found in arctic boreal and temporal lakes where co2 emissions during ice thaw equaled 12 55 of the annual flux denfeld et al 2018 our study suggests that the annual carbon flux will be significantly underestimated if sampling is biased towards the ice free season as the strong emissions during the ice thaw period will not be captured this sampling bias is particularly problematic for boreal and high altitude lentic systems that tend to have a longer ice cover and higher doc loads denfeld et al 2016 knoll et al 2013 accordingly the co2 emissions during the ice thaw period will be of greater significance on an annual scale in conjunction with the diel cycle we conclude that future sampling for upscaling the estimation of the annual carbon budget needs to account for these seasonal and diel variations 5 conclusions our study shows that a semiarid reservoir can be comparatively important for carbon cycling as it shows a high co2 emission rate dic inputs via groundwater plays a central role in sustaining surface water pco2 and regulating its seasonal variability in the hard water nangou reservoir which is characterized by high alkalinity metabolism of aquatic ecosystems is likely to regulate the diel pco2 changes which show a 6 13 difference within a 24 h time span although the nangou reservoir is moderately to highly productive it acts as a net co2 source this confirms previous findings that suggest that productive waters are not necessarily co2 sinks in combination with high resolution spatiotemporal sampling within the single system this study addresses the temporal variations in co2 emissions which were previously found to be greater than their spatial variations the co2 emission rates recorded in our study mean 761 mg c m 2 d 1 were found to be significantly higher than the global average f co2 from reservoirs given the global abundance of hard water lentic systems future studies should incorporate better estimates of co2 emissions from these water bodies to understand the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle the release of the accumulated co2 during ice thaw represents an important pathway of co2 emissions on an annual scale furthermore the efflux of co2 exhibits a clear diel cycle with typically higher f co2 values during the nighttime because of the concurrently higher pco2 however episodic weather events such as rainfall and strong winds were found to significantly enhance co2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern our data highlight the need for future sampling to integrate full seasonal and diel variations excluding such variations may create a large bias in

3528,reservoirs represent a key component of the global carbon cycle however estimates of carbon dioxide co2 emissions from reservoirs remain poorly constrained due to the absence of spatially and temporally resolved measurements we performed high resolution monitoring of co2 emissions f co2 in a semiarid hard water reservoir to examine its seasonal and diel variability our results suggest that dissolved inorganic carbon input plays a central role in sustaining the surface water co2 partial pressure pco2 which varies from 1076 to 4587 μatm although the reservoir is moderately to highly productive throughout the year it is a net co2 source with f co2 values in the range of 308 1753 mg c m 2 d 1 this high co2 efflux indicates that productive waters are not necessarily co2 sinks both pco2 and f co2 exhibit clear seasonal and diel patterns surface water pco2 is highest in march and presents a consistent diurnal nocturnal pattern with the daytime pco2 6 13 lower than the nighttime pco2 high co2 efflux is observed during the ice thaw period indicating the release of co2 that was accumulated during the winter co2 effluxes are typically higher during the nighttime driven by aquatic metabolism but episodic weather events e g rainfall and strong winds can significantly enhance co2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern our study also shows that using only daytime measurements to estimate daily co2 emissions would underestimate it by 9 25 hence future global assessments should incorporate co2 emissions from hard water reservoirs and account for their seasonal and diel variability keywords co2 emissions co2 partial pressure pco2 seasonal and diel variability hard water reservoir chinese loess plateau 1 introduction artificial reservoirs created by dams have different properties from natural systems e g lakes and ponds and play an important role in the global carbon c cycle colas et al 2020 webb et al 2019 however recent estimates of co2 emissions from global reservoirs are highly uncertain partly due to the difficulty in representing the spatial and temporal variability of co2 emissions from hard water reservoirs under different climates deemer et al 2016 finlay et al 2019 prairie et al 2018 prior studies on reservoir co2 emissions focused primarily on tropical and boreal soft water reservoirs demarty et al 2009 finlay et al 2015 guérin et al 2007 teodoru et al 2012 these reservoirs receive substantial inputs of terrestrial organic matter from their catchments with biological metabolism being the primary regulator in comparison relatively little is known about co2 emissions from hard water alkaline reservoirs which are numerous in dry environments they are characterized by strong evaporation and are largely influenced by groundwater inflow their co2 dynamics are not completely understood despite that alkaline reservoirs are globally abundant and serve as important carbon sources for the atmosphere as soft water reservoirs knoll et al 2013 rodriguez and casper 2018 these alkaline reservoirs have elevated dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations relative to soft water systems and show distinctly different carbon cycling processes finlay et al 2019 recent studies indicate that the magnitude of co2 fluxes in hard water systems is potentially driven by hydrological inputs of dic rather than by internal metabolism finlay et al 2015 stets et al 2009 a mechanistic understanding of the carbon processing of alkaline reservoirs and co2 emissions from them is essential to quantify their contribution to the global carbon budget outgassing of co2 from reservoir systems is regulated by multiple biotic processes e g respiration and photosynthesis and abiotic controls e g wind speed rainfall and solar radiation schneider et al 2020 webb et al 2019 the extent to which these factors affect co2 dynamics varies over different temporal scales some studies addressed temporal changes in dissolved co2 concentrations and subsequent emission using limited monitoring data or empirical models associated with uncertainty e g morales pineda et al 2014 spafford and risk 2018 accumulating evidence has suggested that co2 dynamics in reservoirs show pronounced diel patterns resulting from a combination of biological processes e g diel cycles of metabolic balance and short term hydrodynamic controls e g nighttime convection gomez gener et al 2021 xu et al 2019 yet previous measurements of reservoir co2 emissions have mostly been performed during the daytime which provide only a snapshot of the emission and cannot reflect its pattern over 24 h periods the upscaling of these daytime measurements for flux estimation would cause significant errors existing studies on diel variations in co2 emissions from reservoirs especially from hard water reservoirs are scarce and provide a limited understanding of diurnal nocturnal variability liu et al 2016 morales pineda et al 2014 although small lentic systems are disproportionately active with respect to carbon cycling because of their small flooded areas and high perimeter to surface area ratios the impacts of biotic and abiotic factors on their co2 emissions remain poorly understood holgerson and raymond 2016 prairie et al 2018 in this study we performed high resolution co2 flux measurements at a small hard water reservoir on the chinese loess plateau to examine its co2 emissions approximately 55 000 check dams with reservoir sizes ranging from 0 0001 to 30 km2 were constructed on the semiarid chinese loess plateau to reduce sediment loss wang et al 2016 while these reservoirs may have emitted large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere the magnitude of co2 emissions and the drivers involved remain unclear the objectives of this study were to 1 identify the seasonal and diel variability of reservoir co2 emissions and 2 explore the environmental controls on co2 partial pressure pco2 and co2 emissions we hypothesized that this hard water reservoir would be a net source of co2 with significant temporal seasonal and diel variability and that its drivers may differ from those observed in soft water lentic systems in which bacterial metabolism of allochthonous organic matter is typically the primary regulatory mechanism knoll et al 2013 webb et al 2019 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the semiarid nangou catchment 36 54 n 36 59 n 108 23 e 108 26 e with an area of 11 km2 on the central chinese loess plateau fig 1 the region has a semiarid continental climate and the mean annual precipitation is only 450 mm over 75 of the precipitation occurs in the rainy season starting from june to september liu et al 2017 the geology of the catchment is dominated by quaternary loess and loess like deposits that are rich in carbonate minerals qu et al 2020 ran et al 2017 owing to the high erodibility of the loess deposits this catchment shows intense soil erosion which is a feature widely observed on the chinese loess plateau qu et al 2020 the vegetation cover in this catchment is sparse at 5 of the catchment area and the major land use type is dryland agriculture 68 of the catchment area the nangou reservoir 1461 m a s l was built at the catchment outlet in 1968 for trapping sediments and controlling soil erosion fig 1 as such its dam was designed without sluice gates the dam is 8 5 m high but the average water depth is only 1 7 m now maximum depth 2 4 m due to continuous accumulation of sediments the maximum water surface area is approximately 0 3 km2 in summer with an average depth of 1 9 m and the reservoir is ice covered from late november to mid march the reservoir water is clear throughout the year except during flooding when large quantities of sediment are discharged into the reservoir 2 2 field sampling and laboratory analysis to evaluate the seasonal and diel variations in co2 emissions in the nangou reservoir five sampling campaigns were performed in 2019 ice thaw march 14 19 spring may 22 27 summer july 5 10 and august 26 31 and autumn october 14 19 the first campaign in march 2019 was conducted two days after the ice started to thaw in each campaign the sampling started from 15 00 on the first day and ended at 12 00 noon on the last day the period from 09 00 to 18 00 was defined as daytime and the period from 21 00 to 06 00 of the next day as nighttime surface water pco2 and co2 emissions were measured in the middle of the reservoir fig 1 at 3 h intervals over five days in total we collected 200 measurements over the five campaigns furthermore vertical changes in pco2 and dissolved oxygen do in the water column were measured during the last three campaigns water at 50 cm intervals until the bottom was collected using a water sampler for analysis co2 emission was measured using a circular floating chamber surface area 0 08 m2 volume 17 1 l the freely drifting floating chamber was covered with reflective aluminum foil to reduce solar heating and the chamber edges extended 2 cm into the water to minimize artificial disruptions to near surface turbulence ran et al 2017 ran et al 2020 an infrared licor 850 co2 h2o gas analyzer licor inc usa was connected to the chamber deployed on the water surface through rubber polymer tubes to monitor co2 concentration inside it over time readings on the licor 850 gas analyzer were automatically recorded at 1 s intervals for 6 8 min to achieve a linear regression the licor 850 gas analyzer was calibrated daily using two standards with different co2 mixing ratios 500 and 2000 ppm we performed replicate deployments of the floating chamber to check for variability 5 for each co2 emission measurement we also determined the concurrent surface water pco2 using the headspace equilibrium technique müller et al 2015 ran et al 2017 we sampled 200 ml of water in a 400 ml conical flask with the remaining 200 ml filled with ambient air the flask was immediately closed with a lid and vigorously shaken for 2 min to equilibrate the gases in water and air then the equilibrated gas was connected to the licor 850 gas analyzer for co2 concentration measurements repeatability of triplicate surface water pco2 measurements was better than 2 the original surface water pco2 was finally calculated using the solubility constants for co2 from weiss 1974 and the headspace ratio headspace volume water volume during the last three campaigns using the headspace equilibrium technique the pco2 in the water column was measured to examine its spatial variability

calibrated prior to measurement using standard buffers ph 4 01 7 00 and 10 01 the precisions of ph tw do and tds were 0 01 units 0 1 0 5 and 5 mg l 1 respectively the wind speed 2 m above the water surface was determined using a kestrel 1000 handheld anemometer kestrelinstruments boothwyn pa usa and corrected to a height of 10 m using the equation from alin et al 2011 rainfall information was

analyses of the temporal variations of the environmental factors and co2 emissions were based on one way analysis of variance anova and mann whitneytests using spss v25 the normality of the data was examined using the kolmogorov smirnov test and if necessary data were normalized with thebox cox transformation method also in spss v25 whenever the anova test showed a significant difference α 0 05 among the means over different months or in the day night cycle different letters were used to indicate the differences in addition the relationships between pco2 and the environmental factors were estimated using generalized linear models glms using spss v25 the glm approach provides a flexible and rigorous formal framework to distinguish between possible predictor variables and responses 3

8 to 26 1 c with the lowest temperature observed during the ice thaw period march the air temperature ta ranged from 8 2 to 37 c the wind speed at the height of 2 m varied from 0 to 5 7 m s 1 strong winds were measured in march and may table 1 in contrast there were no discernible seasonal and diel variations in tds which ranged from 1178 to 1340 mg l 1 the reservoir water was undersaturated in oxygen for 95 of the measurements with the do content ranging from 51 5 to 105 table 1 the mean do concentrations were 82 9 91 7 87 9 79 3 and 65 1 in march may july august and october respectively the doc varied from 6 1 to 10 4 mg l 1 and the average doc concentration during the five seasons was 7 3 6 7 7 9 7 4 and 7 4 mg l 1 the nangou reservoir was moderately to highly productive throughout the year with the chl a ranging from 2 57 to 27 93 µg l 1 the average concentrations of chl a during the five seasons were 5 14 6 71 12 63 10 07 and 7 56 µg l 1 chl a showed a significant seasonal pattern p 0 05 with the highest values observed in summer july and august and the lowest in march table 1 and fig 2 the reservoir water had extremely high dic concentrations 69 4 99 7 mg l 1 with significant seasonal variations p 0 05 fig 2 the mean dic was 80 3 9 1 mg l 1 which was approximately 10 times that of the doc concentration table 1 in contrast to the seasonal variability all the environmental factors did not show a significant diel fluctuation p 0 05 except for tw in august which was substantially higher during the daytime p 0 05 fig 2 dissolved oxygen in the reservoir exhibited a clear diel cycle throughout the study period fig 3 do levels were the lowest during the early morning hours and highest between 15 00 and 18 00 3 2 temporal variability of pco2 and co2 emissions the pco2 varied from 1076 to 4587 μatm and exhibited pronounced seasonal variations fig 4 a and supplementary dataset the average pco2 values were 3369 573 1326 126 2394 305 2451 355 and 1660 174 μatm in march may july august and october respectively amounting to an average of 2240 788 μatm over the entire study period the highest pco2 was observed in march which was significantly higher than that in the other months p 0 05 mann whitney test while the lowest pco2 was measured in may 1076 1606 μatm the pco2 values in july and august were of a similar magnitude p 0 05 mann whitney test but considerably higher than that in october p 0 01 mann whitney test overall the surface water pco2 during the ice thaw period was on average 42 higher than that in the ice free period fig 4a the pco2 showed a consistent diurnal nocturnal pattern during all the five campaigns fig 4a the daytime pco2 was 6 13 lower than the nighttime pco2 the largest diurnal nocturnal variation was observed in august with a significant difference of 294 µatm p 0 05 mann whitney test whereas the lowest diurnal nocturnal variation was in may 75 µatm difference during the ice thaw period march the diurnal pco2 was on average 280 µatm lower than the nocturnal pco2 the lowest pco2 typically occurred at 15 00 or 18 00 while the highest was at 3 00 the seasonal pattern of the co2 emissions was different from that of the surface water pco2 fig 4b the average f co2 values in march 808 209 mg c m 2 d 1 and may 932 286 mg c m 2 d 1 were significantly higher than those in october 583 141 mg c m 2 d 1 p 0 01 mann whitney test the f co2 in summer ranged from 308 to 1578 mg c m 2 d 1 the average f co2 values in july and august were 789 159 and 690 288 mg c m 2 d 1 respectively overall the average f co2 during the ice thaw period march was 8 higher than the average f co2 during the ice free period 748 262 mg c m 2 d 1 the f co2 values during the nighttime were 3 25 higher than those during the daytime in march may july and october fig 4b the largest diurnal nocturnal amplitude 25 was observed in march however the f co2 in august showed a contrasting diel variability with the daytime value being higher than that of the nighttime by 183 mg c m 2 d 1 23 this is inconsistent with the diurnal nocturnal pattern of the concurrent pco2 fig 4a high co2 effluxes i e 1200 mg c m 2 d 1 were observed in may and august but there was no detectable diel trend in these high f co2 values supplementary dataset overall the lowest f co2 was observed at 15 00 or 18 00 and the highest at 3 00 or 6 00 as an important driver of f co2 k600 varied from 1 3 to 19 3 cm h 1 with all the high k600 values 7 cm h 1 occurring in may mean 9 3 3 2 cm h 1 in comparison the average k600 in march july august and october was only 2 3 0 5 3 6 0 9 3 0 1 2 and 4 0 0 9 cm h 1 respectively 3 3 relationships of pco2 and f co2 with environmental factors the glm results indicated that surface water pco2 was influced by environmental factors but the responses differed significantly during different campaigns variations in pco2 during the five sampling campaigns were primarily related to biogeochemical indicators such as ph do chl a and doc table 2 among the six factors considered here dic was the only environmental driver that exhibited a positive control on co2 concentrations during all the five campaigns table 2 the trends in the relationships between pco2 and chl a doc and tw during the ice thaw season march were different from those in the ice free season i e may july august and october table 2 in particular the surface water pco2 showed a positive correlation with chl a in march but a negative correlation with chl a in the remaining campaigns especially in july and august p 0 01 overall pco2 showed a significant negative correlation with ph do and chl a p 0 01 and a positive correlation with dic supplementary table s1 moreover pco2 was negatively correlated with doc concentrations supplementary table s1 the glm results showed that 86 1 of the variance in pco2 was estimated by six predictors table 3 presents the overall relationship between f co2 and the environmental drivers during the entire study period the f co2 was significantly related to wind speed p 0 01 but there was no statistically significant relationship between f co2 and pco2 r 0 11 p 0 05 not shown both do and chl a were positively related to tw p 0 01 the dic concentration showed a negative response to tw changes r 0 79 p 0 01 furthermore the doc concentration was positively correlated with chl a table 3 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls on pco2 the substantially higher pco2 during the ice thaw period march was partially caused by accumulation of elevated respiratory derived co2 under ice we found a significant relationship between pco2 of march and chl a of august r 0 34 p 0 05 which provides evidence of legacy effects finlay et al 2019 large quantities of dissolved co2 were derived from the microbial metabolism of organic matter produced in the previous summer which is consistent with recent results observed in lakes denfeld et al 2016 macintyre et al 2018 stets et al 2009 the paired o2 co2 dynamics in march along the 1 1 line supplementary text s1 and fig s1 also suggested that the aquatic metabolism is probably an important driver of pco2 vachon et al 2020 the significant negative correlation between pco2 and do in march further indicated the contribution of metabolism by decomposing doc which showed a negative relationship with pco2 table 2 in addition the hypoxic conditions during winter table 1 is likely to have caused the accumulation of large amounts of methane ch4 under ice karlsson et al 2013 webb et al 2019 and the oxidation of ch4 may have contributed to the high pco2 during the ice thaw period however the paired o2 co2 departure cloud for march was significantly away from the 1 1 axis that represents aquatic metabolic activity supplementary fig s1 this reflects substantial contributions of external inputs of soil co2 through snowmelt flow or groundwater in sustaining high pco2 which aligns with the observed patterns in boreal landscapes tranvik et al 2009 vachon et al 2020 in comparison the negative correlation between pco2 and chl a during the ice free period particularly in summer july and august p 0 01 indicated the potential control of aquatic productivity this resulted in lower pco2 levels due to algal photosynthesis and higher doc contents in summer than in the other seasons table 1 the paired o2 co2 cloud departures in july and august approximately coincided with the 1 1 line supplementary fig s1 this further corroborated the control of phytoplankton uptake in modulating pco2 as is widely observed in autotrophic lentic systems mcdonald et al 2013 vachon et al 2020 yang et al 2015 nevertheless the relatively high pco2 in summer relative to spring and autumn fig 4a is different from that observed in soft water systems which typically show low pco2 in summer halbedel and koschorreck 2013 in the nangou reservoir the pco2 showed a strong positive correlation with dic and a weak response to proxies of planktonic metabolism doc and chl a table 2 this is probably due to the predominance of dic which accounts for 90 of the dissolved carbon the high alkalinity mean 6688 754 μmol l 1 of the water tended to create a strong carbonate buffering effect together with the simultaneous decrease in ph table 1 this carbonate buffering sustained continuous co2 oversaturation stets et al 2017 which coincides with the high explanatory power of dic 61 in regulating pco2 in contrast the combined autochthonous and allochthonous doc can only explain 1 of the pco2 variability for the ice free period it appears that on an annual basis the pco2 in the nangou reservoir was not as strongly linked to aquatic metabolism as in soft water reservoirs hanson et al 2003 mcdonald et al 2013 this can also be seen from the much stronger deviation of the paired o2 co2 departures away from the 1 1 line in the ice free period especially in october supplementary fig s1 clearly the finding here differs from recent observations in soft water low alkalinity ecosystems amaral et al 2018 the loading of dic largely from groundwater ran et al 2017 ran et al 2021 appears to be the dominant control on the seasonal pco2 changes in this semiarid reservoir future work is needed to quantitatively investigate the impact of groundwater derived dic inputs viewed in terms of the diel cycle the constantly lower diurnal pco2 fig 4a suggested a universal mechanism in regulating the diel pattern in contrast to humid and temperate reservoirs which show a pronounced seasonality in terrestrial inputs of organic carbon and or soil co2 halbedel and koschorreck 2013 webb et al 2019 external carbon in this semiarid reservoir is mostly derived from groundwater because of the small catchment size and short travel time of groundwater it is anticipated that the stable groundwater inflow was unlikely to have caused the significant diurnal nocturnal pattern as implied by the largely equal dic concentrations between the day night cycles and throughout the year fig 2f we hypothesize that the diurnal nocturnal variations were driven by autotrophic processes of the negative balance between plankton photosynthesis and community respiration in the water column the reduced pco2 during the daytime fig 4a was accompanied by an increase in water temperature fig 2b and stronger solar radiation both of which are related to enhanced photosynthesis bevelhimer et al 2016 spafford and risk 2018 this is further evidenced by the concurrent increase in do and chl a during the daytime fig 2c and d the nocturnal pco2 dynamics could be attributed to co2 production from planktonic and sedimentary bacterial respiration during nighttime amaral et al 2018 yang et al 2019 as a direct proxy of microbial respiration the declining do at night fig 3 indicated that organic matter was progressively consumed for co2 production amaral et al 2018 however there was no discernible difference in doc within the day night cycles p 0 05 and the nighttime doc concentrations were even somewhat higher in march and may fig 2e this suggests that direct co2 production via respiration probably played a minor role in mediating the higher nocturnal pco2 fig 4a the nangou reservoir trapped large quantities of particulate carbon that originated from the surrounding agricultural land sediment respiration of particulate carbon caused the buildup of co2 in the hypolimnion fig 5 especially during the ice cover period finlay et al 2019 the pco2 was consistently 15 53 higher at the reservoir bottom 200 220 cm than in the surface water 0 50 cm and the do declined quickly in response to the metabolic effects at the reservoir bottom fig 5 although the vertical δpco2 in this shallow reservoir is not as apparent as in deep lentic systems halbedel and koschorreck 2013 morales pineda et al 2014 nighttime cooling of the surface water can induce upwelling of deep co2 rich water the shallow water mean depth 1 7 m only also facilitates a rapid and full convective mixing thereby increasing the surface water pco2 as widely observed in small lakes e g åberg et al 2010 brothers et al 2017 4 2 drivers of seasonal and diel co2 emissions our high resolution data suggest that the nangou reservoir is exclusively a net co2 source to the atmosphere the magnitude of f co2 is collectively controlled by the pco2 gradient at the water air interface and the efficiency of gas transfer macintyre et al 2018 podgrajsek et al 2015 the high effluxes during the ice thaw period march were primarily driven by the high surface water pco2 fig 4 although the corresponding k600 1 5 3 3 cm h 1 was the lowest among the five campaigns on the other hand for the high f co2 in may it appears that the significantly higher k600 4 7 19 3 cm h 1 played a dominant role because of the small pco2 gradient across the water air interface fig 4 in contrast the magnitude of f co2 in summer was largely regulated by pco2 because of the comparable k600 whereas a slightly higher k600 in autumn reduced the f co2 differences between summer and autumn on a daily scale the diel f co2 pattern demonstrated pco2 changes which in return reveal the diel variations in photosynthesis respiration ratios fig 4 the higher nighttime effluxes except in august were related to the metabolic activity of aquatic ecosystems which resulted in the higher pco2 this is in line with previous diel variability of co2 flux in freshwater systems podgrajsek et al 2015 rocher ros et al 2020 the diel cycles of do and chl a fig 2c and d reflect the dominance of primary production during daytime and respiration during nighttime morales pineda et al 2014 moreover enhanced convective mixing due to nighttime surface water cooling can augment co2 emissions jonsson et al 2008 spafford and risk 2018 this is highly possible for the nangou reservoir with an average water depth of 1 7 m as discussed above the produced co2 at the reservoir bottom via respiration as shown in fig 5 could be easily entrained to the surface and led to a higher nocturnal f co2 liu et al 2016 this can also partially explain the largest diurnal nocturnal f co2 amplitude in march fig 4b which also registered the largest diel water temperature change 10 and thus the strongest nighttime cooling effect however we noted that episodic weather events can significantly disturb the diurnal nocturnal pattern lynch et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 several high wind and rainfall events were observed during august 28 30 fig 6 which generated pulses of high co2 emissions and eventually caused the inconsistent diurnal nocturnal pattern of f co2 in august fig 4b because the metabolic indicators e g do and chl a showed consistent diel cycles over the five campaigns figs 2 and 3 the higher diurnal f co2 indicated that metabolism was not likely to be a key driver of co2 emissions this was also confirmed by the weak relationship between do and f co2 although surface water pco2 displayed a significant negative correlation with do p 0 05 supplementary fig s2 an alternative explanation is that high effluxes occur during strong winds or rainfall events cole and caraco 1998 zappa et al 2007 recent laboratory experiments and field measurements indicate that raindrops can enhance turbulent mixing and water air gas exchange with their effect comparable to that of moderate winds zappa et al 2007 zhang et al 2020 studies have also suggested that enhanced hydrological inputs of terrestrial co2 to the reservoir during rainfall events may increase the co2 pool thus leading to the higher emission rates ojala et al 2011 rantakari and kortelainen 2005 vachon and del giorgio 2014 the f co2 during the rainfall period 9 00 12 00 on august 28 and 9 00 15 00 on august 30 was 44 higher than that in the no rainfall period fig 6 furthermore the significant dependence of f co2 on wind speeds r2 0 51 p 0 001 but a lesser dependence on pco2 r2 0 01 p 0 05 suggested that the gas transfer velocity played a more important role than δpco2 in controlling the emission flux supplementary fig s2 if the high wind hours 9 00 12 00 and 18 00 on august 29 fig 6 were considered together the f co2 values during these weather events were 80 higher than those under normal conditions consequently the f co2 in august was on average 23 higher during the daytime than during the nighttime this clearly indicates the importance of capturing episodic weather events in examining the diurnal nocturnal pattern of co2 emissions and estimating the daily co2 efflux guérin et al 2007 spafford and risk 2018 taken all measurements together table 3 f co2 was only significantly correlated with wind speed p 0 01 and two water quality indicators chl a and doc p 0 05 for both wind speed has the highest explanatory power among all the potential drivers examined and explains 29 of the overall variability in f co2 table 3 this probably stresses the dominance of gas transfer velocity in determining the magnitude of co2 emission rates because of the considerable co2 oversaturation 3 11 times that of atmospheric equilibrium in the nangou reservoir it is reasonable to conclude that its co2 emissions were not supply limited i e controlled by co2 availability instead the f co2 depended more on the gas transfer velocity and appeared to be transport limited i e controlled by near surface turbulence as suggested by recent findings from flowing streams schneider et al 2020 the negative response of f co2 to concurrent chl a and doc indicated the diel pattern of metabolism as discussed above and as observed in other studies amaral et al 2018 yang et al 2019 4 3 comparison with other reservoirs although the nangou reservoir is 51 years old our measurements indicate that it remains an important hotspot for co2 emission its surface water pco2 and f co2 values are similar to those reported from semiarid temperate and boreal reservoirs but they are marginally lower than those observed in sub tropical reservoirs table 4 this reveals the spatial variations in the availability of decomposable organic matter and co2 sources deemer et al 2016 sediments on the chinese loess plateau are characterized by low and highly refractory organic carbon and over the past decades proactive soil conservation has substantially reduced terrestrial organic carbon inputs into the reservoir qu et al 2020 yu et al 2019 therefore its seasonal co2 emissions were more likely sustained by the high dic loading like those reported in karst reservoirs pu et al 2020 wang et al 2011 while the diel cycle was mediated by the metabolism of aquatic ecosystems it is also noteworthy that the average f co2 from the nangou reservoir is significantly higher than our earlier observations in the chinese loess plateau i e wanggedu and hekoumiao table 4 this large flux difference is probably because our earlier measurements were conducted only during the daytime when the aquatic ecosystems displayed the strongest photosynthesis and accordingly caused the lowest co2 effluxes ran et al 2017 in comparison tropical reservoirs are typically surrounded by forest soils and peatlands with high terrestrial inputs of organic matter coupled with warmer ambient temperatures mineralization of these organic matter is the primary mechanism controlling their high co2 effluxes almeida et al 2016 pu et al 2020 finally the f co2 rates from our study reservoir were much higher than the global average measured from reservoirs lakes and ponds table 4 this further underscores the need to include semiarid reservoirs to correctly estimate the global co2 emission flux rodriguez and casper 2018 varol 2019 previous research has shown that reservoir age determines the co2 effluxes colas et al 2020 teodoru et al 2012 young reservoirs with newly flooded organic matter e g dead trees tend to degas more co2 and the rate declines exponentially over time and finally stabilizes after 15 years teodoru et al 2012 although we cannot examine the interannual changes of co2 efflux for the nangou reservoir comparing it with the geographically similar but younger wanggedu and hekoumiao reservoirs indicates that the efflux age relationship is not applicable for hard water reservoirs table 4 for example if the diurnal co2 emission data alone were used the f co2 values in the nangou reservoir were still 52 68 higher than those from the younger ones this is likely because the co2 emissions in this reservoir are more strongly associated with dic than doc which is in agreement with previous findings that dic inputs are critical in regulating co2 dynamics in hard water systems finlay et al 2009 this differs from soft water reservoirs where the decomposition of organic matter is the major source of dissolved co2 in contrast our results suggest that hard water reservoirs are co2 sources despite being net autotrophic knoll et al 2013 4 4 implications for the estimation of annual co2 emissions previous estimates of co2 emissions from inland waters often rely on sampling during the daytime and involve a simple extrapolation over an entire year e g deemer et al 2016 raymond et al 2013 our study explicitly indicated that measurements of co2 efflux from reservoirs at low temporal resolutions may cause considerable flux biases if we had sampled only at 15 00 each day the daily co2 efflux for the nangou reservoir would have been underestimated by 9 25 on a 5 d basis and the maximum bias could have been 56 the measurement of co2 emission involving diel variability plays a critical role in quantifying daily and annual co2 effluxes gomez gener et al 2021 yang et al 2019 for soft water systems where the diel co2 variability is primarily controlled by the day night cycles of metabolic activity the amplitude of f co2 variation and thus the estimation bias would have been even larger podgrajsek et al 2015 yang et al 2019 for example liu et al 2016 reported a 70 higher nocturnal co2 efflux compared to the daytime efflux in the ross barnett reservoir in central mississippi thus future sampling schemes must consider this diel variability to refine the estimation accuracy of daily carbon emissions from reservoirs or other lentic systems because the measurements were performed only at one site fig 1 the obtained f co2 and k results may have not reflected the spatial heterogeneity in co2 emissions from the entire reservoir given the small and shallow reservoir with potentially full mixing however it is reasonable to postulate that the spatial variations in both f co2 and k are likely small until recently carbon emissions from inland waters during the ice melting period have been largely overlooked we also noted the importance of co2 emissions during the ice thaw period for estimating the annual co2 efflux as a result of sediment respiration in winter the nangou reservoir may have accumulated large quantities of co2 under ice or within the ice as co2 bubbles this subsequently resulted in strong emissions during the ice thaw period when the reservoir system was reconnected with the atmosphere fig 4 a conservative estimate shows that the co2 emitted during the ice thaw period 1 week accounts for 11 of the annual flux this contribution is comparable to those found in arctic boreal and temporal lakes where co2 emissions during ice thaw equaled 12 55 of the annual flux denfeld et al 2018 our study suggests that the annual carbon flux will be significantly underestimated if sampling is biased towards the ice free season as the strong emissions during the ice thaw period will not be captured this sampling bias is particularly problematic for boreal and high altitude lentic systems that tend to have a longer ice cover and higher doc loads denfeld et al 2016 knoll et al 2013 accordingly the co2 emissions during the ice thaw period will be of greater significance on an annual scale in conjunction with the diel cycle we conclude that future sampling for upscaling the estimation of the annual carbon budget needs to account for these seasonal and diel variations 5 conclusions our study shows that a semiarid reservoir can be comparatively important for carbon cycling as it shows a high co2 emission rate dic inputs via groundwater plays a central role in sustaining surface water pco2 and regulating its seasonal variability in the hard water nangou reservoir which is characterized by high alkalinity metabolism of aquatic ecosystems is likely to regulate the diel pco2 changes which show a 6 13 difference within a 24 h time span although the nangou reservoir is moderately to highly productive it acts as a net co2 source this confirms previous findings that suggest that productive waters are not necessarily co2 sinks in combination with high resolution spatiotemporal sampling within the single system this study addresses the temporal variations in co2 emissions which were previously found to be greater than their spatial variations the co2 emission rates recorded in our study mean 761 mg c m 2 d 1 were found to be significantly higher than the global average f co2 from reservoirs given the global abundance of hard water lentic systems future studies should incorporate better estimates of co2 emissions from these water bodies to understand the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle the release of the accumulated co2 during ice thaw represents an important pathway of co2 emissions on an annual scale furthermore the efflux of co2 exhibits a clear diel cycle with typically higher f co2 values during the nighttime because of the concurrently higher pco2 however episodic weather events such as rainfall and strong winds were found to significantly enhance co2 emissions and even reverse the diel pattern our data highlight the need for future sampling to integrate full seasonal and diel variations excluding such variations may create a large bias in catchment and regional carbon budgets due to the paucity of representative measurements data availability statement dataset is available at https doi org 10 25442 hku 13413617 v2 credit authorship

3529,significant nonstationarity of hydrological sequences driven by the coupled influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities has challenged traditional hydrological drought analysis under the stationarity assumption in some regions and has questioned regional hydrological drought analysis under the changing environment to evaluate hydrological drought characteristics the novelty of this paper is the proposition of a gamlss generalized additive models for location scale and shape based nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri considering climate change and anthropogenic influence for investigating the hydrological drought regime in the wuding river basin to that end nonstationary test methods were performed on hydrological sequences and data was segmented into three parts according to the results of the pettitt test a nonstationary probability distribution was fitted to runoff data with meteorological covariates precipitation temperature and anthropogenic covariates water consumption for social development demand and water consumption triggered by water impounding by check dams after selecting an optimal combination of covariates the nsri was calculated utilizing the gamlss model a newly constructed evaluation threshold was proposed based on the traditional sri threshold the performance of sri and nsri were compared at the dingjiagou station in the wuding river basin results of comparison between index identification and recorded drought events demonstrated that the nsri better performed in drought event identification moreover the nsri identified more frequent severe droughts and extreme droughts therefore the proposed nsri provided a more accurate basis for the identification of drought events which can offer valuable information for drought planning preparedness and mitigation keywords non stationary gamlss hydrological drought drought index 1 introduction as an extreme climatic event commonly covering large areas and extending for long time periods drought has a huge impact on agricultural production eco environment and economic development in the world mukherjee et al 2018 with complex terrain diverse climate types large regional differences and a fragile geographical environment china is one of the countries with the most severe drought impacts including economic losses drought events have occurred frequently in most areas of china in recent years especially in most areas of the north west southwest and southeast chang et al 2016 currently frequent occurrences of long return period droughts have raised questions on our original understanding of droughts and the accuracy of traditional stationary drought frequency calculations in changing environment has come into question kiem and austin 2013 kim and jehanzaib 2020 miao et al 2020 therefore how to recognize and respond to nonstationary drought events or processes has become urgent for global drought assessment and management verdon kidd and kiem 2010 das et al 2020 a drought can be defined as a prolonged period of unusually dry weather in an area where some rain might normally be expected droughts involve water shortages crop damage steam flow reduction and depletion of groundwater and soil moisture kim et al 2014 drought can be monitored by relevant physical characteristics although all droughts are generally driven by extreme meteorological change different surface wading processes have strong reactions to drought events mishra and singh 2010 different fields investigate droughts from different perspectives and potential threats according to their needs to date four categories of droughts have been proposed for characterizing water shortages that occur in different fields i e meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought shukla and wood 2008 however recent studies have reported that the synchronicity of meteorological drought hydrological drought and agricultural drought is getting worse under the influence of changing environment and the information expressed by the various types of drought is more heterogeneous mishra and singh 2010 among all the drought types hydrological drought has been paid great attention due to its fundamental role in water resources management correspondingly a lot of indicators or indices have been developed and used for evaluating hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 including palmer hydrological drought index phdi standardized runoff index sri streamflow drought index sdi and standardized streamflow index ssi to represent the deficit of water in streamflow groundwater and or water storage in natural lakes and artificial reservoirs haile et al 2020 hao et al 2016 shukla and wood 2008 among all of these indices sri analogous to the standardized precipitation index spi is considered to have an advantage in depicting hydrological aspects of drought due to low data requirement easy calculation multi time scale and predictability thus sri has been widely employed in hydrological drought analysis in recent years however traditional sri does not account for nonstationarity in the calculation process in many regions of china and other countries in the world hydrological sequences vary greatly with time exhibiting nonstationarity under the coupled influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities chang et al 2019 strupczewski et al 2001 wang et al 2015 the fundamental assumption of stationarity used in the traditional hydrological analysis has therefore been widely questioned ammar et al 2020 hui et al 2018 marra et al 2019 in response to this question many methods have been devoted to deal with nonstationarity the copula method hao and aghakouchak 2013 kang and jiang 2019 zhang et al 2021 generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss su and chen 2019 villarini et al 2010 artificial neural networks ann shahabbodin et al 2020 have been commonly used to estimate and analyze the nonstationary characteristics of hydrological drought among these methods the gamlss developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 has been paid much attention because of its advantage in describing the linear or nonlinear relationship between any parameter or random variable distribution also owing to its comprehensive and flexible features this model has been widely used in global hydrological nonstationary analysis wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zou et al 2018 recently researchers introduced gamlss into nonstationary drought analysis for example wang et al 2015 applied a time dependent standardized precipitation index spit using the gamlss model bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 employed gamlss to develop a time varying non stationary reconnaissance drought index nrdi for drought monitoring in a changing climate yu et al 2019 constructed a bivariate time varying copula model based on gamlss theory and developed a nonstationary joint drought management index jdmi indeed the effectiveness of the gamlss model in nonstationary hydrological calculations has been accepted to further improve the nonstationary drought assessment the gamlss model was selected in this paper to construct the nonstationary sri index for describing the deficit regimes of water in drought events it is known that the covariate selection for the gamlss model directly affects its accuracy zhang et al 2015 researchers have tried to construct models using time as a covariate to analyze the nonstationary drought index park et al 2019 wang et al 2015 although these models can reflect hydrological nonstationarity to a certain extent they do not consider the physical mechanisms driving the hydrological process change large scale climate patterns are considered as the main drivers of interannual and interdecadal variability in hydrological variables zhang et al 2021 in addition anthropogenic activities such as water consumption for industry and agriculture increasing in line with increases in population and social development have significant influences on the hydrological process these activities together with climate change trigger the hydrological drought trend when the drought occurring li et al 2020 thus it is logical to link the hydrological drought index to climate change and anthropogenic activities which will help explain the variability of index das et al 2020 proposed a nonstationary gamma distribution with climate indices in its location parameter as the gamlss covariate li et al 2019 employed the gamlss model using observed precipitation for nonstationary frequency analysis wang et al 2015 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to investigate varying anthropogenic forcing and calculated human induced hydrological drought indices nssi which showed that nssi performed better than the traditional ssi in luan river basin zhang et al 2021 considered reservoir operation agricultural irrigation and soil conservation as anthropogenic impacts on runoff and developed the nonstationary meteorological and hydrological drought index nmhdi providing valuable information for drought management all these studies indicate that characterizing the impact of anthropogenic activities in an appropriate way when constructing the gamlss model can improve the model in response to the physical mechanism combining gamlss and sri zou et al 2018 proposed a gamlss based sri and applied it to the wei river basin in china in order to investigate the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on hydrological drought jehanzaib et al 2020 conducted a similar study to analyze the impact and scale effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought in the han river basin of korea these two studies mainly estimated the impacts of climate change and human activities on regional or watershed sri index by reconstructing the natural runoff series rather than describing the physical driving mechanisms of hydrological drought this paper aims to develop a nonstationary standardized runoff index based on the gamlss model integrating climate and anthropogenic factors in order to assess the nonstationary change of hydrological drought in a changing environment the main tasks of this paper are as follow 1 perform stationary tests on the observed runoff sequences to identify the nonstationary characteristics in the hydrological process namely determine the changepoints and segment the runoff records according to these points 2 select the optimal covariates for the gamlss model 3 calculate the threshold of hydrological drought level in the wuding river basin to redefine regional hydrological drought events and 4 compare the nsri and sri with actual drought events to detect the performance of the nsri in drought identification it is expected to provide a technical framework for understanding and assessing regional hydrological drought in the changing environment and to provide beneficial references for regional drought monitoring forecasting and policy making 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the wuding river is a first order tributary of the yellow river in china with a length of 491 2 km and the basin area is about 30 261 km2 the river originates from the ordos desert in shaanxi province and inner mongolia running on the loess plateau and flows into the yellow river in qingjian country of shaanxi province it has several branches including hailiutu luhe yuxi huaining and dali rivers tian et al 2019 the wuding river basin is located in the north of loess plateau with a typical continental arid and semi arid climate pattern the average annual precipitation varies between 300 and 500 mm 65 of which falls between july and september the average annual runoff of this basin is 15 4 billion m3 since the 1980s the precipitation in the wuding river basin has decreased year by year which has led to the reduction of runoff as the major supplement of runoff what s more the middle and lower reaches of the wuding river even dried up 17 times from 1975 to 2004 which caused hydrological droughts the drought in the wuding river basin directly affects the economic and social development of the surrounding cities in recent years droughts have occurred more frequently therefore it is essential to study the drought patterns and take effective countermeasures to deal with the drought problem in the wuding river basin dingjiagou gauge is the control site in the upper and middle reaches of the wuding river basin the gauge monitors a drainage area of 23 422 km2 accounting for 77 4 of the total basin the basin above the dingjiagou gauge was selected as the study area in this paper as shown in fig 1 2 2 data the monthly runoff data from dingjiagou gauge for 1959 2010 was obtained from hydrological manuals published by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc china the meteorological data including precipitation p and air temperature t were provided by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration the area precipitation and average temperature of the watershed above the dingjiagou gauge were calculated by the thiessen polygon method based on the meteorological stations distributed in and around the study area fig 2 the design construction and operation data of check dams in the wuding river basin were obtained from the water conservancy survey in yulin shaanxi province in this study the calculation of water consumption triggered by the water impounding of the check dam wc was based on the regional precipitation area measured runoff data the total control area of the check dam the total design storage capacity and the effective storage capacity of the check dam the calculation method was the reduction coefficient method first the watershed was divided into precipitation regions according to thiessen polygons and the area and reduction coefficient of each precipitation region was obtained total control area of the check dam effective storage capacity area of precipitation region total designed storage capacity in principle the wc was the measured runoff data multiplied by the reduction coefficient and 603 key check dams in the wuding river basin were involved in the reduction calculation the water consumption for social development demand wd in this study refers to the part taken from surface water the yulin city covers almost all of the industrial irrigation and afforestation areas and towns in the wuding river basin and the main sources of data were from the statistical publications of yulin city including yulin water resources bulletin yulin statistical yearbook and shaanxi water statistical yearbook since the water used by rural residents and livestock in the wuding river basin mainly comes from groundwater this study only considered water used by industry irrigation afforestation and urban residents equal to the water consumption coefficient multiplied by water withdrawal 3 method 3 1 gamlss model the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss was proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 a kind of semi parametric regression model it can be used to describe the linear or nonlinear relationship between any statistical parameter and the explanatory parameter of random variable sequences su and chen 2019 villarini et al 2010 the nonstationarity can be considered in the process of probability distribution estimation of hydrological series by the gamlss model which considers the change of time series yt t 1 2 n following the probability density function f yt θ t conditional on θ t θ t 1 θ t 2 θ tp here θ t is a vector including the p parameter of the distribution and the kth parameter of a given distribution is connected to explanatory variables through the monotonic link functions as follows 1 g k θ k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where θ k is a vector of length n β k is a parameter vector of length j k x k is an n j k fixed known design matrix and z jk is a nonparametric additive function of γ jk if j k 0 the model is reduced to a fully parametric gamlss model without regard to the impact of random items the function is as follows 2 g k θ k x k β k in the process of nonstationary analysis and calculation of hydrological sequences less than or equal to three parameters were usually chosen for fitting and the influence of random items was not considered in this study gamlss was applied to construct a nonstationary model for runoff change analysis in the study area within the gamlss framework the runoff time series was assumed to be distributed with its location parameter μ and scale parameter σ linked to different covariates when a single covariate was chosen for fitting observations might show a nonlinear behavior over the covariate parameters were described by an optimized polynomial function as follows 3 g 1 μ t g 1 μ t a 0 a 1 t a q t q when multiple covariates were selected various covariates connected linearly in the gamlss model generally akaike information criterion aic and schwarz bayesian criterion sbc are selected to obtain the optimal model to ensure the model accuracy and prevent the model from overfitting for qualitative evaluation the gamlss model used a q q plot and worm plot while for quantitative evaluation the model used the mean value variance skewness of residuals filliben correlation coefficient and k s test 3 2 standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 proposed the standardized runoff index sri which is calculated based on the assumption of gamma distribution das et al 2020 the calculation method is as follows 4 f y 1 μ σ γ σ y σ 1 e y μ where μ and σ are the location and scale parameters respectively f y is the probability density function pdf and y 0 μ 0 σ 0 the maximum likelihood method is often used to estimate parameter μ and σ the cumulative probability distribution function cdf of runoff sequence y for a certain time scale can be defined as follows 5 f y 0 y f y d y normalizing the probability of the gamma distribution the sri can be obtained as follows 6 sri k m c 2 m c 1 m c 0 d 3 m d 2 m d 1 m 1 0 7 m 2 l n f where c1 c2 c3 d1 d2 d3 k are empirical parameters c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 d3 0 001308 when f 0 5 then k 1 when f 0 5 then k 1 table 1 wet and drought period classification based on the sri 3 3 mann kendall mk trend test the nonparametric mann kendall trend test was proposed by mann and kendall hamed and rao 1998 mann 1945 and has been widely used to test the trend of time series in hydrology morbidelli et al 2018 rashid et al 2015 tyralis et al 2018 yue and wang 2004 the null hypothesis of this test states that the data x 1 x n is a sample of n independent and identically distributed random variables the test statistic z is calculated as follows 8 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 9 s k 1 n 1 j

statistic s is approximately distributed normally when n 10 in a two sided test for trend the null hypothesis h0 is rejected if z z 1 α 2 which is z z 1 α 2 or z z 1 α 2 at the level of α significance indicating a significant decreasing or increasing trend 3 4 construction of nonstationary sri the construction of nsri was based on the gamlss model and the calculation of sri the runoff data was first input into the gamlss model as fitting data the optimal combination of covariates was obtained and the aic and sbc criteria were combined and worm plot and q q plot of the gamlss model were used then the corresponding optimal nonstationary model acquired two expressions about the location and scale parameters such as fig 2 these expressions clearly described the relationship between covariates and runoff data by transforming the location and scale parameters of runoff data into covariates finally replacing these two expressions with the location and scale parameters respectively the covariates were integrated into the calculation of the sri the traditional threshold of sri which does not account for hydrological nonstationarity is no longer applicable to nsri to construct the nonstationary evaluation threshold the first step was to calculate the runoff anomaly percentage then the classification criteria of runoff anomaly percentage were combined and the corresponding frequency of each type of drought was obtained finally the cumulative frequency of each type of drought was correlated with the cumulative frequency curve of nsri and the threshold of different droughts was obtained the main process of the standardized runoff index construction is shown in fig 2 4 results 4 1 nonstationary analysis fig 3 a shows the mann kendall m k trend test results of the annual runoff series in the study area demonstrating a significant downward trend with great fluctuations it can be seen from the runoff sequence that it peaked at 155 069 m3 in 1964 reaching a minimum in 1981 and the trend had gradually stabilized since 1989 the absolute value of m k parameter z was 6 179 passing the 95 confidence test certifying the negative trend of runoff data moreover the pettitt test presented two change points in the runoff sequence namely at 1978 and 1996 drawn in fig 3 a accordingly the sequences were divided into three parts 1959 to 1978 1979 to 1995 and 1996 to 2010 in which the period of 1959 1978 was considered as near natural period and the rest periods were defined as impacted periods the corresponding segmented mean values were 104 986 m3 77 292 m3 and 65 915 m3 showing a decreasing trend what s more the negative trends of runoff were also found at seasonal scales shown in the seasonal variation in fig 3 b above all the nonstationary runoff sequences in the study area were verified long term changes in annual precipitation water consumption triggered by the water impounding of the check dam wc and water consumption for social development demand wd in the study area are shown in fig 3 a and c it is clear from the figures that the precipitation displayed a significant variation similar to the runoff oscillation except a declining trend of about 2 3 this implies that as a typical region in loess plateau the wuding river basin has a positive correlation between precipitation and runoff although the land cover and anthropogenic impacts were constantly occurring and changing the coupled points in the precipitation runoff chart in fig 3 d also verify it opposite to the reductions in precipitation and runoff sequences annual wd represented a dramatic increase with the lowest value in 1977 and the relatively higher level from 1996 to 1999 the average annual wd was 15 285 m3 accounting for about 18 of the mean annual runoff different from wd the wc series did not show sustainable growth on one hand the total storage capacity of check dams increased with the construction of new dams on the other hand the storage capacity decreased with the filling and retirement of check dams it is known that check dam projects have played an important role in the water and soil conservation of the loess plateau in china controlling serious soil erosion and promoting the greening of the loess plateau meanwhile it is also found that check dams blocked a certain amount of water that should have entered the river leading to the attenuation of runoff in the basin fig 3 d indicates the correlation between runoff and wc wd it can be seen from this figure that the total water consumption covering wc and wd was significantly negative with runoff variation namely runoff was reducing when the total water consumption was increasing it implies that the wc and wd are important drives that impact the runoff variation in the wuding river basin and should be considered in gamlss model construction 4 2 modeling with gamlss the traditional hydrological calculations were made under the assumption of stationarity meaning the hydrological series kept its distribution properties invariant with time implying free of trends and abrupt changes wang et al 2015 rendering the traditional approach unsuitable for nonstationary sequence analysis in this study the gamlss model was employed to investigate the calculation of the nonstationary hydrological drought index by introducing suitable covariates to filter appropriate variables this paper divided the runoff series into three parts 1959 1978 1979 1995 1996 2010 to improve the fitting quality and determine the covariates used for constructing the gamlss model to date the gamlss covariates mainly included time temperature and precipitation among them time as a covariate has certain limitations for gamlss modeling because it cannot comprehensively represent the physical process of hydrological change this paper therefore selected precipitation p and temperature t as climatic covariates of gamlss for hydrological drought because they aid in describing the hydrological process not only climatic elements have impacted the hydrological process but anthropogenic activities have also been driving the watershed nonstationary hydrological variation in recent years it is well known that humans mainly change the dynamics of the water cycle through dams constructed for water storage and through water withdrawals for industrial agricultural or domestic purposes haddeland et al 2014 and further alter hydrological processes and have exerted global scale impacts on water resources the 2018 edition of the united nations world water development report has emphasized that increasing water demand will follow population growth economic development and changing consumption patterns in the next two decades up to 5 500 to 6 000 km3 per year by 2050 boretti and rosa 2019 it triggers more dams constructed or maintained for water storage more water withdrawal required for global water supply and implies greater influence on river hydrological process however the impact of anthropogenic activities has rarely been considered in gamlss studies that use gamlss to analyze the coupled impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought jehanzaib et al 2020 zou et al 2018 did not take the anthropogenic activities as a covariate that is anthropogenic activities were not directly considered in the construction of nonstationary models many studies have indicated that the intensity of anthropogenic activities has been continuously increasing with the repaid economic growth in the wuding river basin and these activities have also triggered regional hydrological variation zhang et al 2016 dang et al 2021 as a result it is essential to carry out the nonstationary analysis of regional hydrological drought in the study area with the factors of anthropogenic activities as covariates literature survey of the wuding river basin shows that the regional anthropogenic impact is mainly reflected in two aspects one refers to direct water consumption for social development demand wd which includes surface and groundwater for the development of industry agriculture and living standards what s more the significant increase in water demand has led to severe hydrological drought together with climate change dang et al 2021 the other one is water impounding by hydraulic structures statistics show that 11 602 check dams were built in the basin until 2017 including 1155 key dams 3747 medium sized dams and 6700 small scale dams tian et al 2019 in the last 60 years the number and influence of check dams have been in the process of continuous fluctuations due to the abandonment of old check dams and construction of new check dams although literature indicates that check dams have played a critical role in controlling soil erosion and improving the ecological environment in the loess plateau it is no doubt also true that check dams especially small ones have impounded a lot of water that should have entered the river channel constantly impacting hydrological variations in the wuding river basin han et al 2019 shi et al 2019 above all the water consumption triggered by the water impounding of check dam wc and water consumption for social development demand wd should be considered as covariates of gamlss to illustrate the anthropogenic impact on regional hydrological drought in general five types of distributions i e normal distribution no lognormal distribution logno gamma distribution ga weibull distribution wei and gumbel distribution gu were used in fitting hydrological series to ensure the covariates can adequately describe the variation of runoff and avoid over fitting of the model the above mentioned four covariates t p wc and wd were proposed into 19 combinations for fitting the distribution respectively for a single covariate this study selected the least squares fitting with a polynomial of degrees 1 2 and 3 for multiple covariates the covariates were directly input into the model and connected linearly the optimal model was generally selected based on the global deviance g d the akaike information criterion aic and the schwartz s bayesian criterion sbc smaller sbc and aic values correspond to better models usually when the length of the hydrological sequence is greater than 8 the sbc criterion is more accurate than the aic zhang et al 2021 thus this study chose the sbc as the criterion of optimal model selection the sbc values of the gamlss models with various covariate combinations and distributions are shown in fig 4 also five distributions were adopted for fitting the optimal covariates and distribution of nonstationary models were selected using a step by step method and the results for three periods are shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 as shown in fig 4 a the selection of different distribution types greatly influenced the model fitting performance results of logno and ga distributions were better and the optimal distribution was logno as for covariates p and wd played a prominent role in improving the model fitting from 1959 to 1978 among all combinations pw and tpw corresponded to the minimum sbc it implied that pw based and tpw based gamlss models had the best performance in fitting the variation of runoff data to further judge the estimation quality of statistical parameters figure tests should be implemented it can be seen from fig 5 that the gamlss model with pw as a covariate performed well in the normal q q plot in addition except for a few points the rest of points were within the 95 confidence interval between the two grey dotted lines which indicated that the pw logno based gamlss model was able to fit data effectively fig 5 b indicates that compared with 1959 1978 different covariate combinations had a more significant impact on model fitting in 1979 1995 in addition the multivariate fitting model was more stable than the univariate model representing a complex relationship between runoff and covariates of all the covariates wd had a decisive influence on model fitting changes in the sbc values showed the model with tpc as a covariate was significantly better than other combinations comparing the results of different distribution types it was found that the no normal distribution was the optimal distribution thus this study implemented the figure test on gamlss models with similar covariate combinations wc pcw tpcw and twc to further distinguish the degree of fitting of hydrological data to the model fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the worm plots indicated that the tpcw no based model performed better than others for the residual points of this model all passed the 95 confidence test similar to the last two periods covariate combinations represented a greater impact on the fitting than distribution type in 1996 2010 as shown in fig 4 c among covariates wd played a significant role showing all multivariate combination models considering wd had smaller sbc values by comparison tpw was considered optimal additionally there was little difference among the results of the five distributions in which no was relatively better fig 7 illustrates the figure test of the gamlss model with tpw covariates and no distribution there was no anomaly observed in the worm plot implying the tpw no based gamlss model reflected the regime of hydrological data it can be concluded that the optimal gamlss models of three periods were 1 lognormal distribution nonstationary model with precipitation and wd as covariate i e pw logno based gamlss model 2 normal distribution nonstationary model with temperature precipitation wc and wd as covariates i e tpcw no based gamlss model and 3 normal distribution nonstationary model with precipitation temperature and wd as covariates i e tpw no based gamlss model 4 3 calculation of indices as mentioned in section 4 1 the index calculation was divided into the near natural period and two impacted periods according to the optimal nonstationary models developed in three periods the monthly non stationary sri nsri of three periods can be calculated by the method mentioned in section 3 4 results of comparison of sri and nsri are shown in fig 8 as shown in violin plots the variation of nsri mainly between 2 and 2 and the mean value of nsri showed a gradually decreasing trend from 1959 to 2010 in the near natural period 1959 1978 except for some extreme cases the indices were mainly distributed around zero fig 8 a with the addition of anthropogenic influence the drought degree identified by the indices gradually increased fig 8 c between sri and nsri the similarities in trend were obviously seen while the differences significantly existed in the index change implying the influence of nonstationarity on the hydrological index as shown in the scatter plots of the three periods fig 8 the variations of nsri and sri showed a significant positive trend indicating that they had a strong similarity in trend variation nevertheless the violin plots showed the difference in the numerical distribution of nsri and sri it was clear in the near natural period fig 8 a that the mean value of sri was higher than nsri with a similar numerical distribution besides the distribution of the two indices gradually presented significant differences over time due to the continuous increase of water consumption for social development demand wd and the change of water impounding of the check dam wc the value of nsri gradually changed from a more uniform distribution near 0 to a negative value fig 8 b and c in addition it can be found from fig 8 that nsri was more sensitive to extreme situations indicating the variation range of the nsri superior to the sri 5 discussion 5 1 drought event identification 5 1 1 threshold construction since the traditional drought classification of the sri is based on stationary consumption the same as spi hao et al 2016 it cannot be directly employed to account for nonstationarity so this study constructed a new classification standard to accurately describe the nsri the first step in this construction was to calculate the anomaly of measured runoff data in the study area from 1959 to 2010 then the runoff anomaly ratio was obtained secondly the runoff anomaly ratio was divided into seven gages i e extreme drought severe drought moderate drought near normal moderate wet very wet and extreme wet concerning the traditional sri classification table 2 at this time the cumulative frequencies of each grade were accumulated sequentially and the cumulative frequencies corresponding to seven grades were 36 22 41 83 47 92 71 15 75 16 78 53 100 the third was to draw the histogram of the frequency distribution of the nsri series as shown in fig 9 fig 9 a represents a good fit between the normal distribution curve and the nsri values and fig 9 b shows the cumulative distribution function of the index according to the cumulative frequency values above the critical values of hydrological drought indicators were calculated as 0 39 0 25 0 15 0 44 0 55 and 0 66 respectively table 2 illustrates a comparison of the constructed thresholds between nsri and sri index it can be seen that the nsri redefined the occurrence and intensity of hydrological drought events different from the sri classification specifically the threshold of hydrological drought increased from 1 to 0 15 implying drought events were more likely under nonstationary conditions than ever in addition the range of indicators for each type decreased illustrating the drought events developed more rapidly than those in the natural period did in addition the range from extreme drought to extreme flood had changed from 2 2 to 0 39 0 66 and it could greatly trigger the occurrence of the sudden sharp drought flood turn events 5 1 2 drought classification the drought events in the wuding river basin can be identified according to the threshold of indexes nsri and sri for better comparison the hydrological drought indexes sequences were divided into three sections i e period a 1959 1978 period b 1979 1995 and period c 1996 2010 the percentages of two drought indicators on a monthly scale are shown in fig 10 which illustrates the occurrence frequencies of drought events in the three periods according to the variation of different levels of drought identified by sri it was concluded that all types of drought events were on the increase namely the basin was in a trend of drought and could continue to increase however this result could not be effectively verified by the trend change of the meteorological drought index spi in the basin the figure shows the nsri based results were different from the sri mainly representing the difference in the proportion of drought events identified especially in more than severe drought events as is shown in the graph the frequency of severe drought recognized by nsri was 36 68 during 1996 2010 and the mean occurrence frequency of extreme drought events identified by sri and nsri was 2 23 and 5 76 respectively fig 10 d from the statistical results of the two indicators a consensus can be obtained that both near normal and extreme droughts showed an increasing trend fig 10 a and b implying the probability of extreme drought will increase in the wuding river basin in the future and the corresponding countermeasures should be taken however it is also seen that moderate drought and severe drought were fundamentally different in the identification proportion and evolution trend fig 10 c and d thus further comparison and verification with historical events should be done 5 2 performance analysis although the results of identification of drought events by nsri and sri have been compared in the previous section the rationality of the nsri cannot be effectively verified in this section the actual drought events recorded in different materials were used to check the identification qualities of nsri and sri aiming to evaluate the performance of the two indicators in this study the documented drought events in the wuding river basin covering 1959 2010 were collected from the shaanxi province drought disaster yearbook and chinese meteorological disasters dictionary as described in the table 4 in appendices since most drought events recorded were counted at the seasonal scale for comparison purposes this study computed the seasonal recognition results by nsri and sri for checking it was noted that spring is from march to may summer refers to the period from june to august autumn is from september to november and winter refers to the period from december to the next february in the wuding river basin the statistical results of different periods are listed in the table 4 including the information of drought events recorded in the materials and the identification results of nsri and sri it can be seen from the table 4 that seasonal and continuous droughts frequently occurred in the study area and many long term drought events have been recorded in the literature however there is a significant difference between nsri and sri in responding to these actual events for example it was documented that a severe drought occurred in the winter of 1961 which was recognized by nsri effectively but sri did not in 1995 a regional severe drought was recorded and covered more than 300 days the identification results showed both nsri and sri recognized the occurrence of drought events in which the results of nsri were closer to the actual situation from the respective duration while sri only recognized spring drought to compare the recognition performance of nsri and sri more intuitively this study counted the recognition rate of drought events combining with the records in the table 4 as shown in fig 11 this figure demonstrates the identification of two indices in intensity frequency and time of drought events respectively it should be pointed out that drought occurrence identification took the year as the unit while time identification was identified in seasons the magnitude identification was counted by the number of the historical drought events with various degrees correctly identified fig 11 illustrates that the recognition rate of the nsri index was 100 for the occurrence of drought events while the sri only recognized 51 11 of drought events that occurred from the perspective of the occurrence times of drought events the nsri had better performance with 91 11 accuracy greater than sri with 40 additionally it was found from the figure that the nsri was efficient and identified 86 67 of the historical drought events at different levels equal to more than three times of sri identification rates it illustrates that the nsri is more suitable in the actual conditions and can produce a relatively correct recognition rate to further analyze the identification results of two indicators the confusion matrix of nsri and sri was calculated as shown in table 3 therein drought events were divided into three types severe drought moderate drought and normal and the identification results of indicators in drought intensity are counted accuracy represents the proportion of correctly identified events to total recognized events while precision notes the fraction of accurately identified drought events among all recorded drought events the recall is the ratio of recorded drought events to all recognized drought events it can be seen from table 3 that the accuracy and recall of nsri were obviously higher than of sri illustrating that the nsri has an advantage in identifying all kinds of drought events the precision of the two indicators was relatively low and nsri was lower than sri only reaching 23 8 this was because it identified a lot of drought events by its high sensitivity thus it is considered that the identification ability of nsri was generally better than sri 5 3 comparison with literature many studies have revealed that the stationarity assumption based traditional indexes or methods cannot accurately identify drought events under changing environments especially in areas that are strongly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities such as the wuding river basin this study constructed a nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri to identify nonstationary hydrological droughts under changing environment therein precipitation and temperature were used as climatic factors the water consumption triggered by the water impounding of the check dam wc and water consumption for social development demand wd represented anthropogenic factors all of them were selected as covariates to estimate the dynamic parameters of nsri for the construction of nonstationary models through the analysis of these variables in previous sections it can be seen that the wd in the study area showed an increasing trend from 1959 to 2010 which is the main part of the direct impact of human activities corresponding to the decrease in runoff fig 3 b however the relationship between observed precipitation and runoff in the study area was not good fig 3 c although the fluctuation of runoff series was consistent with precipitation it can be inferred that precipitation does play a significant role in runoff change but the human impact should not be ignored therefore it is necessary to introduce the anthropogenic factors as covariates for nonstationary model fitting in this study the performance of nsri constructed in identifying drought events confirmed this similar results were also obtained in recent studies for example li et al 2019 added observed precipitation as a covariate in nonstationary runoff frequency analysis and effectively improved the accuracy of frequency analysis zou et al 2018 and jehanzaib et al 2020 estimated the impacts of climate change and human activities on sri index by reconstructing the natural runoff series but they were not insufficient in describing and assessing the nonstationary mechanisms of human induced hydrological drought of course this analysis of the nonstationary index is not a panacea and needs to be applied differently according to the actual situation for instance in some areas where groundwater is the main water source the effect of wd as a covariate may not be good at this time other variables should be considered as covariates li and tan 2015 proposed a check dam index to represent the effect of human activities kang and jiang 2019 added a modified reservoir index as a covariate to evaluate the effect of reservoir regulation when reassessing the hydrological drought of the yangtze river under changing environment wang et al 2015 took soi and amo as meteorological covariates to obtain a human induced index through swat which greatly improved the efficiency of nonstationary index in the luan river basin thus it can be seen that more factors including climate and anthropogenic ones should be considered in the construction of nsri which may positively affect the performance of the index moreover the covariate fitting methods used were generally linear in the nsri hao et al 2019 suggested that the nonlinear fitting could better reflect the variation of values thus this approach should be tried in the future improvement of nsri sarhadi et al 2016 and park et al 2019 proposed that traditional stationary drought indexes would underestimate the frequency of extreme events under different references if the stationary model fitted the overall trend of the entire sequence meanwhile the fitting could be affected by the length of data and further underestimate the extreme events from the results in this study the rule is true in the wuding river basin table 3 sri underestimated the frequency of extreme hydrological drought events when runoff showed a downward trend fig 3 a thereby risking a drought disaster in contrast nsri overcame this limitation by considering suitable covariates and reflected the potential influence of human activities on the drought process because most of the historical drought events recorded were mainly severe droughts and extreme droughts the mild drought events were difficult to verify well as a result the identification capability of the nsri can only be obtained by comparing it with severe droughts and extreme droughts recorded in future research the latest data should be added continuously to improve the index and classification threshold to realize better identification of hydrological drought in the study area 6 conclusions the hydrological sequences have appeared nonstationary in recent years due to the coupled impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities the traditional hydrological drought indicators based on the premise of the consistency hypothesis often failed in identifying and assessing nonstationary hydrological drought therefore this study constructed a gamlss based nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri to identify hydrological drought in a coupled human water system and employed direct human induced water consumption as covariates to implement a nonstationary analysis of hydrological drought index in loess plateau the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 investigating sequences that affect runoff this study determined optimal covariates and distribution of gamlss based nonstationary hydrological drought models by the sbc criterion in three periods 1959 1978 1979 1995 1996 2010 different from the previous investigations water consumption for social development demand wd and water consumption triggered by water impounding of check dam wc were selected as optimal covariates with precipitation and temperature aiming to represent the significant impact of anthropogenic influence on drought event occurrence and process the result indicated that introducing the wd and or wc can effectively improve the fitting performance of the models in human induced periods 2 a gamlss based nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri was employed and the corresponding classification threshold was proposed by referring to the sri evaluation the results of comparison of nsri and sri indicated that nsri considering human impact had a great advantage in identifying hydrological drought events in human induced periods additionally nsri is especially sensitive to severe drought and extreme drought while sri has an underestimation of extreme drought in the wuding river basin also from 1959 to 2010 the analysis results in the study area illustrated the basin was in a trend of drought which could continue to increase showing all types of regional drought events were on the increase a according to the comparison results with the historical drought events recorded it is found that the accuracy and recall of nsri were obviously higher than sri implying that the nsri had better performance in identifying all kinds of drought events results showed that nsri identified 86 67 of the historical drought events at different levels equal to more than three times of sri identification rates it proves that the nsri is more suitable in a coupled human water system and can get a relatively correct recognition rate b although nsri performed better than sri under changing environments and can be used as a new approach for hydrological drought analysis it is not a panacea and needs to be applied differently according to the actual situation through comparison with literature it is considered that more variables representing human impact should be tried in the calculation of nsri to improve the recognition of hydrological drought and aid decision makers in drought planning preparedness and

3529,significant nonstationarity of hydrological sequences driven by the coupled influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities has challenged traditional hydrological drought analysis under the stationarity assumption in some regions and has questioned regional hydrological drought analysis under the changing environment to evaluate hydrological drought characteristics the novelty of this paper is the proposition of a gamlss generalized additive models for location scale and shape based nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri considering climate change and anthropogenic influence for investigating the hydrological drought regime in the wuding river basin to that end nonstationary test methods were performed on hydrological sequences and data was segmented into three parts according to the results of the pettitt test a nonstationary probability distribution was fitted to runoff data with meteorological covariates precipitation temperature and anthropogenic covariates water consumption for social development demand and water consumption triggered by water impounding by check dams after selecting an optimal combination of covariates the nsri was calculated utilizing the gamlss model a newly constructed evaluation threshold was proposed based on the traditional sri threshold the performance of sri and nsri were compared at the dingjiagou station in the wuding river basin results of comparison between index identification and recorded drought events demonstrated that the nsri better performed in drought event identification moreover the nsri identified more frequent severe droughts and extreme droughts therefore the proposed nsri provided a more accurate basis for the identification of drought events which can offer valuable information for drought planning preparedness and mitigation keywords non stationary gamlss hydrological drought drought index 1 introduction as an extreme climatic event commonly covering large areas and extending for long time periods drought has a huge impact on agricultural production eco environment and economic development in the world mukherjee et al 2018 with complex terrain diverse climate types large regional differences and a fragile geographical environment china is one of the countries with the most severe drought impacts including economic losses drought events have occurred frequently in most areas of china in recent years especially in most areas of the north west southwest and southeast chang et al 2016 currently frequent occurrences of long return period droughts have raised questions on our original understanding of droughts and the accuracy of traditional stationary drought frequency calculations in changing environment has come into question kiem and austin 2013 kim and jehanzaib 2020 miao et al 2020 therefore how to recognize and respond to nonstationary drought events or processes has become urgent for global drought assessment and management verdon kidd and kiem 2010 das et al 2020 a drought can be defined as a prolonged period of unusually dry weather in an area where some rain might normally be expected droughts involve water shortages crop damage steam flow reduction and depletion of groundwater and soil moisture kim et al 2014 drought can be monitored by relevant physical characteristics although all droughts are generally driven by extreme meteorological change different surface wading processes have strong reactions to drought events mishra and singh 2010 different fields investigate droughts from different perspectives and potential threats according to their needs to date four categories of droughts have been proposed for characterizing water shortages that occur in different fields i e meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought shukla and wood 2008 however recent studies have reported that the synchronicity of meteorological drought hydrological drought and agricultural drought is getting worse under the influence of changing environment and the information expressed by the various types of drought is more heterogeneous mishra and singh 2010 among all the drought types hydrological drought has been paid great attention due to its fundamental role in water resources management correspondingly a lot of indicators or indices have been developed and used for evaluating hydrological drought mishra and singh 2010 including palmer hydrological drought index phdi standardized runoff index sri streamflow drought index sdi and standardized streamflow index ssi to represent the deficit of water in streamflow groundwater and or water storage in natural lakes and artificial reservoirs haile et al 2020 hao et al 2016 shukla and wood 2008 among all of these indices sri analogous to the standardized precipitation index spi is considered to have an advantage in depicting hydrological aspects of drought due to low data requirement easy calculation multi time scale and predictability thus sri has been widely employed in hydrological drought analysis in recent years however traditional sri does not account for nonstationarity in the calculation process in many regions of china and other countries in the world hydrological sequences vary greatly with time exhibiting nonstationarity under the coupled influence of climate change and anthropogenic activities chang et al 2019 strupczewski et al 2001 wang et al 2015 the fundamental assumption of stationarity used in the traditional hydrological analysis has therefore been widely questioned ammar et al 2020 hui et al 2018 marra et al 2019 in response to this question many methods have been devoted to deal with nonstationarity the copula method hao and aghakouchak 2013 kang and jiang 2019 zhang et al 2021 generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss su and chen 2019 villarini et al 2010 artificial neural networks ann shahabbodin et al 2020 have been commonly used to estimate and analyze the nonstationary characteristics of hydrological drought among these methods the gamlss developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 has been paid much attention because of its advantage in describing the linear or nonlinear relationship between any parameter or random variable distribution also owing to its comprehensive and flexible features this model has been widely used in global hydrological nonstationary analysis wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 zou et al 2018 recently researchers introduced gamlss into nonstationary drought analysis for example wang et al 2015 applied a time dependent standardized precipitation index spit using the gamlss model bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 employed gamlss to develop a time varying non stationary reconnaissance drought index nrdi for drought monitoring in a changing climate yu et al 2019 constructed a bivariate time varying copula model based on gamlss theory and developed a nonstationary joint drought management index jdmi indeed the effectiveness of the gamlss model in nonstationary hydrological calculations has been accepted to further improve the nonstationary drought assessment the gamlss model was selected in this paper to construct the nonstationary sri index for describing the deficit regimes of water in drought events it is known that the covariate selection for the gamlss model directly affects its accuracy zhang et al 2015 researchers have tried to construct models using time as a covariate to analyze the nonstationary drought index park et al 2019 wang et al 2015 although these models can reflect hydrological nonstationarity to a certain extent they do not consider the physical mechanisms driving the hydrological process change large scale climate patterns are considered as the main drivers of interannual and interdecadal variability in hydrological variables zhang et al 2021 in addition anthropogenic activities such as water consumption for industry and agriculture increasing in line with increases in population and social development have significant influences on the hydrological process these activities together with climate change trigger the hydrological drought trend when the drought occurring li et al 2020 thus it is logical to link the hydrological drought index to climate change and anthropogenic activities which will help explain the variability of index das et al 2020 proposed a nonstationary gamma distribution with climate indices in its location parameter as the gamlss covariate li et al 2019 employed the gamlss model using observed precipitation for nonstationary frequency analysis wang et al 2015 used the soil and water assessment tool swat to investigate varying anthropogenic forcing and calculated human induced hydrological drought indices nssi which showed that nssi performed better than the traditional ssi in luan river basin zhang et al 2021 considered reservoir operation agricultural irrigation and soil conservation as anthropogenic impacts on runoff and developed the nonstationary meteorological and hydrological drought index nmhdi providing valuable information for drought management all these studies indicate that characterizing the impact of anthropogenic activities in an appropriate way when constructing the gamlss model can improve the model in response to the physical mechanism combining gamlss and sri zou et al 2018 proposed a gamlss based sri and applied it to the wei river basin in china in order to investigate the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on hydrological drought jehanzaib et al 2020 conducted a similar study to analyze the impact and scale effects of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought in the han river basin of korea these two studies mainly estimated the impacts of climate change and human activities on regional or watershed sri index by reconstructing the natural runoff series rather than describing the physical driving mechanisms of hydrological drought this paper aims to develop a nonstationary standardized runoff index based on the gamlss model integrating climate and anthropogenic factors in order to assess the nonstationary change of hydrological drought in a changing environment the main tasks of this paper are as follow 1 perform stationary tests on the observed runoff sequences to identify the nonstationary characteristics in the hydrological process namely determine the changepoints and segment the runoff records according to these points 2 select the optimal covariates for the gamlss model 3 calculate the threshold of hydrological drought level in the wuding river basin to redefine regional hydrological drought events and 4 compare the nsri and sri with actual drought events to detect the performance of the nsri in drought identification it is expected to provide a technical framework for understanding and assessing regional hydrological drought in the changing environment and to provide beneficial references for regional drought monitoring forecasting and policy making 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the wuding river is a first order tributary of the yellow river in china with a length of 491 2 km and the basin area is about 30 261 km2 the river originates from the ordos desert in shaanxi province and inner mongolia running on the loess plateau and flows into the yellow river in qingjian country of shaanxi province it has several branches including hailiutu luhe yuxi huaining and dali rivers tian et al 2019 the wuding river basin is located in the north of loess plateau with a typical continental arid and semi arid climate pattern the average annual precipitation varies between 300 and 500 mm 65 of which falls between july and september the average annual runoff of this basin is 15 4 billion m3 since the 1980s the precipitation in the wuding river basin has decreased year by year which has led to the reduction of runoff as the major supplement of runoff what s more the middle and lower reaches of the wuding river even dried up 17 times from 1975 to 2004 which caused hydrological droughts the drought in the wuding river basin directly affects the economic and social development of the surrounding cities in recent years droughts have occurred more frequently therefore it is essential to study the drought patterns and take effective countermeasures to deal with the drought problem in the wuding river basin dingjiagou gauge is the control site in the upper and middle reaches of the wuding river basin the gauge monitors a drainage area of 23 422 km2 accounting for 77 4 of the total basin the basin above the dingjiagou gauge was selected as the study area in this paper as shown in fig 1 2 2 data the monthly runoff data from dingjiagou gauge for 1959 2010 was obtained from hydrological manuals published by the hydrology bureau of the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc china the meteorological data including precipitation p and air temperature t were provided by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration the area precipitation and average temperature of the watershed above the dingjiagou gauge were calculated by the thiessen polygon method based on the meteorological stations distributed in and around the study area fig 2 the design construction and operation data of check dams in the wuding river basin were obtained from the water conservancy survey in yulin shaanxi province in this study the calculation of water consumption triggered by the water impounding of the check dam wc was based on the regional precipitation area measured runoff data the total control area of the check dam the total design storage capacity and the effective storage capacity of the check dam the calculation method was the reduction coefficient method first the watershed was divided into precipitation regions according to thiessen polygons and the area and reduction coefficient of each precipitation region was obtained total control area of the check dam effective storage capacity area of precipitation region total designed storage capacity in principle the wc was the measured runoff data multiplied by the reduction coefficient and 603 key check dams in the wuding river basin were involved in the reduction calculation the water consumption for social development demand wd in this study refers to the part taken from surface water the yulin city covers almost all of the industrial irrigation and afforestation areas and towns in the wuding river basin and the main sources of data were from the statistical publications of yulin city including yulin water resources bulletin yulin statistical yearbook and shaanxi water statistical yearbook since the water used by rural residents and livestock in the wuding river basin mainly comes from groundwater this study only considered water used by industry irrigation afforestation and urban residents equal to the water consumption coefficient multiplied by water withdrawal 3 method 3 1 gamlss model the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss was proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 a kind of semi parametric regression model it can be used to describe the linear or nonlinear relationship between any statistical parameter and the explanatory parameter of random variable sequences su and chen 2019 villarini et al 2010 the nonstationarity can be considered in the process of probability distribution estimation of hydrological series by the gamlss model which considers the change of time series yt t 1 2 n following the probability density function f yt θ t conditional on θ t θ t 1 θ t 2 θ tp here θ t is a vector including the p parameter of the distribution and the kth parameter of a given distribution is connected to explanatory variables through the monotonic link functions as follows 1 g k θ k x k β k j 1 j k z jk γ jk where θ k is a vector of length n β k is a parameter vector of length j k x k is an n j k fixed known design matrix and z jk is a nonparametric additive function of γ jk if j k 0 the model is reduced to a fully parametric gamlss model without regard to the impact of random items the function is as follows 2 g k θ k x k β k in the process of nonstationary analysis and calculation of hydrological sequences less than or equal to three parameters were usually chosen for fitting and the influence of random items was not considered in this study gamlss was applied to construct a nonstationary model for runoff change analysis in the study area within the gamlss framework the runoff time series was assumed to be distributed with its location parameter μ and scale parameter σ linked to different covariates when a single covariate was chosen for fitting observations might show a nonlinear behavior over the covariate parameters were described by an optimized polynomial function as follows 3 g 1 μ t g 1 μ t a 0 a 1 t a q t q when multiple covariates were selected various covariates connected linearly in the gamlss model generally akaike information criterion aic and schwarz bayesian criterion sbc are selected to obtain the optimal model to ensure the model accuracy and prevent the model from overfitting for qualitative evaluation the gamlss model used a q q plot and worm plot while for quantitative evaluation the model used the mean value variance skewness of residuals filliben correlation coefficient and k s test 3 2 standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 proposed the standardized runoff index sri which is calculated based on the assumption of gamma distribution das et al 2020 the calculation method is as follows 4 f y 1 μ σ γ σ y σ 1 e y μ where μ and σ are the location and scale parameters respectively f y is the probability density function pdf and y 0 μ 0 σ 0 the maximum likelihood method is often used to estimate parameter μ and σ the cumulative probability distribution function cdf of runoff sequence y for a certain time scale can be defined as follows 5 f y 0 y f y d y normalizing the probability of the gamma distribution the sri can be obtained as follows 6 sri k m c 2 m c 1 m c 0 d 3 m d 2 m d 1 m 1 0 7 m 2 l n f where c1 c2 c3 d1 d2 d3 k are empirical parameters c0 2 515517 c1 0 802853 c2 0 010328 d1 1 432788 d2 0 189269 d3 0 001308 when f 0 5 then k 1 when f 0 5 then k 1 table 1 wet and drought period classification based on the sri 3 3 mann kendall mk trend test the nonparametric mann kendall trend test was proposed by mann and kendall hamed and rao 1998 mann 1945 and has been widely used to test the trend of time series in hydrology morbidelli et al 2018 rashid et al 2015 tyralis et al 2018 yue and wang 2004 the null hypothesis of this test states that the data x 1 x n is a sample of n independent and identically distributed random variables the test statistic z is calculated as follows 8 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 9 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n y j y k 10 s g n y j y k 1 i f y j y k 0 0 i f y j y k 0 1 i f y j y k 0 where y is the variable n is the sample size var s is the variance of s and var s n n 1 2n 5 18 considering the statistic s is approximately distributed normally when n 10 in a two sided test for trend the null hypothesis h0 is rejected if z z 1 α 2 which is z z 1 α 2 or z z 1 α 2 at the level of α significance indicating a significant decreasing or increasing trend 3 4 construction of nonstationary sri the construction of nsri was based on the gamlss model and the calculation of sri the runoff data was first input into the gamlss model as fitting data the optimal combination of covariates was obtained and the aic and sbc criteria were combined and worm plot and q q plot of the gamlss model were used then the corresponding optimal nonstationary model acquired two expressions about the location and scale parameters such as fig 2 these expressions clearly described the relationship between covariates and runoff data by transforming the location and scale parameters of runoff data into covariates finally replacing these two expressions with the location and scale parameters respectively the covariates were integrated into the calculation of the sri the traditional threshold of sri which does not account for hydrological nonstationarity is no longer applicable to nsri to construct the nonstationary evaluation threshold the first step was to calculate the runoff anomaly percentage then the classification criteria of runoff anomaly percentage were combined and the corresponding frequency of each type of drought was obtained finally the cumulative frequency of each type of drought was correlated with the cumulative frequency curve of nsri and the threshold of different droughts was obtained the main process of the standardized runoff index construction is shown in fig 2 4 results 4 1 nonstationary analysis fig 3 a shows the mann kendall m k trend test results of the annual runoff series in the study area demonstrating a significant downward trend with great fluctuations it can be seen from the runoff sequence that it peaked at 155 069 m3 in 1964 reaching a minimum in 1981 and the trend had gradually stabilized since 1989 the absolute value of m k parameter z was 6 179 passing the 95 confidence test certifying the negative trend of runoff data moreover the pettitt test presented two change points in the runoff sequence namely at 1978 and 1996 drawn in fig 3 a accordingly the sequences were divided into three parts 1959 to 1978 1979 to 1995 and 1996 to 2010 in which the period of 1959 1978 was considered as near natural period and the rest periods were defined as impacted periods the corresponding segmented mean values were 104 986 m3 77 292 m3 and 65 915 m3 showing a decreasing trend what s more the negative trends of runoff were also found at seasonal scales shown in the seasonal variation in fig 3 b above all the nonstationary runoff sequences in the study area were verified long term changes in annual precipitation water consumption triggered by the water impounding of the check dam wc and water consumption for social development demand wd in the study area are shown in fig 3 a and c it is clear from the figures that the precipitation displayed a significant variation similar to the runoff oscillation except a declining trend of about 2 3 this implies that as a typical region in loess plateau the wuding river basin has a positive correlation between precipitation and runoff although the land cover and anthropogenic impacts were constantly occurring and changing the coupled points in the precipitation runoff chart in fig 3 d also verify it opposite to the reductions in precipitation and runoff sequences annual wd represented a dramatic increase with the lowest value in 1977 and the relatively higher level from 1996 to 1999 the average annual wd was 15 285 m3 accounting for about 18 of the mean annual runoff different from wd the wc series did not show sustainable growth on one hand the total storage capacity of check dams increased with the construction of new dams on the other hand the storage capacity decreased with the filling and retirement of check dams it is known that check dam projects have played an important role in the water and soil conservation of the loess plateau in china controlling serious soil erosion and promoting the greening of the loess plateau meanwhile it is also found that check dams blocked a certain amount of water that should have entered the river leading to the attenuation of runoff in the basin fig 3 d indicates the correlation between runoff and wc wd it can be seen from this figure that the total water consumption covering wc and wd was significantly negative with runoff variation namely runoff was reducing when the total water consumption was increasing it implies that the wc and wd are important drives that impact the runoff variation in the wuding river basin and should be considered in gamlss model construction 4 2 modeling with gamlss the traditional hydrological calculations were made under the assumption of stationarity meaning the hydrological series kept its distribution properties invariant with time implying free of trends and abrupt changes wang et al 2015 rendering the traditional approach unsuitable for nonstationary sequence analysis in this study the gamlss model was employed to investigate the calculation of the nonstationary hydrological drought index by introducing suitable covariates to filter appropriate variables this paper divided the runoff series into three parts 1959 1978 1979 1995 1996 2010 to improve the fitting quality and determine the covariates used for constructing the gamlss model to date the gamlss covariates mainly included time temperature and precipitation among them time as a covariate has certain limitations for gamlss modeling because it cannot comprehensively represent the physical process of hydrological change this paper therefore selected precipitation p and temperature t as climatic covariates of gamlss for hydrological drought because they aid in describing the hydrological process not only climatic elements have impacted the hydrological process but anthropogenic activities have also been driving the watershed nonstationary hydrological variation in recent years it is well known that humans mainly change the dynamics of the water cycle through dams constructed for water storage and through water withdrawals for industrial agricultural or domestic purposes haddeland et al 2014 and further alter hydrological processes and have exerted global scale impacts on water resources the 2018 edition of the united nations world water development report has emphasized that increasing water demand will follow population growth economic development and changing consumption patterns in the next two decades up to 5 500 to 6 000 km3 per year by 2050 boretti and rosa 2019 it triggers more dams constructed or maintained for water storage more water withdrawal required for global water supply and implies greater influence on river hydrological process however the impact of anthropogenic activities has rarely been considered in gamlss studies that use gamlss to analyze the coupled impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological drought jehanzaib et al 2020 zou et al 2018 did not take the anthropogenic activities as a covariate that is anthropogenic activities were not directly considered in the construction of nonstationary models many studies have indicated that the intensity of anthropogenic activities has been continuously increasing with the repaid economic growth in the wuding river basin and these activities have also triggered regional hydrological variation zhang et al 2016 dang et al 2021 as a result it is essential to carry out the nonstationary analysis of regional hydrological drought in the study area with the factors of anthropogenic activities as covariates literature survey of the wuding river basin shows that the regional anthropogenic impact is mainly reflected in two aspects one refers to direct water consumption for social development demand wd which includes surface and groundwater for the development of industry agriculture and living standards what s more the significant increase in water demand has led to severe hydrological drought together with climate change dang et al 2021 the other one is water impounding by hydraulic structures statistics show that 11 602 check dams were built in the basin until 2017 including 1155 key dams 3747 medium sized dams and 6700 small scale dams tian et al 2019 in the last 60 years the number and influence of check dams have been in the process of continuous fluctuations due to the abandonment of old check dams and construction of new check dams although literature indicates that check dams have played a critical role in controlling soil erosion and improving the ecological environment in the loess plateau it is no doubt also true that check dams especially small ones have impounded a lot of water that should have entered the river channel constantly impacting hydrological variations in the wuding river basin han et al 2019 shi et al 2019 above all the water consumption triggered by the water impounding of check dam wc and water consumption for social development demand wd should be considered as covariates of gamlss to illustrate the anthropogenic impact on regional hydrological drought in general five types of distributions i e normal distribution no lognormal distribution logno gamma distribution ga weibull distribution wei and gumbel distribution gu were used in fitting hydrological series to ensure the covariates can adequately describe the variation of runoff and avoid over fitting of the model the above mentioned four covariates t p wc and wd were proposed into 19 combinations for fitting the distribution respectively for a single covariate this study selected the least squares fitting with a polynomial of degrees 1 2 and 3 for multiple covariates the covariates were directly input into the model and connected linearly the optimal model was generally selected based on the global deviance g d the akaike information criterion aic and the schwartz s bayesian criterion sbc smaller sbc and aic values correspond to better models usually when the length of the hydrological sequence is greater than 8 the sbc criterion is more accurate than the aic zhang et al 2021 thus this study chose the sbc as the criterion of optimal model selection the sbc values of the gamlss models with various covariate combinations and distributions are shown in fig 4 also five distributions were adopted for fitting the optimal covariates and distribution of nonstationary models were selected using a step by step method and the results for three periods are shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 as shown in fig 4 a the selection of different distribution types greatly influenced the model fitting performance results of logno and ga distributions were better and the optimal distribution was logno as for covariates p and wd played a prominent role in improving the model fitting from 1959 to 1978 among all combinations pw and tpw corresponded to the minimum sbc it implied that pw based and tpw based gamlss models had the best performance in fitting the variation of runoff data to further judge the estimation quality of statistical parameters figure tests should be implemented it can be seen from fig 5 that the gamlss model with pw as a covariate performed well in the normal q q plot in addition except for a few points the rest of points were within the 95 confidence interval between the two grey dotted lines which indicated that the pw logno based gamlss model was able to fit data effectively fig 5 b indicates that compared with 1959 1978 different covariate combinations had a more significant impact on model fitting in 1979 1995 in addition the multivariate fitting model was more stable than the univariate model representing a complex relationship between runoff and covariates of all the covariates wd had a decisive influence on model fitting changes in the sbc values showed the model with tpc as a covariate was significantly better than other combinations comparing the results of different distribution types it was found that the no normal distribution was the optimal distribution thus this study implemented the figure test on gamlss models with similar covariate combinations wc pcw tpcw and twc to further distinguish the degree of fitting of hydrological data to the model fig 6 as shown in fig 6 the worm plots indicated that the tpcw no based model performed better than others for the residual points of this model all passed the 95 confidence test similar to the last two periods covariate combinations represented a greater impact on the fitting than distribution type in 1996 2010 as shown in fig 4 c among covariates wd played a significant role showing all multivariate combination models considering wd had smaller sbc values by comparison tpw was considered optimal additionally there was little difference among the results of the five distributions in which no was relatively better fig 7 illustrates the figure test of the gamlss model with tpw covariates and no distribution there was no anomaly observed in the worm plot implying the tpw no based gamlss model reflected the regime of hydrological data it can be concluded that the optimal gamlss models of three periods were 1 lognormal distribution nonstationary model with precipitation and wd as covariate i e pw logno based gamlss model 2 normal distribution nonstationary model with temperature precipitation wc and wd as covariates i e tpcw no based gamlss model and 3 normal distribution nonstationary model with precipitation temperature and wd as covariates i e tpw no based gamlss model 4 3 calculation of indices as mentioned in section 4 1 the index calculation was divided into the near natural period and two impacted periods according to the optimal nonstationary models developed in three periods the monthly non stationary sri nsri of three periods can be calculated by the method mentioned in section 3 4 results of comparison of sri and nsri are shown in fig 8 as shown in violin plots the variation of nsri mainly between 2 and 2 and the mean value of nsri showed a gradually decreasing trend from 1959 to 2010 in the near natural period 1959 1978 except for some extreme cases the indices were mainly distributed around zero fig 8 a with the addition of anthropogenic influence the drought degree identified by the indices gradually increased fig 8 c between sri and nsri the similarities in trend were obviously seen while the differences significantly existed in the index change implying the influence of nonstationarity on the hydrological index as shown in the scatter plots of the three periods fig 8 the variations of nsri and sri showed a significant positive trend indicating that they had a strong similarity in trend variation nevertheless the violin plots showed the difference in the numerical distribution of nsri and sri it was clear in the near natural period fig 8 a that the mean value of sri was higher than nsri with a similar numerical distribution besides the distribution of the two indices gradually presented significant differences over time due to the continuous increase of water consumption for social development demand wd and the change of water impounding of the check dam wc the value of nsri gradually changed from a more uniform distribution near 0 to a negative value fig 8 b and c in addition it can be found from fig 8 that nsri was more sensitive to extreme situations indicating the variation range of the nsri superior to the sri 5 discussion 5 1 drought event identification 5 1 1 threshold construction since the traditional drought classification of the sri is based on stationary consumption the same as spi hao et al 2016 it cannot be directly employed to account for nonstationarity so this study constructed a new classification standard to accurately describe the nsri the first step in this construction was to calculate the anomaly of measured runoff data in the study area from 1959 to 2010 then the runoff anomaly ratio was obtained secondly the runoff anomaly ratio was divided into seven gages i e extreme drought severe drought moderate drought near normal moderate wet very wet and extreme wet concerning the traditional sri classification table 2 at this time the cumulative frequencies of each grade were accumulated sequentially and the cumulative frequencies corresponding to seven grades were 36 22 41 83 47 92 71 15 75 16 78 53 100 the third was to draw the histogram of the frequency distribution of the nsri series as shown in fig 9 fig 9 a represents a good fit between the normal distribution curve and the nsri values and fig 9 b shows the cumulative distribution function of the index according to the cumulative frequency values above the critical values of hydrological drought indicators were calculated as 0 39 0 25 0 15 0 44 0 55 and 0 66 respectively table 2 illustrates a comparison of the constructed thresholds between nsri and sri index it can be seen that the nsri redefined the occurrence and intensity of hydrological drought events different from the sri classification specifically the threshold of hydrological drought increased from 1 to 0 15 implying drought events were more likely under nonstationary conditions than ever in addition the range of indicators for each type decreased illustrating the drought events developed more rapidly than those in the natural period did in addition the range from extreme drought to extreme flood had changed from 2 2 to 0 39 0 66 and it could greatly trigger the occurrence of the sudden sharp drought flood turn events 5 1 2 drought classification the drought events in the wuding river basin can be identified according to the threshold of indexes nsri and sri for better comparison the hydrological drought indexes sequences were divided into three sections i e period a 1959 1978 period b 1979 1995 and period c 1996 2010 the percentages of two drought indicators on a monthly scale are shown in fig 10 which illustrates the occurrence frequencies of drought events in the three periods according to the variation of different levels of drought identified by sri it was concluded that all types of drought events were on the increase namely the basin was in a trend of drought and could continue to increase however this result could not be effectively verified by the trend change of the meteorological drought index spi in the basin the figure shows the nsri based results were different from the sri mainly representing the difference in the proportion of drought events identified especially in more than severe drought events as is shown in the graph the frequency of severe drought recognized by nsri was 36 68 during 1996 2010 and the mean occurrence frequency of extreme drought events identified by sri and nsri was 2 23 and 5 76 respectively fig 10 d from the statistical results of the two indicators a consensus can be obtained that both near normal and extreme droughts showed an increasing trend fig 10 a and b implying the probability of extreme drought will increase in the wuding river basin in the future and the corresponding countermeasures should be taken however it is also seen that moderate drought and severe drought were fundamentally different in the identification proportion and evolution trend fig 10 c and d thus further comparison and verification with historical events should be done 5 2 performance analysis although the results of identification of drought events by nsri and sri have been compared in the previous section the rationality of the nsri cannot be effectively verified in this section the actual drought events recorded in different materials were used to check the identification qualities of nsri and sri aiming to evaluate the performance of the two indicators in this study the documented drought events in the wuding river basin covering 1959 2010 were collected from the shaanxi province drought disaster yearbook and chinese meteorological disasters dictionary as described in the table 4 in appendices since most drought events recorded were counted at the seasonal scale for comparison purposes this study computed the seasonal recognition results by nsri and sri for checking it was noted that spring is from march to may summer refers to the period from june to august autumn is from september to november and winter refers to the period from december to the next february in the wuding river basin the statistical results of different periods are listed in the table 4 including the information of drought events recorded in the materials and the identification results of nsri and sri it can be seen from the table 4 that seasonal and continuous droughts frequently occurred in the study area and many long term drought events have been recorded in the literature however there is a significant difference between nsri and sri in responding to these actual events for example it was documented that a severe drought occurred in the winter of 1961 which was recognized by nsri effectively but sri did not in 1995 a regional severe drought was recorded and covered more than 300 days the identification results showed both nsri and sri recognized the occurrence of drought events in which the results of nsri were closer to the actual situation from the respective duration while sri only recognized spring drought to compare the recognition performance of nsri and sri more intuitively this study counted the recognition rate of drought events combining with the records in the table 4 as shown in fig 11 this figure demonstrates the identification of two indices in intensity frequency and time of drought events respectively it should be pointed out that drought occurrence identification took the year as the unit while time identification was identified in seasons the magnitude identification was counted by the number of the historical drought events with various degrees correctly identified fig 11 illustrates that the recognition rate of the nsri index was 100 for the occurrence of drought events while the sri only recognized 51 11 of drought events that occurred from the perspective of the occurrence times of drought events the nsri had better performance with 91 11 accuracy greater than sri with 40 additionally it was found from the figure that the nsri was efficient and identified 86 67 of the historical drought events at different levels equal to more than three times of sri identification rates it illustrates that the nsri is more suitable in the actual conditions and can produce a relatively correct recognition rate to further analyze the identification results of two indicators the confusion matrix of nsri and sri was calculated as shown in table 3 therein drought events were divided into three types severe drought moderate drought and normal and the identification results of indicators in drought intensity are counted accuracy represents the proportion of correctly identified events to total recognized events while precision notes the fraction of accurately identified drought events among all recorded drought events the recall is the ratio of recorded drought events to all recognized drought events it can be seen from table 3 that the accuracy and recall of nsri were obviously higher than of sri illustrating that the nsri has an advantage in identifying all kinds of drought events the precision of the two indicators was relatively low and nsri was lower than sri only reaching 23 8 this was because it identified a lot of drought events by its high sensitivity thus it is considered that the identification ability of nsri was generally better than sri 5 3 comparison with literature many studies have revealed that the stationarity assumption based traditional indexes or methods cannot accurately identify drought events under changing environments especially in areas that are strongly influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activities such as the wuding river basin this study constructed a nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri to identify nonstationary hydrological droughts under changing environment therein precipitation and temperature were used as climatic factors the water consumption triggered by the water impounding of the check dam wc and water consumption for social development demand wd represented anthropogenic factors all of them were selected as covariates to estimate the dynamic parameters of nsri for the construction of nonstationary models through the analysis of these variables in previous sections it can be seen that the wd in the study area showed an increasing trend from 1959 to 2010 which is the main part of the direct impact of human activities corresponding to the decrease in runoff fig 3 b however the relationship between observed precipitation and runoff in the study area was not good fig 3 c although the fluctuation of runoff series was consistent with precipitation it can be inferred that precipitation does play a significant role in runoff change but the human impact should not be ignored therefore it is necessary to introduce the anthropogenic factors as covariates for nonstationary model fitting in this study the performance of nsri constructed in identifying drought events confirmed this similar results were also obtained in recent studies for example li et al 2019 added observed precipitation as a covariate in nonstationary runoff frequency analysis and effectively improved the accuracy of frequency analysis zou et al 2018 and jehanzaib et al 2020 estimated the impacts of climate change and human activities on sri index by reconstructing the natural runoff series but they were not insufficient in describing and assessing the nonstationary mechanisms of human induced hydrological drought of course this analysis of the nonstationary index is not a panacea and needs to be applied differently according to the actual situation for instance in some areas where groundwater is the main water source the effect of wd as a covariate may not be good at this time other variables should be considered as covariates li and tan 2015 proposed a check dam index to represent the effect of human activities kang and jiang 2019 added a modified reservoir index as a covariate to evaluate the effect of reservoir regulation when reassessing the hydrological drought of the yangtze river under changing environment wang et al 2015 took soi and amo as meteorological covariates to obtain a human induced index through swat which greatly improved the efficiency of nonstationary index in the luan river basin thus it can be seen that more factors including climate and anthropogenic ones should be considered in the construction of nsri which may positively affect the performance of the index moreover the covariate fitting methods used were generally linear in the nsri hao et al 2019 suggested that the nonlinear fitting could better reflect the variation of values thus this approach should be tried in the future improvement of nsri sarhadi et al 2016 and park et al 2019 proposed that traditional stationary drought indexes would underestimate the frequency of extreme events under different references if the stationary model fitted the overall trend of the entire sequence meanwhile the fitting could be affected by the length of data and further underestimate the extreme events from the results in this study the rule is true in the wuding river basin table 3 sri underestimated the frequency of extreme hydrological drought events when runoff showed a downward trend fig 3 a thereby risking a drought disaster in contrast nsri overcame this limitation by considering suitable covariates and reflected the potential influence of human activities on the drought process because most of the historical drought events recorded were mainly severe droughts and extreme droughts the mild drought events were difficult to verify well as a result the identification capability of the nsri can only be obtained by comparing it with severe droughts and extreme droughts recorded in future research the latest data should be added continuously to improve the index and classification threshold to realize better identification of hydrological drought in the study area 6 conclusions the hydrological sequences have appeared nonstationary in recent years due to the coupled impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities the traditional hydrological drought indicators based on the premise of the consistency hypothesis often failed in identifying and assessing nonstationary hydrological drought therefore this study constructed a gamlss based nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri to identify hydrological drought in a coupled human water system and employed direct human induced water consumption as covariates to implement a nonstationary analysis of hydrological drought index in loess plateau the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 investigating sequences that affect runoff this study determined optimal covariates and distribution of gamlss based nonstationary hydrological drought models by the sbc criterion in three periods 1959 1978 1979 1995 1996 2010 different from the previous investigations water consumption for social development demand wd and water consumption triggered by water impounding of check dam wc were selected as optimal covariates with precipitation and temperature aiming to represent the significant impact of anthropogenic influence on drought event occurrence and process the result indicated that introducing the wd and or wc can effectively improve the fitting performance of the models in human induced periods 2 a gamlss based nonstationary standardized runoff index nsri was employed and the corresponding classification threshold was proposed by referring to the sri evaluation the results of comparison of nsri and sri indicated that nsri considering human impact had a great advantage in identifying hydrological drought events in human induced periods additionally nsri is especially sensitive to severe drought and extreme drought while sri has an underestimation of extreme drought in the wuding river basin also from 1959 to 2010 the analysis results in the study area illustrated the basin was in a trend of drought which could continue to increase showing all types of regional drought events were on the increase a according to the comparison results with the historical drought events recorded it is found that the accuracy and recall of nsri were obviously higher than sri implying that the nsri had better performance in identifying all kinds of drought events results showed that nsri identified 86 67 of the historical drought events at different levels equal to more than three times of sri identification rates it proves that the nsri is more suitable in a coupled human water system and can get a relatively correct recognition rate b although nsri performed better than sri under changing environments and can be used as a new approach for hydrological drought analysis it is not a panacea and needs to be applied differently according to the actual situation through comparison with literature it is considered that more variables representing human impact should be tried in the calculation of nsri to improve the recognition of hydrological drought and aid decision makers in drought planning preparedness and
