4610,streamflow time series data are fundamental to hydrological science and water management applications which are commonly derived from stage discharge rating curves the rating curves are usually nonstationary due to temporal characteristics of stream channel and human activities such as indiscriminate dig of sediment this implies the need for an efficient method to estimate nonstationary rating curves from an adequate dataset this study employed a shifting method to estimate the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties the method includes two steps a coupled algorithm pelt crops was first performed to divide the gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple change points in a time series of a residual indicator then the rating curves were calibrated with the baratin stationary model using these homogeneous gaugings within each stationary period the method was applied at shijiao hydrological station in china we found that 1 set the lower and upper limit of parameter crops changepoints for a range of penalties to 0 and inf respectively the whole range of segmentation can be calculated 2 parameter minseglen minimum segment length is of great significance to the segmentation result more changepoints will be detected as the value of minseglen decreasing an appropriate minseglen value should be assigned to find the optimal segmentation 3 the stage discharge relationship in the low flow part is more sensitive to the variation of river topography ten segmentations are needed to produce an accurate discharge for low flow prediction while two segmentations for calibration can produce an accurate discharge for high flow prediction 4 information redundancy exists in the vast amount of gaugings the baratin model can reduce the use of calibration data by employing stage discharge function with a precise exponent from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station keywords nonstationary rating curves baratin changepoint analysis pelt uncertainty analysis shijiao hydrological station in china 1 introduction direct measurements of discharge are time consuming and expensive river discharge time series are monitored by converting continuous water stage records via a stage discharge rating curve iso 1100 2 2010 wmo 2010 usually the rating curve is calibrated at each hydrological station using discrete concurrent measurements of stage and discharge and knowledge on the hydraulic controls which physically determine the stage discharge relation rantz 1982 this indirect calculation of discharge time series can generate a significant amount of discharge uncertainty which will propagate to any hydrological analysis that makes use of discharge time series such as flood frequency analysis steinbakk et al 2016 rainfall runoff model calibration sikorska and renard 2017 hydraulic model calibration douinot et al 2018 and real time flood forecasting ocio et al 2017 to obtain more accurate and reliable discharge data a major challenge is to apply an appropriate method for the estimation of nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties in unstable rivers mansanarez et al 2019 the nonstationarity of the stage discharge relation is mainly affected by numerous and complex processes bed evolution vegetation growth debris ice jams dike break etc herschy 1998 usually there are three alternative methods based on differing assumptions proposed to assess the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties first of all a vpm short for voting point estimation method developed by mcmillan and westerberg 2015 considered that the existing unknown temporal changes in the rating curve lead to epistemic rating curve errors the epistemic uncertainty was quantified and added to other sources of rating curve uncertainty secondly the dynamic method proposed by reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 westerberg et al 2011 jalbert et al 2011 guerrero et al 2012 and morlot et al 2014 attempts to calibrate rating curves continuously varying with time based on the assumption that the stage discharge relation is itself evolving continually thirdly the shifting method proposed by coxon et al 2015 mansanarez et al 2019 assumes that sudden rating changes usually occur after morphogenic events the dates of rating changes divide the whole stage discharge gaugings into some static period nonstationary rating curves need to be calibrated across the successive stationary periods since the sudden rating changes are confirmed to be more widespread in the operational practice mansanarez et al 2019 the shifting method will be further studied in the following text the shifting method has two main issues to be solved detect the dates of rating changes and apply a stationary stage discharge model to each period mansanarez et al 2019 for detecting the dates of changes besides analyzing the information from channel bathymetry profiles zhang et al 2015 stage continuous records reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 sediment transport capacity mansanarez et al 2019 flood events return period mcmillan et al 2010 can be used the most common practice is to apply a segmentation procedure hubert 2000 to the residuals between the stage discharge points and the current rating curve such that the sample means of each segment is significantly different from the mean of each of the neighboring segments morlot et al 2014 rantz 1982 nevertheless this classical segmentation procedure cannot tackle a series of much more than one hundred terms hubert 2000 for estimating successive stationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties the shift corrections method rantz 1982 wmo 2010 derives the shifted rating curves by modifying some selected properties of a base rating curve besides mansanarez et al 2019 proposed a novel stage period discharge spd model for handling the time varying nature of rating curves information from new calibration data previous calibration data and previous rating curves are used to develop a new rating curve in addition since spd model is an extension of baratin model proposed by le coz et al 2014 it can make full use of the hydraulic information of the hydrological station however the spd model restrictively assumes that the stability periods are known and the structure of the rating curve equation determined by hydraulic controls stays constant across periods no matter for dynamic or shifting models the above nonstationary rating methods are driven by natural hydrological processes few studies focus on rivers severely affected by human activities such as sand excavation or construction lu et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the indiscriminate dig of sediment aggravates river bed evolution leading to the variation in the structure of hydraulic control of hydrological station in a short time therefore the latest spd model is no longer suitable for this kind of hydrological station it is necessary to propose a calibration method for such hydrological station besides measuring the stage discharge gaugings frequently leads to a vast amount of data dividing such gauging samples into successive statistic periods is another problem to be solved although morlot et al 2014 divided gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple change points in time series of a residual indicator the employed hubert segmentation procedure hubert 2000 cannot deal with such long sequences over the years to overcome the challenge that the number of possible solutions to the multiple change point increases as datasets increases in length several multiple changepoints search algorithms have been developed most notably the binary segmentation algorithm scott and knott 1974 sen and srivastava 1975 the segment neighborhood algorithm auger and lawrence 1989 bai and perron 1998 optimal partitioning jackson et al 2005 and more recently the pruned exact linear time algorithm killick et al 2012 all of which can be applied to the division of the sample based on the previously mentioned indicator the object of this article is to calibrate an appropriate nonstationary rating curve accounting for the changing river topography for producing an accurate discharge prediction the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a brief description of the study area and data is given in section 2 the method including the segmentation procedure based on the pelt crops algorithm and the baratin stationary model and the experimental design are detailed in section 3 all results are presented in section 4 the discussion about the sensitivity of parameter minseglen and crops on segmentation the performance for high flow and low flow prediction the baratin model and several prospects are drawn in section 5 a conclusion is shown in section 6 2 study area and data the north river is the second largest tributary of the pearl river located in the middle and north of guangdong province china straddling the tropic of cancer the north river basin covers a region of subtropical to a tropical monsoon climate during the flood season from april to september about 95 of the sediment load and 80 of the water discharge are delivered the mainstream of the north river converges with the west river at sixianjiao it then flows into the pearl river estuary forming the north river and west river delta nrwrd which is one of the fastest developing regions in china shijiao hydrological station 112 9578 e 23 5576 n is one of the most critical hydrological station in the north river basin fig 1 since it s located at the apex of the nrwrd and records the amount of discharge entering the north river networks the discharge of shijiao hydrological station plays a critical role in flood control drought resistance and water resource allocation of the cities such as foshan and guangzhou located in lower reaches of the north river basin due to the booming economy and intensive human activities in the nrwrd region a new environmental problem such as indiscriminate sand excavation emerges in the recent two decades liu et al 2018 the process of river bed evolution has been aggravated resulting in frequent changes in the stage discharge relationship nonstationary rating curves need to be calibrated to obtain accurate and reliable discharge data to investigate the applicability of the method proposed in section 3 520 pairs of direct stage discharge gaugings from 2003 to 2008 and the corresponding cross section bathymetric measurements data of shijiao hydrological station were extracted from the annual hydrological report p r china whose reliability and homogeneity are strictly inspected by the hydrology bureau of guangdong province before they were published besides to evaluate the performance of the nonstationary rating curve for high flow and low flow prediction flood series from 2003 to 2008 of the shijiao hydrological station also are extracted from the annual hydrological report p r china this dataset contains 3994 pairs of stage discharge gaugings 3 method the method proposed in this study included two steps the first step was to perform a segmentation procedure based on a multiple changepoints detection algorithm this step aims to divide the whole sample of gaugings into chronological hydraulically homogeneous families each family corresponds to a stationary period the second step was to estimate stationary rating curves using the baratin stationary model based on these homogeneous gaugings within each stationary period fig 2 shows the flowchart for the method 3 1 segmentation procedure for chronological gaugings 3 1 1 residual indicator identification according to the method mentioned in section 1 that uses the gaugings information directly to determine stationary periods a residual indicator between gaugings and a time invariant mean rating curve meanrc needs to be identified morlot et al 2014 in general the stage discharge relationship can be expressed hydraulically by a power function defined in eq 1 iso 1100 2 2010 wmo 2010 meanrc is defined by fitting eq 1 to the whole gauging points of a hydrometric station 1 q h a h b c where q is the discharge h h b is the water stage relative to a given datum at the staff gauge a is the scaling coefficient b is the cease to flow reference level and c is the exponent the above three parameters were estimated by linearizing eq 1 and minimizing the sum of the squared residuals a residual indicator α m defined in eq 2 represents the difference between the water stage of gauging i and the water stage of the corresponding meanrc morlot et al 2014 2 α h g i h mrc q g i where i 1 n n is the number of the whole of gaugings h g i is the water stage of gauging i h mrc q g i is the water stage of meanrc corresponding to q g i and q g i is the discharge of gauging i 3 1 2 multiple changepoints detection changepoints are those points in a data sequence where a change is observed in the statistical properties such as a change in mean variance or distribution more formally assume there is an ordered sequence of data y 1 n y 1 y n the model will have a number of changepoints m together with their positions τ 1 m τ 1 τ m each changepoint position is an integer between 1 and n 1 inclusive we define τ 0 0 and τ m 1 n and assume that the changepoints are ordered such that τ i τ j if and only if i j consequently the m changepoints will split the data into m 1 segments with the i th segment containing y τ i 1 1 τ i one commonly used approach to identify multiple changepoints is to minimize eq 3 3 i 1 m 1 c y τ i 1 1 τ i β f m where c is the cost function for a segment which is usually introduced by modeling the data with segment specific parameters the form of the cost depends not only on modeling assumptions about the data s distribution but also the type of change mean variance both mean and variance to be detected β f m is a penalty to guard against overfitting the penalty provides a compromise between lots of small changes and no changes in practice the choice of penalty by far the most common choice is one which is linear in the number of changepoints that is β f m β m then the number and the position of the changepoints can be jointly estimated by solving a penalized optimization problem specifically by minimize eq 4 haynes et al 2017b jackson et al 2005 killick et al 2012 4 i 1 m 1 c y τ i 1 1 τ i β binary segmentation bs segment neighborhood sn and pruned exact linear time pelt are the three most widely used changepoint search methods as mentioned in section 1 bs is an approximate search method which means that it is not guaranteed to find the global minimum of eq 3 the advantage of bs is that it is computationally efficient resulting in an o n log n calculation sn is an exact method for most common forms of changepoint models sn searches the entire segmentation space using dynamic programming thus has significant computational cost o q n 2 where q is the maximum number of changepoints one wishes to search for pelt is an exact and computationally efficient method achieved by involving a pruning step within the optimal partitioning op algorithm op is an alternative dynamic programming algorithm proposed by jackson et al 2005 pelt has a computational cost o n that is linear in n while still retaining the exactness of the resulting segmentation to balance the accuracy and computational efficiency the pelt algorithm was used in this article pruning in pelt will depend on the choice of penalty constant β killick et al 2012 however it may be challenging to determine an appropriate penalty value to solve this problem a crops short for changepoints for a range of penalties method haynes et al 2017a is usually coupled with pelt algorithm allowing to specify minimum and maximum penalty values and it returns all segmentations for any penalty between these values rocha et al 2020 these are computed in an efficient manner with a tiny number of runs of the pelt algorithm therefore the coupled algorithm pelt crops was chosen to detect the changepoints in series α m once all the segmentations have been calculated the optimal segmentation result can be determined by constructing a diagnostic plot which was proposed by lavielle 2005 this diagnostic plot represents the relationship between the number of changepoints and the minimum value of segmentation cost if a true changepoint is added to the model the improvement in fit will be large once all the true changes have been added the false changes will not improve the fit much lavielle 2005 suggests choosing the point where the decrease in cost due to detecting a further changepoint noticeable changes this can be thought of as looking for an elbow in the diagnostic plot the points on the elbow are then suggested to be the most feasible segmentation thus this diagnostic plot also can be called elbow plot in practice such an approach can reduce the subjectivity of the penalty selection haynes et al 2017b 3 1 3 normality assumptions checking the pelt crops segmentation procedure is a parametric method normal distribution was chosen to model each segment s statistic specifically for detecting a change in the mean if the data within a segment is modeled as being independent and following a normal distribution then the segment cost in eq 3 and eq 4 can be expressed as eq 5 5 c y s 1 t j s 1 t y j 2 j s 1 t y i 2 n consequently normality assumptions need to be further checked after identifying the changes mainly including three aspects independence check normal distribution check and constant variance check killick 2020 recommends two methods for checking normality assumptions post analysis one approach is to check each segment independently it means that one should test or plot n 1 times if there are n changepoints for the data an alternative to check each segment in turn is to check the residuals of the model fit testing the residuals is more convenient as it can check the entire dataset at once instead of checking all the segments multiple times therefore residuals checking will be applied in section 4 the mentioned changepoints detection algorithms above have been integrated into an r package called changepoint killick and eckley 2014 it contains three core wrapper functions to detect changes in the mean in the variance both in mean and variance for data only changes in mean will be detected for the series α m in this article 3 2 baratin stationary model for rating curve calibration baratin is the application of the bayesian paradigm to the problem of calibrating stationary rating curves based on uncertain gaugings and hydraulic knowledge moyeed and clarke 2005 this framework assumes that rating changes within each period are negligible and is based on the following statistical model le coz et al 2014 3 2 1 measurement error models the measurement error models describe the relationship between the gauging measurements h i q i i 1 n and the real values of water level and associated discharges the following error models are assumed 6 h i h i 7 q i q i ε i q ε i q n 0 μ q i eq 6 assumes that the errors in stage measurements are negligible eq 7 assumes that discharge measurements are affected by gaussian errors with mean zero i e no bias and known standard deviation the so called standard uncertainty 3 2 2 structural error model the structural error model describes the residual errors between true discharge q i and its simplified mathematical representation f h θ rc θ rc a b c are the hydraulic parameters in most cases the function f is given by the elementary hydraulic control or a piecewise combination of several elementary hydraulic controls hydraulic control represents the physical characteristics of the channel and it determines the water depth and the discharge in the river section where the hydrological station is located le coz et al 2014 the stage discharge relationship can be formalized as follows 8 q i f h i θ rc ε i f ε i f n 0 σ f the error term ε i f is the remnant error or called structural error it represents the fact that the rating curve in its assumed mathematical form would not perfectly represent the true stage discharge relationship even if the true stage discharge values were known ε i f are assumed to be independent across gaugings and follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unknown standard deviation σ f i besides considering the heteroscedasticity le coz et al 2014 σ f i are parameterized as a linear function of the discharge computed with the rating curve σ f h i γ γ 1 γ 2 f h i θ rc γ 1 and γ 2 are the structural uncertainty parameters which are estimated along with the hydraulic parameters assuming structural errors and measurement errors are independent the relationship between the observed stage and corresponding discharge values can be then expressed as follows 9 q i f h i θ rc ε i f ε i q ε i f ε i q n 0 σ f 2 h i γ u q i 2 3 2 3 bayesian equations and inference eq 9 involves three hydraulic parameters and two structural uncertainty parameters inference on these five parameters θ θ rc γ is performed through the posterior distribution the probability density function pdf of which is defined as 10 p θ h q posterior p q θ h likelihood p θ prior the likelihood of the observed discharge values q given the hydraulic parameters θ rc structural uncertainty parameters γ and observed stage values h can be expressed as 11 p q θ θ rc γ h p n q i f h i θ rc σ f 2 h i γ u q i 2 where p n z m s is the pdf of a gaussian distribution with mean m and standard deviation s evaluated at value z note that bayesian inference uses the information brought by the gaugings and allows including any knowledge on θ that would be available even before acquiring the gaugings assuming independent priors on each inferred parameter the prior information is encoded as a distribution 12 p θ p a p b p c p γ 1 p γ 2 informative priors on the hydraulic parameters θ rc can be derived from the hydraulic knowledge depending on the type of hydraulic control in particular the exponents in the power rating curve equation like eq 1 can be quite precisely elicited for each hydraulic control more details for deriving these informative priors with hydraulic knowledge can be found in le coz et al 2014 mansanarez 2016 and mansanarez et al 2019 the posterior distribution is explored by sampling realizations using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler for each sampling two chains were drawn each chain was composed of 10 000 simulations a burn in factor was set to 0 5 finally a total of 10 000 parameter values can be obtained for each θ rc i i 1 10 000 a rating curve was computed from the large set of rating curves the statistics calculated at each stage value allows assessing parametric uncertainty of the stage discharge relation besides total uncertainty can be represented by the combination of parametric uncertainty and the uncertainty induced by the structural error a single error sampled in n 0 1 and multiplied by γ 1 γ 2 f h i θ rc was added to each rating curve le coz et al 2014 3 3 experimental design in section 4 1 sixteen experiments table 1 are explored to examine the effects of parameter crops and minseglen on changepoints detection in chronological series α m since these two parameters in the coupled algorithm pelt crops need to be manually specified depending on the data itself in each experimental design perturbation only one parameter is changed while another one is kept constant the minseglen is short for minimum segment length and should be set to a positive integer the default value of minseglen is 2 because two parameters the mean and the variance are estimated per segment at least two data points are needed to do this in this article considering there are 520 pairs stage and corresponding discharge data from 2003 to 2008 at shijiao hydrological station 87 pairs of data on average per year here we take 10 as the step size set the maximum and minimum value of minseglen to 90 and 10 respectively forming two eight group experiments 1 8 and 9 16 with the same crops specifying minimal minseglen to 10 is to ensure robust discharge uncertainty bounds as mentioned in section 3 1 2 parameter crops allows to specify minimum and maximum penalty values and the result returns all segmentations for any penalty between these values when using crops users might like to know the ceiling for the number of changepoints setting the lower penalty to 0 will achieve this in turn the latest version r package of changepoint adds functionality to crops that allows users to use inf infinity as an upper limit so that c 0 inf can be specified such that the whole range of segmentations is calculated however in reality the inf varies from case to case users can put a large number in inf and providing it generates 0 changepoints in the data and then this is equivalent to c 0 inf here we set 1000 in inf for the first eight group experiments furthermore in our computation we found that if 1000 is used as an upper limit a changepoint with an immense penalty value may be solved resulting in the elbow point appears on the left side of the diagnostic plot resulting in just very small amount changepoints are detected this segmentation may not be the real optimal solution thus we set another eight group experiment with a smaller upper limit of 100 to explain this phenomenon more details and the results will be described in the next section 4 results 4 1 identification of the chronological homogeneous gauging samples 4 1 1 segmentation of residual indicator α fig 3 shows the identification process of the residual indicator which mainly includes two steps the first step is to fit the mean rating curve based on the whole 520 pairs of gaugings this step is a non linear fitting problem and three parameters are to be solved for the power function defined in eq 1 here we transform it into a linear fit by setting a fixed exponent value of 1 67 since the exponent value is determined by the type of hydraulic control and the cross section geometry the hydraulic control of shijiao hydrological station is an independent channel control or two continuous channel control at different periods and each hydraulic control can be generalized into a rectangle therefore only the scaling coefficient a and the cease to flow reference level b need to be solved we set the range of b between 6 and 2 with a step size of 0 01 and fit a curve for each value of b the meanrc see fig 3b is the optimal solution with the minimum rmse see fig 3a then the residual indicator α m defined in eq 2 represents the difference between the water stage of gauging i and the water stage of the corresponding meanrc can be calculated after that the segmentation procedure described in section 3 1 2 was applied to detect the multiple changepoints in the mean of the chronological residual indicator α m following the experimental design in section 3 3 two eight group experiments with different parameter sets of crops and minseglen were conducted after all the segmentations were calculated each experiment s optimal segmentation was determined by constructing a diagnostic plot or called elbow plot the subplot a h of fig 4 shows the diagnostic plot for the first eight group experiment with the upper limit of crops was set to 1000 as minseglen decreases the number of detected changepoints increases specifically when minseglen is set to 80 only four changepoints were detected and when minseglen is set to 10 forty changepoints were detected however according to the elbow point selection principle described in section 3 1 2 the optimal segmentation of these eight experiments only detected one changepoint as indicated by the red circle the penalty value is 180 617 when the number of changepoints equals 0 while the penalty value is 19 1285 when the number of changepoints equals 1 the difference between the penalty value corresponding to 0 changepoint and 1changepoint is too large resulting in the elbow point in the latter part of the sequence is not apparent therefore when the upper limit of crops was set to 1000 the position of the first eight group is 280 the subplot i p of fig 4 shows the second eight group experiments diagnostic plot it can be observed that when the upper limit of crops is set to 100 the situation of the number of changepoint equaling 0 cannot be detected the maximum penalty value is 19 1285 when the number of changepoints equals 1 in this way when minseglen decreases and the number of changepoint increases the second elbow point can be captured the optimal segmentation for each experiment was summarized in table 2 note that we have 520 pairs of gaugings so there are 520 residual indicators they are a one to one relationship we number this chronological series from 1 to 520 and this sequence represents the segmentation result the position of a changepoint is denoted as the last index of the corresponding segment the number of segments and the position of changepoints for each experiment is summarized in table 2 the chronological series segmentations of residual indicator α m for each experiment are indicated in fig 5 an interesting phenomenon can be found that as the number of changepoints increases with a decreasing minseglen the original changepoints will not disappear for example the position of 280 exists in almost every experiment the corresponding date of each changepoints for experiment 16 is shown in table 3 4 1 2 normality assumption checking fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 show the three aspects of normality assumptions checking after identifying the changepoints including normal distribution checking independence checking and constant variance checking respectively the points in the q q plot for each experiment approximately lie on the line y x which means the probability distributions can be similar to normal distribution the autocorrelation plot shows that most of the spikes are not statistically significant which indicated that the residuals of the model fit for the sixteen experiments are not highly correlated besides the values of variance series for all sixteen experiments fluctuate between 0 and 0 3 although not strictly subject to the assumption of constant variance across the data the variance series of all segmentation experiments can be considered at relatively stationary conditions 4 2 hydraulic configuration and priors specification for each period 4 2 1 hydraulic analysis based on cross section data the range of the gauged water stage and the topography of the cross section were analyzed to determine the hydraulic configuration of the shijiao hydrological station since no apparent fall exists in the range of water stage the relationship of the stage discharge of shijiao is determined by channel control iso 1100 2 2010 according to a total of 16 cross section bathymetric measurements of shijiao hydrological station from 2003 to 2008 fig 6 a a time series of the cross section area under 5 m was calculated fig 6b the area increased continuously from the original 565 m2 in 2004 to 1678 m2 in 2008 the river s width above 5 m remains almost unchanged at about 1000 m the width of the river below 5 m also remains virtually unchanged at about 500 m indicating that the depth of the riverbed has been severely undercut besides since the ratio of width to depth of the cross section is much greater than 5 wmo 2010 it can be concluded that the relationship between the water stage and the discharge of the shijiao hydrological station is determined by two successive wide rectangular channel control therefore the q h formula of these two types of control can be modeled by eq 13 13 q h k s 1 s 1 b w 1 a 1 h b 1 c 1 i f κ 1 h κ 2 l o w f l o w c h a n n e l k s 2 s 2 b w 2 a 2 h b 2 c 2 i f h κ 2 h i g h f l o w c h a n n e l where κ is the activation stage k s is the strickler flow resistance coefficient in m 1 3 s s is the friction slope b w is the width of the rectangular channel in m the scaling coefficient a can be expressed by the product of k s s and b w b is the offset of the cross section in m c is the exponent for wide rectangular control the exponent value of c 1 and c 2 can be deduced as a constant 5 3 le coz et al 2014 4 2 2 specifying priors to each control of each period hydraulic parameters priors for each control of each period need to be specified firstly according to the cross section of the shijiao hydrological station from 2003 to 2008 fig 6a although the channel changed dramatically under 5 m the cross section above 5 m did not change therefore modeled by an equivalent rectangle fig 6c the priors of κ 2 were set to n 5 2 the priors of b w 2 were set to n 1000 50 with the cross section area below 5 m expanding the priors of b w 1 can be determined by n 500 50 for all the period while the priors of κ 1 should be determined based on the average river bed height for example the average river bed in date of 2007 10 22 see fig 6c is 1 m we can set the prior for this period by n 1 1 besides since parameters k s and s are related to the flow conditions it is usually difficult to determine their priors precisely two empirical distributions n 30 5 and n 0 001 0 001 were specified to all periods based on the hydrological test report of the shijiao hydrological station the exponent only depends on the type of control narrow prior uncertainty was fixed to avoid yielding unrealistic values of a and b thus a precise prior was taken for n 5 3 0 05 little is known about structural uncertainty before having estimated the model only order of magnitude considerations can generally be used for γ 1 and γ 2 which can be interpreted as the structural standard deviation for near zero flows and the relative structural standard deviation at high flows respectively thus half n 0 100 and half n 0 1 was assigned to γ 1 and γ 2 except for the prior of κ 1 which needs to be determined according to the channel s lowest elevation all other priors in each period of the experiment are the same the prior specification results of the shijiao hydrological station for the two successive rectangular channel controls were listed in table 4 besides eq 7 assumes the gauged discharge not equal to its true value an error term ε i q following a gaussian distribution with zero mean and known standard deviations μ q i is added to each discharge observation in this paper a constant uncertainty 7 was assigned to μ q i assuming all discharge measurements of shijiao hydrological station were gauged in good flow conditions using the current meter method china 2015 in this method the stream channel cross section is divided into numerous vertical subsections in each subsection the area is obtained by measuring the width and depth of the subsection and the water velocity is determined using a current meter the discharge in each subsection is computed by multiplying the subsection area by the measured velocity the total discharge is then computed by summing the discharge of each subsection 4 3 estimation of nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties for the shijiao hydrological station from 2003 to 2008 can then be estimated using the baratin stationary model period by period after dividing the gaugings into chronological homogeneous samples to clearly show the posterior rating curve and the associated uncertainty in the high flow part and low flow part discharge is expressed in a linear scale and in a logarithmic scale it can be observed from table 2 that some periods of different experiments are the same for example the last period of experiment 9 10 is the same as the last period of experiment 11 experiment 12 experiment 13 and experiment 14 the stationary rating curve for this period only should be calibrated once in experiment 9 10 and the segmentation of experiment 11 experiment 12 and experiment 14 are almost the same as some segmentation of other experiments therefore experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 experiment 15 and experiment 16 are selected to evaluate the effect of the segmentation procedure on the calibration of nonstationary rating curves experiment 1 8 divides the whole 520 pairs gaugings into two chronological homogeneous clusters with the change occurs in 2006 03 23 the first stationary period contains 280 gaugings and the second stationary period includes 240 gaugings the posterior rating curves and the associated uncertainties for these two periods of experiment 1 8 are shown in fig 7 experiment 9 10 divides the whole 520 pairs gaugings into four chronological homogeneous clusters with the changes occur in 2005 03 26 2006 03 24 and 2007 02 14 it is equivalent that experiment 9 10 further dividing the first and second periods of experiment 1 8 into two sub periods the first stationary period contains 188 gaugings the second stationary period includes 93 gaugings the third stationary period includes 102 gaugings and the fourth stationary period contains 137 gaugings the posterior rating curves and the associated uncertainties for the four periods of experiment 9 10 are shown in fig 8 the posterior rating curves and the associated uncertainties of experiment 13 experiment 15 and experiment 16 are shown in fig s4 fig s5 figs s6 s7 respectively note that not every period s calibration result of each experiment is displayed the calibration results of the last two periods of experiment 13 are the same as the last two periods of experiment 9 10 the calibration results of periods 3 7 of experiment 15 are the same as the periods 3 7 of experiment 13 the calibration results of period 4 and period 5 of experiment 16 are the same as period 2 and period 3 of experiment 13 respectively the calibration results of period 8 10 of experiment 16 are the same as the period 5 7 of experiments 13 the calibration result of period 11 of experiment 16 is the same as period 8 of experiment 15 5 discussion this paper combines the pelt crops segmentation procedure and the baratin stationary model to estimate the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties of the shijiao hydrological station two key parameters minseglen and crops that significantly influence the final segmentation will be discussed in this section besides the performance of such nonstationary rating curves for predicting high flow and low flow is further discussed lastly the reason for this vast amount of data and whether there is information redundancy in existing gaugings will also be discussed 5 1 effect of crops on segmentation various search methods have been developed to detect multiple changepoints which involve optimizing either a constrained or penalized cost function over possible numbers and positions of changepoints using dynamic programming jackson et al 2005 recent progress in the penalized optimization has focused on proposing an exact pruning based method killick et al 2012 which is linear in the number of data points under certain conditions such a method naturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under over fitting work has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data generating processes with known distribution however in many applications the model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not always appropriate the pelt crops method haynes et al 2017a enables us to find the solution for all penalty values across a continuous range this approach permits an evaluation of the various segmentation to identify a suitable penalty choice when using crops users might like to know the ceiling for the number of changepoints set the lower limit to 0 and the upper limit to inf respectively for the crops such that the whole range of segmentation can be calculated in reality the inf varies from case to case inf is just a symbol and cannot be input into calculations as a variable users need to put a large number in inf and providing it generates 0 changepoints in the data in this study two integers are used as the upper limit of crops we set 1000 as the upper limit for the first eight group experiment and set 100 as the upper limit for the second eight group experiment it detected 0 changepoints when inf was set to 1000 and the corresponding penalty value of this solution is 180 617 which is smaller than the upper limit of 1000 this means the integer 1000 can be used for the upper limit looking at fig 4 a h it can be found that the elbow point is at the position where the number of changepoints is 1 this experimental is designed to prevent the undetectable elbow point from appearing at the position where the number of changepoints is 1 see the second eight group experiment with the inf equal 100 the maximum penalty value of all solutions is 19 1285 the corresponding number of changepoints is 1 therefore in this case the position where the number of changepoints is 1 obviously cannot be determined as the elbow point and then as the optimal solution 5 2 effect of minseglen on segmentation minseglen is short for minimum segment length which is an essential constraint for the segmentation procedure based on the pelt crops algorithm setting the value of minseglen is an open issue and the value of minseglen usually needs to be specified according to the actual situation in this article we design two eight group experiments with minseglen changing from the maximum value 80 to the minimum value 10 as seen in fig 4 a h more changepoints were detected as the value of minseglen decreasing for the first eight group experiment case only four changepoints were detected for minseglen equals 80 while forty changepoints were detected for minseglen equal 10 a similar phenomenon also appears in the second eight group experiment case it just has no position where the number of changepoint equals 0 5 3 performance for high flow prediction to access the performance for predicting high flow using the nonstationary rating curves we extracted the annual maximum water stage and the corresponding discharge from 2003 to 2008 of the shijiao hydrological station for further evaluation the gaugings and the corresponding dates and the corresponding positions on the time series of residual indicator α m are summarized in table 5 the nonstationary rating curves of experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 experiment 15 experiment 16 are chosen for calibration specifically for example the maximum water stage of 2003 occurs in 2003 04 14 this date corresponds to the 15th position of the time series of α m which are numbered from 1 to 520 look at table 2 15 is in period 1 of experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 and experiment 15 but in period 2 of experiment 16 therefore we use the rating curve in period 1 of experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 and experiment 15 to predict the discharge at water stage of 9 7 m similarly we can predict the discharge at the maximum water stage of 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 the calibration results are shown in fig 9 the height of each column in fig 9 indicates maximum posterior discharge the black vertical line indicates the 95 total uncertainty of the predicted discharge the horizontal red dotted line indicates the discharge corresponding to the maximum water stage which is extracted from the flood series dataset of the shijiao hydrological station we can find that the maximum posterior discharge is in good agreement with the discharge value in the flood series dataset this phenomenon indicates that the parameter crops and minseglen of pelt crops algorithm have little effect on high flow prediction overall dividing the stage discharge gaugings into two chronological homogeneous samples and calibrating two stationary rating curves can obtain high quality flow prediction in addition we find that all the discharge in the annual hydrological report p r china is a certain value which is predicted using the traditional rating method for example the discharge corresponding to the maximum water stage of 2003 is 7680 m3 s in fact it is difficult to know the true value of the discharge a more reasonable approach is to use an uncertainty interval to represent the predicted value the maximum posterior discharge predicted by the baratin stationary model of experiment 1 8 is 8065 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 1387 m3 s 1341 m3 s the maximum posterior discharge predicted by the baratin stationary model of experiment 16 is 7979 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 408 m3 s 404 m3 s this uncertainty is significant for flood frequency analysis steinbakk et al 2016 5 4 performance for low flow prediction following the same principle in predicting high flow as described in section 5 3 we can predict the low flows corresponding to the annual minimum water stages of the shijiao hydrological station the predictions are shown in fig 10 we found that low flow prediction becomes more accurate as the segments increase for example the predicted discharge corresponding to the minimum water stage of 2003 is 547 m3 s when we use the nonstationary rating curves of experiment 1 8 to predict the discharge the maximum posterior value is 806 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty 329 m3 s 350 m3 s when we use the nonstationary rating curves of experiment 16 to predict the discharge the maximum posterior value is 588 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty 72 m3 s 143 m3 s compared to experiment 1 8 and experiment 9 10 dividing the 520 pairs gaugings into eight ten thirteen chronological homogeneous samples and calibrating eight ten thirteen stationary rating curves of experiment 13 experiment 15 and experiment 16 can help us obtain more accurate low flow discharge data this is because of the impact of human activities intensifies the rate of riverbed undercutting the water stage discharge relationship of the low water part is obviously affected by changing the cease to flow reference level of the first channel control therefore we recommend to use a small value of parameter minseglen for example 10 or 20 to segment the chronological gaugings and then use the nonstationary rating curves to predict the low flow discharge 5 5 baratin model can reduce calibration data note that a large number of gaugings data exist at shijiao hydrological station specifically there are about 80 pairs of gaugings on average per year information redundancy may exist in such a vast number of direct gaugings gaugings in period 2 of experiment 9 13 was designed to analyze whether there is information redundancy in the existing gaugings period 2 of experiment 9 10 contains 93 pairs of gaugings from 2005 03 26 to 2006 03 24 a random sampling method was applied here to randomly extract 46 pairs gaugings and 23 pairs gaugings respectively from the whole 93 pairs gaugings then we calibrated the rating curve using these three sets of gaugings separately the calibration results are shown in fig 11 when calibrating using the whole 93 gaugings see fig 11a and fig 11b at the low water stage of 3 m the maximum posterior discharge is 290 m3 s with a 95 of total uncertainty intervals 46 m3 s 97 m3 s at moderate water stage of 7 m the maximum posterior discharge is 3393 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 394 m3 s 397 m3 s at the high water stage of 12 m the maximum posterior discharge is 13124 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 1610 m3 s 1514 m3 s when calibrating using the extracted 46 pairs of gaugings see fig 11c and fig 11d at the low water stage of 3 m the maximum posterior discharge is 288 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 40 m3 s 38 m3 s at the moderate water stage of 7 m the maximum posterior discharge is 3362 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 261 m3 s 308 m3 s at the high water stage of 12 m the maximum posterior discharge is 12834 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 1300 m3 s 1045 m3 s when calibrating using the extracted 23 pairs gaugings see fig 11e and fig 11f at the low water stage of 3 m the maximum posterior discharge is 271 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 141 m3 s 91 m3 s at the moderate water stage of 7 m the maximum posterior discharge is 3338 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 551 m3 s 646 m3 s at the high water stage of 12 m the maximum posterior discharge is 13252 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 2121 m3 s 2515 m3 s after reducing the amount of calibration data from 93 pair gaugings to 46 pair gaugings the uncertainty intervals has not increased as much as we thought but has decreased further reduced to only 23 pair gaugings the uncertainty intervals increased slightly this phenomenon indicates that it is not necessary to use 93 pairs of gaugings for calibration using 46 pairs of gaugings can obtain the same accurate predicted discharge the baratin model uses two information to calibrate rating curves the first one is the direct stage discharge measurements and the second one is hydraulic knowledge make full use of hydraulic knowledge can reduce the use of direct stage discharge measurements in other words the baratin model employs the stage discharge function with precise exponent deducing from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station this practice means that we can get an accurate discharge prediction with less gauging data by using the baratin model 5 6 limitation and future prospects this article uses the mean rating curve to convert the two dimensional stage discharge relationships into one dimensional chronological residual indicators this step enables us to apply the increasingly advanced changepoints detection technology to detect changes in the relationship between the water stage and discharge by calibrating a static rating curve for each stationary period using the baratin model we can estimate the nonstationary rating curves under a changing environment this paper thoroughly discusses and solves the following issues about the changing stage discharge relationship has a change occurred what is the type of the change where is the change how many changes have occurred what is the difference between the pre and post change data and why has there been a change from the author s perception several interesting aspects may be explored further firstly what is the probability that a change has occurred an algorithm named mcp may be a potential tool since it supports estimating uncertainty and prediction intervals near the changpoints lindeløv 2020 furthermore the changepoints detection approaches mentioned above are offline changepoint analysis all data is received and processed in one go online changepoint detection may be developed to calibrate the real time stage discharge relationship bouchikhi et al 2020 6 conclusion human activities such as indiscriminate dig of sediment aggravate river bed evolution leading to variation of the stage discharge relationship in a short time the traditional shifting methods mentioned in section 1 become inappropriate to hydrological stations located at such rivers consequently this study employed a shifting method for estimating nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties by combining a segmentation procedure with the baratin stationary model a coupled algorithm pelt crops was applied to divide the gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple changepoints in the time series of a residual indicator shijiao hydrological station which records the amount of discharge entering the north river networks in china was selected for the research sixteen experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of minseglen minimum segment length and crops the change of range of penalties on the segmentation based on the results and the discussion of nonstationary rating curve estimation the following can be concluded 1 the pelt crops method enables us to find the solution for all penalty values across a continuous range set the lower limit to 0 and the upper limit to inf an appropriate integer respectively for the crops the whole range of segmentation can be calculated 2 the selection of the minseglen has a great significance on the segmentation more changepoints will be detected as the value of minseglen decreasing users need to set an appropriate value for minseglen to find the optimal segmentation result conducting several experiments with different values of minseglen may be a good choice 3 the variation of the stage discharge relationship caused by riverbed undercutting is more reflected in the low flow part more segmentations are needed to produce a more accurate discharge for low flow prediction while only segmenting the stage discharge gaugings into two chronological homogeneous samples for calibration can produce an accurate discharge for high flow prediction 4 the wide application of resident survey and continuous sequence rating methods have led to frequent discharge measurements information redundancy exists in the vast amount of gaugings baratin stationary model can reduce the use of calibration data by employing stage discharge function with a precise exponent from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station 7 code availability

4610,streamflow time series data are fundamental to hydrological science and water management applications which are commonly derived from stage discharge rating curves the rating curves are usually nonstationary due to temporal characteristics of stream channel and human activities such as indiscriminate dig of sediment this implies the need for an efficient method to estimate nonstationary rating curves from an adequate dataset this study employed a shifting method to estimate the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties the method includes two steps a coupled algorithm pelt crops was first performed to divide the gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple change points in a time series of a residual indicator then the rating curves were calibrated with the baratin stationary model using these homogeneous gaugings within each stationary period the method was applied at shijiao hydrological station in china we found that 1 set the lower and upper limit of parameter crops changepoints for a range of penalties to 0 and inf respectively the whole range of segmentation can be calculated 2 parameter minseglen minimum segment length is of great significance to the segmentation result more changepoints will be detected as the value of minseglen decreasing an appropriate minseglen value should be assigned to find the optimal segmentation 3 the stage discharge relationship in the low flow part is more sensitive to the variation of river topography ten segmentations are needed to produce an accurate discharge for low flow prediction while two segmentations for calibration can produce an accurate discharge for high flow prediction 4 information redundancy exists in the vast amount of gaugings the baratin model can reduce the use of calibration data by employing stage discharge function with a precise exponent from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station keywords nonstationary rating curves baratin changepoint analysis pelt uncertainty analysis shijiao hydrological station in china 1 introduction direct measurements of discharge are time consuming and expensive river discharge time series are monitored by converting continuous water stage records via a stage discharge rating curve iso 1100 2 2010 wmo 2010 usually the rating curve is calibrated at each hydrological station using discrete concurrent measurements of stage and discharge and knowledge on the hydraulic controls which physically determine the stage discharge relation rantz 1982 this indirect calculation of discharge time series can generate a significant amount of discharge uncertainty which will propagate to any hydrological analysis that makes use of discharge time series such as flood frequency analysis steinbakk et al 2016 rainfall runoff model calibration sikorska and renard 2017 hydraulic model calibration douinot et al 2018 and real time flood forecasting ocio et al 2017 to obtain more accurate and reliable discharge data a major challenge is to apply an appropriate method for the estimation of nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties in unstable rivers mansanarez et al 2019 the nonstationarity of the stage discharge relation is mainly affected by numerous and complex processes bed evolution vegetation growth debris ice jams dike break etc herschy 1998 usually there are three alternative methods based on differing assumptions proposed to assess the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties first of all a vpm short for voting point estimation method developed by mcmillan and westerberg 2015 considered that the existing unknown temporal changes in the rating curve lead to epistemic rating curve errors the epistemic uncertainty was quantified and added to other sources of rating curve uncertainty secondly the dynamic method proposed by reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 westerberg et al 2011 jalbert et al 2011 guerrero et al 2012 and morlot et al 2014 attempts to calibrate rating curves continuously varying with time based on the assumption that the stage discharge relation is itself evolving continually thirdly the shifting method proposed by coxon et al 2015 mansanarez et al 2019 assumes that sudden rating changes usually occur after morphogenic events the dates of rating changes divide the whole stage discharge gaugings into some static period nonstationary rating curves need to be calibrated across the successive stationary periods since the sudden rating changes are confirmed to be more widespread in the operational practice mansanarez et al 2019 the shifting method will be further studied in the following text the shifting method has two main issues to be solved detect the dates of rating changes and apply a stationary stage discharge model to each period mansanarez et al 2019 for detecting the dates of changes besides analyzing the information from channel bathymetry profiles zhang et al 2015 stage continuous records reitan and petersen øverleir 2011 sediment transport capacity mansanarez et al 2019 flood events return period mcmillan et al 2010 can be used the most common practice is to apply a segmentation procedure hubert 2000 to the residuals between the stage discharge points and the current rating curve such that the sample means of each segment is significantly different from the mean of each of the neighboring segments morlot et al 2014 rantz 1982 nevertheless this classical segmentation procedure cannot tackle a series of much more than one hundred terms hubert 2000 for estimating successive stationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties the shift corrections method rantz 1982 wmo 2010 derives the shifted rating curves by modifying some selected properties of a base rating curve besides mansanarez et al 2019 proposed a novel stage period discharge spd model for handling the time varying nature of rating curves information from new calibration data previous calibration data and previous rating curves are used to develop a new rating curve in addition since spd model is an extension of baratin model proposed by le coz et al 2014 it can make full use of the hydraulic information of the hydrological station however the spd model restrictively assumes that the stability periods are known and the structure of the rating curve equation determined by hydraulic controls stays constant across periods no matter for dynamic or shifting models the above nonstationary rating methods are driven by natural hydrological processes few studies focus on rivers severely affected by human activities such as sand excavation or construction lu et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 the indiscriminate dig of sediment aggravates river bed evolution leading to the variation in the structure of hydraulic control of hydrological station in a short time therefore the latest spd model is no longer suitable for this kind of hydrological station it is necessary to propose a calibration method for such hydrological station besides measuring the stage discharge gaugings frequently leads to a vast amount of data dividing such gauging samples into successive statistic periods is another problem to be solved although morlot et al 2014 divided gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple change points in time series of a residual indicator the employed hubert segmentation procedure hubert 2000 cannot deal with such long sequences over the years to overcome the challenge that the number of possible solutions to the multiple change point increases as datasets increases in length several multiple changepoints search algorithms have been developed most notably the binary segmentation algorithm scott and knott 1974 sen and srivastava 1975 the segment neighborhood algorithm auger and lawrence 1989 bai and perron 1998 optimal partitioning jackson et al 2005 and more recently the pruned exact linear time algorithm killick et al 2012 all of which can be applied to the division of the sample based on the previously mentioned indicator the object of this article is to calibrate an appropriate nonstationary rating curve accounting for the changing river topography for producing an accurate discharge prediction the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a brief description of the study area and data is given in section 2 the method including the segmentation procedure based on the pelt crops algorithm and the baratin stationary model and the experimental design are detailed in section 3 all results are presented in section 4 the discussion about the sensitivity of parameter minseglen and crops on segmentation the performance for high flow and low flow prediction the baratin model and several prospects are drawn in section 5 a conclusion is shown in section 6 2 study area and data the north river is the second largest tributary of the pearl river located in the middle and north of guangdong province china straddling the tropic of cancer the north river basin covers a region of subtropical to a tropical monsoon climate during the flood season from april to september about 95 of the sediment load and 80 of the water discharge are delivered the mainstream of the north river converges with the west river at sixianjiao it then flows into the pearl river estuary forming the north river and west river delta nrwrd which is one of the fastest developing regions in china shijiao hydrological station 112 9578 e 23 5576 n is one of the most critical hydrological station in the north river basin fig 1 since it s located at the apex of the nrwrd and records the amount of discharge entering the north river networks the discharge of shijiao hydrological station plays a critical role in flood control drought resistance and water resource allocation of the cities such as foshan and guangzhou located in lower reaches of the north river basin due to the booming economy and intensive human activities in the nrwrd region a new environmental problem such as indiscriminate sand excavation emerges in the recent two decades liu et al 2018 the process of river bed evolution has been aggravated resulting in frequent changes in the stage discharge relationship nonstationary rating curves need to be calibrated to obtain accurate and reliable discharge data to investigate the applicability of the method proposed in section 3 520 pairs of direct stage discharge gaugings from 2003 to 2008 and the corresponding cross section bathymetric measurements data of shijiao hydrological station were extracted from the annual hydrological report p r china whose reliability and homogeneity are strictly inspected by the hydrology bureau of guangdong province before they were published besides to evaluate the performance of the nonstationary rating curve for high flow and low flow prediction flood series from 2003 to 2008 of the shijiao hydrological station also are extracted from the annual hydrological report p r china this dataset contains 3994 pairs of stage discharge gaugings 3 method the method proposed in this study included two steps the first step was to perform a segmentation procedure based on a multiple changepoints detection algorithm this step aims to divide the whole sample of gaugings into chronological hydraulically homogeneous families each family corresponds to a stationary period the second step was to estimate stationary rating curves using the baratin stationary model based on these homogeneous gaugings within each stationary period fig 2 shows the flowchart for the method 3 1 segmentation procedure for chronological gaugings 3 1 1 residual indicator identification according to the method mentioned in section 1 that uses the gaugings information directly to determine stationary periods a residual indicator between gaugings and a time invariant mean rating curve meanrc needs to be identified morlot et al 2014 in general the stage discharge relationship can be expressed hydraulically by a power function defined in eq 1 iso 1100 2 2010 wmo 2010 meanrc is defined by fitting eq 1 to the whole gauging points of a hydrometric station 1 q h a h b c where q is the discharge h h b is the water stage relative to a given datum at the staff gauge a is the scaling coefficient b is the cease to flow reference level and c is the exponent the above three parameters were estimated by linearizing eq 1 and minimizing the sum of the squared residuals a residual indicator α m defined in eq 2 represents the difference between the water stage of gauging i and the water stage of the corresponding meanrc morlot et al 2014 2 α h g i h mrc q g i where i 1 n n is the number of the whole of gaugings h g i is the water stage of gauging i h mrc q g i is the water stage of meanrc corresponding to q g i and q g i is the discharge of gauging i 3 1 2 multiple changepoints detection changepoints are those points in a data sequence where a change is observed in the statistical properties such as a change in mean variance or distribution more formally assume there is an ordered sequence of data y 1 n y 1 y n the model will have a number of changepoints m together with their positions τ 1 m τ 1 τ m each changepoint position is an integer between 1 and n 1 inclusive we define τ 0 0 and τ m 1 n and assume that the changepoints are ordered such that τ i τ j if and only if i j consequently the m changepoints will split the data into m 1 segments with the i th segment containing y τ i 1 1 τ i one commonly used approach to identify multiple changepoints is to minimize eq 3 3 i 1 m 1 c y τ i 1 1 τ i β f m where c is the cost function for a segment which is usually introduced by modeling the data with segment specific parameters the form of the cost depends not only on modeling assumptions about the data s distribution but also the type of change mean variance both mean and variance to be detected β f m is a penalty to guard against overfitting the penalty provides a compromise between lots of small changes and no changes in practice the choice of penalty by far the most common choice is one which is linear in the number of changepoints that is β f m β m then the number and the position of the changepoints can be jointly estimated by solving a penalized optimization problem specifically by minimize eq 4 haynes et al 2017b jackson et al 2005 killick et al 2012 4 i 1 m 1 c y τ i 1 1 τ i β binary segmentation bs segment neighborhood sn and pruned exact linear time pelt are the three most widely used changepoint search methods as mentioned in section 1 bs is an approximate search method which means that it is not guaranteed to find the global minimum of eq 3 the advantage of bs is that it is computationally efficient resulting in an o n log n calculation sn is an exact method for most common forms of changepoint models sn searches the entire segmentation space using dynamic programming thus has significant computational cost o q n 2 where q is the maximum number of changepoints one wishes to search for pelt is an exact and computationally efficient method achieved by involving a pruning step within the optimal partitioning op algorithm op is an alternative dynamic programming algorithm proposed by jackson et al 2005 pelt has a computational cost o n that is linear in n while still retaining the exactness of the resulting segmentation to balance the accuracy and computational efficiency the pelt algorithm was used in this article pruning in pelt will depend on the choice of penalty constant β killick et al 2012 however it may be challenging to determine an appropriate penalty value to solve this problem a crops short for changepoints for a range of penalties method haynes et al 2017a is usually coupled with pelt algorithm allowing to specify minimum and maximum penalty values and it returns all segmentations for any penalty between these values rocha et al 2020 these are computed in an efficient manner with a tiny number of runs of the pelt algorithm therefore the coupled algorithm pelt crops was chosen to detect the changepoints in series α m once all the segmentations have been calculated the optimal segmentation result can be determined by constructing a diagnostic plot which was proposed by lavielle 2005 this diagnostic plot represents the relationship between the number of changepoints and the minimum value of segmentation cost if a true changepoint is added to the model the improvement in fit will be large once all the true changes have been added the false changes will not improve the fit much lavielle 2005 suggests choosing the point where the decrease in cost due to detecting a further changepoint noticeable changes this can be thought of as looking for an elbow in the diagnostic plot the points on the elbow are then suggested to be the most feasible segmentation thus this diagnostic plot also can be called elbow plot in practice such an approach can reduce the subjectivity of the penalty selection haynes et al 2017b 3 1 3 normality assumptions checking the pelt crops segmentation procedure is a parametric method normal distribution was chosen to model each segment s statistic specifically for detecting a change in the mean if the data within a segment is modeled as being independent and following a normal distribution then the segment cost in eq 3 and eq 4 can be expressed as eq 5 5 c y s 1 t j s 1 t y j 2 j s 1 t y i 2 n consequently normality assumptions need to be further checked after identifying the changes mainly including three aspects independence check normal distribution check and constant variance check killick 2020 recommends two methods for checking normality assumptions post analysis one approach is to check each segment independently it means that one should test or plot n 1 times if there are n changepoints for the data an alternative to check each segment in turn is to check the residuals of the model fit testing the residuals is more convenient as it can check the entire dataset at once instead of checking all the segments multiple times therefore residuals checking will be applied in section 4 the mentioned changepoints detection algorithms above have been integrated into an r package called changepoint killick and eckley 2014 it contains three core wrapper functions to detect changes in the mean in the variance both in mean and variance for data only changes in mean will be detected for the series α m in this article 3 2 baratin stationary model for rating curve calibration baratin is the application of the bayesian paradigm to the problem of calibrating stationary rating curves based on uncertain gaugings and hydraulic knowledge moyeed and clarke 2005 this framework assumes that rating changes within each period are negligible and is based on the following statistical model le coz et al 2014 3 2 1 measurement error models the measurement error models describe the relationship between the gauging measurements h i q i i 1 n and the real values of water level and associated discharges the following error models are assumed 6 h i h i 7 q i q i ε i q ε i q n 0 μ q i eq 6 assumes that the errors in stage measurements are negligible eq 7 assumes that discharge measurements are affected by gaussian errors with mean zero i e no bias and known standard deviation the so called standard uncertainty 3 2 2 structural error model the structural error model describes the residual errors between true discharge q i and its simplified mathematical representation f h θ rc θ rc a b c are the hydraulic parameters in most cases the function f is given by the elementary hydraulic control or a piecewise combination of several elementary hydraulic controls hydraulic control represents the physical characteristics of the channel and it determines the water depth and the discharge in the river section where the hydrological station is located le coz et al 2014 the stage discharge relationship can be formalized as follows 8 q i f h i θ rc ε i f ε i f n 0 σ f the error term ε i f is the remnant error or called structural error it represents the fact that the rating curve in its assumed mathematical form would not perfectly represent the true stage discharge relationship even if the true stage discharge values were known ε i f are assumed to be independent across gaugings and follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unknown standard deviation σ f i besides considering the heteroscedasticity le coz et al 2014 σ f i are parameterized as a linear function of the discharge computed with the rating curve σ f h i γ γ 1 γ 2 f h i θ rc γ 1 and γ 2 are the structural uncertainty parameters which are estimated along with the hydraulic parameters assuming structural errors and measurement errors are independent the relationship between the observed stage and corresponding discharge values can be then expressed as follows 9 q i f h i θ rc ε i f ε i q ε i f ε i q n 0 σ f 2 h i γ u q i 2 3 2 3 bayesian equations and inference eq 9 involves three hydraulic parameters and two structural uncertainty parameters inference on these five parameters θ θ rc γ is performed through the posterior distribution the probability density function pdf of which is defined as 10 p θ h q posterior p q θ h likelihood p θ prior the likelihood of the observed discharge values q given the hydraulic parameters θ rc structural uncertainty parameters γ and observed stage values h can be expressed as 11 p q θ θ rc γ h p n q i f h i θ rc σ f 2 h i γ u q i 2 where p n z m s is the pdf of a gaussian distribution with mean m and standard deviation s evaluated at value z note that bayesian inference uses the information brought by the gaugings and allows including any knowledge on θ that would be available even before acquiring the gaugings assuming independent priors on each inferred parameter the prior information is encoded as a distribution 12 p θ p a p b p c p γ 1 p γ 2 informative priors on the hydraulic parameters θ rc can be derived from the hydraulic knowledge depending on the type of hydraulic control in particular the exponents in the power rating curve equation like eq 1 can be quite precisely elicited for each hydraulic control more details for deriving these informative priors with hydraulic knowledge can be found in le coz et al 2014 mansanarez 2016 and mansanarez et al 2019 the posterior distribution is explored by sampling realizations using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler for each sampling two chains were drawn each chain was composed of 10 000 simulations a burn in factor was set to 0 5 finally a total of 10 000 parameter values can be obtained for each θ rc i i 1 10 000 a rating curve was computed from the large set of rating curves the statistics calculated at each stage value allows assessing parametric uncertainty of the stage discharge relation besides total uncertainty can be represented by the combination of parametric uncertainty and the uncertainty induced by the structural error a single error sampled in n 0 1 and multiplied by γ 1 γ 2 f h i θ rc was added to each rating curve le coz et al 2014 3 3 experimental design in section 4 1 sixteen experiments table 1 are explored to examine the effects of parameter crops and minseglen on changepoints detection in chronological series α m since these two parameters in the coupled algorithm pelt crops need to be manually specified depending on the data itself in each experimental design perturbation only one parameter is changed while another one is kept constant the minseglen is short for minimum segment length and should be set to a positive integer the default value of minseglen is 2 because two parameters the mean and the variance are estimated per segment at least two data points are needed to do this in this article considering there are 520 pairs stage and corresponding discharge data from 2003 to 2008 at shijiao hydrological station 87 pairs of data on average per year here we take 10 as the step size set the maximum and minimum value of minseglen to 90 and 10 respectively forming two eight group experiments 1 8 and 9 16 with the same crops specifying minimal minseglen to 10 is to ensure robust discharge uncertainty bounds as mentioned in section 3 1 2 parameter crops allows to specify minimum and maximum penalty values and the result returns all segmentations for any penalty between these values when using crops users might like to know the ceiling for the number of changepoints setting the lower penalty to 0 will achieve this in turn the latest version r package of changepoint adds functionality to crops that allows users to use inf infinity as an upper limit so that c 0 inf can be specified such that the whole range of segmentations is calculated however in reality the inf varies from case to case users can put a large number in inf and providing it generates 0 changepoints in the data and then this is equivalent to c 0 inf here we set 1000 in inf for the first eight group experiments furthermore in our computation we found that if 1000 is used as an upper limit a changepoint with an immense penalty value may be solved resulting in the elbow point appears on the left side of the diagnostic plot resulting in just very small amount changepoints are detected this segmentation may not be the real optimal solution thus we set another eight group experiment with a smaller upper limit of 100 to explain this phenomenon more details and the results will be described in the next section 4 results 4 1 identification of the chronological homogeneous gauging samples 4 1 1 segmentation of residual indicator α fig 3 shows the identification process of the residual indicator which mainly includes two steps the first step is to fit the mean rating curve based on the whole 520 pairs of gaugings this step is a non linear fitting problem and three parameters are to be solved for the power function defined in eq 1 here we transform it into a linear fit by setting a fixed exponent value of 1 67 since the exponent value is determined by the type of hydraulic control and the cross section geometry the hydraulic control of shijiao hydrological station is an independent channel control or two continuous channel control at different periods and each hydraulic control can be generalized into a rectangle therefore only the scaling coefficient a and the cease to flow reference level b need to be solved we set the range of b between 6 and 2 with a step size of 0 01 and fit a curve for each value of b the meanrc see fig 3b is the optimal solution with the minimum rmse see fig 3a then the residual indicator α m defined in eq 2 represents the difference between the water stage of gauging i and the water stage of the corresponding meanrc can be calculated after that the segmentation procedure described in section 3 1 2 was applied to detect the multiple changepoints in the mean of the chronological residual indicator α m following the experimental design in section 3 3 two eight group experiments with different parameter sets of crops and minseglen were conducted after all the segmentations were calculated each experiment s optimal segmentation was determined by constructing a diagnostic plot or called elbow plot the subplot a h of fig 4 shows the diagnostic plot for the first eight group experiment with the upper limit of crops was set to 1000 as minseglen decreases the number of detected changepoints increases specifically when minseglen is set to 80 only four changepoints were detected and when minseglen is set to 10 forty changepoints were detected however according to the elbow point selection principle described in section 3 1 2 the optimal segmentation of these eight experiments only detected one changepoint as indicated by the red circle the penalty value is 180 617 when the number of changepoints equals 0 while the penalty value is 19 1285 when the number of changepoints equals 1 the difference between the penalty value corresponding to 0 changepoint and 1changepoint is too large resulting in the elbow point in the latter part of the sequence is not apparent therefore when the upper limit of crops was set to 1000 the position of the first eight group is 280 the subplot i p of fig 4 shows the second eight group experiments diagnostic plot it can be observed that when the upper limit of crops is set to 100 the situation of the number of changepoint equaling 0 cannot be detected the maximum penalty value is 19 1285 when the number of changepoints equals 1 in this way when minseglen decreases and the number of changepoint increases the second elbow point can be captured the optimal segmentation for each experiment was summarized in table 2 note that we have 520 pairs of gaugings so there are 520 residual indicators they are a one to one relationship we number this chronological series from 1 to 520 and this sequence represents the segmentation result the position of a changepoint is denoted as the last index of the corresponding segment the number of segments and the position of changepoints for each experiment is summarized in table 2 the chronological series segmentations of residual indicator α m for each experiment are indicated in fig 5 an interesting phenomenon can be found that as the number of changepoints increases with a decreasing minseglen the original changepoints will not disappear for example the position of 280 exists in almost every experiment the corresponding date of each changepoints for experiment 16 is shown in table 3 4 1 2 normality assumption checking fig s1 fig s2 and fig s3 show the three aspects of normality assumptions checking after identifying the changepoints including normal distribution checking independence checking and constant variance checking respectively the points in the q q plot for each experiment approximately lie on the line y x which means the probability distributions can be similar to normal distribution the autocorrelation plot shows that most of the spikes are not statistically significant which indicated that the residuals of the model fit for the sixteen experiments are not highly correlated besides the values of variance series for all sixteen experiments fluctuate between 0 and 0 3 although not strictly subject to the assumption of constant variance across the data the variance series of all segmentation experiments can be considered at relatively stationary conditions 4 2 hydraulic configuration and priors specification for each period 4 2 1 hydraulic analysis based on cross section data the range of the gauged water stage and the topography of the cross section were analyzed to determine the hydraulic configuration of the shijiao hydrological station since no apparent fall exists in the range of water stage the relationship of the stage discharge of shijiao is determined by channel control iso 1100 2 2010 according to a total of 16 cross section bathymetric measurements of shijiao hydrological station from 2003 to 2008 fig 6 a a time series of the cross section area under 5 m was calculated fig 6b the area increased continuously from the original 565 m2 in 2004 to 1678 m2 in 2008 the river s width above 5 m remains almost unchanged at about 1000 m the width of the river below 5 m also remains virtually unchanged at about 500 m indicating that the depth of the riverbed has been severely undercut besides since the ratio of width to depth of the cross section is much greater than 5 wmo 2010 it can be concluded that the relationship between the water stage and the discharge of the shijiao hydrological station is determined by two successive wide rectangular channel control therefore the q h formula of these two types of control can be modeled by eq 13 13 q h k s 1 s 1 b w 1 a 1 h b 1 c 1 i f κ 1 h κ 2 l o w f l o w c h a n n e l k s 2 s 2 b w 2 a 2 h b 2 c 2 i f h κ 2 h i g h f l o w c h a n n e l where κ is the activation stage k s is the strickler flow resistance coefficient in m 1 3 s s is the friction slope b w is the width of the rectangular channel in m the scaling coefficient a can be expressed by the product of k s s and b w b is the offset of the cross section in m c is the exponent for wide rectangular control the exponent value of c 1 and c 2 can be deduced as a constant 5 3 le coz et al 2014 4 2 2 specifying priors to each control of each period hydraulic parameters priors for each control of each period need to be specified firstly according to the cross section of the shijiao hydrological station from 2003 to 2008 fig 6a although the channel changed dramatically under 5 m the cross section above 5 m did not change therefore modeled by an equivalent rectangle fig 6c the priors of κ 2 were set to n 5 2 the priors of b w 2 were set to n 1000 50 with the cross section area below 5 m expanding the priors of b w 1 can be determined by n 500 50 for all the period while the priors of κ 1 should be determined based on the average river bed height for example the average river bed in date of 2007 10 22 see fig 6c is 1 m we can set the prior for this period by n 1 1 besides since parameters k s and s are related to the flow conditions it is usually difficult to determine their priors precisely two empirical distributions n 30 5 and n 0 001 0 001 were specified to all periods based on the hydrological test report of the shijiao hydrological station the exponent only depends on the type of control narrow prior uncertainty was fixed to avoid yielding unrealistic values of a and b thus a precise prior was taken for n 5 3 0 05 little is known about structural uncertainty before having estimated the model only order of magnitude considerations can generally be used for γ 1 and γ 2 which can be interpreted as the structural standard deviation for near zero flows and the relative structural standard deviation at high flows respectively thus half n 0 100 and half n 0 1 was assigned to γ 1 and γ 2 except for the prior of κ 1 which needs to be determined according to the channel s lowest elevation all other priors in each period of the experiment are the same the prior specification results of the shijiao hydrological station for the two successive rectangular channel controls were listed in table 4 besides eq 7 assumes the gauged discharge not equal to its true value an error term ε i q following a gaussian distribution with zero mean and known standard deviations μ q i is added to each discharge observation in this paper a constant uncertainty 7 was assigned to μ q i assuming all discharge measurements of shijiao hydrological station were gauged in good flow conditions using the current meter method china 2015 in this method the stream channel cross section is divided into numerous vertical subsections in each subsection the area is obtained by measuring the width and depth of the subsection and the water velocity is determined using a current meter the discharge in each subsection is computed by multiplying the subsection area by the measured velocity the total discharge is then computed by summing the discharge of each subsection 4 3 estimation of nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties for the shijiao hydrological station from 2003 to 2008 can then be estimated using the baratin stationary model period by period after dividing the gaugings into chronological homogeneous samples to clearly show the posterior rating curve and the associated uncertainty in the high flow part and low flow part discharge is expressed in a linear scale and in a logarithmic scale it can be observed from table 2 that some periods of different experiments are the same for example the last period of experiment 9 10 is the same as the last period of experiment 11 experiment 12 experiment 13 and experiment 14 the stationary rating curve for this period only should be calibrated once in experiment 9 10 and the segmentation of experiment 11 experiment 12 and experiment 14 are almost the same as some segmentation of other experiments therefore experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 experiment 15 and experiment 16 are selected to evaluate the effect of the segmentation procedure on the calibration of nonstationary rating curves experiment 1 8 divides the whole 520 pairs gaugings into two chronological homogeneous clusters with the change occurs in 2006 03 23 the first stationary period contains 280 gaugings and the second stationary period includes 240 gaugings the posterior rating curves and the associated uncertainties for these two periods of experiment 1 8 are shown in fig 7 experiment 9 10 divides the whole 520 pairs gaugings into four chronological homogeneous clusters with the changes occur in 2005 03 26 2006 03 24 and 2007 02 14 it is equivalent that experiment 9 10 further dividing the first and second periods of experiment 1 8 into two sub periods the first stationary period contains 188 gaugings the second stationary period includes 93 gaugings the third stationary period includes 102 gaugings and the fourth stationary period contains 137 gaugings the posterior rating curves and the associated uncertainties for the four periods of experiment 9 10 are shown in fig 8 the posterior rating curves and the associated uncertainties of experiment 13 experiment 15 and experiment 16 are shown in fig s4 fig s5 figs s6 s7 respectively note that not every period s calibration result of each experiment is displayed the calibration results of the last two periods of experiment 13 are the same as the last two periods of experiment 9 10 the calibration results of periods 3 7 of experiment 15 are the same as the periods 3 7 of experiment 13 the calibration results of period 4 and period 5 of experiment 16 are the same as period 2 and period 3 of experiment 13 respectively the calibration results of period 8 10 of experiment 16 are the same as the period 5 7 of experiments 13 the calibration result of period 11 of experiment 16 is the same as period 8 of experiment 15 5 discussion this paper combines the pelt crops segmentation procedure and the baratin stationary model to estimate the nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties of the shijiao hydrological station two key parameters minseglen and crops that significantly influence the final segmentation will be discussed in this section besides the performance of such nonstationary rating curves for predicting high flow and low flow is further discussed lastly the reason for this vast amount of data and whether there is information redundancy in existing gaugings will also be discussed 5 1 effect of crops on segmentation various search methods have been developed to detect multiple changepoints which involve optimizing either a constrained or penalized cost function over possible numbers and positions of changepoints using dynamic programming jackson et al 2005 recent progress in the penalized optimization has focused on proposing an exact pruning based method killick et al 2012 which is linear in the number of data points under certain conditions such a method naturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under over fitting work has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data generating processes with known distribution however in many applications the model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not always appropriate the pelt crops method haynes et al 2017a enables us to find the solution for all penalty values across a continuous range this approach permits an evaluation of the various segmentation to identify a suitable penalty choice when using crops users might like to know the ceiling for the number of changepoints set the lower limit to 0 and the upper limit to inf respectively for the crops such that the whole range of segmentation can be calculated in reality the inf varies from case to case inf is just a symbol and cannot be input into calculations as a variable users need to put a large number in inf and providing it generates 0 changepoints in the data in this study two integers are used as the upper limit of crops we set 1000 as the upper limit for the first eight group experiment and set 100 as the upper limit for the second eight group experiment it detected 0 changepoints when inf was set to 1000 and the corresponding penalty value of this solution is 180 617 which is smaller than the upper limit of 1000 this means the integer 1000 can be used for the upper limit looking at fig 4 a h it can be found that the elbow point is at the position where the number of changepoints is 1 this experimental is designed to prevent the undetectable elbow point from appearing at the position where the number of changepoints is 1 see the second eight group experiment with the inf equal 100 the maximum penalty value of all solutions is 19 1285 the corresponding number of changepoints is 1 therefore in this case the position where the number of changepoints is 1 obviously cannot be determined as the elbow point and then as the optimal solution 5 2 effect of minseglen on segmentation minseglen is short for minimum segment length which is an essential constraint for the segmentation procedure based on the pelt crops algorithm setting the value of minseglen is an open issue and the value of minseglen usually needs to be specified according to the actual situation in this article we design two eight group experiments with minseglen changing from the maximum value 80 to the minimum value 10 as seen in fig 4 a h more changepoints were detected as the value of minseglen decreasing for the first eight group experiment case only four changepoints were detected for minseglen equals 80 while forty changepoints were detected for minseglen equal 10 a similar phenomenon also appears in the second eight group experiment case it just has no position where the number of changepoint equals 0 5 3 performance for high flow prediction to access the performance for predicting high flow using the nonstationary rating curves we extracted the annual maximum water stage and the corresponding discharge from 2003 to 2008 of the shijiao hydrological station for further evaluation the gaugings and the corresponding dates and the corresponding positions on the time series of residual indicator α m are summarized in table 5 the nonstationary rating curves of experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 experiment 15 experiment 16 are chosen for calibration specifically for example the maximum water stage of 2003 occurs in 2003 04 14 this date corresponds to the 15th position of the time series of α m which are numbered from 1 to 520 look at table 2 15 is in period 1 of experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 and experiment 15 but in period 2 of experiment 16 therefore we use the rating curve in period 1 of experiment 1 8 experiment 9 10 experiment 13 and experiment 15 to predict the discharge at water stage of 9 7 m similarly we can predict the discharge at the maximum water stage of 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 the calibration results are shown in fig 9 the height of each column in fig 9 indicates maximum posterior discharge the black vertical line indicates the 95 total uncertainty of the predicted discharge the horizontal red dotted line indicates the discharge corresponding to the maximum water stage which is extracted from the flood series dataset of the shijiao hydrological station we can find that the maximum posterior discharge is in good agreement with the discharge value in the flood series dataset this phenomenon indicates that the parameter crops and minseglen of pelt crops algorithm have little effect on high flow prediction overall dividing the stage discharge gaugings into two chronological homogeneous samples and calibrating two stationary rating curves can obtain high quality flow prediction in addition we find that all the discharge in the annual hydrological report p r china is a certain value which is predicted using the traditional rating method for example the discharge corresponding to the maximum water stage of 2003 is 7680 m3 s in fact it is difficult to know the true value of the discharge a more reasonable approach is to use an uncertainty interval to represent the predicted value the maximum posterior discharge predicted by the baratin stationary model of experiment 1 8 is 8065 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 1387 m3 s 1341 m3 s the maximum posterior discharge predicted by the baratin stationary model of experiment 16 is 7979 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 408 m3 s 404 m3 s this uncertainty is significant for flood frequency analysis steinbakk et al 2016 5 4 performance for low flow prediction following the same principle in predicting high flow as described in section 5 3 we can predict the low flows corresponding to the annual minimum water stages of the shijiao hydrological station the predictions are shown in fig 10 we found that low flow prediction becomes more accurate as the segments increase for example the predicted discharge corresponding to the minimum water stage of 2003 is 547 m3 s when we use the nonstationary rating curves of experiment 1 8 to predict the discharge the maximum posterior value is 806 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty 329 m3 s 350 m3 s when we use the nonstationary rating curves of experiment 16 to predict the discharge the maximum posterior value is 588 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty 72 m3 s 143 m3 s compared to experiment 1 8 and experiment 9 10 dividing the 520 pairs gaugings into eight ten thirteen chronological homogeneous samples and calibrating eight ten thirteen stationary rating curves of experiment 13 experiment 15 and experiment 16 can help us obtain more accurate low flow discharge data this is because of the impact of human activities intensifies the rate of riverbed undercutting the water stage discharge relationship of the low water part is obviously affected by changing the cease to flow reference level of the first channel control therefore we recommend to use a small value of parameter minseglen for example 10 or 20 to segment the chronological gaugings and then use the nonstationary rating curves to predict the low flow discharge 5 5 baratin model can reduce calibration data note that a large number of gaugings data exist at shijiao hydrological station specifically there are about 80 pairs of gaugings on average per year information redundancy may exist in such a vast number of direct gaugings gaugings in period 2 of experiment 9 13 was designed to analyze whether there is information redundancy in the existing gaugings period 2 of experiment 9 10 contains 93 pairs of gaugings from 2005 03 26 to 2006 03 24 a random sampling method was applied here to randomly extract 46 pairs gaugings and 23 pairs gaugings respectively from the whole 93 pairs gaugings then we calibrated the rating curve using these three sets of gaugings separately the calibration results are shown in fig 11 when calibrating using the whole 93 gaugings see fig 11a and fig 11b at the low water stage of 3 m the maximum posterior discharge is 290 m3 s with a 95 of total uncertainty intervals 46 m3 s 97 m3 s at moderate water stage of 7 m the maximum posterior discharge is 3393 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 394 m3 s 397 m3 s at the high water stage of 12 m the maximum posterior discharge is 13124 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 1610 m3 s 1514 m3 s when calibrating using the extracted 46 pairs of gaugings see fig 11c and fig 11d at the low water stage of 3 m the maximum posterior discharge is 288 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 40 m3 s 38 m3 s at the moderate water stage of 7 m the maximum posterior discharge is 3362 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 261 m3 s 308 m3 s at the high water stage of 12 m the maximum posterior discharge is 12834 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 1300 m3 s 1045 m3 s when calibrating using the extracted 23 pairs gaugings see fig 11e and fig 11f at the low water stage of 3 m the maximum posterior discharge is 271 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 141 m3 s 91 m3 s at the moderate water stage of 7 m the maximum posterior discharge is 3338 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 551 m3 s 646 m3 s at the high water stage of 12 m the maximum posterior discharge is 13252 m3 s with a 95 total uncertainty interval 2121 m3 s 2515 m3 s after reducing the amount of calibration data from 93 pair gaugings to 46 pair gaugings the uncertainty intervals has not increased as much as we thought but has decreased further reduced to only 23 pair gaugings the uncertainty intervals increased slightly this phenomenon indicates that it is not necessary to use 93 pairs of gaugings for calibration using 46 pairs of gaugings can obtain the same accurate predicted discharge the baratin model uses two information to calibrate rating curves the first one is the direct stage discharge measurements and the second one is hydraulic knowledge make full use of hydraulic knowledge can reduce the use of direct stage discharge measurements in other words the baratin model employs the stage discharge function with precise exponent deducing from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station this practice means that we can get an accurate discharge prediction with less gauging data by using the baratin model 5 6 limitation and future prospects this article uses the mean rating curve to convert the two dimensional stage discharge relationships into one dimensional chronological residual indicators this step enables us to apply the increasingly advanced changepoints detection technology to detect changes in the relationship between the water stage and discharge by calibrating a static rating curve for each stationary period using the baratin model we can estimate the nonstationary rating curves under a changing environment this paper thoroughly discusses and solves the following issues about the changing stage discharge relationship has a change occurred what is the type of the change where is the change how many changes have occurred what is the difference between the pre and post change data and why has there been a change from the author s perception several interesting aspects may be explored further firstly what is the probability that a change has occurred an algorithm named mcp may be a potential tool since it supports estimating uncertainty and prediction intervals near the changpoints lindeløv 2020 furthermore the changepoints detection approaches mentioned above are offline changepoint analysis all data is received and processed in one go online changepoint detection may be developed to calibrate the real time stage discharge relationship bouchikhi et al 2020 6 conclusion human activities such as indiscriminate dig of sediment aggravate river bed evolution leading to variation of the stage discharge relationship in a short time the traditional shifting methods mentioned in section 1 become inappropriate to hydrological stations located at such rivers consequently this study employed a shifting method for estimating nonstationary rating curves and the associated uncertainties by combining a segmentation procedure with the baratin stationary model a coupled algorithm pelt crops was applied to divide the gauging samples into homogeneous families by detecting the multiple changepoints in the time series of a residual indicator shijiao hydrological station which records the amount of discharge entering the north river networks in china was selected for the research sixteen experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of minseglen minimum segment length and crops the change of range of penalties on the segmentation based on the results and the discussion of nonstationary rating curve estimation the following can be concluded 1 the pelt crops method enables us to find the solution for all penalty values across a continuous range set the lower limit to 0 and the upper limit to inf an appropriate integer respectively for the crops the whole range of segmentation can be calculated 2 the selection of the minseglen has a great significance on the segmentation more changepoints will be detected as the value of minseglen decreasing users need to set an appropriate value for minseglen to find the optimal segmentation result conducting several experiments with different values of minseglen may be a good choice 3 the variation of the stage discharge relationship caused by riverbed undercutting is more reflected in the low flow part more segmentations are needed to produce a more accurate discharge for low flow prediction while only segmenting the stage discharge gaugings into two chronological homogeneous samples for calibration can produce an accurate discharge for high flow prediction 4 the wide application of resident survey and continuous sequence rating methods have led to frequent discharge measurements information redundancy exists in the vast amount of gaugings baratin stationary model can reduce the use of calibration data by employing stage discharge function with a precise exponent from the hydraulic knowledge at a hydrological station 7 code availability

4611,soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological processes and is included in a wide range of global datasets however accurate indications of spatio temporal characteristics of soil moisture remain limited for east asia this study focused on hulunbeir a typical climate sensitive grassland area in east asia four soil moisture datasets were retrieved from global land data assimilation system gldas cma land data assimilation system cldas soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap and the differences between these datasets and measured soil moisture data were analyzed by correlation analysis the key factors affecting soil water such as slope precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were selected to identify the main causes of errors between the product dataset values and measured data by multiple stepwise regression analysis the four products tended to underestimate the soil moisture but exaggerated the temporal variation in winter and spring the cldas and smap products provided good representation of the amplitude and spatio temporal variation in soil moisture the gldas product performed well with acceptable error metrics but failed to capture the vertical variation in soil moisture the smos product had a missing data problem which reduced its utility in the study area notably ndvi and precipitation were the

introduction soil moisture is an important state variable governing the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and plant growth although the water contained in soil represents only a small proportion of the water present on earth it is a very important hydrological parameter dai et al 2004 soil moisture affects land atmosphere interaction processes and strongly controls energy redistribution between sensible and latent heat flux xin et al 2014 furthermore evaporation infiltration and runoff are driven by surface soil moisture and thus soil moisture is a key variable in the hydrological cycle kerr et al 2002 precipitation plant interception throughfall runoff infiltration evaporation and transpiration together comprise the main water cycle processes precipitation is the main source of soil moisture especially in arid and semiarid areas as the first stage of the small catchment water cycle it is crucial to understand the process of rainfall infiltration wang et al 2008 the relationship between vegetation and water is mainly reflected as a mutual influence legates et al 2011 and is the central theme of eco hydrology li 2011 the type of plant including factors such as canopy interception can directly affect soil moisture inputs li 2011 marin et al 2000 and does not contribute to soil moisture recharge llorens and domingo 2007 at the same time because of the obstruction of the leaves it can directly affect the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture recharge durocher 1990 levia and herwitz 2005 small precipitation events 2 5 mm usually affect only the uppermost few centimeters of soil and the added moisture is subsequently easily lost through evaporation especially in land with a large slope schwinning and sala 2004 as the main component of the climate variables system soil moisture can control the hydrological interactions between soil vegetation and climate forcing and also plays an important role in controlling the water and energy balance between the surface and atmosphere global climate observing system gcos 2010 legates et al 2011 therefore it is important to obtain accurate soil moisture contents through measurement and estimation there are three main approaches to obtaining the soil moisture content the first is traditional in situ measurements based on oven drying neutron probe time or frequency domain reflectometry tdr fdr and capacitance measurements lekshmi et al 2014 these methods can obtain the soil moisture content at different depths in real time but they are difficult to use over large areas because the methods are time consuming and or expensive the second approach is hydrological model simulations brocca et al 2012a draper et al 2009a montzka et al 2011 pan and wood 2006 because there is a lack of understanding of the physical mechanism and because the results are highly dependent on the input parameters these simulations cannot be applied over large areas the third approach is remote sensing technology which allows rapid assessment of the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture over a wide area crow et al 2012 there are several remote sensing based soil moisture products such as active microwave sensors the european remote sensing satellites ers 1 since 1992 and ers 2 since 1996 and the advanced scatterometer ascat since 2006 wagner et al 2013 passive microwave sensors include soil moisture and ocean salinity smos since 2009 quets et al 2019 soil moisture active passive smap since 2015 fan et al 2020 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e since 2002 xie et al 2019 although microwave monitoring has a strong ability to penetrate cloud and fog it can be influenced and limited by the natural variability and complexity of the vegetation canopy and surface roughness brocca et al 2012b according to previous studies albergel et al 2009 draper et al 2009b gruhier et al 2010 passive microwave soil moisture products perform better over sparsely vegetated regions whereas the active microwave products show better agreement in regions with moderate vegetation density the two products show similar performance over sparsely to moderately vegetated regions although there is an absence of adequate research comparing the smap product with other soil moisture products it is generally in good agreement with in situ measurements in both dry or wet regions zeng et al 2016 the smap soil moisture product also showed good correlation with the true footprint average in sparsely vegetated regions chen et al 2017 recently many soil moisture validation works have been conducted around the world zhang et al 2017 chan steven et al 2016 cho et al 2017 however little comparative work on soil moisture products has been performed in northeast china a long term large scale and highly accurate surface soil moisture dataset is important for studying water circulation and global climate change however limited information is available on the accuracy of products for determining the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture in east asia therefore using hulunbeir inner mongolia as the study area we established a spatio temporal cross comparison framework to assess the accuracies of simulation and remote sensing through additional field measurements the methods used included in situ measurement using the oven drying method eddy covariance flux tower measurements two land data assimilation system simulations the global land data assimilation system gldas and the cma land data assimilation system cldas and two remote sensing retrieval methods l band products from smos and nasa s soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission five environmental factors were considered in this analysis of the different products slope precipitation temperature normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and leaf area index lai to assess which factors were responsible for any under or over estimation relative to the field data finally these findings were verified after removal of all rainfall events above the 90th percentile between 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2017 this study provides an important reference for accurately describing the hydrological characteristics of climate sensitive grassland areas to achieve efficient management of water resources 2 material and method 2 1 study area hulunbeir is in northeastern inner mongolia china 115 31 126 04 e 47 05 53 20 n covering about 2 5 105 km2 which accounts for 21 4 of the autonomous region fig 1 in this area the major types of vegetation from east to west are forest transition of forest grass and meadow steppe the altitude of hulunbeir is 550 1000 m and the area presents a slow transition from high in the east to low in the west the terrain characteristics cause hulunbeir to have a continental monsoon climate characterized by high winds and four distinct seasons the average precipitation decreases from east to west and has ranged from 604 to 213 mm over the past 15 years http westdc westgis ac cn data the precipitation mainly occurs from may to september when the temperature increases from east to west the main soil types in this area include alfisols calcium layer soil semi lucisols primary soil semi hydromorphic soil saline soil and water into the soil according to the harmonized world soil database http www fao org the alfisols and calcium layer soil are the main soil type in hulunbeir the alfisols are mainly distributed in the east of the study area and have good soil water holding capacity so this area is mostly forest the calcium layer soil is mainly distributed in the west of the study area this area is mainly dominated by grassland because the calcium layer soil is unable to store moisture see fig 2 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 field sampling data in this study the in situ soil moisture was obtained from field sampling through an oven drying experiment in the laboratory the soil moisture sample points were in the southwest part of hulunbeir and most of them were in the hailar basin fig 1 through four consecutive sampling surveys we obtained the spatial variability of soil moisture in hulunbeir soil samples were taken from five depths 0 5 5 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm the collected soil samples were measured in the field the soil samples were transported to the laboratory and oven dried at 105 c yinglan et al 2019 the equation used to calculate the soil moisture content was as follows 1 s w c m f m d m d m a 100 where swc is the gravimetric soil moisture content m3 m 3 mf is the weight of the fresh soil sample in the aluminum box md is the weight of the dried soil sample in the aluminum box and ma is the weight of the aluminum box in addition soil moisture data were obtained from an eddy covariance flux tower to study the temporal variability of soil water content within a time series 1 august 2016 31 july 2017 these data were obtained daily from three depths 0 5 5 10 and 10 20 cm 2 2 2 in situ observation data daily meteorological data from 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2017 were collected at the hailar station which was near the eddy covariance flux tower fig 1 the data included precipitation mm evaporation mm and air temperature c meteorological data collected at the stations were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 2 3 remotely sensed soil moisture products 1 gldas product the gldas was developed by nasa goddard space flight center and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration national centers for environmental prediction by streamlining and parallelization with the land information system the software can drive multiple offline land models and integrate a huge quantity of observation base data the gldas is executed globally at high resolution 0 25 to 1 and can produce results in near real time the gldas product describes soil moisture in four layers 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm the 100 200 cm layer was not used in our analysis in this study the gldas product was extracted from the earthdata website https search earthdata nasa gov with a spatial resolution 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h 2 cldas product the cldas is a data assimilation system developed by the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn the cldas v 2 0 went online to replace the cldas v 1 0 on 17 january 2017 the cldas product uses data fusion and assimilation techniques to fuse multi source data to obtain grid data of high quality soil temperature humidity pressure precipitation and other factors and then drive the land surface process model to obtain land surface variables the cldas product describes soil moisture in five layers 0 5 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm the 100 200 cm layer was not used in our analysis in this study the cldas v 2 0 was selected with a spatial resolution 0 0625 and a temporal resolution of 1 h 3 smos product the smos mission with l band radiometry is the first l band microwave satellite dedicated to making global observations of soil moisture over land https gportal jaxa jp because it uses low frequencies 1 42 ghz 21 cm smos can provide adequate spatial resolution and is seldom affected by cloud cover vegetation cover and other factors the smos satellite carries an interferometric radiometer that was launched on 2 november 2009 using the smos mission it is possible to obtain soil moisture information for the global surface twice every 3 days at 6 00 am ascending and 6 00 pm descending equatorial local crossing time in this study smos l3 soil moisture data with a spatial resolution of 25 km delivered by catds centre aval de traitement des donnees smos were used 4 smap product the smap satellite was launched on 31 january 2015 it carries two l band microwave sensors one l band radiometer and one l band radar the l band satellite can be used to obtain global scale soil moisture and freeze thaw state https search earthdata nasa gov it is a near polar sun synchronous satellite although the smap radar failed on 7 july 2015 the l band radiometer continues to operate as planned and provides routine data the smap product has been publicly available for free from the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center since november 2015 in this study the smap level 4 l4 product was selected at 9 km spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution all the remotely sensed soil moisture products were resampled to 0 25 resolution to match the spatial characteristic of gldas soil moisture data the evaluation work was completed at this scale 0 25 see the green square in fig 1 cui et al 2017 2 3 method to ensure temporal representativeness the eddy covariance flux tower data were used to produce a continuous timeseries 1 august 2016 31 july 2017 of soil moisture in hulunbeir to satisfy quality and spatial representativeness demands 39 sampling points in 2016 46 sampling points in 2017 36 sampling points in 2018 and 26 sampling points in 2019 were selected for soil moisture determination fig 1 to represent the ground truth of hulunbeir because the smos and smap products can only obtain the soil moisture values of surface soil and the vertical variation in soil moisture was limited to within 10 cm depth below the surface only surface soil moisture values were compared among these four products in this study the measured surface soil moisture 0 5 cm samples were compared with two model data and two satellite data for hulunbeir their performance was assessed based on standard statistical metrics including the mean bias the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 which together provide a comprehensive description of product performance to decrease the error between the sampled measured data and the other datasets we chose to use data that were collected over the same period the field investigation was mainly conducted in summer so the reduced accuracy in retrievals during the frozen season for smap and smos was avoided 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations in regional soil moisture 3 1 1 temporal variation in hulunbeir soil moisture the time series of soil moisture and precipitation for the period of 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2017 showed that nearly 80 of annual precipitation occurred in summer and autumn fig 3 the soil moisture changed little in winter 1 november to 31 january and spring 1 february to 30 april with low precipitation overall during these periods the soil moisture content gradually increased with increasing depth from 5 to 20 cm and the change over time in soil moisture of these three layers was the same however the 10 20 cm soil layer showed clear hysteresis especially in spring the soil moisture in the first 0 5 cm and second 5 10 cm layers increased on april 1 and the peak value of the third layer occurred 18 days behind those of the other layers this is likely because as the temperature increases the snow and ice at the surface gradually melts which increases the soil moisture in addition the frozen soil in deep soil melts during late spring the soil moisture changes in summer and autumn are clear with all three layers providing similar information fig 3 3 1 2 spatial and vertical variation in hulunbeir soil moisture as stated above the soil moisture gradually increased in summer and autumn then remained nearly constant in winter and spring however in late spring the snow and ice in the soil gradually melted as temperature increased which caused the soil moisture to increase at the surface the deep soil layer 10 20 cm showed a clear lag in this period however the eddy covariance flux tower was located at the grassland forest transition because of geographic constraints and thus could not reflect the change across the entire spatial distribution of soil moisture in the study region therefore based on the time series monitoring we selected the field samples to address spatial changes in soil moisture across hulunbeir the sampling points were mainly located in west hulunbeir fig 1 because the distribution of sampling points was relatively concentrated there were limitations to the spatial interpolation results however all three images fig 4 showed that the soil moisture gradually decreased from east to west in this region a comparison between figs 1 and 4 reveals that the main vegetation types in the study area from west to east were typical grassland grassland forest transition and forest which suggests that the shift in vegetation type with deep rooted plant systems would result in increased consumption of deep water in addition the capability for water absorption and water storage gradually increased 3 2 comparison among different soil moisture products 3 2 1 temporal variation of soil moisture among the different products the remotely sensed data tended to underestimate the soil moisture in summer and autumn but they were all higher than the measured values in the other seasons fig 5 the smos data were mainly missing in these two periods the soil moisture changes in summer and autumn were clearer with all five datasets presenting a similar trend in these two seasons the smap gldas and cldas products were able to reflect the soil moisture better than the smos product of these the smap product was more precise and was in real time whereas the other two products had a time lag the pearson s correlation coefficients among different soil moisture products ranged from 0 179 to 0 639 table 1 and it is notable that the pearson s correlation coefficient among different soil moisture data against the eddy covariance data shifted with time this might have been caused by the different penetration depths of the sensor and the delay required for water to infiltrate and reach each depth the correlation coefficients were generally lower in summer than in autumn but very high correlations were found between eddy covariance data and the cldas product table 1 based on the values of the correlation coefficients the smap gldas and cldas products captured the temporal variation in soil moisture in the semiarid area more accurately in autumn than in summer the results of the smos product were poor because of the effect of radio frequency identification pollution soldo et al 2014 3 2 2 spatial variation in surface soil moisture among the different products a spatial distribution map of surface soil moisture was prepared for the four datasets fig 6 because the smos descending orbit data were insufficient the smos ascending smos a orbit was considered fig 7 a and b present the different data and scatterplot values of the average soil moisture from the sampling points respectively because the surface soil moisture 0 10 cm was only measured in 2018 and 2019 the statistical metrics are given in table 2 the distribution of the different datasets fig 6 was compared with the soil moisture data presented in fig 4a fig 6 shows that the soil moisture content gradually increased from west to east and the lowest soil moisture values were found in southern hulunbeir all datasets showed the same spatial distribution trend the cldas product was the most consistent with the measured data whereas the gldas and smap products underestimated the soil moisture and the spatial correlation of the smos a product was especially poor the gldas and smap products tended to underestimate the soil moisture with biases of 0 0217 and 0 0257 m3 m 3 respectively fig 7 the main reason for this phenomenon was the mismatch of spatial representativeness between the sampling and remotely sensed data it therefore remains a major challenge for us to improve the precision of soil moisture products this issue together with environmental factors and sensor errors might have resulted in the high rmse however the r 2 between the gldas and smap products and sampling measured data were 0 717 and 0 659 respectively this suggests that the gldas data and smap data can best reflect the real distribution of soil moisture content in hulunbeir the cldas product showed good coincidence with the other datasets even compared with the gldas products it had slightly higher values of the bias and rmse than those of the other products and achieved modest accuracy in addition it captured the temporal variation of soil moisture in semiarid areas the smos a product had slightly smaller bias and rmse values than the other datasets smos has a larger radiometric error than smap and because of its low altitude the contribution of the total electron contents above the satellite are non negligible for soil moisture inversion in addition smos a uses the interferometric technique to retrieve brightness temperature and suffers a greater level of radio frequency identification pollution than other products these factors are likely to have contributed to the poor performance of the smos a product the smos product also had the lowest r 2 values of the four datasets in summary the remotely sensed products underestimated soil moisture in hulunbeir the cldas product showed the best performance of the datasets in this study and can thus most accurately reflect the soil moisture situation in hulunbeir the gldas product had similar performance to the cldas product in hulunbeir but failed to capture the slight changes in soil moisture compared with the model datasets the satellite products generally showed low accuracy except for the smos a dataset the smap product underestimated soil moisture in hulunbeir but its rmse and r 2 values approximately met the mission criteria we suggest that the smap product has an acceptable performance in hulunbeir the smos a product has smaller result than other products 3 2 3 determining soil moisture at different depths because remote sensing technology can only monitor surface soil moisture of land the model simulation products were used to obtain the value of soil moisture at different depths therefore the cldas and gldas products were selected to assess the applicability to different soil depths 10 40 and 40 100 cm model results were compared with the field data to examine whether the model product was consistent in the vertical direction comparison of figs 4 and 8 reveals the same trend between the gldas product and the cldas product and the field sampling data with a gradual increase from west to east especially to the east of the forest grass transition zone where the vegetation development was under a transition process from shallow root to deep root in general forest has the highest capacity to uptake deep water for transpiration and a large amount of water can be stored in deep soils comparison between the cldas product and field sampling revealed that the maximum values were essentially equal but the gldas product had a lower minimum value the r 2 values for the two products at 10 40 cm were significantly higher than those at 40 100 cm 4 discussion 4 1 potential causes of error in the four datasets the results of this study indicated that the four datasets could not accurately reflect soil moisture the weather terrain and vegetation are likely to be the main causes of this error rather than sensor errors moreover the topsoil of this area contains abundant soil organic carbon that might influence the soil physical properties including the soil dielectric properties however it is necessary to determine which factor was the main source of the error in this study the slope precipitation temperature lai and ndvi were selected to identify the main environmental source of the error in the four datasets the slope data were extracted from digital elevation model dem data the precipitation data were retrieved from cldas at the same time as soil moisture and the temperature lai and ndvi data were retrieved from modis for the same period and location the five factors were spatially consistent with the distribution of soil moisture except temperature distribution in hulunbeir fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the slope gradually increased from west to east as shown in fig 1 the largest increase in slope distribution was in the forest grass transition zone from this area to the east is mainly forest and the slope also showed major increases correspondingly the values of precipitation lai and ndvi presented the same increasing trend however because of the impact of vegetation cover the temperature presented the opposite spatial distribution to the other factors correlation coefficients were used to detect the relationship between these five factors the correlation coefficient between slope and soil moisture was the lowest of all factors fig 10 which can be explained by the lack of sampling measured data on steep slopes in addition temperature and soil moisture presented a substantial negative correlation in the forest grass transition zone the vegetation development was under a transit process from shallow root to deep root therefore the soil water gradually growing from this place at the same times the precipitation lai and ndvi are corresponding increase 4 2 definition of the main influencing factors on each dataset multiple stepwise regression was selected to explore the main environmental factors responsible for the error in these different products and to assess the extent of the error caused by each factor 1 gldas product multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that temperature and precipitation were the main environmental factors that caused the gldas product to deviate from the sampling measured data t tests showed that only the slope precipitation and ndvi values were significant with values of 2 591 p 0 012 1 677 p 0 099 and 1 897 p 0 063 respectively multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture gldas 0 002 slope 0 065 precipitation 0 088 ndvi 0 191 precipitation and ndvi were the main environmental factors influencing the error of the gldas soil moisture product comparison of the coefficient values indicated that precipitation was the most important influencing factor however the coefficient values of these two factors were very low which indicates that the quality of gldas product is high this result is consistent with the above analysis see table 1 2 cldas product the precipitation ndvi and temperature values were identified as significant factors during multiple stepwise regression with t test values of 2 539 p 0 014 4 783 p 0 000 and 2 402 p 0 020 respectively multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture cldas 0 105 precipitation 0 234 ndvi 0 003 temperature 0 019 ndvi was the main factor affecting the accuracy of the cldas product but the coefficient value was very low in combination with the analysis of section 4 1 this reveals that the cldas product accurately reflected the measured soil moisture in hulunbeir 3 smap product multiple stepwise regression for the smap product showed that precipitation ndvi and slope were the three main factors affecting the accuracy of the smap product in hulunbeir the t tests results were as follows 2 763 p 0 008 3 011 p 0 004 and 2 053 p 0 045 for precipitation ndvi and slope respectively multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture smap 0 102 precipitation 0 111 ndvi 0 002 slope 0 152 ndvi was more important than the temperature for the smap product in addition the coefficients for the smap product were larger than those for the gldas product which means that this product was more strongly influenced by environmental factors than the above two products this result is consistent with the above analysis see table 1 4 smos a product the multiple regression results for the smos a product showed that precipitation and ndvi were the main factors affecting the accuracy of the smos a product in hulunbeir the t test values were 2 763 p 0 008 and 3 011 p 0 004 for precipitation and ndvi which clearly shows a regression multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture smos a 0 102 precipitation 0 111 ndvi 0 152 precipitation and ndvi were the main factors affecting the accuracy of the smos a product in hulunbeir in addition precipitation ndvi and soil moisture smos a product showed clear spatial consistency which lends credibility to this product in summary the cldas product was identified as optimal to provide a precise inversion of the soil moisture content at 0 10 cm soil depth in hulunbeir although ndvi was identified as the main environmental factor causing the error the value of its coefficient was very small second the gldas product and the smap product were influenced by the same three factors however the coefficient values for gldas were lower finally the smos a product was affected by precipitation and ndvi examination of these findings reveals that the ndvi is an important factor affecting the accuracy of soil moisture products in the semiarid area of hulunbeir precipitation was the other main factor affecting these products 4 3 verification of the key influencing factors precipitation and ndvi were the main environmental factors influencing data accuracy which was verified by the time series dataset from the eddy covariance flux tower because the location of the eddy covariance flux tower is fixed the dataset was ignored in this study however it should be noted that precipitation rate datasets contain small numbers of intensive rainfall events that might affect the calculated correlation coefficients after removal of all rainfall events above or equal to the 90th percentile the pearson s correlation coefficients increased compared with those presented in table 1 all data however the correlation coefficient values for the gldas dataset showed a decline in these time series which indicates that the gldas dataset was rarely affected by the environmental factors to obtain a deeper insight into the dependence of this conclusion from the above discussion we prepared scatterplots for subsets of the two hydrological quarters of summer and autumn the soil moisture changes in autumn were clear with all three datasets providing similar information fig 11 conversely in summer both gldas and cldas time series plots barely changed the r 2 values increased after removal of all rainfall events above the 90th percentile tables 1 and 3 fig 11 this shows that precipitation was the main factor that leads to error at the same time the r 2 values increased after splitting the analyzed soil moisture datasets into separate periods where the effect of precipitation was stronger in summer than autumn fig 11 the r 2 values clearly increased when the strong rainfall events were removed but the r 2 values of the cldas product declined in summer in autumn the r 2 values for the smos a product showed a clear difference to the other two products which usually remained constant or even decreased thus as mentioned in section 4 2 precipitation was the main environmental cause of data error however it had no obvious effects on model products and the accuracy of results was significantly elevated in the satellite products after removal of the influence of high intensity precipitation events 5 conclusion the validation of soil moisture measurements from various sources and different depths is an important scientific challenge in this study we conducted a detailed analysis and comparison of a range of simulation and remotely sensed soil moisture products over the area of hulunbeir with oven dried samples and eddy covariance data these values were compared with the measured data by using linear correlation and statistical metrics in addition five environmental factors slope precipitation temperature ndvi and lai were evaluated through stepwise regression to determine the major factor affecting these products the main findings were as follows 1 the results of the eddy covariance flux tower and field sampling showed that the soil moisture varied greatly in summer and autumn but remained constant in other periods the soil moisture gradually decreased from east to west in this region in line with the vegetation spatial distribution the deep soil moisture presented the same spatial and temporal tendencies as the surface soil moisture with the increase in soil depth the soil moisture tended to increase initially and then decrease 2 compared with the measured data these four products all underestimated soil moisture in this area except in winter and spring the cldas product was found to reflect the field observation features most accurately for soil moisture in temporal horizontal and vertical dimensions the gldas product and the smap product were also suitable but the smos product failed to capture the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture in hulunbeir 3 five environmental factors were evaluated to identify the major environmental factors influencing the error in these products correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression were used to identify which factors most strongly affected the precision of the data product precipitation and ndvi were the main environmental factors causing errors in all four products slope was the next most important factor influencing the gldas and smap products temperature only influenced the cldas product and its ratio was low 4 ndvi and precipitation were identified as the two main environmental causes of data error after removing the influence of high intensity precipitation events the accuracy of satellite products was significantly elevated thus smoothed gldas and cldas data were identified as most appropriate for the surface layer because they considered multiple soil parameters credit authorship contribution

4611,soil moisture is a key variable in hydrological processes and is included in a wide range of global datasets however accurate indications of spatio temporal characteristics of soil moisture remain limited for east asia this study focused on hulunbeir a typical climate sensitive grassland area in east asia four soil moisture datasets were retrieved from global land data assimilation system gldas cma land data assimilation system cldas soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap and the differences between these datasets and measured soil moisture data were analyzed by correlation analysis the key factors affecting soil water such as slope precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were selected to identify the main causes of errors between the product dataset values and measured data by multiple stepwise regression analysis the four products tended to underestimate the soil moisture but exaggerated the temporal variation in winter and spring the cldas and smap products provided good representation of the amplitude and spatio temporal variation in soil moisture the gldas product performed well with acceptable error metrics but failed to capture the vertical variation in soil moisture the smos product had a missing data problem which reduced its utility in the study area notably ndvi and precipitation were the main factors leading to the underestimation by the above four products this study provides an important reference for accurately describing the hydrological characteristics of climate sensitive

is a lack of understanding of the physical mechanism and because the results are highly dependent on the input parameters these simulations cannot be applied over large areas the third approach is remote sensing technology which allows rapid assessment of the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture over a wide area crow et al 2012 there are several remote sensing based soil moisture products such as active microwave sensors the european remote sensing satellites ers 1 since 1992 and ers 2 since 1996 and the advanced scatterometer ascat since 2006 wagner et al 2013 passive microwave sensors include soil moisture and ocean salinity smos since 2009 quets et al 2019 soil moisture active passive smap since 2015 fan et al 2020 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e since 2002 xie et al 2019 although microwave monitoring has a strong ability to penetrate cloud and fog it can be influenced and limited by the natural variability and complexity of the vegetation canopy and surface roughness brocca et al 2012b according to previous studies albergel et al 2009 draper et al 2009b gruhier et al 2010 passive microwave soil moisture products perform better over sparsely vegetated regions whereas the active microwave products show better agreement in regions with moderate vegetation density the two products show similar performance over sparsely to moderately vegetated regions although there is an absence of adequate research comparing the smap product with other soil moisture products it is generally in good agreement with in situ measurements in both dry or wet regions zeng et al 2016 the smap soil moisture product also showed good correlation with the true footprint average in sparsely vegetated regions chen et al 2017 recently many soil moisture validation works have been conducted around the world zhang et al 2017 chan steven et al 2016 cho et al 2017 however little comparative work on soil moisture products has been performed in northeast china a long term large scale and highly accurate surface soil moisture dataset is important for studying water circulation and global climate change however limited information is available on the accuracy of products for determining the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture in east asia therefore using hulunbeir inner mongolia as the study area we established a spatio temporal cross comparison framework to assess the accuracies of simulation and remote sensing through additional field measurements the methods used included in situ measurement using the oven drying method eddy covariance flux tower measurements two land data assimilation system simulations the global land data assimilation system gldas and the cma land data assimilation system cldas and two remote sensing retrieval methods l band products from smos and nasa s soil moisture active passive smap satellite mission five environmental factors were considered in this analysis of the different products slope precipitation temperature normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and leaf area index lai to assess which factors were responsible for any under or over estimation relative to the field data finally these findings were verified after removal of all rainfall events above the 90th percentile between 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2017 this study provides an important reference for accurately describing the hydrological characteristics of climate sensitive grassland areas to achieve efficient management of water resources 2 material and method 2 1 study area hulunbeir is in northeastern inner mongolia china 115 31 126 04 e 47 05 53 20 n covering about 2 5 105 km2 which accounts for 21 4 of the autonomous region fig 1 in this area the major types of vegetation from east to west are forest transition of forest grass and meadow steppe the altitude of hulunbeir is 550 1000 m and the area presents a slow transition from high in the east to low in the west the terrain characteristics cause hulunbeir to have a continental monsoon climate characterized by high winds and four distinct seasons the average precipitation decreases from east to west and has ranged from 604 to 213 mm over the past 15 years http westdc westgis ac cn data the precipitation mainly occurs from may to september when the temperature increases from east to west the main soil types in this area include alfisols calcium layer soil semi lucisols primary soil semi hydromorphic soil saline soil and water into the soil according to the harmonized world soil database http www fao org the alfisols and calcium layer soil are the main soil type in hulunbeir the alfisols are mainly distributed in the east of the study area and have good soil water holding capacity so this area is mostly forest the calcium layer soil is mainly distributed in the west of the study area this area is mainly dominated by grassland because the calcium layer soil is unable to store moisture see fig 2 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 field sampling data in this study the in situ soil moisture was obtained from field sampling through an oven drying experiment in the laboratory the soil moisture sample points were in the southwest part of hulunbeir and most of them were in the hailar basin fig 1 through four consecutive sampling surveys we obtained the spatial variability of soil moisture in hulunbeir soil samples were taken from five depths 0 5 5 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm the collected soil samples were measured in the field the soil samples were transported to the laboratory and oven dried at 105 c yinglan et al 2019 the equation used to calculate the soil moisture content was as follows 1 s w c m f m d m d m a 100 where swc is the gravimetric soil moisture content m3 m 3 mf is the weight of the fresh soil sample in the aluminum box md is the weight of the dried soil sample in the aluminum box and ma is the weight of the aluminum box in addition soil moisture data were obtained from an eddy covariance flux tower to study the temporal variability of soil water content within a time series 1 august 2016 31 july 2017 these data were obtained daily from three depths 0 5 5 10 and 10 20 cm 2 2 2 in situ observation data daily meteorological data from 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2017 were collected at the hailar station which was near the eddy covariance flux tower fig 1 the data included precipitation mm evaporation mm and air temperature c meteorological data collected at the stations were downloaded from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn 2 2 3 remotely sensed soil moisture products 1 gldas product the gldas was developed by nasa goddard space flight center and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration national centers for environmental prediction by streamlining and parallelization with the land information system the software can drive multiple offline land models and integrate a huge quantity of observation base data the gldas is executed globally at high resolution 0 25 to 1 and can produce results in near real time the gldas product describes soil moisture in four layers 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm the 100 200 cm layer was not used in our analysis in this study the gldas product was extracted from the earthdata website https search earthdata nasa gov with a spatial resolution 0 25 and a temporal resolution of 3 h 2 cldas product the cldas is a data assimilation system developed by the national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn the cldas v 2 0 went online to replace the cldas v 1 0 on 17 january 2017 the cldas product uses data fusion and assimilation techniques to fuse multi source data to obtain grid data of high quality soil temperature humidity pressure precipitation and other factors and then drive the land surface process model to obtain land surface variables the cldas product describes soil moisture in five layers 0 5 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm the 100 200 cm layer was not used in our analysis in this study the cldas v 2 0 was selected with a spatial resolution 0 0625 and a temporal resolution of 1 h 3 smos product the smos mission with l band radiometry is the first l band microwave satellite dedicated to making global observations of soil moisture over land https gportal jaxa jp because it uses low frequencies 1 42 ghz 21 cm smos can provide adequate spatial resolution and is seldom affected by cloud cover vegetation cover and other factors the smos satellite carries an interferometric radiometer that was launched on 2 november 2009 using the smos mission it is possible to obtain soil moisture information for the global surface twice every 3 days at 6 00 am ascending and 6 00 pm descending equatorial local crossing time in this study smos l3 soil moisture data with a spatial resolution of 25 km delivered by catds centre aval de traitement des donnees smos were used 4 smap product the smap satellite was launched on 31 january 2015 it carries two l band microwave sensors one l band radiometer and one l band radar the l band satellite can be used to obtain global scale soil moisture and freeze thaw state https search earthdata nasa gov it is a near polar sun synchronous satellite although the smap radar failed on 7 july 2015 the l band radiometer continues to operate as planned and provides routine data the smap product has been publicly available for free from the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center since november 2015 in this study the smap level 4 l4 product was selected at 9 km spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution all the remotely sensed soil moisture products were resampled to 0 25 resolution to match the spatial characteristic of gldas soil moisture data the evaluation work was completed at this scale 0 25 see the green square in fig 1 cui et al 2017 2 3 method to ensure temporal representativeness the eddy covariance flux tower data were used to produce a continuous timeseries 1 august 2016 31 july 2017 of soil moisture in hulunbeir to satisfy quality and spatial representativeness demands 39 sampling points in 2016 46 sampling points in 2017 36 sampling points in 2018 and 26 sampling points in 2019 were selected for soil moisture determination fig 1 to represent the ground truth of hulunbeir because the smos and smap products can only obtain the soil moisture values of surface soil and the vertical variation in soil moisture was limited to within 10 cm depth below the surface only surface soil moisture values were compared among these four products in this study the measured surface soil moisture 0 5 cm samples were compared with two model data and two satellite data for hulunbeir their performance was assessed based on standard statistical metrics including the mean bias the root mean square error rmse and the coefficient of determination r 2 which together provide a comprehensive description of product performance to decrease the error between the sampled measured data and the other datasets we chose to use data that were collected over the same period the field investigation was mainly conducted in summer so the reduced accuracy in retrievals during the frozen season for smap and smos was avoided 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal variations in regional soil moisture 3 1 1 temporal variation in hulunbeir soil moisture the time series of soil moisture and precipitation for the period of 1 august 2016 to 31 july 2017 showed that nearly 80 of annual precipitation occurred in summer and autumn fig 3 the soil moisture changed little in winter 1 november to 31 january and spring 1 february to 30 april with low precipitation overall during these periods the soil moisture content gradually increased with increasing depth from 5 to 20 cm and the change over time in soil moisture of these three layers was the same however the 10 20 cm soil layer showed clear hysteresis especially in spring the soil moisture in the first 0 5 cm and second 5 10 cm layers increased on april 1 and the peak value of the third layer occurred 18 days behind those of the other layers this is likely because as the temperature increases the snow and ice at the surface gradually melts which increases the soil moisture in addition the frozen soil in deep soil melts during late spring the soil moisture changes in summer and autumn are clear with all three layers providing similar information fig 3 3 1 2 spatial and vertical variation in hulunbeir soil moisture as stated above the soil moisture gradually increased in summer and autumn then remained nearly constant in winter and spring however in late spring the snow and ice in the soil gradually melted as temperature increased which caused the soil moisture to increase at the surface the deep soil layer 10 20 cm showed a clear lag in this period however the eddy covariance flux tower was located at the grassland forest transition because of geographic constraints and thus could not reflect the change across the entire spatial distribution of soil moisture in the study region therefore based on the time series monitoring we selected the field samples to address spatial changes in soil moisture across hulunbeir the sampling points were mainly located in west hulunbeir fig 1 because the distribution of sampling points was relatively concentrated there were limitations to the spatial interpolation results however all three images fig 4 showed that the soil moisture gradually decreased from east to west in this region a comparison between figs 1 and 4 reveals that the main vegetation types in the study area from west to east were typical grassland grassland forest transition and forest which suggests that the shift in vegetation type with deep rooted plant systems would result in increased consumption of deep water in addition the capability for water absorption and water storage gradually increased 3 2 comparison among different soil moisture products 3 2 1 temporal variation of soil moisture among the different products the remotely sensed data tended to underestimate the soil moisture in summer and autumn but they were all higher than the measured values in the other seasons fig 5 the smos data were mainly missing in these two periods the soil moisture changes in summer and autumn were clearer with all five datasets presenting a similar trend in these two seasons the smap gldas and cldas products were able to reflect the soil moisture better than the smos product of these the smap product was more precise and was in real time whereas the other two products had a time lag the pearson s correlation coefficients among different soil moisture products ranged from 0 179 to 0 639 table 1 and it is notable that the pearson s correlation coefficient among different soil moisture data against the eddy covariance data shifted with time this might have been caused by the different penetration depths of the sensor and the delay required for water to infiltrate and reach each depth the correlation coefficients were generally lower in summer than in autumn but very high correlations were found between eddy covariance data and the cldas product table 1 based on the values of the correlation coefficients the smap gldas and cldas products captured the temporal variation in soil moisture in the semiarid area more accurately in autumn than in summer the results of the smos product were poor because of the effect of radio frequency identification pollution soldo et al 2014 3 2 2 spatial variation in surface soil moisture among the different products a spatial distribution map of surface soil moisture was prepared for the four datasets fig 6 because the smos descending orbit data were insufficient the smos ascending smos a orbit was considered fig 7 a and b present the different data and scatterplot values of the average soil moisture from the sampling points respectively because the surface soil moisture 0 10 cm was only measured in 2018 and 2019 the statistical metrics are given in table 2 the distribution of the different datasets fig 6 was compared with the soil moisture data presented in fig 4a fig 6 shows that the soil moisture content gradually increased from west to east and the lowest soil moisture values were found in southern hulunbeir all datasets showed the same spatial distribution trend the cldas product was the most consistent with the measured data whereas the gldas and smap products underestimated the soil moisture and the spatial correlation of the smos a product was especially poor the gldas and smap products tended to underestimate the soil moisture with biases of 0 0217 and 0 0257 m3 m 3 respectively fig 7 the main reason for this phenomenon was the mismatch of spatial representativeness between the sampling and remotely sensed data it therefore remains a major challenge for us to improve the precision of soil moisture products this issue together with environmental factors and sensor errors might have resulted in the high rmse however the r 2 between the gldas and smap products and sampling measured data were 0 717 and 0 659 respectively this suggests that the gldas data and smap data can best reflect the real distribution of soil moisture content in hulunbeir the cldas product showed good coincidence with the other datasets even compared with the gldas products it had slightly higher values of the bias and rmse than those of the other products and achieved modest accuracy in addition it captured the temporal variation of soil moisture in semiarid areas the smos a product had slightly smaller bias and rmse values than the other datasets smos has a larger radiometric error than smap and because of its low altitude the contribution of the total electron contents above the satellite are non negligible for soil moisture inversion in addition smos a uses the interferometric technique to retrieve brightness temperature and suffers a greater level of radio frequency identification pollution than other products these factors are likely to have contributed to the poor performance of the smos a product the smos product also had the lowest r 2 values of the four datasets in summary the remotely sensed products underestimated soil moisture in hulunbeir the cldas product showed the best performance of the datasets in this study and can thus most accurately reflect the soil moisture situation in hulunbeir the gldas product had similar performance to the cldas product in hulunbeir but failed to capture the slight changes in soil moisture compared with the model datasets the satellite products generally showed low accuracy except for the smos a dataset the smap product underestimated soil moisture in hulunbeir but its rmse and r 2 values approximately met the mission criteria we suggest that the smap product has an acceptable performance in hulunbeir the smos a product has smaller result than other products 3 2 3 determining soil moisture at different depths because remote sensing technology can only monitor surface soil moisture of land the model simulation products were used to obtain the value of soil moisture at different depths therefore the cldas and gldas products were selected to assess the applicability to different soil depths 10 40 and 40 100 cm model results were compared with the field data to examine whether the model product was consistent in the vertical direction comparison of figs 4 and 8 reveals the same trend between the gldas product and the cldas product and the field sampling data with a gradual increase from west to east especially to the east of the forest grass transition zone where the vegetation development was under a transition process from shallow root to deep root in general forest has the highest capacity to uptake deep water for transpiration and a large amount of water can be stored in deep soils comparison between the cldas product and field sampling revealed that the maximum values were essentially equal but the gldas product had a lower minimum value the r 2 values for the two products at 10 40 cm were significantly higher than those at 40 100 cm 4 discussion 4 1 potential causes of error in the four datasets the results of this study indicated that the four datasets could not accurately reflect soil moisture the weather terrain and vegetation are likely to be the main causes of this error rather than sensor errors moreover the topsoil of this area contains abundant soil organic carbon that might influence the soil physical properties including the soil dielectric properties however it is necessary to determine which factor was the main source of the error in this study the slope precipitation temperature lai and ndvi were selected to identify the main environmental source of the error in the four datasets the slope data were extracted from digital elevation model dem data the precipitation data were retrieved from cldas at the same time as soil moisture and the temperature lai and ndvi data were retrieved from modis for the same period and location the five factors were spatially consistent with the distribution of soil moisture except temperature distribution in hulunbeir fig 9 as shown in fig 9a the slope gradually increased from west to east as shown in fig 1 the largest increase in slope distribution was in the forest grass transition zone from this area to the east is mainly forest and the slope also showed major increases correspondingly the values of precipitation lai and ndvi presented the same increasing trend however because of the impact of vegetation cover the temperature presented the opposite spatial distribution to the other factors correlation coefficients were used to detect the relationship between these five factors the correlation coefficient between slope and soil moisture was the lowest of all factors fig 10 which can be explained by the lack of sampling measured data on steep slopes in addition temperature and soil moisture presented a substantial negative correlation in the forest grass transition zone the vegetation development was under a transit process from shallow root to deep root therefore the soil water gradually growing from this place at the same times the precipitation lai and ndvi are corresponding increase 4 2 definition of the main influencing factors on each dataset multiple stepwise regression was selected to explore the main environmental factors responsible for the error in these different products and to assess the extent of the error caused by each factor 1 gldas product multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that temperature and precipitation were the main environmental factors that caused the gldas product to deviate from the sampling measured data t tests showed that only the slope precipitation and ndvi values were significant with values of 2 591 p 0 012 1 677 p 0 099 and 1 897 p 0 063 respectively multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture gldas 0 002 slope 0 065 precipitation 0 088 ndvi 0 191 precipitation and ndvi were the main environmental factors influencing the error of the gldas soil moisture product comparison of the coefficient values indicated that precipitation was the most important influencing factor however the coefficient values of these two factors were very low which indicates that the quality of gldas product is high this result is consistent with the above analysis see table 1 2 cldas product the precipitation ndvi and temperature values were identified as significant factors during multiple stepwise regression with t test values of 2 539 p 0 014 4 783 p 0 000 and 2 402 p 0 020 respectively multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture cldas 0 105 precipitation 0 234 ndvi 0 003 temperature 0 019 ndvi was the main factor affecting the accuracy of the cldas product but the coefficient value was very low in combination with the analysis of section 4 1 this reveals that the cldas product accurately reflected the measured soil moisture in hulunbeir 3 smap product multiple stepwise regression for the smap product showed that precipitation ndvi and slope were the three main factors affecting the accuracy of the smap product in hulunbeir the t tests results were as follows 2 763 p 0 008 3 011 p 0 004 and 2 053 p 0 045 for precipitation ndvi and slope respectively multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture smap 0 102 precipitation 0 111 ndvi 0 002 slope 0 152 ndvi was more important than the temperature for the smap product in addition the coefficients for the smap product were larger than those for the gldas product which means that this product was more strongly influenced by environmental factors than the above two products this result is consistent with the above analysis see table 1 4 smos a product the multiple regression results for the smos a product showed that precipitation and ndvi were the main factors affecting the accuracy of the smos a product in hulunbeir the t test values were 2 763 p 0 008 and 3 011 p 0 004 for precipitation and ndvi which clearly shows a regression multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed the following equation soil moisture smos a 0 102 precipitation 0 111 ndvi 0 152 precipitation and ndvi were the main factors affecting the accuracy of the smos a product in hulunbeir in addition precipitation ndvi and soil moisture smos a product showed clear spatial consistency which lends credibility to this product in summary the cldas product was identified as optimal to provide a precise inversion of the soil moisture content at 0 10 cm soil depth in hulunbeir although ndvi was identified as the main environmental factor causing the error the value of its coefficient was very small second the gldas product and the smap product were influenced by the same three factors however the coefficient values for gldas were lower finally the smos a product was affected by precipitation and ndvi examination of these findings reveals that the ndvi is an important factor affecting the accuracy of soil moisture products in the semiarid area of hulunbeir precipitation was the other main factor affecting these products 4 3 verification of the key influencing factors precipitation and ndvi were the main environmental factors influencing data accuracy which was verified by the time series dataset from the eddy covariance flux tower because the location of the eddy covariance flux tower is fixed the dataset was ignored in this study however it should be noted that precipitation rate datasets contain small numbers of intensive rainfall events that might affect the calculated correlation coefficients after removal of all rainfall events above or equal to the 90th percentile the pearson s correlation coefficients increased compared with those presented in table 1 all data however the correlation coefficient values for the gldas dataset showed a decline in these time series which indicates that the gldas dataset was rarely affected by the environmental factors to obtain a deeper insight into the dependence of this conclusion from the above discussion we prepared scatterplots for subsets of the two hydrological quarters of summer and autumn the soil moisture changes in autumn were clear with all three datasets providing similar information fig 11 conversely in summer both gldas and cldas time series plots barely changed the r 2 values increased after removal of all rainfall events above the 90th percentile tables 1 and 3 fig 11 this shows that precipitation was the main factor that leads to error at the same time the r 2 values increased after splitting the analyzed soil moisture datasets into separate periods where the effect of precipitation was stronger in summer than autumn fig 11 the r 2 values clearly increased when the strong rainfall events were removed but the r 2 values of the cldas product declined in summer in autumn the r 2 values for the smos a product showed a clear difference to the other two products which usually remained constant or even decreased thus as mentioned in section 4 2 precipitation was the main environmental cause of data error however it had no obvious effects on model products and the accuracy of results was significantly elevated in the satellite products after removal of the influence of high intensity precipitation events 5 conclusion the validation of soil moisture measurements from various sources and different depths is an important scientific challenge in this study we conducted a detailed analysis and comparison of a range of simulation and remotely sensed soil moisture products over the area of hulunbeir with oven dried samples and eddy covariance data these values were compared with the measured data by using linear correlation and statistical metrics in addition five environmental factors slope precipitation temperature ndvi and lai were evaluated through stepwise regression to determine the major factor affecting these products the main findings were as follows 1 the results of the eddy covariance flux tower and field sampling showed that the soil moisture varied greatly in summer and autumn but remained constant in other periods the soil moisture gradually decreased from east to west in this region in line with the vegetation spatial distribution the deep soil moisture presented the same spatial and temporal tendencies as the surface soil moisture with the increase in soil depth the soil moisture tended to increase initially and then decrease 2 compared with the measured data these four products all underestimated soil moisture in this area except in winter and spring the cldas product was found to reflect the field observation features most accurately for soil moisture in temporal horizontal and vertical dimensions the gldas product and the smap product were also suitable but the smos product failed to capture the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture in hulunbeir 3 five environmental factors were evaluated to identify the major environmental factors influencing the error in these products correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression were used to identify which factors most strongly affected the precision of the data product precipitation and ndvi were the main environmental factors causing errors in all four products slope was the next most important factor influencing the gldas and smap products temperature only influenced the cldas product and its ratio was low 4 ndvi and precipitation were identified as the two main environmental causes of data error after removing the influence of high intensity precipitation events the accuracy of satellite products was significantly elevated thus smoothed gldas and cldas data were identified as most appropriate for the surface layer because they considered multiple soil parameters credit authorship contribution

4612,local bridge scour which is defined as the loss of soil particles mass surrounding a pier foundation due to the flowing water induced shear stresses is a primary cause of bridge failure in the united states and worldwide current practice of bridge scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models work herein presents statistical models that extend five deterministic approaches reported in literature to predict the expected scour depth while quantifying inherent model bias and uncertainty in view of data scatter clear water scour database is used herein and the analyses quantify model scatter by comparatively assessing the computed scour depth versus measured data reported in the database a relationship between probability of deceedance associated with the predicted scour depth and a modification factor that is applied into the deterministic prediction is devised the modification factor allows for the use of the scour magnitude computed from the deterministic models while quantifying the probability of a computed scour depth being less than or more than a most likely value per measurements reported in the database the application of the proposed model is demonstrated with an example and the results are discussed keywords scour bridge pier probability of deceedance clear water statistical models nomenclature b pier width b pier width

particles mass surrounding a pier foundation due to the flowing water induced shear stresses which leads to mobilization and transport of the bed material this process of local scouring is the primary cause of bridge collapse in the united states and worldwide melville and coleman 2000 liang et al 2015 qi et al 2016 based on the investigation of 86 bridge failures that occurred from 1961 to 1976 murillo 1987 concluded that 46 cases could be attributed to erosion of streambed caused by running water in general flood is the main source of the increased flow in the stream that induces development of scour holes surrounding a pier wardhana and hadipriono 2003 analyzed 503 failures of bridge structures that happened in the united states and concluded that 11 of the bridge failure can be attributed to design detailing construction and maintenance reasons while 85 of the bridge failure is related to externally triggered events like flood collision overload etc it was also found that the principal cause 243 cases of bridge failure is flood induced scour while the rest can be related to collision overload deterioration and miscellaneous like fire ice etc even scouring phenomena which do not lead to failure cause major operational disruption and financial losses shirole and holt 1991 briaud et al 1999 azamatullah et al 2014 the average annual cost for flood damage and scour repair of highways in the united states is estimated to be 50 million lagasse et al 1995 2012 rhodes and trent 1993 reported that the additional cost to the afflicted population can be as much as five times the repair cost lin et al 2006 reported that during the period of 1996 to 2001 68 bridge failures that occurred in the united states are related to scour hunt 2009 noted that there are 20 904 scour critical bridges in the united states and approximately 80 000 bridges that are deemed scour susceptible with climate change impacts like increase in heavy precipitation and severe flooding coupled with scour is the leading cause of bridge damage liang et al 2015 which eventually demonstrates the importance of properly estimating the scour magnitude beforehand and thoroughly incorporating in design and countermeasures the available scour prediction models commonly in use can be classified into three categories i deterministic ii probabilistic and iii observation based current practice of bridge scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models at present there are more than 20 pier scour deterministic models available in the literature some models are derived based on laboratory scale data e g arneson et al 2012 briaud 2014 while others are derived from scour measurements taken in field conditions e g wilson 1995 in addition there are models that consider both the laboratory scale data and field scale data e g melville 1997 sheppard et al 2014 ettema et al 2017 and link et al 2019 suggested that the incapability of the laboratory scale models to maintain a geometric similitude among the three length scales pier flow depth and bed sediment size results in differences in scour estimations from laboratory test based models and field observation based models the quantitative estimation of the scale effects to date is a challenge for physical model test researchers heller 2011 2017 kiraga et al 2020 although in froude modeling the concepts of self similitude and reynolds number invariance have been proposed such models do not simulate viscous forces which are necessary to simulate sediment erosion recently link et al 2019 suggested that to exclude scale effects in laboratory scale scour modeling appropriate selection of the dimensionless effective flow work and dimensionless grain diameter is necessary literature suggests that pier scour is influenced by flow depth to pier width ratio pier width to median grain size ratio pier face shape pier aspect ratio skew angle of pier flow intensity euler number or reynolds number sediment non uniformity and the temporal rate of evolution however not all the factors are of equal importance thereby not included in the different deterministic models researchers developed table 1 presents the summary of the aforementioned deterministic models in terms of the consideration of pier scour influencing factors the differences in the choice of consideration of pier scour influencing factors in the deterministic models result in a different scour magnitude prediction for a similar set of hydraulic structural and geotechnical parameters observation based approach such as the one introduced by govindasamy 2009 and govindasamy et al 2013 is based on the idea of capitalizing on the available information from observations at existing bridges thereafter based on the knowledge of maximum flow velocity the bridge has been subjected to in its history future scour depths are predicted and then compared with the allowable scour depth of the foundation to assess the criticality of the foundation however the approach requires performing hydrologic analyses if flow data are available or developing a recurrence interval flood map if flow data are not available the process although does not require site specific erosion testing an assumption of the bed material soil classification is required texas department of transportation adopted this method for the first order bridge scour assessment public agencies are leaning towards using this method to prioritize bridge repairs and countermeasure decisions deterministic scour prediction models do not account for inherent model uncertainties and errors the use of deterministic models does not yield the inherent model bias conservativeness unconservativeness for example kwak and briaud 2002 reported that for pier number 3 w of the old woodrow wilson bridge the measured scour depth ranged from 4 3ft 8 9ft 1 31 m 2 72 m using a deterministic model to estimate the scour depth termed as sricos scour rate in cohesive soils method briaud et al 1999 the maximum scour depth was reported to be 9 3ft 2 85 m kwak et al 2001 while from the scour depth estimation it is apparent that the deterministic sricos model is conservative the designer when applying the sricos model does not know the degree of biasness inherent in the system briaud 2008 reported that using hec 18 model and briaud et al 2001 model the estimated scour at the bascule pier of the new woodrow wilson bridge are 64ft 19 5 m and 38ft 11 6 m respectively without the prior knowledge of the degree of biasness of these models each model predicts different scour depths for similar set of parameters one cannot discern whether or not these prediction are conservative and the extent of conservatism in view a given model s application to a wider set of site conditions this raises the importance of developing of probabilistic models for scour assessment that account for the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties statistical error measurement error human error model error albeit a sufficient level of data is needed for such development johnson 1992 developed a relationship between probability of bridge failure and safety factors in the study bridge failure is defined as the point at which the scour depth reaches the bottom of the pier footing simultaneously admitting that the probability of failure to be different depending on the definition of failure briaud et al 2007 developed a probabilistic bridge scour model that considered the uncertainty of hydrologic conditions however no analyses were presented on the model estimates bias and error distribution bolduc et al 2008 introduced a probabilistic model based on the bias in the deterministic models hec 18 sand and briaud et al 1999 which is also referred to as hec 18 clay and scatter around the mean johnson et al 2015 examined the hydraulic and hydrologic uncertainties associated with hec 18 and fdot 2011 scour prediction models johnson et al suggested scour design factors based on target reliability index defined as the ratio of difference between design and simulated scour depth to standard deviation briaud et al 2014 developed a reliability based pier scour model focusing on the risk product of the probability of occurrence times the value of consequences associated with failure in summary probabilistic aspects to predictive models make a designer aware of the uncertainties associated the model s estimate and the extent to which estimation of scour depth is conservative work herein is focused on the applicability of five models in practice and the bias inherited in their estimate of expected scour magnitude the scope includes quantifying scatter in the predicted scour depth from wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model versus measured data relationship between probability of predicted scour depth deceedance i e predicted scour magnitude being less than measured value and modification factors applied to such prediction is proposed the modification factors are used to adjust the predicted scour magnitude from the five models such that the probability of such prediction deceeding or exceeding a measured value is known finally a step by step application of the proposed model and approach is demonstrated and discussed 2 data for analyses benedict and caldwell 2014 compiled laboratory scour measurements from 17 previous investigations consisting of data from 23 different states within the united states data reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 were classified into two categories clear water and live bed scour the analyses in this paper is focused on the data corresponding to clear water scour condition no of data points 340 benedict and caldwell 2014 in general laboratory investigations allow a controlled environment relatively accurate measurements of downscaled parameters like pier width flow depth flow velocity and scour depth compared to the field investigations studies reported in mueller and wagner 2005 sheppard et al 2011 suggest that deterministic models developed based on laboratory data can well capture the responses in the field thereby providing a means to avoid the uncertainties associated with field data the uncertainties associated with field data might include i the accuracy of measured scour depending on the tool used like ground penetrating radar soundings with fathometers survey levels etc ii maturity of scour depth the measured scour might not reflect the equilibrium scour depth iii accuracy of hydraulic properties depending on the method used to approximate like based on historical information based on one dimensional flow models despite the limitations of using field measurements their importance in comprehending unprecedented and complex field setups cannot be overlooked however owing to measurement accuracy and representative scour depth reported in relation to measured hydraulic structural and geotechnical properties clear water laboratory measurements are considered in the study the ranges of the selected variables for the clear water laboratory data including pier width velocities and median grain size are presented in table 2 the values in table 2 reflect the minimum median and maximum values for a selected variable within the database it is important to note that the data across a single row do not correspond to each other i e the minimum median and maximum values in table 2 across one row are not for a specific site these values rather indicate the minimum median and maximum values of the specified variable within the whole database 3 scour prediction models for analyses five pier scour prediction models namely wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model are utilized herein the model equations are provided in table 3 wilson 1995 model is based on field data collected from 22 bridges in mississippi during the period 1938 1994 the drainage area of the selected sites ranged from 60 8 to 5720 square miles the measured pier scour depth in the sites ranged from 0 6 to 20 4 ft melville 1997 model is based on extensive laboratory and field data collected over a period of 25 years the tests were mostly performed in the university of auckland new zealand melville and sutherland 1988 melville 1992 dongol 1994 the method uses a number of factors refer to tables 1 and 3 that influences scour the value of these factors are determined from the envelope curve fitted to the data melville 1997 sheppard et al 2011 the latest update of hec 18 model by arneson et al 2012 is the most widely used pier scour prediction model and it is recommended by the us federal highway administration fhwa for estimating equilibrium scour depth the initial hec 18 model known as richardson and davis 1995 model used a subset of the data collected by chabert and engeldinger 1956 and shen et al 1966 the subset database consisted of data from laboratory testing on sediments with median grain size d 50 ranging from 0 24 to 0 52 mm thereafter based on the studies of melville and sutherland 1988 and jain and fischer 1979 limits on the maximum scour depth based on froude number was imposed briaud 2014 model is based on data from 94 large scale laboratory flume testing as well as dimensional analysis the d 50 ranged from 0 10 to 0 60 mm the critical shear stress of the bed material varied from 0 1 to 0 8 pa sheppard et al 2014 evaluated the performance of 23 scour prediction models using 441 laboratory and 791 field test results and melded two best performing models sheppard and miller 2006 and melville 1997 to develop the sheppard et al 2014 model the melding was done in such a way that the resulting equation yields the least total error 4 statistical model 4 1 approach formulation in scour prediction models uncertainties arise from multiple sources including hydraulic geotechnical structural or predictive model errors yao 2013 hydraulic uncertainty is associated with errors in estimating flow velocity or flow depth geotechnical uncertainty is related to the soil characteristics and erodibility parameters briaud et al 2019 documented the parameters which affect the erodibility of soil and noted that erodibility is dependent on water content undrained shear strength unit weight plasticity index activity and other parameters which might not be frequently available structural uncertainty arises due to error in estimating the skew angle of the flow with respect to bridge pier or in accurately representing the geometry of the bridge pier in the analysis finally the model uncertainty involves the error generated when a given model is used to predict complex phenomena of bridge scouring the hydraulic geotechnical and structural uncertainties can be addressed through improved field characterization and measurement accuracy by accumulating more data or by performing more targeted tests on the soil bed of interest in the work presented herein we will focus on model uncertainty the model uncertainties will be quantified through analyzing the probability of scour magnitude deceedance associated with the predicted scour depth while using one of the five aforementioned deterministic models fig 1 shows the data scatter associated with scour prediction when applying wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model to the measurement database the scatter in the scour prediction is not uniform across the range of measured scour depth the non uniform scatter gives rise to a non constant variance which statistically is known as heteroscedasticity stone 1996 fig 2 shows a plot of the residuals difference between measured and predicted values obtained from best fit curve for hec 18 model in this case a linear relationship is assumed between the predicted and the measured scour depth it seems that the residual is significantly dispersed in the positive residuals region varying between 0 and 5 whereas the data lie mostly within 0 to 1 in the negative residuals region in addition if a linear relationship between predicted and the measure scour depth is adequate a quantile quantile plot should reveal a normal distribution however fig 2 shows that the relationship between standardized residual and theoretical quantile is not linear rather a significant right skewness in the data is noted in light of these observations a robust model is needed which can reduce the heteroscedasticity and non normal errors accordingly the method suggested by box and cox 1964 commonly referred to as box cox method is adopted for this purpose the main objective of applying the box cox transformation to the database is after the transformation the following is obtained i the error variance is constant homoscedasticity ii the observations are normally distributed iii a model which is linear in the independent variable can represent the expected value of the transformed response i e no interaction terms are required the probabilistic model considering the scatter in scour prediction is formulated as 6 y λ κ y sm b ζ and 7 y λ y sp b λ 1 λ where b denotes the pier width y sp and y sm indicate the predicted and the measured scour depth respectively κ and λ are constant terms depending on the deterministic model being considered and ζ is the error term describing the uncertainty of model prediction to ascertain the most likely value of λ large sample maximum likelihood theory is considered the likelihood in terms of the original observations y can be expressed as in eq 8 8 1 2 π n 2 σ n e x p y λ e y λ y λ e y λ 2 σ 2 i 1 n d y i λ d y i where n is the total number of observations y λ is the column vector of transformed observations e y λ is the expected value of y λ y λ e y λ is the transpose of the vector y λ e y λ and σ 2 is the variance of data more details of the associated steps can be found in box and cox 1964 the estimated parameter λ differ for each of the five models considered herein as presented in fig 3 4 2 interpretation of calculated parameters the calculated parameters for wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model are presented in table 4 the r2 of the fitted models vary from 0 16 for wilson 1995 model to 0 56 for sheppard et al 2014 model magnitude of standard error suggest that melville 1997 model has the maximum variance whereas briaud 2014 model has the minimum variance the 95 confidence limit of the parameter λ can be estimated from fig 3 gardoni et al 2002 bolduc et al 2008 considered logarithmic transformation of the data while fitting models to the gudavalli database gudavalli 1997 landers mueller database landers and mueller 1996 and kwak database kwak 2000 to remove heteroscedasticity gudavalli database consisted of 43 laboratory flume experiments landers mueller database is populated with 305 bridge pier scour measurements from 56 bridges in the united states and kwak database entails bridge pier scour measurements from 10 bridge piers from 8 bridges in the state of texas if the parameter λ is calculated to be 0 then the box cox transformation converts to logarithmic transformation referring to fig 3 and table 4 the parameter λ is not 0 in any of the five models indicating that the logarithmic transformation is not the best fit for the five models based on using the clear water laboratory database reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 fig 4 shows the residual diagnostic plots for the five models the fitted models seem to satisfy the homoscedasticity assumption as indicated by equal dispersion of residuals on either side of the axis although wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model and sheppard et al 2014 model comprehensively satisfies the normality assumption linear relationship between standardized residuals and theoretical quantiles briaud 2014 model seems to have a right skewness to the fitted data to check the possibility of other transformation functions logarithmic transformation inverse transformation square root transformation and inverse square root transformation were performed however in all these cases the right skewness seem to increase resulting in a clear non normal error diagnostic plots are checked nevertheless considering the r2 f statistic and standard residual error box cox transformation provided the best fit model for briaud 2014 model fig 5 shows the fitted model to the clear water laboratory datasets it is important to note that the model equations were not forced to satisfy the condition that the predicted scour depth should be zero if the measured scour depth is zero doing so the heteroscedasticity problem and non normal error arises 4 3 quantification of model error from the clear water laboratory data it is observed that the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured scour depth increases as the magnitude of the scour depth increases this can be owing to the fact that the deterministic models are devised to achieve a conservative estimate of the scour depth for example from extensive laboratory investigation melville and sutherland 1988 reported that the ratio of scour depth to pier width y s b rarely exceeds 2 3 however based on these test results the upper bound of y s b for hec 18 model was set to be 2 4 for f 0 8 which is higher than 2 3 therefore in general when the predicted scour depth from a deterministic model is high actually the measured scour depth in the field is low resulting in a higher discrepancy statistically the described hypothesis is not concrete because the scatter in the predicted versus the measured normalized scour depth plot figs 1 and 5 is significant however some statistical measures need to be taken to quantify the dependence of the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured scour depth on the magnitude of the predicted scour depth diagnostic plots of the prediction discrepancy predicted scour depth presents non normal errors several transformation functions logarithmic transformation exponential transformation inverse transformation square root transformation inverse square root transformation cubic transformation inverse cubic transformation were applied and based on associated residual statistics eq 9 can be suggested 9 ζ y sp b y sm b 1 3 m y sp b ϑ ε where m and ϑ are constants ε is the random error of the model fig 6 shows the residual diagnostics for the model of eq 9 it seems that the model in eq 9 satisfies the homoscedasticity assumption and normality assumption the residuals versus leverage plot suggests that there are no outliers or influential data points fig 7 shows the relationship between ζ and predicted scour depths for the five models considered herein in addition to the model best fit regression line 95 confidence limits and 95 prediction limits are also presented it seems that the discrepancy function ζ increases as the magnitude of the predicted normalized scour depth increases the calculated model parameters for wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model are presented in table 5 it is apparent that the discrepancy associated with hec 18 model is most sensitive to the predicted scour depth indicated by maximum slope m 0 262 while sheppard et al 2014 model is the least sensitive m 0 055 for the five models the standard error ranges from 0 184 to 0 210 indicating the models have similar variance r2 value indicates that the melville 1997 and sheppard et al 2014 models are poorly correlated r2 0 05 and 0 01 respectively whereas the maximum correlation was noticed for wilson 1995 model r2 0 57 it is apparent from fig 6 a c and fig 7 a c that a significant number of data points congregate to form a vertical line referring to table 3 the predicted scour depth in wilson 1995 model is a function of upstream flow depth and projected pier width therefore irrespective of the other parameters aspect ratio d 50 pier face shape etc the predicted scour depth will be the same if the upstream flow depth and projected pier width are the same eventually site conditions with similar upstream flow depth and projected pier width presented some discrete congregation of data points when wilson 1995 model is used fig 6 a and fig 7 a referring to table 3 melville 1997 model depends on multiple factors refer to table 1 and remarks section of table 3 however melville 1997 suggested a limiting value for each of these factors for example if b d 50 25 then sediment size factor k d 1 similarly if all the limiting values for each of the factors are reached the corresponding normalized predicted scour depth is yielded to be 2 4 so a single vertical congregation of data points is noticed in fig 6 b and fig 7 b representing the site conditions when the limiting values are reached arneson et al 2012 model considered that if the froude number f 0 8 the maximum normalized predicted scour depth y sp b is 2 4 while for f 0 8 the value is 3 0 therefore in situations when the arneson et al 2012 model expression predicted y sp b 2 4 although f 0 8 the predicted normalized scour depth was restricted to be 2 4 a similar explanation is valid for f 0 8 while the expression suggests y sp b 3 that is why two vertical congregation of data points are perceived in fig 6 c and fig 7 c for briaud 2014 model although there are limiting values for different factors being considered in the model the final expression of y sp b is dependent upon the difference between f pier and f c p i e r which was different for different data points in case of sheppard et al 2014 model a limiting value for each of the factors being considered in the model is not imposed subsequently for briaud 2014 and sheppard et al 2014 models a vertical congregation of the data points was not apparent 4 4 bias in the selected deterministic models national research council 2000 suggested that exceedance and deceedance probabilities provide a useful way to assess the engineering performance of a given model fig 8 shows the relationship between probability of deceedance and μ p which is the ratio of the reported scour depth in benedict and caldwell 2014 to the predicted scour depth from the respective deterministic model e g wilson model melville model hec 18 model briaud model and sheppard et al model a value of μ p 1 indicates that the predicted scour depth from the deterministic model is greater than the reported scour depth in the database implying that the deterministic model is providing a conservative estimate of the scour depth in other words the probability of obtaining μ p 1 is the probability of exceedance when a specific deterministic model is used in contrast a value of μ p 1 implies an unconservative estimate from the deterministic model the probability of deceedance magnitude can be estimated by deducting the probability of exceedance refer to fig 8 probability corresponding to μ p 1 from one fig 8 a indicates that for wilson model the probability of deceedance is 0 38 which in turn indicates that if the deterministic wilson model is used in estimating scour depth in a 38 occasions the predicted scour depth will be less than the measured scour depth similarly the probability of deceedance for melville model hec 18 model briaud model and sheppard et al model are 7 17 29 and 7 respectively it indicates that the melville and sheppard et al models are the most conservative among the five models considered in the study in addition although it is established that hec 18 model provides conservative estimates briaud et al 2014 the associated probability of deceedance is still 17 the analyses suggest the necessity of devising a relationship between probability of deceedance with a modification factor which can be incorporated into the deterministic models to achieve a certain probability of exceedance deceedance 4 5 proposed modification factor kernel density estimation is a non parametric process to identify the density function from the frequency distribution firstly the distribution of μ pod which is the ratio of predicted to measured scour depth modification factor is quantified thereafter the probability density function is ascertained integration of probability density function gives the cumulative density function deduction of cumulative density function from one will provide the magnitude of the probability of deceedance pod in this case pod is defined as the probability that the predicted scour depth will be less than the measured ones the expression presented in eq 10 relates expected scour depth corresponding to a pod to the measured scour depth 10 y se b pod μ pod y smed b where y se is the expected scour depth corresponding to a certain pod and y smed is the median scour depth obtained considering ζ zero in eq 6 fig 9 shows the relationship between the pod of the measured scour depth and μ pod it seems that as the expected pod decreases the corresponding modification factor increases the rate of increase of the modification factor increases when the pod is less than 0 2 fig 9 is useful in a sense that the designer can select a suitable modification factor to satisfy a desired pod with higher pod indicating a larger probability that the predicted scour will be less than the one occurring in the field 5 database dependence it is important to note that the pod chart is developed considering the laboratory clear water scour data reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 which may lead to the conclusion that the proposed factors are database dependent however the database utilized is the largest collection of pier scour data available in the united states with a complete set of parameters to allow for comparative analysis of models that require different input parameters in addition to the database specific statistics the approach for the probabilistic framework leading to the development of the easy to use factors that render the probabilistic approach readily applicable to practice is described therefore it is possible to extend a deterministic model to assess probability of deceedance and to develop associated modification factors for a different set of database using the approach discussed in the study to this end and to illustrate the effect of the developed approach on database dependence a similar analysis using the field clear water database reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 was performed a statistical outlier identification technique was used to disregard any obvious unreasonable data error in the models estimation was considered as a parameter to identify the outliers a second criterion that was applied to identify unreasonable data points was the measured scour depth being equal to the accuracy of the measurement instrument through these screening processes the number of data count was reduced to 405 from 469 these 405 data points were considered for further analyses the resulting modification factor pod charts are shown in fig 10 in general the modification factors in fig 10 based on field data are comparatively higher than the modification factors presented in fig 9 where the clear water laboratory datasets were utilized the higher modification factor to some extent can be attributed to limitations associated with field scour measurements while the laboratory measurements provides relatively accurate measurements of downscaled equilibrium scour magnitude field measurements may not represent an equilibrium scour depth even though extreme outliers were eliminated from the dataset there is a possibility that non equilibrium scour field measurements remaining in the dataset led to increase the inherent uncertainty of the model and thereby the increase in the proposed modification factor therefore it is recommended that the modification factors developed using the laboratory clear water data fig 9 be used in design 6 application of the proposed model to utilize the model suggested herein the following steps need to be considered step 1 estimate the mean approach velocity at the threshold critical condition using eq 11 13 henderson 1966 melville and sutherland 1988 and compare with upstream mean flow velocity to identify clear water or live bed condition the models presented herein are applicable to clear water case only 11 v c 5 75 u c l o g 5 53 y d 50 and 12 u c k u 0 0377 0 041 d 50 1 4 f o r 0 1 m m d 50 1 m m 13 u c k u 0 01 d 50 0 5 0 0213 d 50 f o r 1 m m d 50 100 m m where u c is the critical shear velocity in m s k u 0 3048 d 50 is the median particle size in mm y is the flow depth directly upstream of the pier and v c is the mean approach velocity at the threshold condition parameters need to be put in consistent units in eq 11 step 2 use wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model sheppard et al 2014 model eq 1 5 to predict the scour depth step 3 insert the predicted scour depth in eq 6 7 to get the median measured scour depth step 4 use eq 9 to assess the median error associated with model scatter also note the range of measured scour depth step 5 select a pod that needs to be satisfied step 6 use the appropriate pod chart of fig 9 to estimate the corresponding modification factor μ pod step 7 multiply μ pod with the median measured scour depth to get the expected scour depth for example a pier of width 2 5 ft skew angle 30 degree is subjected to a mean flow velocity 0 97 ft sec the upstream flow depth is 10 4 ft and d 50 is reported to be 0 18 mm the pier nose shape is round and has an aspect ratio of 4 from step 1 it is identified that the mean flow velocity at the threshold condition is 1 19 ft sec which is greater than the mean flow velocity thus clear water condition is assumed using hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model eq 3 the normalized scour depth is estimated to be 2 05 corresponding y sp 5 1 ft eq 6 7 reveal the median normalized measured scour depth to be 1 62 corresponding y sm 4 1 ft using eq 9 and parameters from table 4 median error is calculated to be 0 48 therefore the measured normalized scour depth may vary in the range of 1 57 2 53 two pod were selected to be 0 1 and 0 5 respectively for illustration from fig 9 the corresponding μ pod was noted to be 2 6 and 1 3 respectively the expected normalized scour depths eq 9 corresponding to a pod of 0 1 and 0 5 are 4 2 and 2 1 respectively corresponding to scour depths of 10 5 ft and 5 3 ft respectively therefore if the predicted scour depth is 10 5 ft then there is only a 10 probability that this value will be exceeded while if the predicted scour depth is 5 3 ft then there is a 50 probability that this value will be exceeded 7 summary and conclusion current practice of bridge pier scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models work herein presents statistical model that extends five deterministic approaches reported in literature to predict the expected scour depth while quantifying inherent model uncertainty in view of measurements reported in database statistical analyses extended wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model by assessing probability of deceedance associated with the predicted scour depth a modification factor that is applied into the deterministic prediction is proposed to allow for the use of the deterministic models while quantifying the probability of a computed scour depth being less than or more than a most likely value per measurements reported in database based on the results obtained herein the following conclusions are advanced 1 the scatter associated with the scour prediction using the five deterministic scour prediction models is non uniform leading to heteroscedasticity and non normal errors a probabilistic model considering the scatter in the five deterministic models is formulated to address such heteroscedasticity and non normal errors 2 analyses using the clear water measured laboratory data suggest that the discrepancy between the predicted and measured scour depth is a function of the magnitude of the scour depth several statistical models are applied based on the residual statistics a prediction discrepancy predicted scour depth function referred to as discrepancy function is proposed 3 the use of wilson model melville model hec 18 model briaud model and sheppard et al model in scour depth estimation involves a probability of deceedance of 38 7 17 29 and 7 respectively therefore melville and sheppard et al models are the most conservative among the five models the widely used hec 18 model show a 17 probability of deceedance which is less than half the value obtained by using the melville model 4 a relationship between probability of deceedance of a given measured scour depth and a modification factor that is applied into the deterministic prediction is proposed the modification factor allows for the use of the deterministic models while quantifying the probability of the computed scour depth being less than or more than a most likely value per measurements reported in the utilized database the developed probabilistic model of this study is applicable for estimating the expected scour depth for given hydraulic geotechnical and structural parameters the application of the model is simple refer to the demonstrated example problem and the

4612,local bridge scour which is defined as the loss of soil particles mass surrounding a pier foundation due to the flowing water induced shear stresses is a primary cause of bridge failure in the united states and worldwide current practice of bridge scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models work herein presents statistical models that extend five deterministic

cause of bridge collapse in the united states and worldwide melville and coleman 2000 liang et al 2015 qi et al 2016 based on the investigation of 86 bridge failures that occurred from 1961 to 1976 murillo 1987 concluded that 46 cases could be attributed to erosion of streambed caused by running water in general flood is the main source of the increased flow in the stream that induces development of scour holes surrounding a pier wardhana and hadipriono 2003 analyzed 503 failures of bridge structures that happened in the united states and concluded that 11 of the bridge failure can be attributed to design detailing construction and maintenance reasons while 85 of the bridge failure is related to externally triggered events like flood collision overload etc it was also found that the principal cause 243 cases of bridge failure is flood induced scour while the rest can be related to collision overload deterioration and miscellaneous like fire ice etc even scouring phenomena which do not lead to failure cause major operational disruption and financial losses shirole and holt 1991 briaud et al 1999 azamatullah et al 2014 the average annual cost for flood damage and scour repair of highways in the united states is estimated to be 50 million lagasse et al 1995 2012 rhodes and trent 1993 reported that the additional cost to the afflicted population can be as much as five times the repair cost lin et al 2006 reported that during the period of 1996 to 2001 68 bridge failures that occurred in the united states are related to scour hunt 2009 noted that there are 20 904 scour critical bridges in the united states and approximately 80 000 bridges that are deemed scour susceptible with climate change impacts like increase in heavy precipitation and severe flooding coupled with scour is the leading cause of bridge damage liang et al 2015 which eventually demonstrates the importance of properly estimating the scour magnitude beforehand and thoroughly incorporating in design and countermeasures the available scour prediction models commonly in use can be classified into three categories i deterministic ii probabilistic and iii observation based current practice of bridge scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models at present there are more than 20 pier scour deterministic models available in the literature some models are derived based on laboratory scale data e g arneson et al 2012 briaud 2014 while others are derived from scour measurements taken in field conditions e g wilson 1995 in addition there are models that consider both the laboratory scale data and field scale data e g melville 1997 sheppard et al 2014 ettema et al 2017 and link et al 2019 suggested that the incapability of the laboratory scale models to maintain a geometric similitude among the three length scales pier flow depth and bed sediment size results in differences in scour estimations from laboratory test based models and field observation based models the quantitative estimation of the scale effects to date is a challenge for physical model test researchers heller 2011 2017 kiraga et al 2020 although in froude modeling the concepts of self similitude and reynolds number invariance have been proposed such models do not simulate viscous forces which are necessary to simulate sediment erosion recently link et al 2019 suggested that to exclude scale effects in laboratory scale scour modeling appropriate selection of the dimensionless effective flow work and dimensionless grain diameter is necessary literature suggests that pier scour is influenced by flow depth to pier width ratio pier width to median grain size ratio pier face shape pier aspect ratio skew angle of pier flow intensity euler number or reynolds number sediment non uniformity and the temporal rate of evolution however not all the factors are of equal importance thereby not included in the different deterministic models researchers developed table 1 presents the summary of the aforementioned deterministic models in terms of the consideration of pier scour influencing factors the differences in the choice of consideration of pier scour influencing factors in the deterministic models result in a different scour magnitude prediction for a similar set of hydraulic structural and geotechnical parameters observation based approach such as the one introduced by govindasamy 2009 and govindasamy et al 2013 is based on the idea of capitalizing on the available information from observations at existing bridges thereafter based on the knowledge of maximum flow velocity the bridge has been subjected to in its history future scour depths are predicted and then compared with the allowable scour depth of the foundation to assess the criticality of the foundation however the approach requires performing hydrologic analyses if flow data are available or developing a recurrence interval flood map if flow data are not available the process although does not require site specific erosion testing an assumption of the bed material soil classification is required texas department of transportation adopted this method for the first order bridge scour assessment public agencies are leaning towards using this method to prioritize bridge repairs and countermeasure decisions deterministic scour prediction models do not account for inherent model uncertainties and errors the use of deterministic models does not yield the inherent model bias conservativeness unconservativeness for example kwak and briaud 2002 reported that for pier number 3 w of the old woodrow wilson bridge the measured scour depth ranged from 4 3ft 8 9ft 1 31 m 2 72 m using a deterministic model to estimate the scour depth termed as sricos scour rate in cohesive soils method briaud et al 1999 the maximum scour depth was reported to be 9 3ft 2 85 m kwak et al 2001 while from the scour depth estimation it is apparent that the deterministic sricos model is conservative the designer when applying the sricos model does not know the degree of biasness inherent in the system briaud 2008 reported that using hec 18 model and briaud et al 2001 model the estimated scour at the bascule pier of the new woodrow wilson bridge are 64ft 19 5 m and 38ft 11 6 m respectively without the prior knowledge of the degree of biasness of these models each model predicts different scour depths for similar set of parameters one cannot discern whether or not these prediction are conservative and the extent of conservatism in view a given model s application to a wider set of site conditions this raises the importance of developing of probabilistic models for scour assessment that account for the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties statistical error measurement error human error model error albeit a sufficient level of data is needed for such development johnson 1992 developed a relationship between probability of bridge failure and safety factors in the study bridge failure is defined as the point at which the scour depth reaches the bottom of the pier footing simultaneously admitting that the probability of failure to be different depending on the definition of failure briaud et al 2007 developed a probabilistic bridge scour model that considered the uncertainty of hydrologic conditions however no analyses were presented on the model estimates bias and error distribution bolduc et al 2008 introduced a probabilistic model based on the bias in the deterministic models hec 18 sand and briaud et al 1999 which is also referred to as hec 18 clay and scatter around the mean johnson et al 2015 examined the hydraulic and hydrologic uncertainties associated with hec 18 and fdot 2011 scour prediction models johnson et al suggested scour design factors based on target reliability index defined as the ratio of difference between design and simulated scour depth to standard deviation briaud et al 2014 developed a reliability based pier scour model focusing on the risk product of the probability of occurrence times the value of consequences associated with failure in summary probabilistic aspects to predictive models make a designer aware of the uncertainties associated the model s estimate and the extent to which estimation of scour depth is conservative work herein is focused on the applicability of five models in practice and the bias inherited in their estimate of expected scour magnitude the scope includes quantifying scatter in the predicted scour depth from wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model versus measured data relationship between probability of predicted scour depth deceedance i e predicted scour magnitude being less than measured value and modification factors applied to such prediction is proposed the modification factors are used to adjust the predicted scour magnitude from the five models such that the probability of such prediction deceeding or exceeding a measured value is known finally a step by step application of the proposed model and approach is demonstrated and discussed 2 data for analyses benedict and caldwell 2014 compiled laboratory scour measurements from 17 previous investigations consisting of data from 23 different states within the united states data reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 were classified into two categories clear water and live bed scour the analyses in this paper is focused on the data corresponding to clear water scour condition no of data points 340 benedict and caldwell 2014 in general laboratory investigations allow a controlled environment relatively accurate measurements of downscaled parameters like pier width flow depth flow velocity and scour depth compared to the field investigations studies reported in mueller and wagner 2005 sheppard et al 2011 suggest that deterministic models developed based on laboratory data can well capture the responses in the field thereby providing a means to avoid the uncertainties associated with field data the uncertainties associated with field data might include i the accuracy of measured scour depending on the tool used like ground penetrating radar soundings with fathometers survey levels etc ii maturity of scour depth the measured scour might not reflect the equilibrium scour depth iii accuracy of hydraulic properties depending on the method used to approximate like based on historical information based on one dimensional flow models despite the limitations of using field measurements their importance in comprehending unprecedented and complex field setups cannot be overlooked however owing to measurement accuracy and representative scour depth reported in relation to measured hydraulic structural and geotechnical properties clear water laboratory measurements are considered in the study the ranges of the selected variables for the clear water laboratory data including pier width velocities and median grain size are presented in table 2 the values in table 2 reflect the minimum median and maximum values for a selected variable within the database it is important to note that the data across a single row do not correspond to each other i e the minimum median and maximum values in table 2 across one row are not for a specific site these values rather indicate the minimum median and maximum values of the specified variable within the whole database 3 scour prediction models for analyses five pier scour prediction models namely wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model are utilized herein the model equations are provided in table 3 wilson 1995 model is based on field data collected from 22 bridges in mississippi during the period 1938 1994 the drainage area of the selected sites ranged from 60 8 to 5720 square miles the measured pier scour depth in the sites ranged from 0 6 to 20 4 ft melville 1997 model is based on extensive laboratory and field data collected over a period of 25 years the tests were mostly performed in the university of auckland new zealand melville and sutherland 1988 melville 1992 dongol 1994 the method uses a number of factors refer to tables 1 and 3 that influences scour the value of these factors are determined from the envelope curve fitted to the data melville 1997 sheppard et al 2011 the latest update of hec 18 model by arneson et al 2012 is the most widely used pier scour prediction model and it is recommended by the us federal highway administration fhwa for estimating equilibrium scour depth the initial hec 18 model known as richardson and davis 1995 model used a subset of the data collected by chabert and engeldinger 1956 and shen et al 1966 the subset database consisted of data from laboratory testing on sediments with median grain size d 50 ranging from 0 24 to 0 52 mm thereafter based on the studies of melville and sutherland 1988 and jain and fischer 1979 limits on the maximum scour depth based on froude number was imposed briaud 2014 model is based on data from 94 large scale laboratory flume testing as well as dimensional analysis the d 50 ranged from 0 10 to 0 60 mm the critical shear stress of the bed material varied from 0 1 to 0 8 pa sheppard et al 2014 evaluated the performance of 23 scour prediction models using 441 laboratory and 791 field test results and melded two best performing models sheppard and miller 2006 and melville 1997 to develop the sheppard et al 2014 model the melding was done in such a way that the resulting equation yields the least total error 4 statistical model 4 1 approach formulation in scour prediction models uncertainties arise from multiple sources including hydraulic geotechnical structural or predictive model errors yao 2013 hydraulic uncertainty is associated with errors in estimating flow velocity or flow depth geotechnical uncertainty is related to the soil characteristics and erodibility parameters briaud et al 2019 documented the parameters which affect the erodibility of soil and noted that erodibility is dependent on water content undrained shear strength unit weight plasticity index activity and other parameters which might not be frequently available structural uncertainty arises due to error in estimating the skew angle of the flow with respect to bridge pier or in accurately representing the geometry of the bridge pier in the analysis finally the model uncertainty involves the error generated when a given model is used to predict complex phenomena of bridge scouring the hydraulic geotechnical and structural uncertainties can be addressed through improved field characterization and measurement accuracy by accumulating more data or by performing more targeted tests on the soil bed of interest in the work presented herein we will focus on model uncertainty the model uncertainties will be quantified through analyzing the probability of scour magnitude deceedance associated with the predicted scour depth while using one of the five aforementioned deterministic models fig 1 shows the data scatter associated with scour prediction when applying wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model to the measurement database the scatter in the scour prediction is not uniform across the range of measured scour depth the non uniform scatter gives rise to a non constant variance which statistically is known as heteroscedasticity stone 1996 fig 2 shows a plot of the residuals difference between measured and predicted values obtained from best fit curve for hec 18 model in this case a linear relationship is assumed between the predicted and the measured scour depth it seems that the residual is significantly dispersed in the positive residuals region varying between 0 and 5 whereas the data lie mostly within 0 to 1 in the negative residuals region in addition if a linear relationship between predicted and the measure scour depth is adequate a quantile quantile plot should reveal a normal distribution however fig 2 shows that the relationship between standardized residual and theoretical quantile is not linear rather a significant right skewness in the data is noted in light of these observations a robust model is needed which can reduce the heteroscedasticity and non normal errors accordingly the method suggested by box and cox 1964 commonly referred to as box cox method is adopted for this purpose the main objective of applying the box cox transformation to the database is after the transformation the following is obtained i the error variance is constant homoscedasticity ii the observations are normally distributed iii a model which is linear in the independent variable can represent the expected value of the transformed response i e no interaction terms are required the probabilistic model considering the scatter in scour prediction is formulated as 6 y λ κ y sm b ζ and 7 y λ y sp b λ 1 λ where b denotes the pier width y sp and y sm indicate the predicted and the measured scour depth respectively κ and λ are constant terms depending on the deterministic model being considered and ζ is the error term describing the uncertainty of model prediction to ascertain the most likely value of λ large sample maximum likelihood theory is considered the likelihood in terms of the original observations y can be expressed as in eq 8 8 1 2 π n 2 σ n e x p y λ e y λ y λ e y λ 2 σ 2 i 1 n d y i λ d y i where n is the total number of observations y λ is the column vector of transformed observations e y λ is the expected value of y λ y λ e y λ is the transpose of the vector y λ e y λ and σ 2 is the variance of data more details of the associated steps can be found in box and cox 1964 the estimated parameter λ differ for each of the five models considered herein as presented in fig 3 4 2 interpretation of calculated parameters the calculated parameters for wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model are presented in table 4 the r2 of the fitted models vary from 0 16 for wilson 1995 model to 0 56 for sheppard et al 2014 model magnitude of standard error suggest that melville 1997 model has the maximum variance whereas briaud 2014 model has the minimum variance the 95 confidence limit of the parameter λ can be estimated from fig 3 gardoni et al 2002 bolduc et al 2008 considered logarithmic transformation of the data while fitting models to the gudavalli database gudavalli 1997 landers mueller database landers and mueller 1996 and kwak database kwak 2000 to remove heteroscedasticity gudavalli database consisted of 43 laboratory flume experiments landers mueller database is populated with 305 bridge pier scour measurements from 56 bridges in the united states and kwak database entails bridge pier scour measurements from 10 bridge piers from 8 bridges in the state of texas if the parameter λ is calculated to be 0 then the box cox transformation converts to logarithmic transformation referring to fig 3 and table 4 the parameter λ is not 0 in any of the five models indicating that the logarithmic transformation is not the best fit for the five models based on using the clear water laboratory database reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 fig 4 shows the residual diagnostic plots for the five models the fitted models seem to satisfy the homoscedasticity assumption as indicated by equal dispersion of residuals on either side of the axis although wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model and sheppard et al 2014 model comprehensively satisfies the normality assumption linear relationship between standardized residuals and theoretical quantiles briaud 2014 model seems to have a right skewness to the fitted data to check the possibility of other transformation functions logarithmic transformation inverse transformation square root transformation and inverse square root transformation were performed however in all these cases the right skewness seem to increase resulting in a clear non normal error diagnostic plots are checked nevertheless considering the r2 f statistic and standard residual error box cox transformation provided the best fit model for briaud 2014 model fig 5 shows the fitted model to the clear water laboratory datasets it is important to note that the model equations were not forced to satisfy the condition that the predicted scour depth should be zero if the measured scour depth is zero doing so the heteroscedasticity problem and non normal error arises 4 3 quantification of model error from the clear water laboratory data it is observed that the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured scour depth increases as the magnitude of the scour depth increases this can be owing to the fact that the deterministic models are devised to achieve a conservative estimate of the scour depth for example from extensive laboratory investigation melville and sutherland 1988 reported that the ratio of scour depth to pier width y s b rarely exceeds 2 3 however based on these test results the upper bound of y s b for hec 18 model was set to be 2 4 for f 0 8 which is higher than 2 3 therefore in general when the predicted scour depth from a deterministic model is high actually the measured scour depth in the field is low resulting in a higher discrepancy statistically the described hypothesis is not concrete because the scatter in the predicted versus the measured normalized scour depth plot figs 1 and 5 is significant however some statistical measures need to be taken to quantify the dependence of the discrepancy between the predicted and the measured scour depth on the magnitude of the predicted scour depth diagnostic plots of the prediction discrepancy predicted scour depth presents non normal errors several transformation functions logarithmic transformation exponential transformation inverse transformation square root transformation inverse square root transformation cubic transformation inverse cubic transformation were applied and based on associated residual statistics eq 9 can be suggested 9 ζ y sp b y sm b 1 3 m y sp b ϑ ε where m and ϑ are constants ε is the random error of the model fig 6 shows the residual diagnostics for the model of eq 9 it seems that the model in eq 9 satisfies the homoscedasticity assumption and normality assumption the residuals versus leverage plot suggests that there are no outliers or influential data points fig 7 shows the relationship between ζ and predicted scour depths for the five models considered herein in addition to the model best fit regression line 95 confidence limits and 95 prediction limits are also presented it seems that the discrepancy function ζ increases as the magnitude of the predicted normalized scour depth increases the calculated model parameters for wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model are presented in table 5 it is apparent that the discrepancy associated with hec 18 model is most sensitive to the predicted scour depth indicated by maximum slope m 0 262 while sheppard et al 2014 model is the least sensitive m 0 055 for the five models the standard error ranges from 0 184 to 0 210 indicating the models have similar variance r2 value indicates that the melville 1997 and sheppard et al 2014 models are poorly correlated r2 0 05 and 0 01 respectively whereas the maximum correlation was noticed for wilson 1995 model r2 0 57 it is apparent from fig 6 a c and fig 7 a c that a significant number of data points congregate to form a vertical line referring to table 3 the predicted scour depth in wilson 1995 model is a function of upstream flow depth and projected pier width therefore irrespective of the other parameters aspect ratio d 50 pier face shape etc the predicted scour depth will be the same if the upstream flow depth and projected pier width are the same eventually site conditions with similar upstream flow depth and projected pier width presented some discrete congregation of data points when wilson 1995 model is used fig 6 a and fig 7 a referring to table 3 melville 1997 model depends on multiple factors refer to table 1 and remarks section of table 3 however melville 1997 suggested a limiting value for each of these factors for example if b d 50 25 then sediment size factor k d 1 similarly if all the limiting values for each of the factors are reached the corresponding normalized predicted scour depth is yielded to be 2 4 so a single vertical congregation of data points is noticed in fig 6 b and fig 7 b representing the site conditions when the limiting values are reached arneson et al 2012 model considered that if the froude number f 0 8 the maximum normalized predicted scour depth y sp b is 2 4 while for f 0 8 the value is 3 0 therefore in situations when the arneson et al 2012 model expression predicted y sp b 2 4 although f 0 8 the predicted normalized scour depth was restricted to be 2 4 a similar explanation is valid for f 0 8 while the expression suggests y sp b 3 that is why two vertical congregation of data points are perceived in fig 6 c and fig 7 c for briaud 2014 model although there are limiting values for different factors being considered in the model the final expression of y sp b is dependent upon the difference between f pier and f c p i e r which was different for different data points in case of sheppard et al 2014 model a limiting value for each of the factors being considered in the model is not imposed subsequently for briaud 2014 and sheppard et al 2014 models a vertical congregation of the data points was not apparent 4 4 bias in the selected deterministic models national research council 2000 suggested that exceedance and deceedance probabilities provide a useful way to assess the engineering performance of a given model fig 8 shows the relationship between probability of deceedance and μ p which is the ratio of the reported scour depth in benedict and caldwell 2014 to the predicted scour depth from the respective deterministic model e g wilson model melville model hec 18 model briaud model and sheppard et al model a value of μ p 1 indicates that the predicted scour depth from the deterministic model is greater than the reported scour depth in the database implying that the deterministic model is providing a conservative estimate of the scour depth in other words the probability of obtaining μ p 1 is the probability of exceedance when a specific deterministic model is used in contrast a value of μ p 1 implies an unconservative estimate from the deterministic model the probability of deceedance magnitude can be estimated by deducting the probability of exceedance refer to fig 8 probability corresponding to μ p 1 from one fig 8 a indicates that for wilson model the probability of deceedance is 0 38 which in turn indicates that if the deterministic wilson model is used in estimating scour depth in a 38 occasions the predicted scour depth will be less than the measured scour depth similarly the probability of deceedance for melville model hec 18 model briaud model and sheppard et al model are 7 17 29 and 7 respectively it indicates that the melville and sheppard et al models are the most conservative among the five models considered in the study in addition although it is established that hec 18 model provides conservative estimates briaud et al 2014 the associated probability of deceedance is still 17 the analyses suggest the necessity of devising a relationship between probability of deceedance with a modification factor which can be incorporated into the deterministic models to achieve a certain probability of exceedance deceedance 4 5 proposed modification factor kernel density estimation is a non parametric process to identify the density function from the frequency distribution firstly the distribution of μ pod which is the ratio of predicted to measured scour depth modification factor is quantified thereafter the probability density function is ascertained integration of probability density function gives the cumulative density function deduction of cumulative density function from one will provide the magnitude of the probability of deceedance pod in this case pod is defined as the probability that the predicted scour depth will be less than the measured ones the expression presented in eq 10 relates expected scour depth corresponding to a pod to the measured scour depth 10 y se b pod μ pod y smed b where y se is the expected scour depth corresponding to a certain pod and y smed is the median scour depth obtained considering ζ zero in eq 6 fig 9 shows the relationship between the pod of the measured scour depth and μ pod it seems that as the expected pod decreases the corresponding modification factor increases the rate of increase of the modification factor increases when the pod is less than 0 2 fig 9 is useful in a sense that the designer can select a suitable modification factor to satisfy a desired pod with higher pod indicating a larger probability that the predicted scour will be less than the one occurring in the field 5 database dependence it is important to note that the pod chart is developed considering the laboratory clear water scour data reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 which may lead to the conclusion that the proposed factors are database dependent however the database utilized is the largest collection of pier scour data available in the united states with a complete set of parameters to allow for comparative analysis of models that require different input parameters in addition to the database specific statistics the approach for the probabilistic framework leading to the development of the easy to use factors that render the probabilistic approach readily applicable to practice is described therefore it is possible to extend a deterministic model to assess probability of deceedance and to develop associated modification factors for a different set of database using the approach discussed in the study to this end and to illustrate the effect of the developed approach on database dependence a similar analysis using the field clear water database reported in benedict and caldwell 2014 was performed a statistical outlier identification technique was used to disregard any obvious unreasonable data error in the models estimation was considered as a parameter to identify the outliers a second criterion that was applied to identify unreasonable data points was the measured scour depth being equal to the accuracy of the measurement instrument through these screening processes the number of data count was reduced to 405 from 469 these 405 data points were considered for further analyses the resulting modification factor pod charts are shown in fig 10 in general the modification factors in fig 10 based on field data are comparatively higher than the modification factors presented in fig 9 where the clear water laboratory datasets were utilized the higher modification factor to some extent can be attributed to limitations associated with field scour measurements while the laboratory measurements provides relatively accurate measurements of downscaled equilibrium scour magnitude field measurements may not represent an equilibrium scour depth even though extreme outliers were eliminated from the dataset there is a possibility that non equilibrium scour field measurements remaining in the dataset led to increase the inherent uncertainty of the model and thereby the increase in the proposed modification factor therefore it is recommended that the modification factors developed using the laboratory clear water data fig 9 be used in design 6 application of the proposed model to utilize the model suggested herein the following steps need to be considered step 1 estimate the mean approach velocity at the threshold critical condition using eq 11 13 henderson 1966 melville and sutherland 1988 and compare with upstream mean flow velocity to identify clear water or live bed condition the models presented herein are applicable to clear water case only 11 v c 5 75 u c l o g 5 53 y d 50 and 12 u c k u 0 0377 0 041 d 50 1 4 f o r 0 1 m m d 50 1 m m 13 u c k u 0 01 d 50 0 5 0 0213 d 50 f o r 1 m m d 50 100 m m where u c is the critical shear velocity in m s k u 0 3048 d 50 is the median particle size in mm y is the flow depth directly upstream of the pier and v c is the mean approach velocity at the threshold condition parameters need to be put in consistent units in eq 11 step 2 use wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model sheppard et al 2014 model eq 1 5 to predict the scour depth step 3 insert the predicted scour depth in eq 6 7 to get the median measured scour depth step 4 use eq 9 to assess the median error associated with model scatter also note the range of measured scour depth step 5 select a pod that needs to be satisfied step 6 use the appropriate pod chart of fig 9 to estimate the corresponding modification factor μ pod step 7 multiply μ pod with the median measured scour depth to get the expected scour depth for example a pier of width 2 5 ft skew angle 30 degree is subjected to a mean flow velocity 0 97 ft sec the upstream flow depth is 10 4 ft and d 50 is reported to be 0 18 mm the pier nose shape is round and has an aspect ratio of 4 from step 1 it is identified that the mean flow velocity at the threshold condition is 1 19 ft sec which is greater than the mean flow velocity thus clear water condition is assumed using hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model eq 3 the normalized scour depth is estimated to be 2 05 corresponding y sp 5 1 ft eq 6 7 reveal the median normalized measured scour depth to be 1 62 corresponding y sm 4 1 ft using eq 9 and parameters from table 4 median error is calculated to be 0 48 therefore the measured normalized scour depth may vary in the range of 1 57 2 53 two pod were selected to be 0 1 and 0 5 respectively for illustration from fig 9 the corresponding μ pod was noted to be 2 6 and 1 3 respectively the expected normalized scour depths eq 9 corresponding to a pod of 0 1 and 0 5 are 4 2 and 2 1 respectively corresponding to scour depths of 10 5 ft and 5 3 ft respectively therefore if the predicted scour depth is 10 5 ft then there is only a 10 probability that this value will be exceeded while if the predicted scour depth is 5 3 ft then there is a 50 probability that this value will be exceeded 7 summary and conclusion current practice of bridge pier scour prediction is mostly based on the use of deterministic models work herein presents statistical model that extends five deterministic approaches reported in literature to predict the expected scour depth while quantifying inherent model uncertainty in view of measurements reported in database statistical analyses extended wilson 1995 model melville 1997 model hec 18 arneson et al 2012 model briaud 2014 model and sheppard et al 2014 model by assessing probability of deceedance associated with the predicted scour depth a modification factor that is applied into the deterministic prediction is proposed to allow for the use of the deterministic models while quantifying the probability of a computed scour depth being less than or more than a most likely value per measurements reported in database based on the results obtained herein the following conclusions are advanced 1 the scatter associated with the scour prediction using the five deterministic scour prediction models is non uniform leading to heteroscedasticity and non normal errors a probabilistic model considering the scatter in the five deterministic models is formulated to address such heteroscedasticity and non normal errors 2 analyses using the clear water measured laboratory data suggest that the discrepancy between the predicted and measured scour depth is a function of the magnitude of the scour depth several statistical models are applied based on the residual statistics a prediction discrepancy predicted scour depth function referred to as discrepancy function is proposed 3 the use of wilson model melville model hec 18 model briaud model and sheppard et al model in scour depth estimation involves a probability of deceedance of 38 7 17 29 and 7 respectively therefore melville and sheppard et al models are the most conservative among the five models the widely used hec 18 model show a 17 probability of deceedance which is less than half the value obtained by using the melville model 4 a relationship between probability of deceedance of a given measured scour depth and a modification factor that is applied into the deterministic prediction is proposed the modification factor allows for the use of the deterministic models while quantifying

4613,the accuracy of hydrological model predictions is limited by uncertainties in model structure and parameterization and observations used for calibration validation and model forcing while calibration is usually performed with discharge estimates the internal model processes might be misrepresented and the model might be getting the right results for the wrong reasons thus compromising model reliability an alternative is to calibrate model parameters with remote sensing rs observations of the water cycle previous studies highlighted the potential of rs based calibration to improve discharge estimates focusing less on other variables of the water cycle in this study we analyzed in detail the contribution of five rs based variables water level h flood extent a terrestrial water storage tws evapotranspiration et and soil moisture w to calibrate a coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model for a large amazon sub basin with extensive floodplains single variable calibration experiments with all variables were able to improve discharge kge from around 6 1 to 52 9 when compared to a priori parameter sets water cycle representation was improved with multi variable calibration kge for all variables were improved in the evaluation period by analyzing different calibration setups a consistent selection of complementary variables for model calibration resulted in a better performance than incorporating all rs variables into the calibration by looking at multiple rs observations of the water cycle inconsistencies in model structure and parameterization were found which would remain unknown if only discharge observations were considered keywords hydrological modeling multi variable calibration amazon hydrodynamic modeling large basins 1 introduction the accurate representation of hydrologic processes in mathematical models remains a key challenge in water resources research and applications baroni et al 2019 clark et al 2015 kirchner 2006 nearing et al 2016 semenova beven 2015 due to uncertainties in model structure wagener et al 2003 parameterization gharari et al 2014 shafii and tolson 2015 and observations di baldassarre and montanari 2009 these uncertainties might lead to inaccurate predictions of hydrological variables for water resources and natural hazards management grimaldi et al 2019 montanari koutsoyiannis 2014 and for quantification of impacts of climate change and anthropogenic effects on the water cycle haddeland et al 2006 teutschbein seibert 2012 xu et al 2005 this problem has led for instance to initiatives to better constrain the terrestrial water budget by fusing models and earth observation datasets pan wood 2006 pellet et al 2019 traditionally hydrological models are calibrated against gauged streamflow data which might hamper predictions in ungauged sites since they do not guarantee an accurate representation of other water cycle components e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration thus leading to uncertainty in hydrologic predictions hrachowitz et al 2013 moreover for a given model many parameter sets can provide equally acceptable performances for streamflow evaluation i e the equifinality thesis but they might be right for the wrong reasons beven 2006 kirchner 2006 several solutions have been proposed to improve process representation and reduce uncertainty in model predictions such as the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation beven binley 1992 dynamic identifiability analysis wagener et al 2003 multiscale parameter regionalization samaniego et al 2010 and multi objective calibration yapo et al 1998 however these are ongoing developments and stand out as one of the twenty three unsolved problems in hydrology blöschl et al 2019 how can we disentangle and reduce model structural parameter input uncertainty in hydrological prediction in addition to the presented solutions an alternative is the use of complementary datasets besides streamflow observations for model calibration e g crow et al 2003 franks et al 1998 lo et al 2010 lópez et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 data assimilation e g brêda et al 2019 houser et al 1998 mitchell et al 2004 paiva et al 2013 pathiraja et al 2016 reichle et al 2002 vrugt et al 2005 or validation e g alkama et al 2010 motovilov et al 1999 neal et al 2012 siqueira et al 2018 such approaches are promising to improve

ungauged or poorly gauged sites sivapalan et al 2003 however distributed data of complementary hydrological variables e g evapotranspiration soil moisture are scarce and in situ measurements present poor spatial and temporal representativeness in this context remote sensing rs observations have stood out in the last decade because of their increasing spatial and temporal resolution free availability in many cases and capability to record less monitored hydrological variables such as soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage lakshmi 2004 lettenmaier et al 2015 for instance grace mission provided monthly estimates of changes in water storage on a global coverage with an accuracy of 2 cm when uniformly estimated over land and oceans in regions with larger amplitudes e g amazon basin water storage anomalies estimates from grace are even more accurate tapley et al 2004 missions such as smos smap amsr e and ascat were estimated to provide soil moisture data with a median rmsd root mean square deviation of 0 06 0 10 m3 m3 for the conus karthikeyan et al 2017 altimeters such as envisat jason 2 and icesat 1 and icesat 2 can yield water level data with an accuracy ranging from 0 04 m to 0 42 m involving trade offs between temporal resolution from 10 to 91 days and cross track separation from 15 to 315 km jarihani et al 2013 while the future swot mission will provide at least one water level measurement every 21 days for global rivers wider than 100 m biancamaria et al 2016 many studies have used multiple remote sensing products in combination to better understand the water cycle aires 2014 billah 2015 lakshmi et al 2018 although previous studies have analyzed the value of integrating rs data into hydrological modeling through calibration or data assimilation see review by xu et al 2014 jiang wang 2019 this topic has not been fully explored to its potential yet therefore in section 1 1 we present major knowledge gaps in the context of rs based calibration of hydrological models through an extensive literature review in section 1 2 we describe the aims and contributions of this study 1 1 literature review on calibration of hydrological models with rs data a comprehensive yet non exhaustive literature review of studies that used rs datasets for parameter estimation in hydrological models is presented in this section and summarized in fig 1 a total of 64 research articles was found see supplementary material table s1 for details on the review methodology most publications involved large study areas 1000 km2 which is expected because of the usual coarse resolution of rs products fig 1a most studies used rs derived evapotranspiration for model calibration followed by soil moisture fig 1b but there were also attempts for calibration of up to eight different rs derived variables nijzink et al 2018 this indicates a still existent knowledge gap regarding which rs derived variables are more useful for model calibration indeed many recent studies have investigated the added value of rs derived information to calibrate hydrological models fig 1c table s1 most of the studies aprox 70 used only one rs product for model calibration fig 1d in black while twelve studies used two products and five used three products only few studies used more than three rs products for model calibration demirel et al 2019 nijzink et al 2018 some studies addressed the use of rs data to estimate discharge in ungauged basins kittel et al 2018 sun et al 2010 while others focused on narrowing the parameter search space and thus equifinality reduction by combining multiple variables for calibration e g nijzink et al 2018 pan et al 2018 this is confirmed by fig 1d in blue which demonstrates that the vast majority of researches used two variables for calibration in general discharge and a rs derived variable within these studies some analyzed model performance in terms of discharge only while others considered different variables fig 1d in red providing a more comprehensive discussion on inconsistencies of hydrological models e g koch et al 2018 li et al 2018 regarding how rs is incorporated into the model calibration procedure fig 1f 65 2 of the articles used rs based spatially distributed information thus calibrating the model with distributed objective functions e g pixel by pixel or by sub basin within these studies bias insensitive objective functions have been recently introduced e g koch et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020 demirel 2018 zink et al 2018 huang et al 2020 being important for reducing the impact of rs data uncertainty on the parameter estimation procedure the remaining publications 34 8 incorporated rs data as an average for the whole basin finally there is still a need for more studies in tropical regions especially south america fig 1g which have particular hydro climatic characteristics and so have different requirements than temperate regions on model process representation e g snow related processes might not be so relevant in some tropical areas whereas an accurate representation of floodplains might be in the case of basin with complex river floodplain interactions as in the amazon an accurate flood wave routing method is required to correctly depict the water transport along the drainage network our analysis shows that most studies used simple flood wave routing schemes such as kinematic wave or muskingum fig 1h only 10 1 attempted to couple hydrologic and river hydrodynamic models highlighting the necessity of better understanding the applicability of rs based calibration in basins with major flat regions with wetlands hodges 2013 neal et al 2012 pontes et al 2017 1 2 aims and contributions of this paper our study addresses major knowledge gaps identified in the previous literature review in the context of rs based calibration of hydrological models firstly most of the studies analyzed two or less variables fig 1e here we used a large number of rs observed variables for model calibration namely soil moisture evapotranspiration terrestrial water storage flood extent and river water levels and thus move beyond the contributions of rs for improving only discharge estimates by simultaneously looking at different variables we also move towards an improved representation of the water cycle as a whole enhancing our ability to identify model limitations and inconsistencies furthermore most studies to date focused on european temperate watersheds fig 1c which largely differ from tropical basins in terms of hydroclimatic characteristics and river wetland interactions in this context large scale coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic models have major developments in recent years paiva et al 2013 fleischmann 2020 rajib et al 2020 yamazaki et al 2011 but to our knowledge the complementarity of hydrologic soil moisture evapotranspiration terrestrial water storage and hydrodynamic flood extent and river water level rs observations for model calibration has not yet been addressed in the literature here we present a study case in a tropical basin with extensive floodplains in the amazon with a state of the art coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model which together with the previously mentioned advances provides important contributions to the growing literatures of rs based calibration of hydrological models this study aims to investigate the applicability of multiple rs observations in an accessible approach to model and represent the water cycle accurately in tropical areas 2 methods 2 1 experimental design a hydrologic hydrodynamic model mgb collischonn et al 2007 is set up for a case study in the amazon purus river basin with a priori parameter sets based on their variability as reported in literature references in table s2 the study is then divided into two steps firstly a sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how different parameter sets river hydraulic soil vegetation affect model output variables river discharge flood extent river water level soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage then a calibration step is performed in which the model is calibrated with the well known multi objective global optimization for hydrologic models mocom ua algorithm yapo et al 1998 considering six variables 1 in situ streamflow one gauge at the basin outlet and rs freely available state of the art observations of 2 water level one satellite altimetry virtual station 3 flood extent sum of flooded areas over the lower purus river basin 4 terrestrial water storage tws 5 evapotranspiration and 6 soil moisture variables 4 5 and 6 are averaged over the whole basin the calibration of each variable is performed individually single variable and evaluated for all variables all calibration experiments are repeated three times with different initial parameter sets to ensure that convergence is not dependent on the initial parameter sets given limitations on the availability of simultaneous rs temporal coverage the model is calibrated for one time period 2009 2012 and evaluated for i the same time period of calibration and ii for a different period 2006 2008 for discharge flood extent tws et and 2013 2014 for water level and soil moisture the time periods are different due to limitations in remote sensing data availability to understand how lumped calibration can retrieve the remotely sensed spatial patterns a qualitative evaluation is provided additionally a final test is performed in which two multi variable calibration experiments are conducted i calibration with all analyzed variables except discharge and ii calibration with two complementary variables water level and soil moisture which are selected for simultaneous calibration for being complementary and having led to satisfactory calibration performance 2 2 study area purus river basin the purus river basin fig 2 in amazon has a drainage area of approximately 236 000 km2 and river discharge ranges from around 1 000 june december to 12 000 m3 s january july at canutama gauge because of its large area it is compatible with the spatial resolution of rs products e g a pixel of grace presents spatial resolution of roughly 300 400 km besides purus river basin has minor anthropogenic influences ríos villamizar et al 2017 also evidenced by the mostly forested last use depicted in fig 2b which simplifies the modeling process the climate is equatorial fig 2d and mean annual rainfall is 2147 mm year according to in situ gauges purus basin was selected because of its representativeness of tropical regions as the amazon basin which is the largest river in the world holeman 1968 and it is characterized by extensive floodplains junk 1997 for instance on the lower purus the floodplain width is in the order of 30 km which corresponds to approximately 30 times the main channel width paiva et al 2011 these floodplains allow a satisfactory flood extent monitoring by rs image classification which contributes to the suitability of purus river basin for this study 2 3 hydrologic hydrodynamic model mgb the mgb modelo de grandes bacias a portuguese acronym for large basin model is a semi distributed hydrologic hydrodynamic model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 it was chosen for this study because 1 it has been widely and successfully applied in several south american basins e g paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 2 it is representative and similar to other conceptual hydrological models like vic liang et al 1994 and swat and 3 the hydrological component is tightly coupled to a hydrodynamic routing scheme allowing the simulation of complex flat tropical basins moreover the source code of mgb is freely available at www ufrgs br lsh the stream network is derived from digital elevation model dem processing the model has 19 parameters which are further detailed in the next section other model inputs are precipitation climate data soil type and land use maps which are further described in section 2 6 model setup within the model structure basins are discretized into unit catchments which are further divided into hydrological response units hru s based on soil type and land use model parameters are specific for each of the hrus a vertical water balance is performed for each hru considering canopy interception soil infiltration evapotranspiration and generation of surface subsurface and groundwater flows soil is represented as a bucket model with a single layer flow generated in each hru is routed to the outlet of the unit catchment with linear reservoirs outflow from each unit catchment is then propagated through the stream network by using a 1d hydrodynamic model based on the inertial approximation proposed by bates et al 2010 a schematic representation of the model structure is presented in supplementary material fig s1 2 4 a priori uncertainty of model parameters within mgb model there are parameters related to river hydraulics manning s roughness and width and depth parameters related to geomorphological relationships conceptual parameters related to soil water budget wm b kbas kint xl cap wc ci cs cb and vegetation cover albedo leaf area index vegetation height and penman monteith surface resistance which are further detailed in supplementary material table s2 out of the 19 model parameters six are fixed and 13 are calibrated the a priori uncertainty of mgb model parameters is estimated based on their variability as reported in literature references in table s2 supplementary material table s2 presents the calibration parameters their initial values range and the references that support these assumptions 2 5 sensitivity analysis in order to understand how different parameter sets river hydraulic soil vegetation affect model output variables river discharge flood extent river water level soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage multiple model runs were conducted considering four uncalibrated model setups 1 varying only soil parameters 2 varying only vegetation parameters 3 varying only hydraulic parameters 4 varying all parameters together one hundred runs were conducted in triplicate to ensure that convergence is not dependent on the randomly selected initial parameter sets thus resulting in 300 runs for each setup in this step no rs based calibration is performed yet parameters were varied considering a uniform distribution and results were analyzed in terms of mean rmsd root mean square deviation of each variable by comparing each run with a reference one i e the initial run with the initial parameter set as defined in supplementary material table s2 this was performed in order to understand the sources of model uncertainties related to different sets of parameters e g are flood extent estimates sensitive to vegetation parameters or are et estimates sensitive to hydraulic parameters the dispersion of model outputs was also compared to uncertainty in the observations as derived from literature to understand which variables are inter related in the model we further analyzed the results of setup 4 varying all parameters together this was done by firstly computing the kling gupta efficiency metric kge gupta et al 2009 between the perturbed runs and a reference one i e run with the initial parameter set for each variable and then calculating the pearson correlation r between kge values for each pair of variables e g discharge and water level discharge and flood extent and so forth this experiment is relevant to evaluate whether two variables get improved or get worsened together or whether a variable improvement impacts on the deterioration of another in other words this approach allows to evaluate the correlation between the variables in general the results from the sensitivity analysis are used to better understand the model overall behavior and interpret our results from the calibration experiments we aim to first understand how the different rs datasets can affect model predictions how uncertain are rs data in relation to the model predictions and how sensitive is the model to different parameters then we perform multiple calibration experiments and finally we can evaluate whether the results from calibration are right for the right reasons i e if they are consistent with our findings from the sensitivity analysis 2 6 model setup the bare earth digital elevation model dem o loughlin et al 2016 fig 2c was used for stream network computation and basin discretization with the iph hydrotools gis package siqueira et al 2016 the original dem resolution is 90 m and it was resampled to 500 m to facilitate gis processing an upstream area threshold of 100 km2 was adopted to delineate the drainage network and unit catchments were discretized by dividing the stream network into fixed reach length of 10 km resulting in 2957 unit catchments for the whole basin daily precipitation data were derived from tmpa 3b42 version 7 for the period 01 01 2005 31 12 2014 with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 available at https gpm nasa gov

mean surface air temperature relative humidity insolation wind speed and atmospheric pressure were obtained from the climatic research unit database new et al 2000 available at http www cru uea ac uk data at a spatial resolution of 10 and also interpolated with the nearest neighbor method soil type and land cover maps were extracted from the hru discretization developed by fan et al 2015 fig 2b 1

water storage capacity and shallow soils are those with low water storage capacity in the purus river basin 57 4 of the region is covered by forest with deep soils 26 9 by forest with shallow soils and 13 7 by wetlands i e river floodplains 2 7 model calibration the mocom ua calibration algorithm yapo et al 1998 multi objective global optimization for hydrologic models was adopted due to its satisfactory performance when coupled with hydrological models e g collischonn et al 2008 maurer et al 2009 naz et al 2014 mocom ua is an evolutionary algorithm based on sce ua duan et al 1992 shuffled complex evolution that simultaneously optimizes a model population with respect to different objective functions the algorithm converges towards the pareto optimum when all points in the population become non dominated and thus all solutions in the pareto front are equally good in regards to the objective functions considered the model population consists of randomly distributed points within the parameter search space and it reflects the a priori uncertainty of model parameters here the population size was set to 100 individuals the altered model parameters and their respective ranges are described in supplementary material table s2 all calibration experiments are repeated three times totaling 300 initial runs with differing initial parameter sets to ensure that convergence is not dependent on the initial parameter sets initial parameters are set as the mean of their literature based range table s2 objective functions to be optimized depend on the calibration setup in the single variable calibration for each variable three objective functions of that summarize the agreement between simulated and observed rs time series are simultaneously optimized pearson correlation r ratio of averages μ sim μ obs and ratio of standard deviations σ sim σ obs which are associated to the individual terms of kge metric gupta et al 2009 these 3 objective functions are

improvement deterioration for a given calibration setup in comparison with the calibration with the variable itself 2 8 calibration evaluation data in the next paragraphs we introduce the data used for model calibration and evaluation as well as how mgb outputs were evaluated in comparison to them in situ discharge measurements were obtained from the brazilian water agency hidroweb database

uncertainty in discharge observations can be estimated as ranging from 6 2 to 42 8 at the 95 confidence level with an average of 25 6 di baldassarre and montanari 2009 discharge was evaluated on a daily basis remotely sensed water level data were obtained from jason 2 mission which presents an orbit cycle of approximately 10 days and tracks separated by approximately 300 km at the equator lambin et al 2010 it presents an accuracy of approximately 0 28 m jarihani et al 2013 and data are available since 2008 the virtual station presented in fig 2a corresponds to track number 165 and it is located around 1050 km upstream from the discharge gauging station processed data for this study were downloaded from the hydroweb theia database available at http hydroweb theia land fr the simulated water level was computed in mgb at the unit catchment associated to the altimetry virtual station being an advantage of using the hydrodynamic scheme for flood routing instead of the muskingum simplification simulated and rs water level data were compared every 10 days in terms of anomaly values subtracted from long term average satellite flood extent data were derived from alos palsar imagery which presents a ground resolution of 100 m rosenqvist et al 2007 images were downloaded from alaska satellite facility available at https www asf alaska edu in processing level 1 5 which already presents geometric and radiometric corrections a 3 3 median filter was used to remove speckle noise lee et al 2014 images were classified into water backscattering coefficient less than 14 db non flooded forest between 14 db and 6 5 db and flooded forest higher than 6 5 db classes according to hess et al 2003 and lee et al 2014 the uncertainty of flood extent estimates was estimated as 49 8 based on the rmsd root mean square deviation between the resulting classification of this study and the dual season mapping developed by hess et al 2003 simulated and rs flood extent data were compared for the pink area depicted in fig 2a in order to avoid spurious flood extent data in regions that are known to be not subject to flooding alos palsar presents a recurrence cycle of 46 days from 2006 to 2011 and flood extent data were available and compared to mgb for 21 dates satellite based terrestrial water storage tws anomalies were extracted from grace mission launched in march 2002 grace provides monthly tws estimates based on anomalies in gravitational potential at a resolution of 300 400 km with a uniform accuracy of 2 cm over the land and ocean regions tapley et al 2004 tws anomalies were retrieved from three processing centers gfz geoforschungs zentrum potsdam germany csr center for space research at university of texas use and jpl jet propulsion laboratory usa available at https grace jpl nasa gov and then the mean value based on the three products was averaged for the whole basin in mgb tws values were computed as the sum of water storage of all hydrological compartments river floodplains soil groundwater and vegetation canopy paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 simulated and rs based tws were compared in terms of anomaly values subtracted from long term average at a monthly time scale satellite based evapotranspiration estimates were retrieved from the mod16 product derived by an algorithm presented by mu et al 2011 based on the penman monteith equation the dataset covers the period 2000 2010 with a spatial resolution of 1 km for global vegetated land areas because of that even though mgb evapotranspiration is calculated for flooded areas open water evaporation in main channel and floodplains and vegetation for water balance purposes only the vegetation et output was compared to mod16 mod16 products are provided in 8 days monthly and annual intervals monthly intervals were used here and averaged for the whole basin the accuracy of mod16 along the amazon basin is estimated as 0 76 mm day gomis cebolla et al 2019 mod16 data is available at https www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php in mgb evapotranspiration is computed via penman monteith equation shuttleworth 1993 based on the climate input variables satellite based soil moisture is derived from the smos mission kerr et al 2001 processed by the centre aval de traitement des données smos catds and downloaded in processing level 4 which combines lower level products with data from other sensors and modeling data assimilation techniques the daily l4 root zone soil moisture product at 0 1 m soil depth al bitar et al 2013 were used available at https www catds fr products available products from cec sm l4 land research products and data from ascending and descending orbits were averaged for the whole basin the dataset covers the period 2010 today in mgb soil moisture as a saturation degree was computed as the water in the soil compartment divided by the maximum water capacity of the soil wm parameter since mgb estimates saturation degree values for a soil bucket reservoir smos values were rescaled for the range 0 100 according to the min max correction method described by tarpanelli et al 2013 and applied by some studies e g rajib et al 2016 silvestro et al 2015 thus they are compared to the results of mgb s on a daily time scale as an average for the whole basin 3 results and discussion results are structured as follows firstly the sensitivity analysis is presented with discussions on model uncertainties section 3 1 then results for model calibration are presented with discussions on how rs based model calibration can improve discharge and the water cycle representation as a whole section 3 2 3 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was carried out to understand how different parameter types river hydraulic soil vegetation and all together affect the variation of different hydrological processes in mgb fig 3 a this was performed by analyzing the dispersion of six output variables discharge water level flood extent tws anomalies vegetation et and soil moisture these results are also compared with an estimate of the uncertainties of observations values provided in section 2 8 calibration evaluation data and are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 1 1 how do varying model outputs relate to uncertainty in the observations some variables present in situ rs observations that have uncertainties significantly lower than the overall dispersion of the model e g 25 6 for discharge observations while model overall parameter dispersion is 160 this pattern is also found for water level and tws estimates and implies that these observations might be useful to constrain the model nonetheless uncertainties in rs products of flood extent 50 and vegetation et 23 are in the same order of magnitude of model overall parameter dispersion which might hamper their contribution for model calibration due to their high uncertainties 3 1 2 how are the different model variables affected by model parameters from fig 3a the overall model dispersions are related to different sets of parameters for each variable the higher the bar rmsd value the stronger the relationship between a given set of parameters hydraulics soil vegetation or all and the variable itself for instance discharge water level and tws are more strongly related to hydraulics and soil parameters and to a lesser extent to vegetation parameters flood extent estimates are strongly related to hydraulic parameters and less to soil and vegetation as expected soil moisture and vegetation et estimates relate to vertical water balance processes being insensitive to hydraulic parameters soil moisture w is more sensitive to soil parameters while vegetation et is more sensitive to vegetation parameters these results are very useful to understand the rs based calibration experiments addressed in section 3 2 for instance if model calibration with et or w is achieved through optimization of hydraulic parameters it would highlight that the model would have gotten the right results for the wrong reasons the same would occur if flood extent calibration targeted soil or vegetation parameters 3 1 3 which variables are inter related by varying all parameters together there is a high correlation between the performance of discharge and flood extent water level and flood extent flood extent and tws and et and tws respectively correlation greater or equal to 0 4 p value 0 00 fig 3b high correlations between discharge water level and flood extent are expected because of their strong association through river transport processes however correlation between discharge and water level is not too high 0 30 p value 0 00 and this is probably due to high uncertainties in the hydraulic parameters and to the relatively long distance between the water level virtual station and the streamflow gauge furthermore high correlations between tws and flood extent might be related to surface water storage dynamics which are especially relevant in regions with floodplains low correlations were found for et and water level et and flood extent both 0 08 p value 0 17 and soil moisture and tws 0 06 p value 0 30 a low correlation between et and water level or flood extent could be attributed to et being related to vertical processes whereas water level and flood extent are related to river transport processes the low correlation between soil moisture and tws could be attributed to the soil moisture compartment not having much influence in the tws for a region with floodplains in which the variations in surface water storage are more relevant in general a high correlation between variables in fig 3b should be reflected in positive results when calibrating with a given variable and evaluating with the other highly correlated variables single variable calibration this may also indicate that observations of these variables are redundant if used simultaneously in a multi calibration framework however high correlations in fig 3b followed by deterioration after the single variable calibration process might indicate structural errors in the model or in the observations we stress however that this study did not attempt to quantify structural errors conversely low correlations in fig 3b followed by improvement in performance with the calibration with multiple variables might indicate complementarity between variables 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 how rs based model calibration improves discharge estimates for the evaluation time period 2006 2008 for discharge flood extent tws et and 2013 2014 for water level and soil moisture calibration with all rs products led to improvements in discharge estimates fig 4 a for the calibration time period 2009 2012 tws et and soil moisture rs products also led to improvements in discharge estimates however water level flood extent and tws led to discharge overestimation in wet periods fig 4a even though discharge is highly correlated with water level and flood extent fig 3b correlations of 0 30 and 0 62 respectively this could be due to high uncertainties in the observations fig 3a but if this was the case it would also be reflected in a poor performance for water level and flood extent when discharge is the target variable for calibration fig 4b which does not occur therefore calibration with discharge leads to reasonable parameter sets for the performance of discharge itself and also for performance of water level and flood extent however it does not lead to the best hydraulic arrangement which might be achieved more successfully when calibrating with water level or flood extent nonetheless both water level and flood extent observations are representative of specific locations in the basin fig 2 and calibration with these variables might lead to the best parameter arrangement for these locations but not for the whole watershed a more spatially consistent use of these observations should improve their usability to constrain models and improve discharge estimates such as the studies of kittel et al 2018 that used radar altimetry measurements at 12 locations in the basin schneider et al 2017 that used data from 13 virtual stations or liu et al 2015 that used water level measurements at four virtual stations and flood extent for stream segments at different locations in the basin rs variables as tws et and soil moisture were able to improve discharge estimates by s 13 7 kgecal 0 36 s 52 9 kgecal 0 64 and s 27 0 kgecal 0 45 fig 5 a calibration period or s 27 4 kgeeval 0 52 s 6 1 kgeeval 0 37 s 12 3 kgeeval 0 43 fig 5b evaluation period compared to an uncalibrated setup of median kge ranging from 0 22 to 0 26 which is especially relevant in the context of the prediction in ungauged basins initiative hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 these results agree with previous studies such as lópez et al 2017 that found good performances in discharge estimates by model calibration with gleam et and esa cci soil moisture nijzink et al 2018 that found improvements in discharge by using soil moisture products amsr e ascat and tws from grace or zhang et al 2020 that was able to improve monthly and mean annual runoff in wet catchments by calibrating a model with et estimates the multi variable calibration experiment considering all variables except discharge fig 5b ii resulted in a skill score of s 17 4 kgeeval 0 45 for discharge in the evaluation period this is relevant for estimating discharge in poorly gauged basins nonetheless for the calibration period skill score had a low value s 1 7 kgecal 0 25 reflecting some limitations when retrieving discharges probably because of potential trade offs between variables koppa et al 2019 rs uncertainties can be reduced in model calibration for instance by using bias insensitive metrics e g demirel et al 2018 zink et al 2018 dembele et al 2020 or explicitly including them into the objective functions aires 2014 croke 2009 foglia et al 2009 peña arancibia et al 2015 3 2 2 how does rs based model calibration improve the water cycle representation when performing a single variable calibration the performance of the variable itself always improves which is evidenced by the positive values in the main diagonal fig 5a i for calibration period and fig 5b i for evaluation period the calibration with water level was able to improve estimates of flood extent tws et and soil moisture cal period and all variables eval period calibration with flood extent improved water level tws et and soil moisture cal period and all variables eval period calibration with tws improved all variables in both cal and eval periods calibration with et was able to improve discharge and flood extent cal and discharge flood extent and tws eval calibration with soil moisture improved all variables but et for both cal and eval periods results for calibration and evaluation periods agree i e improvement positive skill score or deterioration negative skill score for both cal and eval in 43 out of the 48 cases 89 6 in the five remaining cases 10 4 results between calibration and evaluation periods differ three of them are in the evaluation with tws calibration with discharge et and all except q and two of them are in the discharge evaluation calibration with water level and flood extent in the best modeling scenario calibration with any variable should improve the performance of all other variables however we have identified that this did not happen in our experiments this can be due to uncertainties in model structure in parameterization in the observations or the integration techniques in model calibration dembele et al 2020 previous studies have also found significant advantages in using rs based model calibration to identify structural model issues e g werth et al 2009 willem vervoort et al 2014 winsemius and savenije 2008 detect uncertainties in input data e g milzow et al 2011 identify deficiencies in model parameterization e g franks et al 1998 koppa et al 2019 and increase model reliability e g koch et al 2018 manfreda et al 2018 according to fig 4b and supplementary material fig s2 calibration with discharge improved estimates of almost all variables however calibration with discharge deteriorated the performance for vegetation et time series vegetation et estimated by mod16 varies at maximum 30 mm month mgb calibration with discharge led to maximum et variations of 100 mm month reaching around 30 mm month in the driest periods while mod16 estimates are limited to a minimum of 100 mm month in these periods time series in fig 4b however one can notice that not even the seasonality between mgb and mod16 time series agree this could be due to relatively high uncertainties in vegetation et estimates from mod16 for the amazon basin around 23 mm month according to gomis cebolla et al 2019 nonetheless it could also be related to model structural and or parameter deficiencies in which case the model might be right for the wrong reasons in order to identify the source of this et inconsistency we have compared mod16 and mgb results to in situ measurements of et in purus river basin provided by gomis cebolla et al 2019 and maeda et al 2017 we found a much stronger agreement both in seasonality and in amplitude of in situ observations with mod16 observations than with mgb model outputs hasler avissar 2007 and pan et al 2020 have already warned about the overestimation of dry season water stress in hydrological models probably related to the misrepresentation of soil water availability for plants this was also found by maeda et al 2017 which highlighted that et was not water limited because of the plants access to deep soil water which has also been previously documented by nepstad et al 1994 they found that in the southern amazon ecotone deep root water intake plays a key role in maintaining ecosystem productivity during dry season mgb model is probably misrepresenting these processes which would remain unknown if it were only compared to discharge time series even though the calibration with discharge observations was not able to accurately estimate et calibration with the remaining variables except for soil moisture was able to improve et estimates for instance in fig 3b et and water level presented low correlation r 0 08 but calibration with water level improved et estimates by s 16 9 cal period and s 25 6 eval period conversely however calibration with et was not able to improve water level estimates s 2 9 and s 1 3 for cal and eval periods respectively which suggests structural errors or uncertainty in the observations in general calibration with tws did not present much influence on any other variables in spite of some improvements skill scores were usually low consistently tws estimates were relatively easily improved by calibration with any variable except for et for cal period or discharge for eval period these results for tws contrast with previous works from lo et al 2010 nijzink et al 2018 rakovec et al 2016 schumacher et al 2018 and werth and güntner 2010 which highlighted the value of grace data when incorporated into hydrological modeling this can be due to the high seasonality of the purus river basin in which tws does not aggregate much information biasing the calibration with high correlation values even for the initial guess uncalibrated setup the tws performance was already satisfactory kge values were around 0 8 while for all other variables kge values were much lower below 0 3 for the uncalibrated setup the calibration experiments with discharge water level and flood extent improved the performances of flood extent and water level but did not largely affect et which was actually degraded with discharge calibration and soil moisture this is probably due to the tight relationship between water level and flood extent through river transport processes i e flood routing along the river floodplain system while et and soil moisture are more related to vertical hydrological processes e g vertical soil water balance for instance in the sensitivity analysis a low correlation was obtained between et and flood extent modelled time series 0 08 fig 3b a small yet positive skill score for the assessment of flood extent when calibrating with et and vice versa suggests a complementarity between variables that relate to different processes the calibration with soil moisture improves the performances of all variables water level to a lesser extent except for et consistently calibration with all variables except et are able to improve soil moisture to some extent while in the sensitivity analysis the modelled times series of soil moisture and tws presented a low correlation 0 06 fig 3b the calibration with tws was able to improve soil moisture and vice versa which suggests a complementarity between these variables 3 2 3 what is the added value of complementary rs observations by calibrating with all variables together except q fig 5 ii we found improvements for almost all variables with the most significant improvements for flood extent s 26 8 for cal period and s 24 3 for eval period and et s 17 8 for cal period and s 23 3 for eval period for discharge performance for the evaluation period was improved s 17 4 which is important for estimating discharge in poorly gauged basins however for the calibration period skill score for discharge performance was s 1 7 which might reflect some limitations in retrieving discharge based on the calibration of the rs derived variables as discussed previously therefore we chose a specific arrangement of two complementary variables in order to check if this calibration setup might lead to better retrievals for discharge and the other variables the chosen variables were water level and soil moisture because of their complementarity correlation in fig 3b of 0 27 based on the skill score values in fig 5 i calibration with water level only improves all variables but discharge and soil moisture to a lesser extent while calibration with soil moisture only improves all variables but et and water level to a lesser extent the calibration arrangement of water level and soil moisture led to improvements not only to soil moisture and water level themselves but also to all other variables et to a lesser extent for instance flood extent was improved by s 52 6 and s 34 1 cal and eval period respectively discharge was improved by s 59 9 with a resulting mean kge 0 70 for the calibration period s 45 0 and mean kge 0 35 for evaluation period these results agree with previous works that found an improvement in model performances by multi variable calibration of soil moisture and evapotranspiration e g koppa et al 2019 lópez et al 2017 discharge and evapotranspiration e g herman et al 2017 pan et al 2018 poméon et al 2018 discharge and soil moisture e g li et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 discharge and tws e g rakovec et al 2016 schumacher et al 2018 werth and güntner 2010 and discharge and water level e g kittel et al 2018 schneider et al 2017 sun et al 2012 however it is difficult to compare this study to previous works because most of them used discharge observations as constraints in this study we avoided the use of discharge observations for multi variable calibration in order to analyze the applicability of the rs based calibration method for poorly gauged regions we emphasize that the multi variable calibration against water level hydrodynamic variable and soil moisture hydrologic variable was only possible due to the model s hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling setup calibration with water level and soil moisture did not present much influence on et performance because of the specificities regarding et in this watershed i e given that the model setup does not represent deep root water intake during dry season as discussed previously by comparing the two frameworks for multi variable calibration all except q versus h w calibration we found that calibration with all variables except q is useful to some extent but consistently selecting complementary variables for model calibration resulted in best overall performance 3 3 are we getting the right results for the right sets of parameters when analyzing the dispersions of parameters before and after calibration with each variable fig 6 for a few selected parameters supplementary material fig s3 for all calibrated parameters it can be observed that the range of parameters varies largely depending on the calibration variables for instance wm is a soil conceptual parameter related to maximum water storage in the soil in the calibration based on single variables except et it converged to low values 300 mm while in the calibration with et it reached high values 2000 mm this probably occurred in order to compensate by overparameterization a structural error in the model i e the model inability to represent deep root water uptake in dry season these trade offs between model parameters during calibration has also been reported and discussed by koppa et al 2019 the surface resistance parameter associated with forest areas also resulted in a wide range of values depending on the calibration target variables when calibrated with water level flood extent or all except q experiments it reached median values higher than 150 s m but calibration with h w led to median values lower than 50 s m surface resistance is a vegetation parameter directly related to et dynamics so it is important to note that calibration with et was able to reduce the dispersion of this parameter reaching a median value of about 80 s m similar to calibration with q and w another interesting result relates to channel manning s coefficient which presented different values for each calibration experiment this agrees with previous findings about manning parameter being often used as an effective parameter that compensates for neglected hydrodynamic processes as localized channel head losses poor cross section representation or non represented 2d processes neal et al 2015 many previous studies have highlighted the use of multi variable calibration to narrow parameters search space nijzink et al 2018 w sun et al 2018 but this was not observed in our results based on the limited multi variable calibration experiments performed here all except q and h w no narrowing in parameters search space was found for most parameters except for wm calibration with all except q and h w still resulted in a wide range of parameter values this can be due to differing convergence sets of parameters between each of the triplicate runs a more robust experiment comparing more multi variable calibration strategies e g q different rs based variables might provide better understanding on this topic 3 4 spatial evaluation for model calibration we used one streamflow gauge for discharge one virtual station for water level averaged rs data for the whole basin for tws et and soil moisture and flood extent over the lower part of the basin however many recent studies investigated the potential for using rs spatially distributed information in model calibration for instance with bias insensitive metrics demirel et al 2018 zink et al 2018 dembele et al 2020 here we further analyze how the lumped calibration affected the simulated spatial patterns fig 7 for discharge water level and flood extent spatial patterns are well reproduced even when running the model with the initial parameter set because the spatial patterns of these variables are determined by intrinsic characteristics of the basin nonetheless for et the spatial patterns are completely different between the initial parameter set and the calibrated setup in this case the calibration with spatially aggregated et was able to recover the spatial representation of mod16 a similar result was found for soil moisture spatial representation by demirel et al 2019 that calibrated a model with spatially aggregated soil moisture and tws data in summary these results highlight the overall model capability to retrieve the et spatial pattern even by using a lumped calibration approach however for other variables the spatial pattern was not considerably affected by the differing model calibration strategies 4 conclusion we calibrated and evaluated a hydrologic hydrodynamic model with five different rs based observations of the water cycle water levels jason 2 flood extent alos palsar tws grace vegetation et mod16 and soil moisture smos for a study basin in a tropical region with floodplains purus river basin in the amazon and analyzed the redundancy and complementarity between different variables and processes results showed that calibration with current rs observations was able to improve discharge estimates for instance in the uncalibrated setup a priori parameter sets average performances mean kge for discharge were around kge 0 30 by calibrating the model with et from mod16 and evaluating for the same time period discharge average performance mean kge was improved to kge 0 64 representing a skill score of s 52 9 also in the calibration period a joint scheme of calibration with water level soil moisture led to discharge improvements of s 59 9 when evaluating for a different time period discharge performance was improved by calibration with water level tws and a joint scheme of all rs variables s 25 9 s 27 9 and s 17 4 respectively we conclude that rs observations are useful to predict discharge estimates however the utility of each rs variable might depend on the study area characteristics and the time period considered our results also showed that rs based calibration led to an overall improvement of the water cycle representation for instance calibration with water level was able to improve estimates of water level itself but also flood extent tws and et calibration with soil moisture was able to improve estimates of soil moisture itself but also discharge flood extent and tws we highlight the novelty and further applicability of relating the calibration and evaluation of hydrological e g soil moisture et tws and hydraulic variables e g flood extent and water level which is only possible with a tightly coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model setup moreover calibration with multiple rs variables was able to highlight deficiencies that might be related to model structure parameterization observations and data integration techniques in model calibration in the context of model structure for instance calibration with et highlighted the model inability to represent the root water intake in dry season in this region thus compensating it by misrepresenting other variables in the context of model parameterization for instance we found a wide range of different parameters by varying the calibration target variable besides individual calibration with each rs variable we conducted two multi variable calibration experiments calibration with all variables except discharge and calibration with water level and soil moisture calibration with all variables was useful to some extent but appropriately selecting complementary variables for model calibration may result in a better overall performance even though we used a lumped calibration approach results highlighted the overall model capability to retrieve et spatial pattern but not for tws and soil moisture the main conclusions presented here are of great interest for the hydrological community and agree with previous works in that rs based calibration is useful to improve the water cycle representation in hydrological models to further investigate the potentiality of rs data future developments should test the methodology presented here for multiple basins at contrasting hydro climatic regions here we assessed an amazonian equatorial basin with particular climate and land cover characteristics and an overall spatial homogeneity of rainfall runoff processes other basins with different hydroclimatic regimes could be also assessed e g in arid basins subject to long dry periods more erratic precipitation patterns and different runoff generation mechanisms than the amazon which require different model structures finally here we used one state of the art rs product for each variable but future developments should explore other missions like swot for surface water observation biancamaria et al 2016 as well as considering different products for representing each variable e g et could be estimated by gleam modis ssebop sebs alexi metric etc besides mod16 credit

4613,the accuracy of hydrological model predictions is limited by uncertainties in model structure and parameterization and observations used for calibration validation and model forcing while calibration is usually performed with discharge estimates the internal model processes might be misrepresented and the model might be getting the right results for the wrong reasons thus compromising model reliability an alternative is to calibrate model parameters with remote sensing rs observations of the water cycle previous studies highlighted the potential of rs based calibration to improve discharge estimates focusing less on other variables of the water cycle in this study we analyzed in detail the contribution of five rs based variables water level h flood extent a terrestrial water storage tws evapotranspiration et and soil moisture w to calibrate a coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model for a large amazon sub basin with extensive floodplains single variable calibration experiments with all variables were able to improve discharge kge from around 6 1 to 52 9 when compared to a priori parameter sets water cycle representation was improved with multi variable calibration kge for all variables were improved in the evaluation period by analyzing different calibration setups a consistent selection of complementary variables for model calibration resulted in a better performance than incorporating all rs variables into the calibration by looking at multiple rs observations of the water cycle inconsistencies in model structure and parameterization were found which would remain unknown if only discharge observations were considered keywords hydrological modeling multi variable calibration amazon hydrodynamic modeling large basins 1 introduction the accurate representation of hydrologic processes in mathematical models remains a key challenge in water resources research and applications baroni et al 2019 clark et al 2015 kirchner 2006 nearing et al 2016 semenova beven 2015 due to uncertainties in model structure wagener et al 2003 parameterization gharari et al 2014 shafii and tolson 2015 and observations di baldassarre and montanari 2009 these uncertainties might lead to inaccurate predictions of hydrological variables for water resources and natural hazards management grimaldi et al 2019 montanari koutsoyiannis 2014 and for quantification of impacts of climate change and anthropogenic effects on the water cycle haddeland et al 2006 teutschbein seibert 2012 xu et al 2005 this problem has led for instance to initiatives to better constrain the terrestrial water budget by fusing models and earth observation datasets pan wood 2006 pellet et al 2019 traditionally hydrological models are calibrated against gauged streamflow data which might hamper predictions in ungauged sites since they do not guarantee an accurate representation of other water cycle components e g soil moisture and evapotranspiration thus leading to uncertainty in hydrologic predictions hrachowitz et al 2013 moreover for a given model many parameter sets can provide equally acceptable performances for streamflow evaluation i e the equifinality thesis but they might be right for the wrong reasons beven 2006 kirchner 2006 several solutions have been proposed to improve process representation and reduce uncertainty in model predictions such as

poor spatial and temporal representativeness in this context remote sensing rs observations have stood out in the last decade because of their increasing spatial and temporal resolution free availability in many cases and capability to record less monitored hydrological variables such as soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage lakshmi 2004 lettenmaier et al 2015 for instance grace mission provided monthly estimates of changes in water storage on a global coverage with an accuracy of 2 cm when uniformly estimated over land and oceans in regions with larger amplitudes e g amazon basin water storage anomalies estimates from grace are even more accurate tapley et al 2004 missions such as smos smap amsr e and ascat were estimated to provide soil moisture

an accuracy ranging from 0 04 m to 0 42 m involving trade offs between temporal resolution from 10 to 91 days and cross track separation from 15 to 315 km jarihani et al 2013 while the future swot mission will provide at least one water level measurement every 21 days for global rivers wider than 100 m biancamaria et al 2016 many studies have used multiple remote sensing products in combination to better understand the water cycle aires 2014 billah 2015 lakshmi et al 2018 although previous studies have analyzed the value of integrating rs data into hydrological modeling through calibration or data assimilation see review by xu et al 2014 jiang wang 2019 this topic has not been fully explored to its potential yet therefore in section 1 1 we present major knowledge gaps in the context of rs based calibration of hydrological models through an extensive literature review in section 1 2 we describe the aims and contributions of this study 1 1 literature review on calibration of hydrological models with rs data a comprehensive yet non exhaustive literature review of studies that used rs datasets for parameter estimation in hydrological models is presented in this section and summarized in fig 1 a total of 64 research articles was found see supplementary material table s1 for details on the review methodology most publications involved large study areas 1000 km2 which is expected because of the usual coarse resolution of rs products fig 1a most studies used rs derived evapotranspiration for model calibration followed by soil moisture fig 1b but there were also attempts for calibration of up to eight different rs derived variables nijzink et al 2018 this indicates a still existent knowledge gap regarding which rs derived variables are more useful for model calibration indeed many recent studies have investigated the added value of rs derived information to calibrate hydrological models fig 1c table s1 most of the studies aprox 70 used only one rs product for model calibration fig 1d in black while twelve studies used two products and five used three products only few studies used more than three rs products for model calibration demirel et al 2019 nijzink et al 2018 some studies addressed the use of rs data to estimate discharge in ungauged basins kittel et al 2018 sun et al 2010 while others focused on narrowing the parameter search space and thus equifinality reduction by combining multiple variables for calibration e g nijzink et al 2018 pan et al 2018 this is confirmed by fig 1d in blue which demonstrates that the vast majority of researches used two variables for calibration in general discharge and a rs derived variable within these studies some analyzed model performance in terms of discharge only while others considered different variables fig 1d in red providing a more comprehensive discussion on inconsistencies of hydrological models e g koch et al 2018 li et al 2018 regarding how rs is incorporated into the model calibration procedure fig 1f 65 2 of the articles used rs based spatially distributed information thus calibrating the model with distributed objective functions e g pixel by pixel or by sub basin within these studies bias insensitive objective functions have been recently introduced e g koch et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020 demirel 2018 zink et al 2018 huang et al 2020 being important for reducing the impact of rs data uncertainty on the parameter estimation procedure the remaining publications 34 8 incorporated rs data as an average for the whole basin finally there is still a need for more studies in tropical regions especially south america fig 1g which have particular hydro climatic characteristics and so have different requirements than temperate regions on model process representation e g snow related processes might not be so relevant in some tropical areas whereas an accurate representation of floodplains might be in the case of basin with complex river floodplain interactions as in the amazon an accurate flood wave routing method is required to correctly depict the water transport along the drainage network our analysis shows that most studies used simple flood wave routing schemes such as kinematic wave or muskingum fig 1h only 10 1 attempted to couple hydrologic and river hydrodynamic models highlighting the necessity of better understanding the applicability of rs based calibration in basins with major flat regions with wetlands hodges 2013 neal et al 2012 pontes et al 2017 1 2 aims and contributions of this paper our study addresses major knowledge gaps identified in the previous literature review in the context of rs based calibration of hydrological models firstly most of the studies analyzed two or less variables fig 1e here we used a large number of rs observed variables for model calibration namely soil moisture evapotranspiration terrestrial water storage flood extent and river water levels and thus move beyond the contributions of rs for improving only discharge estimates by simultaneously looking at different variables we also move towards an improved representation of the water cycle as a whole enhancing our ability to identify model limitations and inconsistencies furthermore most studies to date focused on european temperate watersheds fig 1c which largely differ from tropical basins in terms of hydroclimatic characteristics and river wetland interactions in this context large scale coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic models have major developments in recent years paiva et al 2013 fleischmann 2020 rajib et al 2020 yamazaki et al 2011 but to our knowledge the complementarity of hydrologic soil moisture evapotranspiration terrestrial water storage and hydrodynamic flood extent and river water level rs observations for model calibration has not yet been addressed in the literature here we present a study case in a tropical basin with extensive floodplains in the amazon with a state of the art coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model which together with the previously mentioned advances provides important contributions to the growing literatures of rs based calibration of hydrological models this study aims to investigate the applicability of multiple rs observations in an accessible approach to model and represent the water cycle accurately in tropical areas 2 methods 2 1 experimental design a hydrologic hydrodynamic model mgb collischonn et al 2007 is set up for a case study in the amazon purus river basin with a priori parameter sets based on their variability as reported in literature references in table s2 the study is then divided into two steps firstly a sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how different parameter sets river hydraulic soil vegetation affect model output variables river discharge flood extent river water level soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage then a calibration step is performed in which the model is calibrated with the well known multi objective global optimization for hydrologic models mocom ua algorithm yapo et al 1998 considering six variables 1 in situ streamflow one gauge at the basin outlet and rs freely available state of the art observations of 2 water level one satellite altimetry virtual station 3 flood extent sum of flooded areas over the lower purus river basin 4 terrestrial water storage tws 5 evapotranspiration and 6 soil moisture variables 4 5 and 6 are averaged over the whole basin the calibration of each variable is performed individually single variable and evaluated for all variables all calibration experiments are repeated three times with different initial parameter sets to ensure that convergence is not dependent on the initial parameter sets given limitations on the availability of simultaneous rs temporal coverage the model is calibrated for one time period 2009 2012 and evaluated for i the same time period of calibration and ii for a different period 2006 2008 for discharge flood extent tws et and 2013 2014 for water level and soil moisture the time periods are different due to limitations in remote sensing data availability to understand how lumped calibration can retrieve the remotely sensed spatial patterns a qualitative evaluation is provided additionally a final test is performed in which two multi variable calibration experiments are conducted i calibration with all analyzed variables except discharge and ii calibration with two complementary variables water level and soil moisture which are selected for simultaneous calibration for being complementary and having led to satisfactory calibration performance 2 2 study area purus river basin the purus river basin fig 2 in amazon has a drainage area of approximately 236 000 km2 and river discharge ranges from around 1 000 june december to 12 000 m3 s january july at canutama gauge because of its large area it is compatible with the spatial resolution of rs products e g a pixel of grace presents spatial resolution of roughly 300 400 km besides purus river basin has minor anthropogenic influences ríos villamizar et al 2017 also evidenced by the mostly forested last use depicted in fig 2b which simplifies the modeling process the climate is equatorial fig 2d and mean annual rainfall is 2147 mm year according to in situ gauges purus basin was selected because of its representativeness of tropical regions as the amazon basin which is the largest river in the world holeman 1968 and it is characterized by extensive floodplains junk 1997 for instance on the lower purus the floodplain width is in the order of 30 km which corresponds to approximately 30 times the main channel width paiva et al 2011 these floodplains allow a satisfactory flood extent monitoring by rs image classification which contributes to the suitability of purus river basin for this study 2 3 hydrologic hydrodynamic model mgb the mgb modelo de grandes bacias a portuguese acronym for large basin model is a semi distributed hydrologic hydrodynamic model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 it was chosen for this study because 1 it has been widely and successfully applied in several south american basins e g paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 2 it is representative and similar to other conceptual hydrological models like vic liang et al 1994 and swat and 3 the hydrological component is tightly coupled to a hydrodynamic routing scheme allowing the simulation of complex flat tropical basins moreover the source code of mgb is freely available at www ufrgs br lsh the stream network is derived from digital elevation model dem processing the model has 19 parameters which are further detailed in the next section other model inputs are precipitation climate data soil type and land use maps which are further described in section 2 6 model setup within the model structure basins are discretized into unit catchments which are further divided into hydrological response units hru s based on soil type and land use model parameters are specific for each of the hrus a vertical water balance is performed for each hru considering canopy interception soil infiltration evapotranspiration and generation of surface subsurface and groundwater flows soil is represented as a bucket model with a single layer flow generated in each hru is routed to the outlet of the unit catchment with linear reservoirs outflow from each unit catchment is then propagated through the stream network by using a 1d hydrodynamic model based on the inertial approximation proposed by bates et al 2010 a schematic representation of the model structure is presented in supplementary material fig s1 2 4 a priori uncertainty of model parameters within mgb model there are parameters related to river hydraulics manning s roughness and width and depth parameters related to geomorphological relationships conceptual parameters related to soil water budget wm b kbas kint xl cap wc ci cs cb and vegetation cover albedo leaf area index vegetation height and penman monteith surface resistance which are further detailed in supplementary material table s2 out of the 19 model parameters six are fixed and 13 are calibrated the a priori uncertainty of mgb model parameters is estimated based on their variability as reported in literature references in table s2 supplementary material table s2 presents the calibration parameters their initial values range and the references that support these assumptions 2 5 sensitivity analysis in order to understand how different parameter sets river hydraulic soil vegetation affect model output variables river discharge flood extent river water level soil moisture evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage multiple model runs were conducted considering four uncalibrated model setups 1 varying only soil parameters 2 varying only vegetation parameters 3 varying only hydraulic parameters 4 varying all parameters together one hundred runs were conducted in triplicate to ensure that convergence is not dependent on the randomly selected initial parameter sets thus resulting in 300 runs for each setup in this step no rs based calibration is performed yet parameters were varied considering a uniform distribution and results were analyzed in terms of mean rmsd root mean square deviation of each variable by comparing each run with a reference one i e the initial run with the initial parameter set as defined in supplementary material table s2 this was performed in order to understand the sources of model uncertainties related to different sets of parameters e g are flood extent estimates sensitive to vegetation parameters or are et estimates sensitive to hydraulic parameters the dispersion of model outputs was also compared to uncertainty in the observations as derived from literature to understand which variables are inter related in the model we further analyzed the results of setup 4 varying all parameters together this was done by firstly computing the kling gupta efficiency metric kge gupta et al 2009 between the perturbed runs and a reference one i e run with the initial parameter set for each variable and then calculating the pearson correlation r between kge values for each pair of variables e g discharge and water level discharge and flood extent and so forth this experiment is relevant to evaluate whether two variables get improved or get worsened together or whether a variable improvement impacts on the deterioration of another in other words this approach allows to evaluate the correlation between the variables in general the results from the sensitivity analysis are used to better understand the model overall behavior and interpret our results from the calibration experiments we aim to first understand how the different rs datasets can affect model predictions how uncertain are rs data in relation to the model predictions and how sensitive is the model to different parameters then we perform multiple calibration experiments and finally we can evaluate whether the results from calibration are right for the right reasons i e if they are consistent with our findings from the sensitivity analysis 2 6 model setup the bare earth digital elevation model dem o loughlin et al 2016 fig 2c was used for stream network computation and basin discretization with the iph hydrotools gis package siqueira et al 2016 the original dem resolution is 90 m and it was resampled to 500 m to facilitate gis processing an upstream area threshold of 100 km2 was adopted to delineate the drainage network and unit catchments were discretized by dividing the stream network into fixed reach length of 10 km resulting in 2957 unit catchments for the whole basin daily precipitation data were derived from tmpa 3b42 version 7 for the period 01 01 2005 31 12 2014 with spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 huffman et al 2007 available at https gpm nasa gov

satisfactory performance when coupled with hydrological models e g collischonn et al 2008 maurer et al 2009 naz et al 2014 mocom ua is an evolutionary algorithm based on sce ua duan et al 1992 shuffled complex evolution that simultaneously optimizes a model population with respect to different objective functions the algorithm converges towards the pareto optimum when all points in the population become non dominated and thus all solutions in the pareto front are equally good in regards to the objective functions considered the model population consists of randomly distributed points within the parameter search space and it reflects the a priori uncertainty of model parameters here the population size was set to 100 individuals the altered model parameters and their respective ranges are described in supplementary material table s2 all calibration experiments are repeated three times totaling 300 initial runs with differing initial parameter sets to ensure that convergence is not dependent on the initial parameter sets initial parameters are set as the mean of their literature based range table s2 objective functions to be optimized depend on the calibration setup in the single variable calibration for each variable three objective functions of that summarize the agreement between simulated and observed rs time series are simultaneously optimized pearson

for model calibration and evaluation as well as how mgb outputs were evaluated in comparison to them in situ discharge measurements were obtained from the brazilian water agency hidroweb database

uncertainty in discharge observations can be estimated as ranging from 6 2 to 42 8 at the 95 confidence level with an average of 25 6 di baldassarre and montanari 2009 discharge was evaluated on a daily basis remotely sensed water level data were obtained from jason 2 mission which presents an orbit cycle of approximately 10 days and tracks separated by approximately 300 km at the equator lambin et al 2010 it presents an accuracy of approximately 0 28 m jarihani et al 2013 and data are available since 2008 the virtual station presented in fig 2a corresponds to track number 165 and it is located around 1050 km upstream from the discharge gauging station processed data for this study were downloaded from the hydroweb theia database available at http hydroweb theia land fr the simulated water level was computed in mgb at the unit catchment associated to the altimetry virtual station being an advantage of using the hydrodynamic scheme for flood routing instead of the muskingum simplification simulated and rs water level data were compared every 10 days in terms of anomaly values subtracted from long term average satellite flood extent data were derived from alos palsar imagery which presents a ground resolution of 100 m rosenqvist et al 2007 images were downloaded from alaska satellite facility available at https www asf alaska edu in processing level 1 5 which already presents geometric and radiometric corrections a 3 3 median filter was used to remove speckle noise lee et al 2014 images were classified into water backscattering coefficient less than 14 db non flooded forest between 14 db and 6 5 db and flooded forest higher than 6 5 db classes according to hess et al 2003 and lee et al 2014 the uncertainty of flood extent estimates was estimated as 49 8 based on the rmsd root mean square deviation between the resulting classification of this study and the dual season mapping developed by hess et al 2003 simulated and rs flood extent data were compared for the pink area depicted in fig 2a in order to avoid spurious flood extent data in regions that are known to be not subject to flooding alos palsar presents a recurrence cycle of 46 days from 2006 to 2011 and flood extent data were available and compared to mgb for 21 dates satellite based terrestrial water storage tws anomalies were extracted from grace mission launched in march 2002 grace provides monthly tws estimates based on anomalies in gravitational potential at a resolution of 300 400 km with a uniform accuracy of 2 cm over the land and ocean regions tapley et al 2004 tws anomalies were retrieved from three processing centers gfz geoforschungs zentrum potsdam germany csr center for space research at university of texas use and jpl jet propulsion laboratory usa available at https grace jpl nasa gov and then the mean value based on the three products was averaged for the whole basin in mgb tws values were computed as the sum of water storage of all hydrological compartments river floodplains soil groundwater and vegetation canopy paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 simulated and rs based tws were compared in terms of anomaly values subtracted from long term average at a monthly time scale satellite based evapotranspiration estimates were retrieved from the mod16 product derived by an algorithm presented by mu et al 2011 based on the penman monteith equation the dataset covers the period 2000 2010 with a spatial resolution of 1 km for global vegetated land areas because of that even though mgb evapotranspiration is calculated for flooded areas open water evaporation in main channel and floodplains and vegetation for water balance purposes only the vegetation et output was compared to mod16 mod16 products are provided in 8 days monthly and annual intervals monthly intervals were used here and averaged for the whole basin the accuracy of mod16 along the amazon basin is estimated as 0 76 mm day gomis cebolla et al 2019 mod16 data is available at https www ntsg umt edu project modis mod16 php in mgb evapotranspiration is computed via penman monteith equation shuttleworth 1993 based on the climate input variables satellite based soil moisture is derived from the smos mission kerr et al 2001 processed by the centre aval de traitement des données smos catds and downloaded in processing level 4 which combines lower level products with data from other sensors and modeling data assimilation techniques the daily l4 root zone soil moisture product at 0 1 m soil depth al bitar et al 2013 were used available at https www catds fr products available products from cec sm l4 land research products and data from ascending and descending orbits were averaged for the whole basin the dataset covers the period 2010 today in mgb soil moisture as a saturation degree was computed as the water in the soil compartment divided by the maximum water capacity of the soil wm parameter since mgb estimates saturation degree values for a soil bucket reservoir smos values were rescaled for the range 0 100 according to the min max correction method described by tarpanelli et al 2013 and applied by some studies e g rajib et al 2016 silvestro et al 2015 thus they are compared to the results of mgb s on a daily time scale as an average for the whole basin 3 results and discussion results are structured as follows firstly the sensitivity analysis is presented with discussions on model uncertainties section 3 1 then results for model calibration are presented with discussions on how rs based model calibration can improve discharge and the water cycle representation as a whole section 3 2 3 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was carried out to understand how different parameter types river hydraulic soil vegetation and all together affect the variation of different hydrological processes in mgb fig 3 a this was performed by analyzing the dispersion of six output variables discharge water level flood extent tws anomalies vegetation et and soil moisture these results are also compared with an estimate of the uncertainties of observations values provided in section 2 8 calibration evaluation data and are discussed in the subsequent sections 3 1 1 how do varying model outputs relate to uncertainty in the observations some variables present in situ rs observations that have uncertainties significantly lower than the overall dispersion of the model e g 25 6 for discharge observations while model overall parameter dispersion is 160 this pattern is also found for water level and tws estimates and implies that these observations might be useful to constrain the model nonetheless uncertainties in rs products of flood extent 50 and vegetation et 23 are in the same order of magnitude of model overall parameter dispersion which might hamper their contribution for model calibration due to their high uncertainties 3 1 2 how are the different model variables affected by model parameters from fig 3a the overall model dispersions are related to different sets of parameters for each variable the higher the bar rmsd value the stronger the relationship between a given set of parameters hydraulics soil vegetation or all and the variable itself for instance discharge water level and tws are more strongly related to hydraulics and soil parameters and to a lesser extent to vegetation parameters flood extent estimates are strongly related to hydraulic parameters and less to soil and vegetation as expected soil moisture and vegetation et estimates relate to vertical water balance processes being insensitive to hydraulic parameters soil moisture w is more sensitive to soil parameters while vegetation et is more sensitive to vegetation parameters these results are very useful to understand the rs based calibration experiments addressed in section 3 2 for instance if model calibration with et or w is achieved through optimization of hydraulic parameters it would highlight that the model would have gotten the right results for the wrong reasons the same would occur if flood extent calibration targeted soil or vegetation parameters 3 1 3 which variables are inter related by varying all parameters together there is a high correlation between the performance of discharge and flood extent water level and flood extent flood extent and tws and et and tws respectively correlation greater or equal to 0 4 p value 0 00 fig 3b high correlations between discharge water level and flood extent are expected because of their strong association through river transport processes however correlation between discharge and water level is not too high 0 30 p value 0 00 and this is probably due to high uncertainties in the hydraulic parameters and to the relatively long distance between the water level virtual station and the streamflow gauge furthermore high correlations between tws and flood extent might be related to surface water storage dynamics which are especially relevant in regions with floodplains low correlations were found for et and water level et and flood extent both 0 08 p value 0 17 and soil moisture and tws 0 06 p value 0 30 a low correlation between et and water level or flood extent could be attributed to et being related to vertical processes whereas water level and flood extent are related to river transport processes the low correlation between soil moisture and tws could be attributed to the soil moisture compartment not having much influence in the tws for a region with floodplains in which the variations in surface water storage are more relevant in general a high correlation between variables in fig 3b should be reflected in positive results when calibrating with a given variable and evaluating with the other highly correlated variables single variable calibration this may also indicate that observations of these variables are redundant if used simultaneously in a multi calibration framework however high correlations in fig 3b followed by deterioration after the single variable calibration process might indicate structural errors in the model or in the observations we stress however that this study did not attempt to quantify structural errors conversely low correlations in fig 3b followed by improvement in performance with the calibration with multiple variables might indicate complementarity between variables 3 2 model calibration 3 2 1 how rs based model calibration improves discharge estimates for the evaluation time period 2006 2008 for discharge flood extent tws et and 2013 2014 for water level and soil moisture calibration with all rs products led to improvements in discharge estimates fig 4 a for the calibration time period 2009 2012 tws et and soil moisture rs products also led to improvements in discharge estimates however water level flood extent and tws led to discharge overestimation in wet periods fig 4a even though discharge is highly correlated with water level and flood extent fig 3b correlations of 0 30 and 0 62 respectively this could be due to high uncertainties in the observations fig 3a but if this was the case it would also be reflected in a poor performance for water level and flood extent when discharge is the target variable for calibration fig 4b which does not occur therefore calibration with discharge leads to reasonable parameter sets for the performance of discharge itself and also for performance of water level and flood extent however it does not lead to the best hydraulic arrangement which might be achieved more successfully when calibrating with water level or flood extent nonetheless both water level and flood extent observations are representative of specific locations in the basin fig 2 and calibration with these variables might lead to the best parameter arrangement for these locations but not for the whole watershed a more spatially consistent use of these observations should improve their usability to constrain models and improve discharge estimates such as the studies of kittel et al 2018 that used radar altimetry measurements at 12 locations in the basin schneider et al 2017 that used data from 13 virtual stations or liu et al 2015 that used water level measurements at four virtual stations and flood extent for stream segments at different locations in the basin rs variables as tws et and soil moisture were able to improve discharge estimates by s 13 7 kgecal 0 36 s 52 9 kgecal 0 64 and s 27 0 kgecal 0 45 fig 5 a calibration period or s 27 4 kgeeval 0 52 s 6 1 kgeeval 0 37 s 12 3 kgeeval 0 43 fig 5b evaluation period compared to an uncalibrated setup of median kge ranging from 0 22 to 0 26 which is especially relevant in the context of the prediction in ungauged basins initiative hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 these results agree with previous studies such as lópez et al 2017 that found good performances in discharge estimates by model calibration with gleam et and esa cci soil moisture nijzink et al 2018 that found improvements in discharge by using soil moisture products amsr e ascat and tws from grace or zhang et al 2020 that was able to improve monthly and mean annual runoff in wet catchments by calibrating a model with et estimates the multi variable calibration experiment considering all variables except discharge fig 5b ii resulted in a skill score of s 17 4 kgeeval 0 45 for discharge in the evaluation period this is relevant for estimating discharge in poorly gauged basins nonetheless for the calibration period skill score had a low value s 1 7 kgecal 0 25 reflecting some limitations when retrieving discharges probably because of potential trade offs between variables koppa et al 2019 rs uncertainties can be reduced in model calibration for instance by using bias insensitive metrics e g demirel et al 2018 zink et al 2018 dembele et al 2020 or explicitly including them into the objective functions aires 2014 croke 2009 foglia et al 2009 peña arancibia et al 2015 3 2 2 how does rs based model calibration improve the water cycle representation when performing a single variable calibration the performance of the variable itself always improves which is evidenced by the positive values in the main diagonal fig 5a i for calibration period and fig 5b i for evaluation period the calibration with water level was able to improve estimates of flood extent tws et and soil moisture cal period and all variables eval period calibration with flood extent improved water level tws et and soil moisture cal period and all variables eval period calibration with tws improved all variables in both cal and eval periods calibration with et was able to improve discharge and flood extent cal and discharge flood extent and tws eval calibration with soil moisture improved all variables but et for both cal and eval periods results for calibration and evaluation periods agree i e improvement positive skill score or deterioration negative skill score for both cal and eval in 43 out of the 48 cases 89 6 in the five remaining cases 10 4 results between calibration and evaluation periods differ three of them are in the evaluation with tws calibration with discharge et and all except q and two of them are in the discharge evaluation calibration with water level and flood extent in the best modeling scenario calibration with any variable should improve the performance of all other variables however we have identified that this did not happen in our experiments this can be due to uncertainties in model structure in parameterization in the observations or the integration techniques in model calibration dembele et al 2020 previous studies have also found significant advantages in using rs based model calibration to identify structural model issues e g werth et al 2009 willem vervoort et al 2014 winsemius and savenije 2008 detect uncertainties in input data e g milzow et al 2011 identify deficiencies in model parameterization e g franks et al 1998 koppa et al 2019 and increase model reliability e g koch et al 2018 manfreda et al 2018 according to fig 4b and supplementary material fig s2 calibration with discharge improved estimates of almost all variables however calibration with discharge deteriorated the performance for vegetation et time series vegetation et estimated by mod16 varies at maximum 30 mm month mgb calibration with discharge led to maximum et variations of 100 mm month reaching around 30 mm month in the driest periods while mod16 estimates are limited to a minimum of 100 mm month in these periods time series in fig 4b however one can notice that not even the seasonality between mgb and mod16 time series agree this could be due to relatively high uncertainties in vegetation et estimates from mod16 for the amazon basin around 23 mm month according to gomis cebolla et al 2019 nonetheless it could also be related to model structural and or parameter deficiencies in which case the model might be right for the wrong reasons in order to identify the source of this et inconsistency we have compared mod16 and mgb results to in situ measurements of et in purus river basin provided by gomis cebolla et al 2019 and maeda et al 2017 we found a much stronger agreement both in seasonality and in amplitude of in situ observations with mod16 observations than with mgb model outputs hasler avissar 2007 and pan et al 2020 have already warned about the overestimation of dry season water stress in hydrological models probably related to the misrepresentation of soil water availability for plants this was also found by maeda et al 2017 which highlighted that et was not water limited because of the plants access to deep soil water which has also been previously documented by nepstad et al 1994 they found that in the southern amazon ecotone deep root water intake plays a key role in maintaining ecosystem productivity during dry season mgb model is probably misrepresenting these processes which would remain unknown if it were only compared to discharge time series even though the calibration with discharge observations was not able to accurately estimate et calibration with the remaining variables except for soil moisture was able to improve et estimates for instance in fig 3b et and water level presented low correlation r 0 08 but calibration with water level improved et estimates by s 16 9 cal period and s 25 6 eval period conversely however calibration with et was not able to improve water level estimates s 2 9 and s 1 3 for cal and eval periods respectively which suggests structural errors or uncertainty in the observations in general calibration with tws did not present much influence on any other variables in spite of some improvements skill scores were usually low consistently tws estimates were relatively easily improved by calibration with any variable except for et for cal period or discharge for eval period these results for tws contrast with previous works from lo et al 2010 nijzink et al 2018 rakovec et al 2016 schumacher et al 2018 and werth and güntner 2010 which highlighted the value of grace data when incorporated into hydrological modeling this can be due to the high seasonality of the purus river basin in which tws does not aggregate much information biasing the calibration with high correlation values even for the initial guess uncalibrated setup the tws performance was already satisfactory kge values were around 0 8 while for all other variables kge values were much lower below 0 3 for the uncalibrated setup the calibration experiments with discharge water level and flood extent improved the performances of flood extent and water level but did not largely affect et which was actually degraded with discharge calibration and soil moisture this is probably due to the tight relationship between water level and flood extent through river transport processes i e flood routing along the river floodplain system while et and soil moisture are more related to vertical hydrological processes e g vertical soil water balance for instance in the sensitivity analysis a low correlation was obtained between et and flood extent modelled time series 0 08 fig 3b a small yet positive skill score for the assessment of flood extent when calibrating with et and vice versa suggests a complementarity between variables that relate to different processes the calibration with soil moisture improves the performances of all variables water level to a lesser extent except for et consistently calibration with all variables except et are able to improve soil moisture to some extent while in the sensitivity analysis the modelled times series of soil moisture and tws presented a low correlation 0 06 fig 3b the calibration with tws was able to improve soil moisture and vice versa which suggests a complementarity between these variables 3 2 3 what is the added value of complementary rs observations by calibrating with all variables together except q fig 5 ii we found improvements for almost all variables with the most significant improvements for flood extent s 26 8 for cal period and s 24 3 for eval period and et s 17 8 for cal period and s 23 3 for eval period for discharge performance for the evaluation period was improved s 17 4 which is important for estimating discharge in poorly gauged basins however for the calibration period skill score for discharge performance was s 1 7 which might reflect some limitations in retrieving discharge based on the calibration of the rs derived variables as discussed previously therefore we chose a specific arrangement of two complementary variables in order to check if this calibration setup might lead to better retrievals for discharge and the other variables the chosen variables were water level and soil moisture because of their complementarity correlation in fig 3b of 0 27 based on the skill score values in fig 5 i calibration with water level only improves all variables but discharge and soil moisture to a lesser extent while calibration with soil moisture only improves all variables but et and water level to a lesser extent the calibration arrangement of water level and soil moisture led to improvements not only to soil moisture and water level themselves but also to all other variables et to a lesser extent for instance flood extent was improved by s 52 6 and s 34 1 cal and eval period respectively discharge was improved by s 59 9 with a resulting mean kge 0 70 for the calibration period s 45 0 and mean kge 0 35 for evaluation period these results agree with previous works that found an improvement in model performances by multi variable calibration of soil moisture and evapotranspiration e g koppa et al 2019 lópez et al 2017 discharge and evapotranspiration e g herman et al 2017 pan et al 2018 poméon et al 2018 discharge and soil moisture e g li et al 2018 rajib et al 2016 discharge and tws e g rakovec et al 2016 schumacher et al 2018 werth and güntner 2010 and discharge and water level e g kittel et al 2018 schneider et al 2017 sun et al 2012 however it is difficult to compare this study to previous works because most of them used discharge observations as constraints in this study we avoided the use of discharge observations for multi variable calibration in order to analyze the applicability of the rs based calibration method for poorly gauged regions we emphasize that the multi variable calibration against water level hydrodynamic variable and soil moisture hydrologic variable was only possible due to the model s hydrologic hydrodynamic coupling setup calibration with water level and soil moisture did not present much influence on et performance because of the specificities regarding et in this watershed i e given that the model setup does not represent deep root water intake during dry season as discussed previously by comparing the two frameworks for multi variable calibration all except q versus h w calibration we found that calibration with all variables except q is useful to some extent but consistently selecting complementary variables for model calibration resulted in best overall performance 3 3 are we getting the right results for the right sets of parameters when analyzing the dispersions of parameters before and after calibration with each variable fig 6 for a few selected parameters supplementary material fig s3 for all calibrated parameters it can be observed that the range of parameters varies largely depending on the calibration variables for instance wm is a soil conceptual parameter related to maximum water storage in the soil in the calibration based on single variables except et it converged to low values 300 mm while in the calibration with et it reached high values 2000 mm this probably occurred in order to compensate by overparameterization a structural error in the model i e the model inability to represent deep root water uptake in dry season these trade offs between model parameters during calibration has also been reported and discussed by koppa et al 2019 the surface resistance parameter associated with forest areas also resulted in a wide range of values depending on the calibration target variables when calibrated with water level flood extent or all except q experiments it reached median values higher than 150 s m but calibration with h w led to median values lower than 50 s m surface resistance is a vegetation parameter directly related to et dynamics so it is important to note that calibration with et was able to reduce the dispersion of this parameter reaching a median value of about 80 s m similar to calibration with q and w another interesting result relates to channel manning s coefficient which presented different values for each calibration experiment this agrees with previous findings about manning parameter being often used as an effective parameter that compensates for neglected hydrodynamic processes as localized channel head losses poor cross section representation or non represented 2d processes neal et al 2015 many previous studies have highlighted the use of multi variable calibration to narrow parameters search space nijzink et al 2018 w sun et al 2018 but this was not observed in our results based on the limited multi variable calibration experiments performed here all except q and h w no narrowing in parameters search space was found for most parameters except for wm calibration with all except q and h w still resulted in a wide range of parameter values this can be due to differing convergence sets of parameters between each of the triplicate runs a more robust experiment comparing more multi variable calibration strategies e g q different rs based variables might provide better understanding on this topic 3 4 spatial evaluation for model calibration we used one streamflow gauge for discharge one virtual station for water level averaged rs data for the whole basin for tws et and soil moisture and flood extent over the lower part of the basin however many recent studies investigated the potential for using rs spatially distributed information in model calibration for instance with bias insensitive metrics demirel et al 2018 zink et al 2018 dembele et al 2020 here we further analyze how the lumped calibration affected the simulated spatial patterns fig 7 for discharge water level and flood extent spatial patterns are well reproduced even when running the model with the initial parameter set because the spatial patterns of these variables are determined by intrinsic characteristics of the basin nonetheless for et the spatial patterns are completely different between the initial parameter set and the calibrated setup in this case the calibration with spatially aggregated et was able to recover the spatial representation of mod16 a similar result was found for soil moisture spatial representation by demirel et al 2019 that calibrated a model with spatially aggregated soil moisture and tws data in summary these results highlight the overall model capability to retrieve the et spatial pattern even by using a lumped calibration approach however for other variables the spatial pattern was not considerably affected by the differing model calibration strategies 4 conclusion we calibrated and evaluated a hydrologic hydrodynamic model with five different rs based observations of the water cycle water levels jason 2 flood extent alos palsar tws grace vegetation et mod16 and soil moisture smos for a study basin in a tropical region with floodplains purus river basin in the amazon and analyzed the redundancy and complementarity between different variables and processes results showed that calibration with current rs observations was able to improve discharge estimates for instance in the uncalibrated setup a priori parameter sets average performances mean kge for discharge were around kge 0 30 by calibrating the model with et from mod16 and evaluating for the same time period discharge average performance mean kge was improved to kge 0 64 representing a skill score of s 52 9 also in the calibration period a joint scheme of calibration with water level soil moisture led to discharge improvements of s 59 9 when evaluating for a different time period discharge performance was improved by calibration with water level tws and a joint scheme of all rs variables s 25 9 s 27 9 and s 17 4 respectively we conclude that rs observations are useful to predict discharge estimates however the utility of each rs variable might depend on the study area characteristics and the time period considered our results also showed that rs based calibration led to an overall improvement of the water cycle representation for instance calibration with water level was able to improve estimates of water level itself but also flood extent tws and et calibration with soil moisture was able to improve estimates of soil moisture itself but also discharge flood extent and tws we highlight the novelty and further applicability of relating the calibration and evaluation of hydrological e g soil moisture et tws and hydraulic variables e g flood extent and water level which is only possible with a tightly coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model setup moreover calibration with multiple rs variables was able to highlight deficiencies that might be related to model structure parameterization observations and data integration techniques in model calibration in the context of model structure for instance calibration with et highlighted the model inability to represent the root water intake in dry season in this region thus compensating it by misrepresenting other variables in the context of model parameterization for instance we found a wide range of different parameters by varying the calibration target variable besides individual calibration with each rs variable we conducted two multi variable calibration experiments calibration with all variables except discharge and calibration with water level and soil moisture calibration with all variables was useful to some extent but appropriately selecting complementary variables for model calibration may result in a better overall performance even though we used a lumped calibration approach results highlighted the overall model capability to retrieve et spatial pattern but not for tws and soil moisture the main conclusions presented here are of great interest for the hydrological community and agree with previous works in that rs based calibration is useful to improve the water cycle representation in hydrological models to further investigate the potentiality of rs data future developments should test the methodology presented here for multiple basins at contrasting hydro climatic regions here we assessed an amazonian equatorial basin with particular climate and land cover characteristics and an overall spatial homogeneity of rainfall runoff processes other basins with different hydroclimatic regimes could be also assessed e g in arid basins subject to long dry periods more erratic precipitation patterns and different runoff generation mechanisms than the amazon which require different model structures finally here we used one state of the art rs product for each variable but future developments should explore other missions like swot for surface water observation biancamaria et al 2016 as well as considering different products for representing each variable e g et could be estimated by gleam modis ssebop sebs alexi metric etc besides mod16 credit

4614,coastal ecosystem health and sustainability is tightly coupled to submarine groundwater discharge sgd and associated nutrient carbon and pollutant fluxes however there are few studies that systematically analyse the interaction between the terrestrial aquifer system catchment morphology and coastal sgd the objective of this study was to evaluate the role of catchment morphology and how this influences the spatial distribution timing and volume of the sgd flux to a branched tidal creek system on the barrier island spiekeroog germany the subsurface salinity was mapped using electrical resistivity tomography ert and a hydrogeochemical survey of the shallow groundwater temporal and spatial analysis of geochemical tracers radon 222 chloride in the tidal creek water was integrated into a transient 222rn mass balance model for quantification of sgd rates during two field campaigns that encompassed spring and neap tides the ert mapping indicated that fresh groundwater dominated under the dune ridges down to about 15 m depth but became progressively more brackish seawards this is likely due to frequent tidal and storm flooding of low lying areas the highest groundwater fluxes into the creek were indicated by high 222rn activities average 468 bq m 3 towards the dune ridge chloride concentrations up to 17 3 g l 1 increased seawards showing the progressive salinization of water in the creek the freshwater component of sgd was highly variable in time but was highest at low tide while the total sgd flux saline fresh was highest when tides changed from inflow to outflow as the rapid pressure release on the local aquifer caused a large hydraulic gradient towards the creek comparing the freshwater component of mean daily sgd to the creek with estimated groundwater recharge rates in the catchment 665 m3 d 1 shows that the fresh groundwater discharge exceeds fresh recharge during spring tides 120 but is was lower than recharge during neap tides 27 in this study we show that tidal creeks and their relation to catchment morphology are relevant for understanding the spatial and temporal exchange of fresh and saline water between the catchment and coastal zone keywords submarine groundwater discharge sgd radon catchment hydrology subterranean estuary freshwater lens coastal aquifer 1 introduction exchange of water and matter dissolved and particulate from terrestrial to marine systems is fundamental to hydrological and chemical cycles at the land sea interface on local to global scales burnett et al 2003 2006 cho et al 2018 moore 2010 sadat noori et al 2016 webb et al 2019 submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been identified as an important exchange mechanism between land and sea taniguchi et al 2019 thus a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental controls on sgd and associated matter fluxes is required this has proven challenging because of various complicating factors at the land sea interface such as variable density flow boufadel 2000 predictable tides robinson et al 2007 and unpredictable storms high waves nikpeyman et al 2019 boundary conditions and the heterogeneity of material properties in the subsurface houben et al 2018 especially in tidal and storm affected systems the frequent shifts between saltwater and freshwater interfaces determines the extension of freshwater lenses oberdorfer et al 1990 dynamic conditions often hamper a sharp delimitation between terrestrial fresh water and seawater that is recycled through the subterranean estuary holt et al 2017 thus sgd typically consists of different water components such as freshwater from inland areas and recirculated sea water robinson et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2002 recirculated sea water often dominates sgd water fluxes taniguchi et al 2019 robinson et al 2007 and especially storm tides have been shown to salinize shallow freshwater in the subsurface gingerich et al 2017 post and houben 2017 both salinization and freshwater recharge processes regulate the development and extension of freshwater aquifer systems in the coastal zone anderson and lauer 2008 post and houben 2017 salt marshes are located at the transition zone between terrestrial freshwater and saline water bodies and are usually characterized by vegetation adapted to the gradient in salinity wilson et al 2015a tidal creeks cut through low permeable salt marsh mud and directly connect surface waters with underlying aquifers krest et al 2000 in salt marsh areas recharge by seawater is driven by the inundation of the marsh areas wilson and morris 2012 wilson et al 2015b this groundwater may then drain into adjoining creeks and rivers peterson et al 2019 other studies have not observed a direct connection between the flooded surface area and groundwater e g byers and chmura 2014 harvey et al 1987 creeks and tidally influenced rivers may therefore not only drain the groundwater below the salt marsh but can also connect the coastal hinterland with the sea by acting as a conduit for sgd peterson et al 2010 consequently a process based understanding of tidal creeks as an interface between the ocean and terrestrial systems is important for a qualitative and quantitative understanding of nutrient and water cycling between these systems system characteristics such as surface topography spatially non uniform freshwater recharge and aquifer heterogeneity contribute to the complexity of sgd cheng and ouazar 2004 post et al 2013 conceptual and physically based models with reduced system complexity can be used to identify primary controls influencing sgd both numerical greskowiak 2014 holt et al 2019 houben et al 2018 röper et al 2014b and physical analogue models shi et al 2011 stoeckl and houben 2012 have provided valuable information on the dominant controls on land sea interactions compared to coastal areas with large and often complex landward catchments the conditions on islands including barrier islands are often much simpler this is due to the well defined boundary conditions surrounded by the ocean and often a less heterogeneous and complex aquifer system anderson and lauer 2008 thus islands constitute useful conditions for understanding sgd processes and the morphological drivers that influence the exchange of water and solutes in coastal areas various studies have investigated sgd qualitatively and quantitatively using methods such as heat as a tracer röper et al 2014a isotopes cho et al 2019 geochemical tracers hussain et al 1999 stieglitz et al 2010 taniguchi et al 2002 geophysical johnson et al 2015 o connell et al 2018 and hydraulic methods such as head gradient observations and seepage meters in this study our primary objective was to evaluate the role of catchment morphology dunes salt marsh and tidal creek system in influencing the spatial distribution timing and volume of sgd fluxes we also aimed to understand the contribution of the tidal creek to the water balance of the coastal aquifer of spiekeroog we applied the geochemical tracers radon 222rn and chloride cl in combination with a spatially lumped but dynamic 222rn mass balance model the barrier island spiekeroog germany located in the north sea is a useful experimental field site for sgd studies as the formation and development of the local aquifer system is well studied e g holt et al 2017 2019 röper et al 2012 2 sampling site spiekeroog has a maximum east west extension of 9 8 km and a maximum width of 2 3 km the average annual precipitation from 1984 to 2011 for spiekeroog was 808 mm oowv 2012 the mean tidal range is 2 7 m mesotidal with annual means from 1995 to 2015 of 1 4 m mean high water mhw asl and 1 3 m bsl mean low water mlw holt et al 2017 the freshwater lens below the main dune arc in the western part of spiekeroog has been subject to prior investigations and is used for the island s public water supply röper et al 2012 tronicke et al 1999 in contrast the freshwater lens in the geologically younger eastern part of the island ostplate is still under development holt et al 2019 röper et al 2013 the ostplate is characterized by one main dune arc and a high permeable sandy aquifer combined with nearly no surface run off in the dunes enhancing groundwater recharge 300 400 mm a 1 röper et al 2012 the salt marsh south of the dune arc consists of clay and silt with a low hydraulic permeability holt et al 2019 and references therein thus precipitation in the salt marsh area likely only provides a limited contribution to fresh groundwater recharge holt et al 2017 a relation between vegetation zones and groundwater salinities was recently demonstrated for the ostplate where the dominant vegetation serves as a good indicator of the groundwater salinity holt et al 2017 biogeochemical processes that control the groundwater quality were recently described by seibert et al 2019 the eastern end of the ostplate is drained by a branched tidal creek fig 1 which extends from the wadden sea to the upper salt marsh areas holt et al 2017 and references therein in total the branched tidal creek network covers an area of around 1 km2 fig 1 it consists of one main channel draining in a south east direction into the wadden sea and numerous smaller branches with varying widths and depths the main stem is about 1 km in length has a maximum width of 10 m and maximum depth of roughly 0 8 m during low tide these tidal creeks cut through the mudflat to a depth up to 1 5 m and expose up to 30 cm of salt marsh mud clay layer on top of the sandy subsurface sediments 3 materials and methods 3 1 222rn and electrical conductivity monitoring field surveys took place between february 20 26 and march 14 20 2016 222rn electrical conductivity ec water level and wind velocity were measured close to the tidal creek mouth fig 1 222rn is a sensitive tracer for sdg due to the large contrast in activities between the groundwater and surface water this contrast is maintained by 222rn loss by radioactive decay t1 2 3 8 d and degassing to the atmosphere from surface water taniguchi et al 2019 222rn has been used in numerous studies for quantifying sgd in coastal and estuarine environments e g burnett et al 2006 burnett and dulaiova 2003 sadat noori et al 2018 stewart et al 2015 wong et al 2013 ec measurements are a simple but useful way to delineate between recycled sea water and fresh water short et al 2015 sea water measured close to the spiekeroog harbour has an ec of 50 ms cm 1 röper et al 2012 while fresh water under the dunes has a maximum value of 0 1 ms cm 1 for comparability all ec measurements were converted to equivalent chloride concentrations by correlating measured cl and ec spatial mapping data or to salinity based on the method described in stuyfzand 1993 222rn activities were measured continuously using 10 min intervals using a radon in air detector rad7 durridge co coupled to a 10 m gas permeable membrane accurel type pp v8 2 hf membrana the setup is similar to those described in schubert et al 2008 and used by santos et al 2011 the membrane was wrapped around a pvc tube 20 cm diameter containing holes diameter 1 cm to ensure maximum contact between the membrane and creek water the membrane was installed in the water column directly above the tidal creek bed and about 2 m away from the bank a level logger solinst inc was installed next to the membrane which recorded the water level in 5 min intervals data from the level logger was atmospherically compensated using a barometric logger barologger solinst inc attached to the rad7 box the rad7 detector was located on a small island in the tidal creek and was elevated 50 cm above the ground to reduce the likelihood of flooding during high tide fig 1 the 222rn distribution between water and air phases at equilibrium depends on water temperature and salinity the approach introduced by meyer and schweidel 1916 with a correction for salinity by schubert et al 2012 was used to calculate the 222rn in water activities from the detected 222rn in air activities wind velocities were measured 1 25 m above the land surface 5 min intervals using an anemometer with an integrated data logger at the same location for the second survey in march wind data was obtained from the deutscher wetterdienst due to problems with the data logger ec was logged at 10 min intervals cond 3310 wtw gmbh germany close to the 222rn measurement site using a floating polystyrene platform 3 2 222rn mass balance modelling quantification of dynamic sgd fluxes were calculated using a 222rn mass balance approach similar to the model described in gilfedder et al 2015 which was used for wetlands and based on continuous 222rn measurements the mass balance model inversely estimates the sgd fluxes by accounting for the wind induced 222rn losses to the atmosphere as well as the temporal variations in the flooded area of the catchment the 222rn mass balance can be written as 1 d c rn d t h a c rn

the wadden sea during ebb tide for every time step the flooded area a of the catchment and associated ponded water volume was estimated based on the elevation of the catchment using lidar derived dem and the measured water level at sampling site 1 based on that qflood and qebb were determined under application of the tidal prism approach dyer and taylor 1973 luketina 1998 peterson et al 2010 this approach assumes a uniform water level for the entire catchment area and has been used previously for mangrove systems with similar morphological characteristics gleeson et al 2013 determination of the gas transfer velocity krn for 222rn was derived from the wind velocity by applying the empirical equation of macintyre et al 1995 eqs 2 and 3 this is likely to be an underestimate of the real gas exchange fluxes as degassing induced by turbulent flow conditions in the tidal creek is neglected the original degassing equation proposed by macintyre et al 1995 was developed for degassing of co2 scaling k from co2 to 222rn was done using the schmidt number sc ratio and a roughness factor n that accounts for either a smooth or wavy water surface eq 2 the schmidt number for any gas is the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the mass diffusivity in our case we scaled between k600 for co2 sc 600 for co2 at 20 c as in macintyre et al 1995 to krn by accounting for the effects of water temperature tidal creek on the viscosity and diffusivity parameters a corresponding n value of 0 5 was used representing a wavy water surface at wind speeds 2 m s 1 the wind velocity u10 at 10 m

solved numerically euler method and run as a forward model calculating 222rn activities at each time step of the measurement period the modelled 222rn was fitted to the measured data by optimising the sgd flux to the tidal creek at each time step this is fundamentally different from previous approaches where the mass balance equation is solved explicitly for the sgd fluxes based on measured changes of 222rn activities in time i e δ222rn δt and then adding or subtracting radon source and sink terms burnett et al 2003 we have found that the previous method often results in physically implausible negative groundwater fluxes due to noise in the 222rn measurements previously these errors have been reduced by e g applying smoothing algorithms to the raw data but with an associated loss of temporal resolution burnett and dulaiova 2003 in some cases negative values have simply been explained by mixing processes between coastal and offshore water with lower 222rn concentrations which may or may not be the case dulaiova et al 2006 the optimization method optimization algorithm fsolve matlab described above has the benefit that 1 it is less sensitive to noise in measurements 2 it clearly can be seen when the model cannot fit measured data and thus model assumptions are violated 3 it does not produce negative groundwater fluxes and 4 there is no need to reduce the measurement resolution or applying smoothing algorithms the disadvantage of this method is the often long simulations times to find the best fit scenario which can range from a few hours to a few days depending on the length of the dataset a similar approach was applied by gilfedder et al 2015 to quantify groundwater discharge to a wetland lake system and by dimova and burnett 2011 for groundwater discharge to a small lake a temporal offset of 20 min for measured 222rn data was used to compensate for the temporal delay to reach equilibrium between 222rn in the water and air phase and the formation of the actual measured 218po on the rad 7 detector stieglitz et al 2010 the freshwater component of sgd was calculated based on the cl concentrations of each sample using a binary mixing model in a similar approach to salem et al 2016 the cl ion is assumed to be conservative during the mixing process between freshwater and saline sea water end member concentrations for the freshwater were assumed to be represented by the samples extracted from under the dunes 0 g l 1 and the sea water end member cl concentrations in the wadden sea 16 5 g l 1 3 3 spatial mapping in the tidal creek water samples from the tidal creek were taken for 222rn ec and cl analysis 222rn was sampled in 1 l plastic bottles that were filled without headspace from about 5 cm below the water surface sample analysis were conducted within a few hours in the island laboratory using a rad7 durridge company co radon detector large dome large detector version applying the h2o accessory lee and kim 2006 the samples were degassed in a closed loop for five minutes and 222rn decay counts were integrated for one hour each sample was counted at least three times with a total measurement time of up to six hours results were adjusted for the decay between time of sampling and time of measurement the 222rn and chemical sampling took place in the time frame between 2 h before and after low tide due to regulations limiting access to the national park during high tide distance between sampling locations along the creek were 10 30 m and were selected based on the dominant flow conditions stagnant water pools and turbulent reaches of the tidal creek system were avoided ec and temperature was measured directly in the field using a hand held ec meter cond 3310 wtw gmbh germany with an automated temperature correction to 25 c cl concentration was measured after filtration 0 45 µm filter in the laboratory of the limnological research station university of bayreuth 3 4 geoelectrical resistivity surveying and shallow groundwater sampling an electrical resistivity tomography ert survey 16th of march 2016 and shallow groundwater sampling 18th of march 2016 was performed to determine the spatial extension of the freshwater lens and salinity of the local aquifer below the ostplate the ert transect extended from the dunes to shortly before the start of the tidal creek fig 1 in the nw se direction the ert transect passed through dunes and upper and lower salt marsh vegetation according to the classification of holt et al 2017 fig 1 the ert estimates the electrical resistivity in the subsurface for 2d profiles which can be used to derive the spatial transition of groundwater salinity salem et al 2016 the total length of the ert transect was 375 m and consisted of two profiles each using 50 stainless steel electrodes with an electrode spacing of 4 m 4point light 10w lgm lippmann the electrode array configurations included wenner and dipole dipole arrays the subsurface electrical resistivity values were found by inverting the measured apparent resistivity data using res2dinv software geotomo software 2010 with a least squares inversion algorithm shallow groundwater sampling was conducted along the geoelectrical profile at 55 m 85 m 132 m 192 m 275 m 321 m and 355 m starting from the northern dunes end of the transect labelled 1 7 respectively fig 7 for sampling a stainless steel piezometer diameter of 2 cm with a 10 cm screen was hammered 1 5 m into the ground samples were obtained using a 50 ml syringe and 1 5 m silicone tubing after first purging the piezometer with the syringe and the tubing the ec was measured directly in the field 4 results 4 1 temporal dynamics of radon salinity and groundwater discharge to the tidal creek during spring tide february 20 26 2016 222rn activities ranged from 0 to 315 bq m 3 fig 2 a activities were highest during low tide fig 2 b but rapidly decreased with increasing tidal stage for the second survey neap tide 222rn activities were not as clearly influenced by the tidal fluctuations with little variations in 222rn activities during the four day measurement period fig 3 a b 222rn activities during neap tide were also significantly lower than during spring tide t test p 0 05 ranging from 0 to 155 bq m 3 simulated and measured 222rn activities during both surveys showed a very good fit r2 0 999 to measured data the highest modelled sgd flux up to 84030 m3 d 1 1 2 m d 1 for the first survey fig 2 d and 3125 m3 d 1 0 7 m d 1 for the second survey fig 3 d did not correspond to the highest 222rn activities at low tide but were observed when tides change from inflow to outflow conditions fig 2 d e fig 3 d e the highest proportion of freshwater in the creek up to 25 was observed during low tide and the lowest up to 6 for high tide figs 4 and 5 4 2 spatial mapping of the tidal creek measured 222rn activities in the tidal creek were highest close to the dunes mean 468 36 bq m 3 and decreased to below 100 bq m 3 close to the mouth of the creek fig 6 222rn activities do not only decrease depending on the distance to the sea north south direction but also decreased away from the main dune arc east west direction the lowest 222rn activities 17 bq m 3 were measured for the most western location of the creek cl concentrations increased during both surveys from the dunes towards the sea ranging from 9 5 g l 1 to 17 3 g l 1 for the second survey 4 3 ert profile and groundwater sampling high electrical resistivity values of 160 400 ωm indicating high freshwater proportions 0 8 g l 1 were measured at the north western part of the ert transect close to the main dune arc fig 1 according to the ert results the freshwater lens extended over a total distance of 130 m towards the tidal creek fig 7 ert results are closely correlated to the salinity measurements for shallow groundwater where low salinities correspond to high electrical resistivity values electrical resistivity values along the ert transect in general decreased towards the sea for the salt marsh while salinities increased gradually between 100 and 4 ωm salinity 11 2 g l 1 5 discussion 5 1 temporal dynamics of sgd according to continuous 222rn and cl data sgd and fresh sgd fluxes are highly variable in time 222rn activities were highest during low tide and rapidly decrease with increasing tidal stage figs 2 and 3 previous studies have shown that tidal pumping is the primary driving process for sgd during low tide conditions and is predominantly composed of sea water recycled through the coastal sediments tidal pumping is driven by reversal of hydraulic gradients during tidal cycles and describes the infiltration of seawater into intertidal sediments during high tide and exfiltration during low tide gleeson et al 2013 li et al 2009 robinson et al 2007 urish and mckenna 2004 the high tide sea water reverses the hydraulic gradient towards the aquifer and so restricts groundwater exfiltration and the absence of a sgd flux during high tide this sgd process seems also plausible for the tidal creek system on the ostplate fig 8 the highest modelled sgd flux up to 1 2 m d 1 for the first and 0 7 m d 1 for the second campaign are very high compared to previous studies e g burnett et al 2008 crusius et al 2005 nikpeyman et al 2019 however average sgd rates of 0 22 m d 1 and 0 13 m d 1 for the first and second survey respectively are comparable to previous investigations quantifying sgd in the western part of the island as well as other coastal systems in general taniguchi et al 2002 burnett et al 2008 santos et al 2015 for example santos et al 2015 estimated a tidally averaged sgd flux of 0 12 m d 1 for west spiekeroog calculations suggest the peak fluxes in sgd only occur over a short period of 2 h when tides change from inflow to outflow conditions fig 2 d 3 d this can be explained by the large pressure release on the aquifer as water rapidly drains from the creek this process is amplified by the extreme tidal range 2 72 m for spiekeroog holt et al 2017 which is distinctive for the wadden sea marencic 2009 this peak fluxes in sgd when tides change from inflow to outflow conditions have only seldomly been observed previously as the volume of the water in the coastal zone e g water in the catchment of the tidal creek is usually assumed to be constant in mesotidal creeks in the wadden sea the assumption of a constant volume is unreasonable due to the large change in the tidal amplitude and associated flooded area δa 0 53 km2 this is similar to the results of peterson et al 2019 where they observed high groundwater inputs during early to mid ebb tide for a tidal creek with a large tidal amplitude average 2 4 m high groundwater inputs were attributed to the increased hydraulic gradient by sea water flooding the marsh in addition peterson et al 2019 found a relation between the inundation of salt marsh and groundwater input into the creek no differentiation between fresh or recirculated water wilson and morris 2012 also demonstrated that the volume of groundwater flushing is increased when salt marsh areas get inundated the groundwater discharge to the tidal creek may be enhanced compared to silty areas in the catchment because creeks cut through the low permeable surface marsh mud krest et al 2000 and thus expose the highly permeable sandy aquifer on a small scale 10 cm a similar role has been reported for bioturbation due to crab burrows in mangrove systems where preferential groundwater exchange was enhanced by the direct hydrological connection to high permeable sand layers gleeson et al 2013 stieglitz et al 2013 the concept is transferable to tidal creeks due to similar settings where the sandy creek bed forms a conductive conduit between the shallow groundwater and the coastal surface water harvey and odum 1990 suggest that groundwater from sandy aquifers that are topped with salt marsh mud may be directly discharged into creeks through preferential flow paths modelling results of xin et al 2012 come to a similar conclusion and show that elastic storage release mechanisms related to soil compressibility are linked to a change in variations in storage of the aquifer the highest proportion of freshwater in the creek up to 25 was observed during low tide figs 4 and 5 the small amount of freshwater 6 during high tide was attributed to inflowing sea water and water from the last low tide re entering the creek this shows that despite the highest proportion of freshwater and the highest 222rn activities being observed during low tide the highest sgd fluxes do not necessarily occur at the same time 5 2 relation between sgd and groundwater recharge spatial measurements of cl and 222rn allowed the identification of the groundwater origin that contributes to the sgd flux in the creek figs 2 and 3 low 222rn activities measured in the tidal creek towards the sea 200 bq m 3 could either be explained by 222rn decay and degassing during transport or by dilution with sea water fig 6 a c a differentiation between recirculated water and saline sea water from 222rn data alone is not possible as the accumulation of 222rn in subsurface waters is independent of water origin and chemistry peterson et al 2019 higher cl concentrations at seaward sampling sites fig 6 b d demonstrate a clear influence of recirculated sea water the fast tidal dynamics 0 52 days from low to high tide compared to the 222rn enrichment in the subsurface 23 days until equilibrium concentrations are reached thus suggests that dilution is the dominant factor for low 222rn activities in the creek close to the sea however cl concentration of 13 5 g l 1 at the most seaward sampling location during spring tide do not reach the endmember concentration of the wadden sea and the freshwater fraction can still be as high as 18 at this sampling location this means that either 1 there is a sgd flux beyond the end of the tidal creek directly into the sea or 2 that fresh groundwater entering the creek during low tide remains in the coastal zone close to the end of the creek and flows back into the creek during the next high tide we favour the second option as the 222rn activities in the inflowing tide are also higher than would be expected for the wadden sea under these conditions small proportion of creek water flows back into the creek system during high tide similar to what has been described by crusius et al 2005 close to the dune arc high 222rn activities in the tidal creek indicate a higher sgd flux and proportion of groundwater burnett et al 2003 hussain et al 1999 nikpeyman et al 2019 swarzenski 2007 this could be due to a shorter distance to the dunes as the main groundwater recharge area in addition the hydraulic gradient arising from the elevation of the dunes is higher beukeboom 1976 according to holt et al 2017 2019 and röper et al 2013 there is one major freshwater lens below the dune ridge at the eastern part of the ostplate and the eastern branches of the tidal creek are closer to this freshwater lens than the more westerly branches fig 1 fig 9 higher 222rn activities at the eastern part of the tidal creek compared to values at the western parts therefore can be explained by higher fractions of groundwater originating from the nearby freshwater lens below the dune arc to the east fig 9 this indicates that the water in the creek reflects the distance to the underlying freshwater lens under the dune ridges and suggests that discharge into the tidal creek is directly coupled to the main groundwater recharge area and so coupled directly to the dune morphology of the catchment 5 3 connection of the creek catchment to the hinterland the ert imaging in combination with results from shallow groundwater sampling showed a dominant freshwater component in the aquifer close to the main recharge area under the dunes fig 7 this is in agreement with previous shallow groundwater investigations presented in holt et al 2017 ert imaging results indicate a higher vertical extension of the freshwater lens 10 15 m than previously reported for the ostplate röper et al 2013 recent salinity measurements for shallow groundwater showed a vertical extension of 4 5 m for the freshwater lens holt et al 2017 2019 however this study was conducted at the western part of the ostplate and results may not be transferable to the eastern part holt et al 2017 röper et al 2013 the observed gradual increase in the salinity represents an extended transition zone between fresh and saltwater the dominance of brackish water rather than a sharp interface between fresh and saltwater as seen in other coastal areas is likely due to large tides and winter storms flooding the high proportion of saltwater in the brackish groundwater can also be attributed to the still developing freshwater lens below the ostplate röper et al 2013 the origin of the freshwater component in the brackish groundwater below the salt marsh could be rainfall that is preferentially infiltrating e g via bioturbation moffett et al 2012 stieglitz et al 2013 xin et al 2012 xiao et al 2019 however this process on the catchment scale is assumed to be of minor relevance for the freshwater fraction in the subterranean estuary moffett et al 2012 consequently freshwater recharge for the salt marsh area is low wiederhold et al 2015 due to the low permeability salt marsh clay pollmann 2019 this suggests that most of the freshwater in the brackish groundwater is originated from the local freshwater lens below the dune arc as freshwater recharge mainly occurs for the dune area the morphological setting and terrestrial backdrop of the catchment induced by either the distance to dune recharge area or low topography are pivotal in addition to the age of the groundwater system in controllingling the salinity of the aquifer system 5 4 catchment mass balance and development of the freshwater lens differences in simulated groundwater fluxes for the sampling campaigns figs 2 and 3 result from the lower tidal amplitudes during neap tide second campaign compared to spring tide conditions first campaign kim and hwang 2002 li et al 1999 urish and mckenna 2004 comparison of fresh water recharge rates and fresh water sgd fluxes during neap and spring tides allow an assessment of the tidal creek s role for the catchment s water balance for estimation of the freshwater recharge we used the simulation results from a recently developed model of the freshwater lens underneath the ostplate holt et al 2019 this model suggested that recharge was 344 mm of which 69 is freshwater in the upper saltmarsh and 197 mm 41 freshwater for the lower saltmarsh freshwater recharge is assumed to occur evenly distributed over the whole active area upper salt marsh 0 76 km2 lower salt marsh 0 78 km2 recharge in the dune area grey dunes was assumed to drain to the northern beach rather than into the study catchment due to the location of the water divide south of the dunes holt et al 2019 given these assumptions we calculate a freshwater recharge of 665 m3 d 1 for the creek catchment discharge was assumed to only occur into the tidal creek 0 023 km2 due to the direct exposure of the sandy aquifer in the creek bed extrapolating the modelled sgd rate of 0 22 m d 1 from the spring tide measurements and a mean sgd freshwater proportion of 16 fig 4 leads to a daily freshwater volume flux of 810 m3 leaving the aquifer this shows that 120 of freshwater recharge drains into the creek during spring tide for neap tide a mean sgd rate of 0 13 m d 1 and a freshwater proportion of 6 fig 5 leads to a daily freshwater volume flux of 179 m3 that exits the aquifer via the creek corresponding to only 27 of fresh water recharge table 1 this suggests that a substantial proportion of recharge may contribute to the growth of the freshwater lens at low tidal magnitudes these simple calculations show that the fresh water balance is highly sensitive to the active recharge area and the temporal variability in fresh sgd even if spring and neap tides are only representative for the maximum and minimum flux values that occur rarely throughout the year calculations show that there exists a draining capacity of tidal creeks which should not be underestimated especially for highly vulnerable coastal aquifers 6 conclusions this study demonstrates that tidal creeks are important connectors between areas of groundwater recharge and discharge to the sea the enhanced hydraulic conductivity of the creek sediment as well as pressure loading effects due to periodic inundation of the salt marsh area is likely to be responsible for the groundwater flux into the tidal creek on the catchment scale also the distance to the dunes as groundwater recharge plays a crucial role in that context tidal creeks act as a conduit for the freshwater originating from the freshwater lens and in this way increase the freshwater component in the creek system in contrast tides and storms lead to salinization of the subterranean estuary below the tidal creek and salt marsh comparing fresh groundwater recharge with the fresh sgd into the creek during spring tide and neap tide as regularly occurring maximal and minimal fluxes throughout the year demonstrates that a large proportion of freshwater recharging the lens drains into the wadden sea during high tidal magnitudes during neap tide a significant amount of freshwater though remains in the aquifer the comparison of these two extreme tidal situations demonstrates that tidal cycles in creeks have a strong impact on the freshwater extension at barrier islands and thus influence the freshwater occurrence in these sensitive systems credit authorship contribution statement clarissa glaser conceptualization investigation writing original draft sven

4614,coastal ecosystem health and sustainability is tightly coupled to submarine groundwater discharge sgd and associated nutrient carbon and pollutant fluxes however there are few studies that systematically analyse the interaction between the terrestrial aquifer system catchment morphology and coastal sgd the objective of this study was to evaluate the role of catchment morphology and how this influences the spatial distribution timing and volume of the sgd flux to a branched tidal creek system on the barrier island spiekeroog germany the subsurface salinity was mapped using electrical resistivity tomography ert and a hydrogeochemical survey of the shallow groundwater temporal and spatial analysis of geochemical tracers radon 222 chloride in the tidal creek water was integrated into a transient 222rn mass balance model for quantification of sgd rates during two field campaigns that encompassed spring and neap tides the ert mapping indicated that fresh groundwater dominated under the dune ridges down to about 15 m depth but became progressively more brackish seawards this is likely due to frequent tidal and storm flooding of low lying areas the highest groundwater fluxes into the creek were indicated by high 222rn activities average 468 bq m 3 towards the dune ridge chloride concentrations up to 17 3 g l 1 increased seawards showing the progressive salinization of water in the creek the freshwater component of sgd was highly variable in time but was highest at low tide while the total sgd flux saline fresh was highest when tides changed from inflow to outflow as the rapid pressure release on the local aquifer caused a large hydraulic gradient towards the creek comparing the freshwater component of mean daily sgd to the creek with estimated groundwater recharge rates in the catchment 665 m3 d 1 shows that the fresh groundwater discharge exceeds fresh recharge during spring tides 120 but is was lower than recharge during neap tides 27 in this study we show that tidal creeks and their relation to catchment morphology are relevant for understanding the spatial and temporal exchange of fresh and saline water between the catchment and coastal zone keywords submarine groundwater discharge sgd radon catchment hydrology subterranean estuary freshwater lens coastal aquifer 1 introduction exchange of water and matter dissolved and particulate from terrestrial to marine systems is fundamental to hydrological and chemical cycles at the land sea interface on local to global scales burnett et al 2003 2006 cho et al 2018 moore 2010 sadat noori et al 2016 webb et al 2019 submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been identified as an important exchange mechanism between land and sea taniguchi et al 2019 thus a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental controls on sgd and associated matter fluxes is required this has proven challenging because of various complicating factors at the land sea interface such as variable density flow boufadel 2000 predictable tides robinson et al 2007 and unpredictable storms high waves nikpeyman et al 2019 boundary conditions and the heterogeneity of material properties in the subsurface houben et al 2018 especially in tidal and storm affected systems the frequent shifts between saltwater and freshwater interfaces determines the extension of freshwater lenses oberdorfer et al 1990 dynamic conditions often hamper a sharp delimitation between terrestrial fresh water and seawater that is recycled through the subterranean estuary holt et al 2017 thus sgd typically consists of different water components such as freshwater from inland areas and recirculated sea water robinson et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2002 recirculated sea water often dominates sgd water fluxes taniguchi et al 2019 robinson et al 2007 and especially storm tides have been shown to salinize shallow freshwater in the subsurface gingerich et al 2017 post and houben 2017 both salinization and freshwater recharge processes regulate the development and extension of freshwater aquifer systems in the coastal zone anderson and lauer 2008 post and houben 2017 salt marshes are located at the transition zone between terrestrial freshwater and saline water bodies and are usually characterized by vegetation adapted to the gradient in salinity wilson et al 2015a tidal creeks cut through low permeable salt marsh mud and directly connect surface waters with underlying aquifers krest et al 2000 in salt marsh areas recharge by seawater is driven by the inundation of the marsh areas wilson and morris 2012 wilson et al 2015b this groundwater may then drain into adjoining creeks and rivers peterson et al 2019 other studies have not observed a direct connection between the flooded surface area and groundwater e g byers and chmura 2014 harvey et al 1987 creeks and tidally influenced rivers may therefore not only drain the groundwater below the salt marsh but can also connect the coastal hinterland with the sea by acting as a conduit for sgd peterson et al 2010 consequently a process based understanding of tidal creeks as an interface between the ocean and terrestrial systems is important for a qualitative and quantitative understanding of nutrient and water cycling between these systems system characteristics such as surface topography spatially non uniform freshwater recharge and aquifer heterogeneity contribute to the complexity of sgd cheng and ouazar 2004 post et al 2013 conceptual and physically based models with reduced system complexity can be used to identify primary controls influencing sgd both numerical greskowiak 2014 holt et al 2019 houben et al 2018 röper et al 2014b and physical analogue models shi et al 2011 stoeckl and houben 2012 have provided valuable information on the dominant controls on land sea interactions compared to coastal areas with large and often complex landward catchments the conditions on islands including barrier islands are often much simpler this is due to the well defined boundary conditions surrounded by the ocean and often a less heterogeneous and complex aquifer system anderson and lauer 2008 thus islands constitute useful conditions for understanding sgd processes and the morphological drivers that influence the exchange of water and solutes in coastal areas various studies have investigated sgd qualitatively and quantitatively using methods such as heat as a tracer röper et al 2014a isotopes cho et al 2019 geochemical tracers hussain et al 1999 stieglitz et al 2010 taniguchi et al 2002 geophysical johnson et al 2015 o connell et al 2018 and hydraulic methods such as head gradient observations and seepage meters in this study our primary objective was to evaluate the role of catchment morphology dunes salt marsh and tidal creek system in influencing the spatial distribution timing and volume of sgd fluxes we also aimed to understand the contribution of the tidal creek to the water balance of the coastal aquifer of spiekeroog we applied the geochemical tracers radon 222rn and chloride cl in combination with a spatially lumped but dynamic 222rn mass balance model the barrier island spiekeroog germany located in the north sea is a useful experimental field site for sgd studies as the formation and development of the local aquifer system is well studied e g holt et al 2017 2019 röper et al 2012 2 sampling site spiekeroog has a maximum east west extension of 9 8 km and a maximum width of 2 3 km the average annual precipitation from 1984 to 2011 for spiekeroog was 808 mm oowv 2012 the mean tidal range is 2 7

spiekeroog has been subject to prior investigations and is used for the island s public water supply röper et al 2012 tronicke et al 1999 in contrast the freshwater lens in the geologically younger eastern part of the island ostplate is still under development holt et al 2019 röper et al 2013 the ostplate is characterized by one main dune arc and a high permeable sandy aquifer combined with nearly no surface run off in the dunes enhancing groundwater recharge 300 400 mm a 1 röper et al 2012 the salt marsh south of the dune arc consists of clay and silt with a low hydraulic permeability holt et al 2019 and references therein thus precipitation in the salt marsh area likely only provides a limited contribution to fresh groundwater recharge holt et al 2017 a relation between vegetation zones and groundwater salinities was recently demonstrated for the ostplate where the dominant vegetation serves as a good indicator of the groundwater salinity holt et al 2017 biogeochemical processes that control the groundwater quality were recently described by seibert et al 2019 the eastern end of the ostplate is drained by a branched tidal creek fig 1 which extends from the wadden sea to the upper salt marsh areas holt et al 2017 and references therein in total the branched tidal creek network covers an area of around 1 km2 fig 1 it consists of one main channel draining in a south east direction into the wadden sea and numerous smaller branches with varying widths and depths the main stem is about 1 km in length has a maximum width of 10 m and maximum depth of roughly 0 8 m during low tide these tidal creeks cut through the mudflat to a depth up to 1 5 m and expose up to 30 cm of salt marsh mud clay layer on top of the sandy subsurface sediments 3 materials and methods

to the tidal creek mouth fig 1 222rn is a sensitive tracer for sdg due to the large contrast in activities between the groundwater and surface water this contrast is maintained by 222rn loss by radioactive decay t1 2 3 8 d and degassing to the atmosphere from surface water taniguchi et al 2019 222rn has been used in numerous studies for quantifying sgd in coastal and estuarine environments e g burnett et al 2006 burnett and dulaiova 2003 sadat noori et al 2018 stewart et al 2015 wong et al 2013 ec measurements are a simple but useful way to delineate between recycled sea water and fresh water short et al 2015 sea water measured close to the spiekeroog harbour has an ec of 50 ms cm 1 röper et al 2012 while fresh water under the dunes has a maximum value of 0 1 ms cm 1 for comparability all ec measurements were converted to equivalent chloride concentrations by correlating measured cl and ec spatial mapping data or to salinity based on the method described in stuyfzand 1993 222rn activities were measured continuously using 10 min intervals using a radon in air detector rad7 durridge co coupled to a 10 m gas permeable membrane accurel type pp v8 2 hf membrana the setup is similar to those described in schubert et al 2008 and used by santos et al 2011 the membrane was wrapped around a pvc tube 20 cm diameter containing holes diameter 1 cm to ensure maximum contact between the membrane and creek water the membrane was installed in the water column directly above the tidal creek bed and about 2 m away from the bank a level logger solinst inc was installed next to the membrane which recorded the water level in 5 min intervals data from the level logger was atmospherically compensated using a barometric logger barologger solinst inc attached to the rad7 box the rad7 detector was located on a small island in the tidal creek and was elevated 50 cm above the ground to reduce the likelihood of flooding during high tide fig 1 the 222rn distribution between water and air phases at equilibrium depends on water temperature and salinity the approach introduced by meyer and schweidel 1916 with a correction for salinity by schubert et al 2012 was used to calculate the 222rn in water activities from the detected 222rn in air activities wind velocities were measured 1 25 m above the land surface 5 min intervals using an anemometer with an integrated data logger at the same location for the second survey in march wind data was obtained from the deutscher wetterdienst due to problems with the data logger ec was logged at 10 min intervals cond 3310 wtw gmbh germany close to the 222rn measurement site using a floating polystyrene platform 3 2 222rn mass balance modelling quantification of dynamic sgd fluxes were calculated using a 222rn mass balance approach similar to the model described in gilfedder et al 2015 which was used for wetlands and based on continuous 222rn measurements the mass balance model inversely estimates the sgd fluxes by accounting for the wind induced 222rn losses to the atmosphere as well as the temporal variations in the flooded area of the catchment the 222rn mass balance can be written as 1 d c rn d t h a c rn

the wadden sea during ebb tide for every time step the flooded area a of the catchment and associated ponded water volume was estimated based on the elevation of the catchment using lidar derived dem and the measured water level at sampling site 1 based on that qflood and qebb were determined under application of the tidal prism approach dyer and taylor 1973 luketina 1998 peterson et al 2010 this approach assumes a uniform water level for the entire catchment area and has been used previously for mangrove systems with similar morphological characteristics gleeson et al 2013 determination of the gas transfer velocity krn for 222rn was derived from the wind velocity by applying the empirical equation of macintyre et al 1995 eqs 2 and 3 this is likely to be an underestimate of the real gas exchange fluxes as degassing induced by turbulent flow conditions in the tidal creek is neglected the original degassing equation proposed by macintyre et al 1995 was developed for degassing of co2 scaling k from co2 to 222rn was done using the schmidt number sc ratio and a roughness factor n that accounts for either a smooth or wavy water surface eq 2 the schmidt number for any gas is the ratio of the kinematic viscosity to the mass diffusivity in our case we scaled between k600 for co2 sc 600 for co2 at 20 c as in macintyre et al 1995 to krn by accounting for the effects of water temperature tidal creek on the viscosity and diffusivity parameters a corresponding n value of 0 5 was used representing a wavy water surface at wind speeds 2 m s 1 the wind velocity u10 at 10 m

solved numerically euler method and run as a forward model calculating 222rn activities at each time step of the measurement period the modelled 222rn was fitted to the measured data by optimising the sgd flux to the tidal creek at each time step this is fundamentally different from previous approaches where the mass balance equation is solved explicitly for the sgd fluxes based on measured changes of 222rn activities in time i e δ222rn δt and then adding or subtracting radon source and sink terms burnett et al 2003 we have found that the previous method often results in physically implausible negative groundwater fluxes due to noise in the 222rn measurements previously these errors have been reduced by e g applying smoothing algorithms to the raw data but with an associated loss of temporal resolution burnett and dulaiova 2003 in some cases negative values have simply been explained by mixing processes between coastal and offshore water with lower 222rn concentrations which may or may not be the case dulaiova et al 2006 the optimization method optimization algorithm fsolve matlab described above has the benefit that 1 it is less sensitive to noise in measurements 2 it clearly can be seen when the model cannot fit measured data and thus model assumptions are violated 3 it does not produce negative groundwater fluxes and 4 there is no need to reduce the measurement resolution or applying smoothing algorithms the disadvantage of this method is the often long simulations times to find the best fit scenario which can range from a few hours to a few days depending on the length of the dataset a similar approach was applied by gilfedder et al 2015 to quantify groundwater discharge to a wetland lake system and by dimova and burnett 2011 for groundwater discharge to a small lake a temporal offset of 20 min for measured 222rn data was used to compensate for the temporal delay to reach equilibrium between 222rn in the water and air phase and the formation of the actual measured 218po on the rad 7 detector stieglitz et al 2010 the freshwater component of sgd was calculated based on the cl concentrations of each sample using a binary mixing model in a similar approach to salem et al 2016 the cl ion is assumed to be conservative during the mixing process between freshwater and saline sea water end member concentrations for the freshwater were assumed to be represented by the samples extracted from under the dunes 0 g l 1 and the sea water end member cl concentrations in the wadden sea 16 5 g l 1 3 3 spatial mapping in the tidal creek water samples from the tidal creek were taken for 222rn ec and cl analysis 222rn was sampled in 1 l plastic bottles that were filled without headspace from about 5 cm below the water surface sample analysis were conducted within a few hours in the island laboratory using a rad7 durridge company co radon detector large dome large detector version applying the h2o accessory lee and kim 2006 the samples were degassed in a closed loop for five minutes and 222rn decay counts were integrated for one hour each sample was counted at least three times with a total measurement time of up to six hours results were adjusted for the decay between time of sampling and time of measurement the 222rn and chemical sampling took place in the time frame between 2 h before and after low tide due to regulations limiting access to the national park during high tide distance between sampling locations along the creek were 10 30 m and were selected based on the dominant flow conditions stagnant water pools and turbulent reaches of the tidal creek system were avoided ec and temperature was measured directly in the field using a hand held ec meter cond 3310 wtw gmbh germany with an automated temperature

and shallow groundwater sampling an electrical resistivity tomography ert survey 16th of march 2016 and shallow groundwater sampling 18th of march 2016 was performed to determine the spatial extension of the freshwater lens and salinity of the local aquifer below the ostplate the ert transect extended from the dunes to shortly before the start of the tidal creek fig 1 in the nw se direction the ert transect passed through dunes and upper and lower salt marsh vegetation according to the classification of holt et al 2017 fig 1 the ert estimates the electrical resistivity in the subsurface for 2d profiles which can be used to derive the spatial transition of groundwater salinity salem et al 2016 the total length of the ert transect was 375 m and consisted of two profiles each using 50 stainless steel electrodes with an electrode spacing of 4 m 4point light 10w lgm lippmann the electrode array configurations included wenner and dipole dipole arrays the subsurface electrical resistivity values were found by inverting the measured apparent resistivity data using res2dinv software geotomo software 2010 with a least squares inversion algorithm shallow groundwater sampling was conducted along the geoelectrical profile at 55 m 85 m 132 m 192 m 275 m 321 m and 355 m starting from the northern dunes end of the transect labelled 1 7 respectively fig 7 for sampling a stainless steel piezometer diameter of 2 cm with a 10 cm screen was hammered 1 5 m into the ground samples were obtained using a 50 ml syringe and 1 5 m silicone tubing after first purging the piezometer with the syringe and the tubing the ec was measured directly in the field 4 results 4 1 temporal dynamics of radon salinity and groundwater discharge to the tidal creek during spring tide february 20 26 2016 222rn activities ranged from 0 to 315 bq m 3 fig 2 a activities were highest during low tide fig 2 b but rapidly decreased with increasing tidal stage for the second survey neap tide 222rn activities were not as clearly influenced by the tidal fluctuations with little variations in 222rn activities during the four day measurement period fig 3 a b 222rn activities during neap tide were also significantly lower than during spring tide t test p 0 05 ranging from 0 to 155 bq m 3 simulated and measured 222rn activities during both surveys showed a very good fit r2 0 999 to measured data the highest modelled sgd flux up to 84030 m3 d 1 1 2 m d 1 for the first survey fig 2 d and 3125 m3 d 1 0 7 m d 1 for the second survey fig 3 d did not correspond to the highest 222rn activities at low tide but were observed when tides change from inflow to outflow conditions fig 2 d e fig 3 d e the highest proportion of freshwater in the creek up to 25 was observed during low tide and the lowest up to 6 for high tide figs 4 and 5 4 2 spatial mapping of the tidal creek measured 222rn activities in the tidal creek were highest close to the dunes mean 468 36 bq m 3 and decreased to below 100 bq m 3 close to the mouth of the creek fig 6 222rn activities do not only decrease depending on the distance to the sea north south direction but also decreased away from the main dune arc east west direction the lowest 222rn activities 17 bq m 3 were measured for the most western location of the creek cl concentrations increased during both surveys from the dunes towards the sea ranging from 9 5 g l 1 to 17 3 g l 1 for the second survey 4 3 ert profile and groundwater sampling high electrical resistivity values of 160 400 ωm indicating high freshwater proportions 0 8 g l 1 were measured at the north western part of the ert transect close to the main dune arc fig 1 according to the ert results the freshwater lens extended over a total distance of 130 m towards the tidal creek fig 7 ert results are closely correlated to the salinity measurements for shallow groundwater where low salinities correspond to high electrical resistivity values electrical resistivity values along the ert transect in general decreased towards the sea for the salt marsh while salinities increased gradually between 100 and 4 ωm salinity 11 2 g l 1 5 discussion 5 1 temporal dynamics of sgd according to continuous 222rn and cl data sgd and fresh sgd fluxes are highly variable in time 222rn activities were highest during low tide and rapidly decrease with increasing tidal stage figs 2 and 3 previous studies have shown that tidal pumping is the primary driving process for sgd during low tide conditions and is predominantly composed of sea water recycled through the coastal sediments tidal pumping is driven by reversal of hydraulic gradients during tidal cycles and describes the infiltration of seawater into intertidal sediments during high tide and exfiltration during low tide gleeson et al 2013 li et al 2009 robinson et al 2007 urish and mckenna 2004 the high tide sea water reverses the hydraulic gradient towards the aquifer and so restricts groundwater exfiltration and the absence of a sgd flux during high tide this sgd process seems also plausible for the tidal creek system on the ostplate fig 8 the highest modelled sgd flux up to 1 2 m d 1 for the first and 0 7 m d 1 for the second campaign are very high compared to previous studies e g burnett et al 2008 crusius et al 2005 nikpeyman et al 2019 however average sgd rates of 0 22 m d 1 and 0 13 m d 1 for the first and second survey respectively are comparable to previous investigations quantifying sgd in the western part of the island as well as other coastal systems in general taniguchi et al 2002 burnett et al 2008 santos et al 2015 for example santos et al 2015 estimated a tidally averaged sgd flux of 0 12 m d 1 for west spiekeroog calculations suggest the peak fluxes in sgd only occur over a short period of 2 h when tides change from inflow to outflow conditions fig 2 d 3 d this can be explained by the large pressure release on the aquifer as water rapidly drains from the creek this process is amplified by the extreme tidal range 2 72 m for spiekeroog holt et al 2017 which is distinctive for the wadden sea marencic 2009 this peak fluxes in sgd when tides change from inflow to outflow conditions have only seldomly been observed previously as the volume of the water in the coastal zone e g water in the catchment of the tidal creek is usually assumed to be constant in mesotidal creeks in the wadden sea the assumption of a constant volume is unreasonable due to the large change in the tidal amplitude and associated flooded area δa 0 53 km2 this is similar to the results of peterson et al 2019 where they observed high groundwater inputs during early to mid ebb tide for a tidal creek with a large tidal amplitude average 2 4 m high groundwater inputs were attributed to the increased hydraulic gradient by sea water flooding the marsh in addition peterson et al 2019 found a relation between the inundation of salt marsh and groundwater input into the creek no differentiation between fresh or recirculated water wilson and morris 2012 also demonstrated that the volume of groundwater flushing is increased when salt marsh areas get inundated the groundwater discharge to the tidal creek may be enhanced compared to silty areas in the catchment because creeks cut through the low permeable surface marsh mud krest et al 2000 and thus expose the highly permeable sandy aquifer on a small scale 10 cm a similar role has been reported for bioturbation due to crab burrows in mangrove systems where preferential groundwater exchange was enhanced by the direct hydrological connection to high permeable sand layers gleeson et al 2013 stieglitz et al 2013 the concept is transferable to tidal creeks due to similar settings where the sandy creek bed forms a conductive conduit between the shallow groundwater and the coastal surface water harvey and odum 1990 suggest that groundwater from sandy aquifers that are topped with salt marsh mud may be directly discharged into creeks through preferential flow paths modelling results of xin et al 2012 come to a similar conclusion and show that elastic storage release mechanisms related to soil compressibility are linked to a change in variations in storage of the aquifer the highest proportion of freshwater in the creek up to 25 was observed during low tide figs 4 and 5 the small amount of freshwater 6 during high tide was attributed to inflowing sea water and water from the last low tide re entering the creek this shows that despite the highest proportion of freshwater and the highest 222rn activities being observed during low tide the highest sgd fluxes do not necessarily occur at the same time 5 2 relation between sgd and groundwater recharge spatial measurements of cl and 222rn allowed the identification of the groundwater origin that contributes to the sgd flux in the creek figs 2 and 3 low 222rn activities measured in the tidal creek towards the sea 200 bq m 3 could either be explained by 222rn decay and degassing during transport or by dilution with sea water fig 6 a c a differentiation between recirculated water and saline sea water from 222rn data alone is not possible as the accumulation of 222rn in subsurface waters is independent of water origin and chemistry peterson et al 2019 higher cl concentrations at seaward sampling sites fig 6 b d demonstrate a clear influence of recirculated sea water the fast tidal dynamics 0 52 days from low to high tide compared to the 222rn enrichment in the subsurface 23 days until equilibrium concentrations are reached thus suggests that dilution is the dominant factor for low 222rn activities in the creek close to the sea however cl concentration of 13 5 g l 1 at the most seaward sampling location during spring tide do not reach the endmember concentration of the wadden sea and the freshwater fraction can still be as high as 18 at this sampling location this means that either 1 there is a sgd flux beyond the end of the tidal creek directly into the sea or 2 that fresh groundwater entering the creek during low tide remains in the coastal zone close to the end of the creek and flows back into the creek during the next high tide we favour the second option as the 222rn activities in the inflowing tide are also higher than would be expected for the wadden sea under these conditions small proportion of creek water flows back into the creek system during high tide similar to what has been described by crusius et al 2005 close to the dune arc high 222rn activities in the tidal creek indicate a higher sgd flux and proportion of groundwater burnett et al 2003 hussain et al 1999 nikpeyman et al 2019 swarzenski 2007 this could be due to a shorter distance to the dunes as the main groundwater recharge area in addition the hydraulic gradient arising from the elevation of the dunes is higher beukeboom 1976 according to holt et al 2017 2019 and röper et al 2013 there is one major freshwater lens below the dune ridge at the eastern part of the ostplate and the eastern branches of the tidal creek are closer to this freshwater lens than the more westerly branches fig 1 fig 9 higher 222rn activities at the eastern part of the tidal creek compared to values at the western parts therefore can be explained by higher fractions of groundwater originating from the nearby freshwater lens below the dune arc to the east fig 9 this indicates that the water in the creek reflects the distance to the underlying freshwater lens under the dune ridges and suggests that discharge into the tidal creek is directly coupled to the main groundwater recharge area and so coupled directly to the dune morphology of the catchment 5 3 connection of the creek catchment to the hinterland the ert imaging in combination with results from shallow groundwater sampling showed a dominant freshwater component in the aquifer close to the main recharge area under the dunes fig 7 this is in agreement with previous shallow groundwater investigations presented in holt et al 2017 ert imaging results indicate a higher vertical extension of the freshwater lens 10 15 m than previously reported for the ostplate röper et al 2013 recent salinity measurements for shallow groundwater showed a vertical extension of 4 5 m for the freshwater lens holt et al 2017 2019 however this study was conducted at the western part of the ostplate and results may not be transferable to the eastern part holt et al 2017 röper et al 2013 the observed gradual increase in the salinity represents an extended transition zone between fresh and saltwater the dominance of brackish water rather than a sharp interface between fresh and saltwater as seen in other coastal areas is likely due to large tides and winter storms flooding the high proportion of saltwater in the brackish groundwater can also be attributed to the still developing freshwater lens below the ostplate röper et al 2013 the origin of the freshwater component in the brackish groundwater below the salt marsh could be rainfall that is preferentially infiltrating e g via bioturbation moffett et al 2012 stieglitz et al 2013 xin et al 2012 xiao et al 2019 however this process on the catchment scale is assumed to be of minor relevance for the freshwater fraction in the subterranean estuary moffett et al 2012 consequently freshwater recharge for the salt marsh area is low wiederhold et al 2015 due to the low permeability salt marsh clay pollmann 2019 this suggests that most of the freshwater in the brackish groundwater is originated from the local freshwater lens below the dune arc as freshwater recharge mainly occurs for the dune area the morphological setting and terrestrial backdrop of the catchment induced by either the distance to dune recharge area or low topography are pivotal in addition to the age of the groundwater system in controllingling the salinity of the aquifer system 5 4 catchment mass balance and development of the freshwater lens differences in simulated groundwater fluxes for the sampling campaigns figs 2 and 3 result from the lower tidal amplitudes during neap tide second campaign compared to spring tide conditions first campaign kim and hwang 2002 li et al 1999 urish and mckenna 2004 comparison of fresh water recharge rates and fresh water sgd fluxes during neap and spring tides allow an assessment of the tidal creek s role for the catchment s water balance for estimation of the freshwater recharge we used the simulation results from a recently developed model of the freshwater lens underneath the ostplate holt et al 2019 this model suggested that recharge was 344 mm of which 69 is freshwater in the upper saltmarsh and 197 mm 41 freshwater for the lower saltmarsh freshwater recharge is assumed to occur evenly distributed over the whole active area upper salt marsh 0 76 km2 lower salt marsh 0 78 km2 recharge in the dune area grey dunes was assumed to drain to the northern beach rather than into the study catchment due to the location of the water divide south of the dunes holt et al 2019 given these assumptions we calculate a freshwater recharge of 665 m3 d 1 for the creek catchment discharge was assumed to only occur into the tidal creek 0 023 km2 due to the direct exposure of the sandy aquifer in the creek bed extrapolating the modelled sgd rate of 0 22 m d 1 from the spring tide measurements and a mean sgd freshwater proportion of 16 fig 4 leads to a daily freshwater volume flux of 810 m3 leaving the aquifer this shows that 120 of freshwater recharge drains into the creek during spring tide for neap tide a mean sgd rate of 0 13 m d 1 and a freshwater proportion of 6 fig 5 leads to a daily freshwater volume flux of 179 m3 that exits the aquifer via the creek corresponding to only 27 of fresh water recharge table 1 this suggests that a substantial proportion of recharge may contribute to the growth of the freshwater lens at low tidal magnitudes these simple calculations show that the fresh water balance is highly sensitive to the active recharge area and the temporal variability in fresh sgd even if spring and neap tides are only representative for the maximum and minimum flux values that occur rarely throughout the year calculations show that there exists a draining capacity of tidal creeks which should not be underestimated especially for highly vulnerable coastal aquifers 6 conclusions this study demonstrates that tidal creeks are important connectors between areas of groundwater recharge and discharge to the sea the enhanced hydraulic conductivity of the creek sediment as well as pressure loading effects due to periodic inundation of the salt marsh area is likely to be responsible for the groundwater flux into the tidal creek on the catchment scale also the distance to the dunes as groundwater recharge plays a crucial role in that context tidal creeks act as a conduit for the freshwater originating from the freshwater lens and in this way increase the freshwater component in the creek system in contrast tides and storms lead to salinization of the subterranean estuary below the tidal creek and salt marsh comparing fresh groundwater recharge with the fresh sgd into the creek during spring tide and neap tide as regularly occurring maximal and minimal fluxes throughout the year demonstrates that a large proportion of freshwater recharging the lens drains into the wadden sea during high tidal magnitudes during neap tide a significant amount of freshwater though remains in the aquifer the comparison of these two extreme tidal situations demonstrates that tidal cycles in creeks have a strong impact on the freshwater extension at barrier islands and thus influence the freshwater occurrence in these sensitive systems credit authorship contribution statement clarissa glaser conceptualization investigation writing original draft sven
