2915,changing climatic conditions have changed the stationary rainfall runoff relationships in many basins in this context the value of the model parameters will depend more on the selection of the calibration period which directly affects the accuracy of runoff forecasting however systematic exploration and testing of the impact of calibration conditions on the transferability of hydrological models under stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions require more effort the present study investigates the impact of four calibration conditions on model transferability including the length of the calibration period the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the difference in climate conditions as measured by the total rainfall amount between the calibration and transfer periods and the difference in the similarity of rainfall processes between the calibration and transfer periods two catchments with stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions and five models including xaj hbv ihacres simhyd and gr4j are used in this study the results show that 1 a longer calibration period is required for catchments with nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships to achieve stable simulations 2 with the increase in the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the transferability of the model decreases gradually and the degree of reduction is greater for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships and 3 when forecasting future runoff under nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships the closeness of the total rainfall amount between the calibration and transfer periods is more important than the similarity in rainfall series between the calibration and transfer periods this study provides insight into the impact of calibration conditions on the transferability of hydrological models in the context of climate change abbreviations xaj xinanjiang hbv

question that must be answered in hydrology as an applied science arnell 2004 asadieh and krakauer 2017 fonseca and santos 2019 guillod et al 2018 kuriqi et al 2020 shen et al 2017 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 hydrological models as the main study tool are widely used in the analysis and determination of hydrological responses to changing environments with two significant advantages first hydrological models can be easily modified and improved in specific areas and many models with different structures and complexities have been successfully applied to catchments with different climatic or geographic conditions second hydrological models can be used to predict hydrological dynamics by connecting with many climate scenarios predicted by global climate models or other methods farsi and mahjouri 2019 fowler et al 2018 gleick 1986 guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2007 schulze 1997 yang et al 2020 all hydrological models are essentially limited assumptions about the behaviour of catchments and models will always remain imperfect when they attempt to represent real world behaviour andr√©assian et al 2009 hydrological models are usually established under the stationary rainfall runoff relationship and used under the assumption that the climate and underlying surface conditions between model calibration and transfer period are similar ditthakit et al 2021 xu 1999 xu et al 2005 however with the increase in anthropogenic activities in recent years land use and global climate changes have changed the stationary rainfall runoff relationship in many basins which may make the hydrological models reduce their predictive ability in the new environment arnell and gosling 2013 brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2014 dakhlaoui et al 2019 klemes 1986 li et al 2012 westra et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 the question of testing and comparing the robustness of hydrological models in dynamic climatic conditions has been the subject of many studies cornelissen et al 2013 jones et al 2006 li et al 2015 merz et al 2011 oni et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2017 evaluated the robustness of three hydrological models ihacres hbv and gr4j in northern tunisia based on precipitation and temperature conditions the results showed that the robustness of the models became unacceptable when annual precipitation decreased by more than 25 and annual average temperatures increased by more than 1 75 c brigode et al 2013 used two hydrological models to investigate the uncertainty of hydrological predictions in the context of climate change in northern and central france and demonstrated that the lack of robustness was the major source of variability in streamflow projections under future climate conditions li et al 2012 used two hydrological models to simulate future runoff under different climatic conditions on 30 unimpaired catchments in australia and found that when a hydrological model was set up to simulate runoff for a wet climate scenario then it should be calibrated on a wet segment of the historic record and similarly a dry segment should be used for a dry climate scenario therefore it can be concluded that altered rainfall runoff relationships have brought some limitations in the application of hydrological models however in most studies of hydrological responses to climate change climate change is usually characterized by changes in the total amount of rainfall temperature but ignore changes in the processes of rainfall temperature series broderick et al 2016 huang et al 2012 lute and luce 2017 vaze et al 2010 all hydrological models are calibrated by comparing the observed and simulated historical records and the calibrated models are used in other periods or catchments other than the calibration period or calibration catchment in which the observed data are not available lute and luce 2017 patil and stieglitz 2015 zheng et al 2018 the calibrated parameters partly represent the climatic and underlying surface characteristics that affect the hydrological process in the catchment teutschbein et al 2015 however the change trend of annual rainfall and annual runoff is not consistent under changing climatic conditions which results in nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships among different periods zhang et al 2011 for a certain future period the climatic conditions may be different from the historical period or only similar to a certain part of the historical period therefore the choice of calibrate period directly affects the accuracy of future runoff prediction notably climate change is a slow process so on a long time scale the influence of climate change on the rainfall runoff relationship is obvious but the impact is often small in the short term zhang et al 2011 therefore it is often believed that using the latest historical data before the forecast year to calibrate the model parameters may improve the accuracy of runoff forecasting there are a few examples of studying the impact of the calibration period length on model performance xu and vandewiele 1994 demonstrated that 10 years of hydroclimatic data are necessary and sufficient to calibrate monthly water balance models arsenault et al 2018 used two hydrological models to evaluate the model parameters robustness and capabilities in simulating streamflow in three north american catchments the results indicated that using full data set to calibrate parameters was the optimal strategy merz et al 2009 set up six calibration periods i e 1 3 5 10 15 and 30 years to analyse the impact of the length of the calibration period on model performance and the results suggested that a calibration period of 5 years captured most of the temporal hydrological variability in the context of climate change the correctness of the model parameters will depend more on the selection of the calibration data period than the length of the calibration period and the former condition determines the similarity between the calibration and simulation periods and therefore directly affects the accuracy of future runoff forecasting however less attention has been given to the selection of the calibration period compared with other modelling issues affecting parameters such as the optimization method and objective function xu 1999 although many previous studies have investigated the applicability of hydrological models under different calibration conditions some key questions still need to be systematically explored which promoted the current study 1 how do the climate conditions of the chosen calibration period affect the transferability of models 2 how does the length of the calibration periods affect the model simulation under stationary and nonstationary conditions 3 how does the impact of calibration conditions on model transferability differ with the complexity of the model to investigate above problems five conceptual hydrological models i e hbv bergstrom 1976 xaj zhao et al 1980 simhyd chiew et al 2002 gr4j perrin et al 2003 and ihacres jakeman et al 1990 with different structures and parameters are applied to two catchments considering both stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions in this study the objective of the present study is to explore and test the impact of four calibration conditions on the transferability of conceptual hydrological models including the length of the calibration period the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the difference in rainfall amounts between the calibration and transfer periods and the similarity of rainfall processes between calibration and transfer periods the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the study area and data section 3 introduces details about the five conceptual models time series similarity calculation method and model calibration and evaluation methods the results corresponding to different calibration conditions are demonstrated and discussed in section 4 finally the major conclusions and the possible limitations of this study are summarized in section 5 2 study area and data to investigate the impact of the calibration conditions on the transferability of hydrological models under stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions the selected study area must have two characteristics first long term observation data are available then stationary and nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships have occurred in different basins respectively based on the two requirements the minxian and xiashan basins are chosen as the study areas their geographical location and distribution diagram of stations are shown in fig 1 and the features of the climate are listed in table 1 the minxian basin is a subbasin of the taohe river basin the largest tributary in the upper reaches of the yellow river and this basin covers a total area of 14 874 km2 the xiashan basin is a subbasin of the ganjiang river basin and is one of the main tributaries of the middle reaches of the yangtze river with a total area of 15 884 km2 the minxian basin and xiashan basin belong to semi humid and humid climate zones respectively with obvious climate differences the underlying surface and climate conditions of the xiashan basin are more beneficial to generate runoff than those of the minxian basin which can be confirmed by the runoff coefficients listed in table 1 affected by the terrain and monsoon the study basins have a strong seasonal climate approximately 74 of rainfall occurs from march to august in the xiashan basin moreover the phenomenon is more obvious in the minxian basin with more than 81 of rainfall concentrated in the months of may to september the daily values of temperature evaporation runoff and rainfall in the period of 1959 2002 are used as model inputs in this study the daily runoff was obtained from the hydrology bureau of yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources and hydrology bureau of changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and other data were obtained from the national meteorological information centre the mean areal temperature evaporation and rainfall are calculated by the thiessen polygon method these hydrometeorological data are quality controlled by the china meteorological data service centre and have been used in many other studies deng et al 2019 wang and zhao 2020 fig 2 a and b show annual rainfall and runoff series variabilities and their linear trends over the 1959 2002 period in the two basins the results of the mann kendall mk methods in detecting trends in rainfall and runoff series are calculated and shown in table 2 the annual rainfall and runoff showed significant decreasing trends according to the mk test for the minxian basin while no obvious trend occurred during the study period in the xiashan basin table 2 also shows the correlation coefficient between annual runoff and annual rainfall temperature in the two study areas the correlation between rainfall and runoff is much higher than that between temperature and runoff indicating that rainfall is the main driving factor of runoff production in order to evaluate the deviation between annual runoff and annual rainfall from 1959 to 2002 the cumulative curves of runoff depth and rainfall are calculated and plotted at the bottom of fig 2 for the cumulative annual rainfall of the two basins a straight line can be seen while the cumulative runoff depth are quite different from those of rainfall in the minxian basin and the two cumulative lines have deviated since the 1970s fig 2c the cumulative discrepancy shows that a significant change has occurred in the rainfall runoff relationship since that time in the xiashan basin the cumulative lines of rainfall and runoff depth are basically consistent in the study period 3 models and methods 3 1 hydrological models in the study five daily scale hydrological models are used to investigate the impact of calibration conditions on model transferability under stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions these models are selected based on the following three reasons 1 the models are mature and popular in previous studies 2 model parameters and structures show remarkable differences and five models show a wide range of the hydrological models available and 3 lumped hydrological models have been widely used in evaluating the hydrological response to changing environment broderick et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2017 li et al 2019 in the five models runoff processes are conceptualized in different ways which causes differences in the parameters and structures of different models the physical processes of the xaj hbv and simhyd models are described in more detail while the gr4j and ihacres models are more simple and empirical kim et al 2018 melsen and guse 2019 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 zhang and chiew 2009 for the runoff generation mechanism the xaj and hbv models consider the saturation excess flow mechanism while the simhyd model also considers the infiltration excess mechanism in addition to the saturation excess flow mechanism cheng and yu 2019 chiew et al 2009 teutschbein et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 moreover the hbv and xaj models consider the impact of the uneven distribution of rainfall by using a storage capacity curve but the simhyd model does not the gr4j and ihacres models are designed as metric models to decrease the uncertainty of the model coron et al 2012 however the ihacres model attempts to describe internal processes in more detail while the gr4j model is more distinctive in terms of the water distribution proportion under different routing paths and groundwater exchange caused by unclosed watersheds andr√©assian et al 2001 guo et al 2017 3 2 time series similarity calculation method in the area of time series similarity the vast majority of work has focused on indexing under the euclidean distance metric however it is only defined in the special case where the two sequences have the same length in many cases the meteorological processes are similar but the peak times are different if the euclidean distance is used to calculate the similarity the error is large therefore dynamic time warping dtw proposed by berndt and clifford 1994 another method to measure the similarities among time series is used in the study this method adjusts the corresponding relationship between the elements of different time series by using the idea of dynamic programming to obtain the best curve path and uses the value of this path to measure the similarity degree of the time series the advantage of this method is that the one to many mapping between time series is realized by distorting the time series so the method can measure the similarities among any equal or unequal length time series suppose there are two time series x and y of length m and n respectively where 1 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x i x m 2 y y 1 y 2 y 3 y j y n an m by n matrix is constructed where the i j element of the matrix refers to the distance d x i y j between the two points x i and y j i e d x i y j x i y j 2 a warping path w is a contiguous set of matrix elements that defines mapping between x and y the k element of w is defined as w k i j k so a path set is shown as follows 3 w w 1 w 2 w 3 w k w k max m n k m n 1 the warping path must meet several constraints 1 the starting and ending points of the warping path should correspond to diagonally opposite corner cells of the matrix 2 the allowable steps in the warping path to adjacent cells including diagonally adjacent cells must be continuous and 3 the warping path must be monotonically spaced in time there are many warping paths that satisfy the above constraints but the one that minimizes the warping cost is 4 dtw x y min k 1 k w k this warping path can be found using the dynamic programming method the cumulative distance Œ≥ i j is defined as the sum of the distance d i j found in the current cell and the minimum of the cumulative distances of the adjacent elements 5 Œ≥ i j d x i y j min Œ≥ i 1 j 1 Œ≥ i 1 j Œ≥ i j 1 note that when the k element of w is constrained such that w k i j k i j k the value of dtw is equal to the euclidean distance 3 3 model evaluation method the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cmaes optimization algorithm hansen and ostermeier 1996 is used to optimise the model parameters in this study by introducing the covariance matrix adaptation in the algorithm the rotation invariant implementation of both individual and global step sizes is realized bayer and finkel 2004 the algorithm exhibits strong repeatability to generate similar parameter sets for a succession of calibrations poissant et al 2017 the complete algorithm was presented by hansen and ostermeier 2001 and is extensively used to optimise the parameters of models chen et al 2013 poissant et al 2017 model parameters are usually calibrated by minimizing the difference between the observed and simulated runoff in this study the kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge proposed by gupta et al 2009 is considered to be the objective function the kge is calculated as follows 6 kge 1 Œ≥ 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 here Œ± is the ratio of the standard deviation of the simulated values to the standard deviation of the observed values Œ≤ is the ratio of the simulated value mean to the mean of the observed values and Œ≥ is the correlation coefficient kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 and the optimal value is 1 in addition the relative error re and the nash efficiency coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used to assess the accuracy of the simulation results 7 ns 1 q obs t q sim t 2 q obs t q obs 2 8 re q sim t q obs t q obs t 100 where q sim t and q obs t are the daily simulated and observed runoff values at time t respectively and q obs is the average value of the observed runoff to eliminate the influence of the initial climatic and underlying surface conditions on model performance the first year of the historical record is used as the warm up period in order to evaluate the transferability performance of the models yang et al 2020 proposed an evaluation criteria based on the changes in re and ns in this paper the change in kge is added as the evaluation method as shown in table 3 1 if kge of the target catchment kget 0 70 the transferability of the model is considered acceptable regardless of the value of Œ¥kge from the calibration to transfer periods 2 if kget 0 70 the model is considered to have transferability when Œ¥kge 0 2 from the calibration to transfer periods otherwise this model is not considered to have transferability 4 results and discussion in the following five sections the basic simulation capabilities of the five models under stationary climatic conditions in the study areas are first analysed through the most common and basic split sample test method then the model transferability under different length of calibration years and different length of interval between the calibration and transfer periods in the two catchments are discussed in sections 4 2 and 4 3 finally sections 4 4 and 4 5 investigate the impact of the difference in climate conditions as measured by the total rainfall amount and the similarity of rainfall processes between the calibration and transfer periods on model transferability 4 1 the basic simulation capability of the models in reproducing historical records the complete 44 year historical data is reorganized into even and odd years to minimize the impact of possible human activities and climate change the test procedure involves model calibration using historical data of odd even years and model validation using historical data of even odd years table 4 shows the values of three evaluation indexes kge ns and re of different calibration and validation periods the five models perform similarly well for all calibrations with all ns values greater than 0 78 and re values within 2 all validations are slightly poorer but also show very good performance with all ns values exceeding 0 75 and re values within 6 moreover comparing the simulation results of five models the difference is relatively small based on the evaluation criteria in table 3 the transferability of the all models are considered to be acceptable as all ns kge 0 70 and re 10 demonstrating that the five models have similar basic simulation capabilities in reproducing historical records in the study areas 4 2 the impact of the length of the calibration period on model transferability seven calibration period lengths including 3 years 5 years 8 years 10 years 13 years 15 years and 18 years are defined and used in this test taking the 3 year length as an example the test procedure involves selecting each adjacent 3 year series in turn as the calibration period from the complete observation series using a 3 year sliding window in each basin the entire available time series are used as the transfer period as a result the calibration and transfer periods are not independent and the transfer tests presented here should not be interpreted as strict split sample tests however the testing procedure implemented in this work is highly dependent on the length of the sliding window used to build the calibration sub periods the difference in the impact of different period lengths on model transferability is more accurately reflected using the same test period note that the number of transfer tests will not be the same for the different calibration period lengths seven calibration period lengths i e 3 years 5 years 8 years 10 years 13 years 15 years and 18 years have 1482 1190 812 600 342 210 and 72 groups of test procedures respectively the kling gupta efficiency kge of the calibration and transfer periods for the runoff simulations with different length of calibration years is calculated the results are summarized in fig 3 and fig 4 for the two basins the boxplot provides the 5th 25th 50th 75th and 95th percentile values of the distribution over the calibration and testing results for each length level the dotted dashed line refers to the mean value of each length level in both study basins model performance is improved with the increase in the length of calibration years while the improvement is no longer significant when the length of calibration years exceeds a given threshold in the minxian basin an approximately 13 year calibration period is required to achieve a stable model performance in the xiashan basin an 8 year calibration period is necessary this phenomenon indicates that a longer calibration period is required to achieve stable model efficiency for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships as indicated in fig 2 figs 3 and 4 also show that a longer calibration period leads to a robust model performance with a better value and a smaller variability in kge when the length of calibration years is lower than the threshold the impact of the length of calibration years on model transferability is more obvious note that the boxplot that has the smallest variance and the highest median value is the optimal solution the results indicate that the simulation accuracy decreases in the calibration period and increases in the validation period with the increase in the length of calibration years the findings are consistent with the results of merz et al 2009 under stationary climatic conditions an approximately 8 year calibration period is required to achieve a stable model performance while a 13 year calibration period is necessary under nonstationary climatic conditions which is slightly longer than the 5 year calibration period recommended by merz et al 2009 the results in table 4 and figs 3 and 4 also demonstrate that using the full data set to calibrate parameters is the optimal strategy when there is no large amount of available data which is consistent with the findings of arsenault et al 2018 4 3 the impact of the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods on model transferability according to the results of section 4 2 to eliminate the impact of the length of the calibration period on model transferability a 15 year calibration period length is used in this part specifically each adjacent 15 year series is used to define a sub period using a 15 year sliding window in each basin the hydrological models are calibrated for each sub period using kge as the objective function the calibrated parameter set is used to perform all the possible transfer tests on independent sub periods to ensure independence of the calibration and transfer periods transfer sub periods overlapping with the calibration sub periods are not considered the interval length is 0 when the calibration period series is adjacent to the transfer period the interval length is 1 when there is a one year gap period between the two series and so on the change in kge from the calibration to transfer periods for the runoff simulations with different numbers of interval years is calculated the mean value of kge changes is shown in fig 5 overall with the increase in the number of interval years the change in kge from the calibration to transfer periods for the runoff simulations gradually increases which indicates that the transferability of the model worsens in the minxian basin with the increase in the number of interval years the decrease in kge in the gr4j model is obviously smaller than that in the other models within a 13 year interval period the gr4j model still shows good transferability as its Œ¥kge 0 2 however for other models xaj hbv simhyd and ihacres when the interval period is greater than 5 years the decrease in kge exceeds 0 2 moreover the differences between models increase as the number of interval years increases the hbv simhyd and ihacres models behave similarly within a 5 year interval period while the five models produce obvious changes over the 13 year interval period in the xiashan basin with the increase in the number of interval years the decrease in kge in the xaj hbv simhyd and gr4j models are similar while the results of the ihacres model show no obvious decreasing trend the transferability of all five models is acceptable as their Œ¥kge 0 2 comparing the results of the two basins the decrease of kge in the minxian basin is far greater than that in the xiashan basin which indicates that the impact of the number of interval years between transfer and calibration periods on the transferability of the model is greater for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships as indicated in fig 2 4 4 the impact of the change in the total amount of rainfall on model transferability in this part the impact of climate variability as measured by the difference in average annual rainfall between the calibration and transfer periods on the model transferability is considered the relationship between the decrease of kge in the model simulations and the percentage difference in total rainfall in the transfer period compared with the model calibrations is discussed the percentage difference in rainfall is calculated by dividing rainfall in the calibration period by that in the transfer period the impact of the change in the total amount of rainfall in the two basins on model transferability is summarized in fig 6 when the rainfall in the transfer period is higher than in the calibration period the points of the simulation results are distributed on the right side of the y axis and vice versa in the minxian basin with the increase of the difference in rainfall amount between the calibration and the transfer periods the reduction in the kge value is generally higher the results also reveal that the reduction in kge values is generally greater when the model is transferred from wet to dry periods compared with the opposite scenario the gr4j model has the best and most stable performance among the five models with the reduction in kge values mostly within a value of 0 2 and the rest between 0 2 and 0 22 for the other four models the reduction in kge values is approximately 0 3 when the transfer period is wetter than the calibration period by 10 positive side of the x axis in fig 6 compared with a reduction in kge values of approximately 0 6 when the transfer period is drier than the calibration period by 10 negative side of the x axis in fig 6 in the xiashan basin the relationship between the change in kge value and the change in rainfall does not show a similar and regular pattern as that in the minxian basin the kge shows a slight decrease by approximately 0 05 0 15 for the five models when the transfer period rainfall is wetter than the calibration period rainfall positive side of the x axis in fig 6 while the transfer period is drier than the calibration period negative side of the x axis in fig 6 the reduction in kge values is only within 0 1 from the above results all five models perform better in the xiashan basin than in the minxian basin under changing rainfall amount conditions rainfall changes have a greater impact on model simulation accuracy in catchments with nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships 4 5 the impact of the pattern change in the time series of the rainfall process on model transferability in this section the relationship between the decrease in kge values in the model simulations and the similarity of the rainfall process in the transfer period compared with the model calibration periods is discussed the similarity of the rainfall process is calculated by the dtw method introduced in section 3 2 fig 7 shows the relationship between the change in rainfall similarity and the kge change from the calibration to transfer periods the x axis represents the standardized similarity distance of the rainfall process by using the min max normalization method each subplot contains four boxes which represent the standardized similarity distances in the four intervals of 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 5 note that the number of transfer tests included in each box is not the same the dotted dashed line refers to the mean value of each box in the minxian catchment the change in kge values from calibration to transfer periods with the standardized similarity distance of the rainfall process does not have a significant change trend while the kge values have an obvious decreasing trend in the xiashan basin moreover the five models show similar patterns of change with similarity change of the rainfall process by comparing the results of fig 6 and fig 7 the impact of the difference in the rainfall process on the model transferability is far less than that of the change in the total rainfall amount under nonstationary climatic conditions in other words in the basin with nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship for forecasting future runoff the historical period in which the total rainfall is similar to that in the future period is more suitable to calibrate model parameters than the period with a similar rainfall process 5 summary and conclusions in the context of climate change the impact of model calibration conditions on the transferability of conceptual hydrological models has become an essential and key issue in this study two catchments with stationary and nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships are adopted to explore the influence of four calibration conditions on the transferability of conceptual hydrological models including the length of the calibration period the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the difference in the total rainfall amount and the similarity of rainfall series between the calibration and transfer periods five common conceptual hydrological models are used to explore the differences in model transferability the major conclusions are described as follows 1 for model transferability under stationary conditions five hydrological models used in the study have similar basic simulation capabilities in reproducing historical records in the study areas 2 a long calibration period leads to a robust model performance while the impact is no longer significant when the length of calibration period exceeds a given threshold a longer calibration period is required for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships to achieve stable simulations 3 with the increase in the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the accuracy of the model gradually decreases and the degree of reduction is greater for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships 4 the accuracy of the model gradually decreases with the increase in the difference in rainfall amounts between the transfer and calibration periods rainfall changes have a greater impact on model simulation accuracies for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships 5 when forecasting future runoff under a nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship the closeness of the rainfall amount between the calibration and transfer periods is more important than the similarity in rainfall series between the calibration and transfer periods this study investigates the impact of four calibration conditions on the model transferability under stationary and nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship conditions and provides some interesting findings that have not been reported in the literature however there are also some limitations and further studies are required first the flow magnitude and subsurface conditions in the two basins are not identical which may bring some uncertainty for the study results then in the study only two catchments are considered and the obtained conclusions may not be representative thus more basins with different climate and underlying surface characteristics need to be tested to generalize the findings more spatial variability should be included in the future work moreover only the transferability of lumped hydrological models is explored in this work however the distributed hydrological models are also extensively used in the study of hydrological response to climate change therefore a deeper comparison of the performance between lumped and distributed hydrological models in the impact of different calibration conditions on the model transferability will be conducive to enrich the research findings credit authorship contribution statement wushuang yang data curation writing

2915,changing climatic conditions have changed the stationary rainfall runoff relationships in many basins in this context the value of the model parameters will depend more on the selection of the calibration period which directly affects the accuracy of runoff forecasting however systematic exploration and testing of the impact of calibration conditions on the transferability of hydrological models under stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions require more effort the present study investigates the impact of four calibration conditions on model transferability including the length of the calibration period the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the difference in climate conditions as measured by the total rainfall amount between the calibration

question that must be answered in hydrology as an applied science arnell 2004 asadieh and krakauer 2017 fonseca and santos 2019 guillod et al 2018 kuriqi et al 2020 shen et al 2017 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 hydrological models as the main study tool are widely used in the analysis and determination of hydrological responses to changing environments with two significant advantages first hydrological models can be easily modified and improved in specific areas and many models with different structures and complexities have been successfully applied to catchments with different climatic or geographic conditions second hydrological models can be used to predict hydrological dynamics by connecting with many climate scenarios predicted by global climate models or other methods farsi and mahjouri 2019 fowler et al 2018 gleick 1986 guo et al 2018 jiang et al 2007 schulze 1997 yang et al 2020 all hydrological models are essentially limited assumptions about the behaviour of catchments and models will always remain imperfect when they attempt to represent real world behaviour andr√©assian et al 2009 hydrological models are usually established under the stationary rainfall runoff relationship and used under the assumption that the climate and underlying surface conditions between model calibration and transfer period are similar ditthakit et al 2021 xu 1999 xu et al 2005 however with the increase in anthropogenic activities in recent years land use and global climate changes have changed the stationary rainfall runoff relationship in many basins which may make the hydrological models reduce their predictive ability in the new environment arnell and gosling 2013 brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2014 dakhlaoui et al 2019 klemes 1986 li et al 2012 westra et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 the question of testing and comparing the robustness of hydrological models in dynamic climatic conditions has been the subject of many studies cornelissen et al 2013 jones et al 2006 li et al 2015 merz et al 2011 oni et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2017 evaluated the robustness of three hydrological models ihacres hbv and gr4j in northern tunisia based on precipitation and temperature conditions the results showed that the robustness of the models became unacceptable when annual precipitation decreased by more than 25 and annual average temperatures increased by more than 1 75 c brigode et al 2013 used two hydrological models to investigate the uncertainty of hydrological predictions in the context of climate change in northern and central france and demonstrated that the lack of robustness was the major source of variability in streamflow projections under future climate conditions li et al 2012 used two hydrological models to simulate future runoff under different climatic conditions on 30 unimpaired catchments in australia and found that when a hydrological model was set up to simulate runoff for a wet climate scenario then it should be calibrated on a wet segment of the historic record and similarly a dry segment should be used for a dry climate scenario therefore it can be concluded that altered rainfall runoff relationships have brought some limitations in the application of hydrological models however in most studies of hydrological responses to climate change climate change is usually characterized by changes in the total amount of rainfall temperature but ignore changes in the processes of rainfall temperature series broderick et al 2016 huang et al 2012 lute and luce 2017 vaze et al 2010 all hydrological models are calibrated by comparing the observed and simulated historical records and the calibrated models are used in other periods or catchments other than the calibration period or calibration catchment in which the observed data are not available lute and luce 2017 patil and stieglitz 2015 zheng et al 2018 the calibrated parameters partly represent the climatic and underlying surface characteristics that affect the hydrological process in the catchment teutschbein et al 2015 however the change trend of annual rainfall and annual runoff is not consistent under changing climatic conditions which results in nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships among different periods zhang et al 2011 for a certain future period the climatic conditions may be different from the historical period or only similar to a certain part of the historical period therefore the choice of calibrate period directly affects the accuracy of future runoff prediction notably climate change is a slow process so on a long time scale the influence of climate change on the rainfall runoff relationship is obvious but the impact is often small in the short term zhang et al 2011 therefore it is often believed that using the latest historical data before the forecast year to calibrate the model parameters may improve the accuracy of runoff forecasting there are a few examples of studying the impact of the calibration period length on model performance xu and vandewiele 1994 demonstrated that 10 years of hydroclimatic data are necessary and sufficient to calibrate monthly water balance models arsenault et al 2018 used two hydrological models to evaluate the model parameters robustness and capabilities in simulating streamflow in three north american catchments the results indicated that using full data set to calibrate parameters was the optimal strategy merz et al 2009 set up six calibration periods i e 1 3 5 10 15 and 30 years to analyse the impact of the length of the calibration period on model performance and the results suggested that a calibration period of 5 years captured most of the temporal hydrological variability in the context of climate change the correctness of the model parameters will depend more on the selection of the calibration data period than the length of the calibration period and the former condition determines the similarity between the calibration and simulation periods and therefore directly affects the accuracy of future runoff forecasting however less attention has been given to the selection of the calibration period compared with other modelling issues affecting parameters such as the optimization method and objective function xu 1999 although many previous studies have investigated the applicability of hydrological models under different calibration conditions some key questions still need to be systematically explored which promoted the current study 1 how do the climate conditions of the chosen calibration period affect the transferability of models 2 how does the length of the calibration periods affect the model simulation under stationary and nonstationary conditions 3 how does the impact of calibration conditions on model transferability differ with the complexity of the model to investigate above problems five conceptual hydrological models i e hbv bergstrom 1976 xaj zhao et al 1980 simhyd chiew et al 2002 gr4j perrin et al 2003 and ihacres jakeman et al 1990 with different structures and parameters are applied to two catchments considering both stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions in this study the objective of the present study is to explore and test the impact of four calibration conditions on the transferability of conceptual hydrological models including the length of the calibration period the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the difference in rainfall amounts between the calibration and transfer periods and the similarity of rainfall processes between calibration and transfer periods the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the study area and data section 3 introduces details about the five conceptual models time series similarity calculation method and model calibration and evaluation methods the results corresponding to different calibration conditions are demonstrated and discussed in section 4 finally the major conclusions and the possible limitations of this study are summarized in section 5 2 study area and data to investigate the impact of the calibration conditions on the transferability of hydrological models under stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions the selected study area must have two characteristics first long term observation data are available then stationary and nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships have occurred in different basins respectively based on the two requirements the minxian and xiashan basins are chosen as the study areas their geographical location and distribution diagram of stations are shown in fig 1 and the features of the climate are listed in table 1 the minxian basin is a subbasin of the taohe river basin the largest tributary in the upper reaches of the yellow river and this basin covers a total area of 14 874 km2 the xiashan basin is a subbasin of the ganjiang river basin and is one of the main tributaries of the middle reaches of the yangtze river with a total area of 15 884 km2 the minxian basin and xiashan basin belong to semi humid and humid climate zones respectively with obvious climate differences the underlying surface and climate conditions of the xiashan basin are more beneficial to generate runoff than those of the minxian basin which can be confirmed by the runoff coefficients listed in table 1 affected by the terrain and monsoon the study basins have a strong seasonal climate approximately 74 of rainfall occurs from march to august in the xiashan basin moreover the phenomenon is more obvious in the minxian basin with more than 81 of rainfall concentrated in the months of may to september the daily values of temperature evaporation runoff and rainfall in the period of 1959 2002 are used as model inputs in this study the daily runoff was obtained from the hydrology bureau of yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources and hydrology bureau of changjiang water resources commission of the ministry of water resources and other data were obtained from the national meteorological information centre the mean areal temperature evaporation and rainfall are calculated by the thiessen polygon method these hydrometeorological data are quality controlled by the china meteorological data service centre and have been used in many other studies deng et al 2019 wang and zhao 2020 fig 2 a and b show annual rainfall and runoff series variabilities and their linear trends over the 1959 2002 period in the two basins the results of the mann kendall mk methods in detecting trends in rainfall and runoff series are calculated and shown in table 2 the annual rainfall and runoff showed significant decreasing trends according to the mk test for the minxian basin while no obvious trend occurred during the study period in the xiashan basin table 2 also shows the correlation coefficient between annual runoff and annual rainfall temperature in the two study areas the correlation between rainfall and runoff is much higher than that between temperature and runoff indicating that rainfall is the main driving factor of runoff production in order to evaluate the deviation between annual runoff and annual rainfall from 1959 to 2002 the cumulative curves of runoff depth and rainfall are calculated and plotted at the bottom of fig 2 for the cumulative annual rainfall of the two basins a straight line can be seen while the cumulative runoff depth are quite different from those of rainfall in the minxian basin and the two cumulative lines have deviated since the 1970s fig 2c the cumulative discrepancy shows that a significant change has occurred in the rainfall runoff relationship since that time in the xiashan basin the cumulative lines of rainfall and runoff depth are basically consistent in the study period 3 models and methods 3 1 hydrological models in the study five daily scale hydrological models are used to investigate the impact of calibration conditions on model transferability under stationary and nonstationary climatic conditions these models are selected based on the following three reasons 1 the models are mature and popular in previous studies 2 model parameters and structures show remarkable differences and five models show a wide range of the hydrological models available and 3 lumped hydrological models have been widely used in evaluating the hydrological response to changing environment broderick et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2017 li et al 2019 in the five models runoff processes are conceptualized in different ways which causes differences in the parameters and structures of different models the physical processes of the xaj hbv and simhyd models are described in more detail while the gr4j and ihacres models are more simple and empirical kim et al 2018 melsen and guse 2019 wang et al 2018 zeng et al 2016 zhang and chiew 2009 for the runoff generation mechanism the xaj and hbv models consider the saturation excess flow mechanism while the simhyd model also considers the infiltration excess mechanism in addition to the saturation excess flow mechanism cheng and yu 2019 chiew et al 2009 teutschbein et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 moreover the hbv and xaj models consider the impact of the uneven distribution of rainfall by using a storage capacity curve but the simhyd model does not the gr4j and ihacres models are designed as metric models to decrease the uncertainty of the model coron et al 2012 however the ihacres model attempts to describe internal processes in more detail while the gr4j model is more distinctive in terms of the water distribution proportion under different routing paths and groundwater exchange caused by unclosed watersheds andr√©assian et al 2001 guo et al 2017 3 2 time series similarity calculation method in the area of time series similarity the vast majority of work has focused on indexing under the euclidean distance metric however it is only defined in the special case where the two sequences have the same length in many cases the meteorological processes are similar but the peak times are different if the euclidean distance is used to calculate the similarity the error is large therefore dynamic time warping dtw proposed by berndt and clifford 1994 another method to measure the similarities among time series is used in the study this method adjusts the corresponding relationship between the elements of different time series by using the idea of dynamic programming to obtain the best curve path and uses the value of this path to measure the similarity degree of the time series the advantage of this method is that the one to many mapping between time series is realized by distorting the time series so the method can measure the similarities among any equal or unequal length time series suppose there are two time series x and y of length m and n respectively where 1 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x i x m 2 y y 1 y 2 y 3 y j y n an m by n matrix is constructed where the i j element of the matrix refers to the distance d x i y j between the two points x i and y j i e d x i y j x i y j 2 a warping path w is a contiguous set of matrix elements that defines mapping between x and y the k element of w is defined as w k i j k so a path set is shown as follows 3 w w 1 w 2 w 3 w k w k max m n k m n 1 the warping path must meet several constraints 1 the starting and ending points of the warping path should correspond to diagonally opposite corner cells of the matrix 2 the allowable steps in the warping path to adjacent cells including diagonally adjacent cells must be continuous and 3 the warping path must be monotonically spaced in time there are many warping paths that satisfy the above constraints but the one that minimizes the warping cost is 4 dtw x y min k 1 k w k this warping path can be found using the dynamic programming method the cumulative distance Œ≥ i j is defined as the sum of the distance d i j found in the current cell and the minimum of the cumulative distances of the adjacent elements 5 Œ≥ i j d x i y j min Œ≥ i 1 j 1 Œ≥ i 1 j Œ≥ i j 1 note that when the k element of w is constrained such that w k i j k i j k the value of dtw is equal to the euclidean distance 3 3 model evaluation method the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy cmaes optimization algorithm hansen and ostermeier 1996 is used to optimise the model parameters in this study by introducing the covariance matrix adaptation in the algorithm the rotation invariant implementation of both individual and global step sizes is realized bayer and finkel 2004 the algorithm exhibits strong repeatability to generate similar parameter sets for a succession of calibrations poissant et al 2017 the complete algorithm was presented by hansen and ostermeier 2001 and is extensively used to optimise the parameters of models chen et al 2013 poissant et al 2017 model parameters are usually calibrated by minimizing the difference between the observed and simulated runoff in this study the kling gupta efficiency coefficient kge proposed by gupta et al 2009 is considered to be the objective function the kge is calculated as follows 6 kge 1 Œ≥ 1 2 Œ± 1 2 Œ≤ 1 2 here Œ± is the ratio of the standard deviation of the simulated values to the standard deviation of the observed values Œ≤ is the ratio of the simulated value mean to the mean of the observed values and Œ≥ is the correlation coefficient kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 and the optimal value is 1 in addition the relative error re and the nash efficiency coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 are used to assess the accuracy of the simulation results 7 ns 1 q obs t q sim t 2 q obs t q obs 2 8 re q sim t q obs t q obs t 100 where q sim t and q obs t are the daily simulated and observed runoff values at time t respectively and q obs is the average value of the observed runoff to eliminate the influence of the initial climatic and underlying surface conditions on model performance the first year of the historical record is used as the warm up period in order to evaluate the transferability performance of the models yang et al 2020 proposed an evaluation criteria based on the changes in re and ns in this paper the change in kge is added as the evaluation method as shown in table 3 1 if kge of the target catchment kget 0 70 the transferability of the model is considered acceptable regardless of the value of Œ¥kge from the calibration to transfer periods 2 if kget 0 70 the model is considered to have transferability when Œ¥kge 0 2 from the calibration to transfer periods otherwise this model is not considered to have transferability 4 results and discussion in the following five sections the basic simulation capabilities of the five models under stationary climatic conditions in the study areas are first analysed through the most common and basic split sample test method then the model transferability under different length of calibration years and different length of interval between the calibration and transfer periods in the two catchments are discussed in sections 4 2 and 4 3 finally sections 4 4 and 4 5 investigate the impact of the difference in climate conditions as measured by the total rainfall amount and the similarity of rainfall processes between the calibration and transfer periods on model transferability 4 1 the basic simulation capability of the models in reproducing historical records the complete 44 year historical data is reorganized into even and odd years to minimize the impact of possible human activities and climate change the test procedure involves model calibration using historical data of odd even years and model validation using historical data of even odd years table 4 shows the values of three evaluation indexes kge ns and re of different calibration and validation periods the five models perform similarly well for all calibrations with all ns values greater than 0 78 and re values within 2 all validations are slightly poorer but also show very good performance with all ns values exceeding 0 75 and re values within 6 moreover comparing the simulation results of five models the difference is relatively small based on the evaluation criteria in table 3 the transferability of the all models are considered to be acceptable as all ns kge 0 70 and re 10 demonstrating that the five models have similar basic simulation capabilities in reproducing historical records in the study areas 4 2 the impact of the length of the calibration period on model transferability seven calibration period lengths including 3 years 5 years 8 years 10 years 13 years 15 years and 18 years are defined and used in this test taking the 3 year length as an example the test procedure involves selecting each adjacent 3 year series in turn as the calibration period from the complete observation series using a 3 year sliding window in each basin the entire available time series are used as the transfer period as a result the calibration and transfer periods are not independent and the transfer tests presented here should not be interpreted as strict split sample tests however the testing procedure implemented in this work is highly dependent on the length of the sliding window used to build the calibration sub periods the difference in the impact of different period lengths on model transferability is more accurately reflected using the same test period note that the number of transfer tests will not be the same for the different calibration period lengths seven calibration period lengths i e 3 years 5 years 8 years 10 years 13 years 15 years and 18 years have 1482 1190 812 600 342 210 and 72 groups of test procedures respectively the kling gupta efficiency kge of the calibration and transfer periods for the runoff simulations with different length of calibration years is calculated the results are summarized in fig 3 and fig 4 for the two basins the boxplot provides the 5th 25th 50th 75th and 95th percentile values of the distribution over the calibration and testing results for each length level the dotted dashed line refers to the mean value of each length level in both study basins model performance is improved with the increase in the length of calibration years while the improvement is no longer significant when the length of calibration years exceeds a given threshold in the minxian basin an approximately 13 year calibration period is required to achieve a stable model performance in the xiashan basin an 8 year calibration period is necessary this phenomenon indicates that a longer calibration period is required to achieve stable model efficiency for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships as indicated in fig 2 figs 3 and 4 also show that a longer calibration period leads to a robust model performance with a better value and a smaller variability in kge when the length of calibration years is lower than the threshold the impact of the length of calibration years on model transferability is more obvious note that the boxplot that has the smallest variance and the highest median value is the optimal solution the results indicate that the simulation accuracy decreases in the calibration period and increases in the validation period with the increase in the length of calibration years the findings are consistent with the results of merz et al 2009 under stationary climatic conditions an approximately 8 year calibration period is required to achieve a stable model performance while a 13 year calibration period is necessary under nonstationary climatic conditions which is slightly longer than the 5 year calibration period recommended by merz et al 2009 the results in table 4 and figs 3 and 4 also demonstrate that using the full data set to calibrate parameters is the optimal strategy when there is no large amount of available data which is consistent with the findings of arsenault et al 2018 4 3 the impact of the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods on model transferability according to the results of section 4 2 to eliminate the impact of the length of the calibration period on model transferability a 15 year calibration period length is used in this part specifically each adjacent 15 year series is used to define a sub period using a 15 year sliding window in each basin the hydrological models are calibrated for each sub period using kge as the objective function the calibrated parameter set is used to perform all the possible transfer tests on independent sub periods to ensure independence of the calibration and transfer periods transfer sub periods overlapping with the calibration sub periods are not considered the interval length is 0 when the calibration period series is adjacent to the transfer period the interval length is 1 when there is a one year gap period between the two series and so on the change in kge from the calibration to transfer periods for the runoff simulations with different numbers of interval years is calculated the mean value of kge changes is shown in fig 5 overall with the increase in the number of interval years the change in kge from the calibration to transfer periods for the runoff simulations gradually increases which indicates that the transferability of the model worsens in the minxian basin with the increase in the number of interval years the decrease in kge in the gr4j model is obviously smaller than that in the other models within a 13 year interval period the gr4j model still shows good transferability as its Œ¥kge 0 2 however for other models xaj hbv simhyd and ihacres when the interval period is greater than 5 years the decrease in kge exceeds 0 2 moreover the differences between models increase as the number of interval years increases the hbv simhyd and ihacres models behave similarly within a 5 year interval period while the five models produce obvious changes over the 13 year interval period in the xiashan basin with the increase in the number of interval years the decrease in kge in the xaj hbv simhyd and gr4j models are similar while the results of the ihacres model show no obvious decreasing trend the transferability of all five models is acceptable as their Œ¥kge 0 2 comparing the results of the two basins the decrease of kge in the minxian basin is far greater than that in the xiashan basin which indicates that the impact of the number of interval years between transfer and calibration periods on the transferability of the model is greater for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships as indicated in fig 2 4 4 the impact of the change in the total amount of rainfall on model transferability in this part the impact of climate variability as measured by the difference in average annual rainfall between the calibration and transfer periods on the model transferability is considered the relationship between the decrease of kge in the model simulations and the percentage difference in total rainfall in the transfer period compared with the model calibrations is discussed the percentage difference in rainfall is calculated by dividing rainfall in the calibration period by that in the transfer period the impact of the change in the total amount of rainfall in the two basins on model transferability is summarized in fig 6 when the rainfall in the transfer period is higher than in the calibration period the points of the simulation results are distributed on the right side of the y axis and vice versa in the minxian basin with the increase of the difference in rainfall amount between the calibration and the transfer periods the reduction in the kge value is generally higher the results also reveal that the reduction in kge values is generally greater when the model is transferred from wet to dry periods compared with the opposite scenario the gr4j model has the best and most stable performance among the five models with the reduction in kge values mostly within a value of 0 2 and the rest between 0 2 and 0 22 for the other four models the reduction in kge values is approximately 0 3 when the transfer period is wetter than the calibration period by 10 positive side of the x axis in fig 6 compared with a reduction in kge values of approximately 0 6 when the transfer period is drier than the calibration period by 10 negative side of the x axis in fig 6 in the xiashan basin the relationship between the change in kge value and the change in rainfall does not show a similar and regular pattern as that in the minxian basin the kge shows a slight decrease by approximately 0 05 0 15 for the five models when the transfer period rainfall is wetter than the calibration period rainfall positive side of the x axis in fig 6 while the transfer period is drier than the calibration period negative side of the x axis in fig 6 the reduction in kge values is only within 0 1 from the above results all five models perform better in the xiashan basin than in the minxian basin under changing rainfall amount conditions rainfall changes have a greater impact on model simulation accuracy in catchments with nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships 4 5 the impact of the pattern change in the time series of the rainfall process on model transferability in this section the relationship between the decrease in kge values in the model simulations and the similarity of the rainfall process in the transfer period compared with the model calibration periods is discussed the similarity of the rainfall process is calculated by the dtw method introduced in section 3 2 fig 7 shows the relationship between the change in rainfall similarity and the kge change from the calibration to transfer periods the x axis represents the standardized similarity distance of the rainfall process by using the min max normalization method each subplot contains four boxes which represent the standardized similarity distances in the four intervals of 0 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 0 5 and 0 5 note that the number of transfer tests included in each box is not the same the dotted dashed line refers to the mean value of each box in the minxian catchment the change in kge values from calibration to transfer periods with the standardized similarity distance of the rainfall process does not have a significant change trend while the kge values have an obvious decreasing trend in the xiashan basin moreover the five models show similar patterns of change with similarity change of the rainfall process by comparing the results of fig 6 and fig 7 the impact of the difference in the rainfall process on the model transferability is far less than that of the change in the total rainfall amount under nonstationary climatic conditions in other words in the basin with nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship for forecasting future runoff the historical period in which the total rainfall is similar to that in the future period is more suitable to calibrate model parameters than the period with a similar rainfall process 5 summary and conclusions in the context of climate change the impact of model calibration conditions on the transferability of conceptual hydrological models has become an essential and key issue in this study two catchments with stationary and nonstationary rainfall runoff relationships are adopted to explore the influence of four calibration conditions on the transferability of conceptual hydrological models including the length of the calibration period the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the difference in the total rainfall amount and the similarity of rainfall series between the calibration and transfer periods five common conceptual hydrological models are used to explore the differences in model transferability the major conclusions are described as follows 1 for model transferability under stationary conditions five hydrological models used in the study have similar basic simulation capabilities in reproducing historical records in the study areas 2 a long calibration period leads to a robust model performance while the impact is no longer significant when the length of calibration period exceeds a given threshold a longer calibration period is required for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships to achieve stable simulations 3 with the increase in the length of the interval between the calibration and transfer periods the accuracy of the model gradually decreases and the degree of reduction is greater for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships 4 the accuracy of the model gradually decreases with the increase in the difference in rainfall amounts between the transfer and calibration periods rainfall changes have a greater impact on model simulation accuracies for catchments with nonstationary climatic conditions and rainfall runoff relationships 5 when forecasting future runoff under a nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship the closeness of the rainfall amount between the calibration and transfer periods is more important than the similarity in rainfall series between the calibration and transfer periods this study investigates the impact of four calibration conditions on the model transferability under stationary and nonstationary rainfall runoff relationship conditions and provides some interesting findings that have not been reported in the literature however there are also some limitations and further studies are required first the flow magnitude and subsurface conditions in the two basins are not identical which may bring some uncertainty for the study results then in the study only two catchments are considered and the obtained conclusions may not be representative thus more basins with different climate and underlying surface characteristics need to be tested to generalize the findings more spatial variability should be included in the future work moreover only the transferability of lumped hydrological models is explored in this work however the distributed hydrological models are also extensively used in the study of hydrological response to climate change therefore a deeper comparison of the performance between lumped and distributed hydrological models in the impact of different calibration conditions on the model transferability will be conducive to enrich the research findings credit authorship contribution statement wushuang yang data curation writing

2916,understanding hydrological variability is of crucial importance for water resource management in sub saharan africa ssa while existing studies typically focus on individual river basins and suffer from incomplete records this study provides a new perspective of trends and variability in hydrological flood and drought characteristics frequency duration and intensity across the entire ssa this is achieved by i creating a 65 year long complete daily streamflow dataset consisting of over 600 gauging stations ii quantifying changes in flood and drought characteristics between 1950 and 2014 iii evaluating how decadal variability influences historical trends results of daily streamflow reconstructions using random forests provide satisfactory performance over most of ssa except for parts of southern africa using change point and trend analyses we identify three periods that characterise historical variations affecting hydrological extremes in western and central africa and some parts of southern africa i the 1950s 60s and after the 1980s 90s when floods droughts tend to be more less intense more less frequent and more less persistent and ii the 1970s 80s when floods droughts are less more intense less more frequent and less more persistent finally we reveal significant decadal variations in all flood and drought characteristics which explain aperiodic increasing and decreasing trends this stresses the importance of considering multiple time periods when analysing recent trends as previous assessments may have been unrepresentative of long term changes keywords

environment jonkman 2005 di baldassarre et al 2010 winsemius et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 this is particularly important in sub saharan africa ssa where historical trends and variability in hydrological extremes have led to devastating consequences di baldassarre et al 2010 shiferaw et al 2014 for example in ssa over the 20th and 21st centuries drought alone has resulted in more than 800 000 deaths and 2 billion usd in economic damages according to the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters masih et al 2014 similarly flood events have had an overwhelming impact on lives

drought in ssa e g paturel et al 1998 servat et al 1998 tramblauer et al 2014 over this region most studies have indeed focused on meteorological drought e g masih et al 2014 malherbe et al 2016 lweendo et al 2017 onyutha 2017 degefu et al 2019 gebremeskel haile et al 2019 which does not necessarily translate into hydrological droughts van loon van lanen 2012 van lanen et al 2016 in addition most studies on hydrological extremes in ssa focus on one characteristic i e maximum and minimum flow yet the frequency duration and intensity of floods and droughts are equally vital metrics for effective water management because they determine the type of mitigation strategy that is most effective bond et al 2008 yang liu 2020 similarly most studies focus on either floods or droughts but not both despite a need for water management strategies plans and policies to consider both extremes di baldassarre et al 2010 rangecroft et al 2016 brunner et al 2021 data scarcity however remains a considerable challenge impacting the study of hydrological extremes across ssa mahe et al 2013 do et al 2017 dixon et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020a b and limiting such efforts global datasets used to study hydrological extremes such as the global runoff data centre grdc dataset are relatively short with several gaps in their record for the african continent dixon et al 2020 in addition these datasets are not always quality controlled especially over ssa hannah et al 2011 tencaliec et al 2015 giustarini et al 2016 recently by combining the grdc dataset with the data collected and analysed over the last 70 years by the french institute for research and development ird tramblay et al 2020b compiled the first daily african database of hydrometric indices adhi spanning the entire continent between 1950 and 2018 subsequently the adhi was used to further understand continental trends in annual maximum flow tramblay et al 2020a however the adhi dataset presents numerous and random gaps with varying lengths over most regions in ssa which could limit the accurate detection of trends and variability slater villarini 2017 therefore this paper aims at characterizing patterns of trends and variability in the frequency duration and intensity of both flood and drought events for the first time across ssa this is accomplished by presenting a new reconstructed gap free daily streamflow dataset enabling us to examine 65 complete years of data this long term record free of gaps is indeed crucial to separate the influence of interannual to decadal variations on potential trends hannaford et al 2013 dieppois et al 2016 sidibe et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the study area datasets and methods used in section 3 we evaluate the performance of the gap filling methods used to generate a robust and complete streamflow dataset for ssa then we examine changes abrupt and gradual and variability in streamflow in section 4 we summarize our main results and discuss their wider implications 2 methods and data 2 1 data daily streamflow data are collected from a large database of daily river discharge data obtained from the syst√®me d informations environnementales sur les ressources en eaux et leur mod√©lisation sierem http www hydrosciences fr sierem boyer et al 2006 and grdc https portal grdc bafg de databases from these databases we collected 1764 stations with a minimum of 10 years of data from 1950 to 2018 across ssa fig 1 a b geographic data for the major basins and river networks in the ssa are also extracted from the grdc database previous studies have restricted the selection of stations to those with no more than 50 of missing data e g sidibe et al 2018 arriagada et al 2021 here from the original 1764 daily streamflow gauges we first selected stations with a maximum of 60 missing data totalling 720 stations to ensure adequate spatial coverage fig 1a and then evaluated the data quality in the remaining stations i e checking for the presence of thresholding in the maximum streamflow due to gauge rating curve exceedances and the presence of anomalous data especially in southern africa as noted in previous studies e g valimba et al 2005 trambauer et al 2014 chawanda et al 2020 to retain 661 stations using all stations with a maximum of 60 missing data also ensures that the gap filling procedure is informed with sufficient data to identify robust statistical relationships cf section 2 2 as illustrated in fig 1a the density of the compiled database is particularly large over western and southern africa southern african stations also have the lowest percentage of missing data over the study period fig 1a however the congo river the largest basin in africa andsecond largest river in the world is very poorly covered by gauging stations with long time series although it represents about half of the freshwater flowing into the atlantic ocean from africa alsdorf et al 2016 time coverage of daily streamflow data is more limited in the 1950s 60s which is the beginning of the hydrological networks in many countries and the post 1990s fig 1b furthermore to simplify analysis and interpretation of trends and variability are stratified according to 19 major hydrological basins fig 1c 2 2 creating a complete daily streamflow dataset for ssa to reconstruct a complete daily streamflow dataset between 1950 and 2014 we use a random forest rf algorithm rf is a machine learning technique that relies on classification and regression algorithms to learn from a set of variables to predict another variable breiman 2001 rf algorithms have already been used successfully for reconstructing complete daily to monthly streamflow datasets in western africa sidibe et al 2018 and south america arriagada et al 2021 tyralis et al 2021 highlight that the rf reconstructing and forecasting skills are stronger than those of multiple linear regressions and neural networks specifically a new variant of the original rf known as missranger mr wright ziegler 2018 is chosen for this study the mr algorithm was designed to overcome some of the limitations of the original rf which does not scale well with increasing data wright ziegler 2018 additionally the mr algorithm is faster and less computationally demanding than the original rf wright ziegler 2018 cross validation of the results of the reconstruction is performed by running 1000 simulations randomly generating artificial gaps of six years for each station reconstructions from the mr algorithm are then evaluated against the original data using the kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 when all modelled values are equal to the mean of observations kge and nse are equal to 0 41 and 0 respectively knoben et al 2019 the best model performance is given by kge and nse equal to 1 thus in the present study all stations showing an nse less than 0 or kge 0 41 in the cross validation results are considered unacceptable in addition to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the goodness of fit we quantify the number of stations showing good performances i e nse and kge greater than 0 5 knoben et al 2019 2 3 hydrological extreme indicators we examine the duration intensity and frequency of both hydrological droughts and floods in ssa as the nature and development of floods and hydrological drought events are different their detection and characterization are too the following two sub sections discuss the methodology we employ to characterize them 2 3 1 flood event characterization although flood peaks play a crucial role the peak alone may not properly depict a flood nor its impact bl√∂schl et al 2013 aspects like the frequency intensity and duration of an event are vital characteristics of flood typology to be considered diederen et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 tarasova et al 2019 such characteristics can be estimated through event separation methods fischer et al 2019 here we use a peak over threshold pot approach that relies on a baseflow separation method to determine the start and end of flood events mangini et al 2018 oppel mewes 2020 as in mangini et al 2018 the start of each flood event is determined when the flow starts to increase suddenly while the end of the event is determined when the plot of log transformed flow versus time becomes straight to achieve this the baseflow is estimated using the chapman digital filter chapman 1999 and the recession constant is determined for each station using the approach by thomas et al 2013 the start and end of each event are defined using a 3 day centred moving average following recommendations from mangini et al 2018 recessions with durations lower than 10 days are not considered the direct runoff is then computed as the difference between the baseflow and streamflow mangini et al 2018 tarasova et al 2018 giani et al 2021 finally we compute the annual frequency of events and maximum flood duration meanwhile flood intensity is estimated from the ratio between the volume and duration of flood events note that we also tested different thresholds such as 2 4 5 and 8 events per year but this did not significantly impact our results not shown 2 3 2 drought event characterization understanding hydrological drought processes and impacts require one to examine drought characteristics like timing duration severity or intensity and extent tallaksen lanen 2004 mishra singh 2010 van loon 2015 oikonomou et al 2020 this can be accomplished using fixed or variable thresholds here we use a variable threshold because it considers the seasonality of drought van loon et al 2015 2019 kozek tomaszewski 2019 sutanto van lanen 2020 tomaszewski kozek 2021 for each month the flow duration curves are computed and the 80th percentile is calculated before being smoothed using a centred average of 30 days van loon 2015 then mutually dependent droughts are pooled based on the inter event time method fleig et al 2006 here for all catchments an inter event period of 10 days is used as recommended by tallaksen et al 1997 and fleig et al 2006 in our study according to previous studies e g van loon van lanen 2012 kozek tomaszewski 2019 van loon et al 2019 sutanto van lanen 2020 tomaszewski kozek 2021 we used a duration limit of 15 days for minor droughts as shorter drought duration could have also been used e g fleig et al 2006 we also tested shorter duration droughts such as 5 and 10 days but this did not significantly impact our results not shown from this procedure we estimate the annual frequency of drought events and maximum drought duration annual maximum drought intensity is estimated by dividing the volume deficit by the drought duration 2 4 detecting historical changes and trends in hydrological extremes 2 4 1 step changes detection to investigate potential long term changes in the different characteristics of flood and drought we first perform a change point analysis several change point tests are normally used to detect abrupt changes in streamflow time series here we use an algorithm for a non parametric multiple change point analysis that uses dynamic programming and pruning based on the kolmogorov smirnov statistics known as the change point procedure via pruned objectives cp3o zhang et al 2017 for any type of distribution within a given dataset this method detects the number of change points and their locations simultaneously this is particularly important for hydrological extremes whose distributions depart from the normal distribution 2 4 2 trend analysis we then investigate the presence of trends in the flood and drought characteristics we examine how the historical baseline trends 1950 2014 compared to those identified in a recent period defined by the step changes for the duration and intensity of events we use the mann kendall mk statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is a non parametric and rank based method that has been extensively used for detecting trends in hydrological variables kundzewicz radziejewski 2006 wang et al 2020 as the mk test can only be used when the data are independent and is not robust against serial correlation we use a modified mk trend test with iterative pre whitening of the series zhang et al 2000 zhang zwiers 2004 as recommended in b√ºrger 2017 to detect changes in the time series of discrete events i e flood and drought frequency we use poisson regression to quantify the trend statistical significance e g vormoor et al 2016 mangini et al 2018b hodgkins et al 2019 2 4 3 trend versus long term and decadal variability trend analysis strongly depends on the start and end dates chosen to compute them because long term and decadal variations are very likely to influence the trend magnitude over specific decades chen grasby 2009 hannaford et al 2013 onyutha 2016 sidibe et al 2018 to assess the contribution of long term trends and decadal variations we use a multi temporal trend analysis where trends are analysed recursively for every segment of 10 to 65 years within the time series here over each segment of the multi temporal trend analysis the rate of change is estimated using the theil sen approach which is less sensitive to outliers than linear regression methods theil 1950 sen 1968 to assess the significance of trends for the intensity and duration we use the mk test cf section 2 4 2 for the frequency of events we use a significance test based on poisson regression cf section 2 4 2 further details about how the multi temporal trend analysis is constructed and interpreted are available in supplementary material fig s1 to facilitate comparisons between regions this test is applied to regionally average duration intensity and frequency of events finally we examine how strong decadal variations in flood and drought characteristics are over ssa decadal variations 9 years in the frequency duration and intensity of flood and drought events have thus been extracted using maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt percival walden 2000 quilty adamowski 2018 sidibe et al 2019 to do so we use a least asymmetric la 8 wavelet filter as recommended for the decomposition of turbulent signals cornish et al 2006 roushangar alizadeh 2019 we then calculate the percentage of explained variance by comparing the variance of decadal variations to the total variance of the time series i e the variance of non filtered time series the significance of decadal variations has been estimated by quantifying the probability that decadal variance exceeds the variance that would be detected at the same timescale in random noise we thus use 1000 monte carlo simulations of a signal presenting the same autoregressive 1 coefficient at lag 1 ar 1 mean and standard deviation sidibe et al 2018 dieppois et al 2019 3 results 3 1 performances of daily streamflow reconstructions the rf algorithm is applied to all stations with less than 60 missing data 661 streamflow gauges note however that the results are overall similar using all stations with less than 50 missing data but the rf gap filling performance decreases when including stations with more than 70 90 of missing data not shown for all stations cross validated kge is greater than 0 4 but nse is less than 0 for 45 stations out of the 661 stations i e 7 fig 2 a b thus based on the kge and nse 616 daily streamflow gauges i e 93 are reconstructed with acceptable results cf section 2 2 in addition over 72 of stations are reconstructed with good performances according to the kge and nse i e kge and nse 0 5 cross validated nse and kge results are greater over western africa with an average performance higher than 0 9 fig 2a b due to the high density of stations available for this region similarly the performance of the rf algorithm is very high across the two major basins of central africa lake chad and congo where the mean kge and nse values are greater than 0 9 fig 2a b these results are therefore consistent with previous studies reconstructing daily streamflow over the volta basin using direct sampling demb√©l√© et al 2019 likewise these daily reconstructions provide similar performances to the monthly reconstructions of western and central african streamflow provided by sidibe et al 2018 using rf and multivariate imputations by chained equations across eastern africa the performances are generally good but appear lower in the nile basin kge and nse of 0 85 and 0 71 respectively fig 2a b across southern africa the performances show large differences between several catchments in the region greater performances are observed in the zambezi river and the south africa west coast basins where 63 of stations show nse greater than 0 6 fig 2a b results are generally lower over the orange river limpopo river and the namibia coastal basin with a mean kge and nse of 0 58 and 0 33 respectively fig 2 b nevertheless over some parts of southern africa our results show greater performances than previous studies modelling historical monthly streamflow chawanda et al 2020 we note that the presence of changed flows due to human influence i e river regulation dams irrigation in southern africa is the likely reason for the weakened model performance for instance brunner 2021 found that reservoir regulation impacts regional hazards by reducing spatial flood connectedness which could significantly reduce the performance of rf reconstructions overall the rf algorithm reproduces quite well the observed streamflow hydrographs fig 2c f as illustrated in fig 2c f both the high flow and low flow characteristics such as the timing duration and shape are generally well represented even in regions where cross validation results are lower fig 2c f nevertheless in some regions of southern africa where streamflow is more intermittent and highly seasonal the rf algorithm shows some limitations in reconstructing peak flows fig 2f 3 2 historical step changes in flood and drought event characteristics statistical analysis of multiple change points has been carried out for the annual maximum duration maximum intensity and frequency of flood and drought events between 1950 and 2014 using the cp3o approach zhang et al 2017 3 2 1 step changes in flood event characteristics spatial distribution and time location of the first and second step changes of flood event characteristics are summarized in fig 3 across ssa similar change points are observed in flood duration intensity and frequency compared to the rest of ssa temporal changes in the flood characteristics are significantly more consistent in western and central africa in these regions we detect two change points one in the late 1960s 70s and another in the 1980s 90s fig 3a c these two regional change points result in three distinct flood regimes in western and central africa i until the late 1960s we note more frequent more intense and longer duration flood events ii between the late 1960s 70s and the 1980s 90s flood events are less frequent less intense and tend to be shorter iii in the post 1990s longer duration flood events become more frequent more intense this is thus consistent with previous studies analysing temporal changes in rainfall and average flow e g lebel ali 2009 nicholson 2013 sidibe et al 2018 which according to our study may have affected all flood characteristics we note however that the high level of similarity in the detection of change points over the post 1990s in western and central africa may be exacerbated due to the gap filling procedure as this time period is less densely covered fig 1b in eastern and southern africa the change points analysis reveals different patterns while eastern africa seems to be affected by very large spatial variability southern africa shows two regionally coherent change points in 1955 and the early 1960s fig 3a c before 1955 and after the early 1960s most of southern africa experienced less frequent less intense and shorter duration floods than between 1955 and the early 1960s in addition several southern african stations show change points in the 1960s 70s and 1980 90s consistently with changes reported in western and central africa fig 3a c nevertheless we note that changes in mean characteristics of flood events are less coherent at the regional scale over the second half of the timeseries especially in southern africa fig 3a c this could be due to anthropogenic influence such as reservoir construction diversion of water from some basins and extensive water abstraction in parts of southern africa brunner 2021 however some studies of southern rainfall variability reported an increased variability which could potentially impact the detection of change points after the mid 1960s e g dieppois et al 2016 malherbe et al 2016 3 2 2 step changes in drought event characteristics spatial distribution and time location of the first and second step changes of drought events are summarized in fig 4 drought duration intensity and frequency show similar change points over most of western and central africa the change point patterns are temporally consistent the results show two change points one in the late 1960s 70s and another in the 1980s 90s fig 4a c resulting in three distinct drought regimes i until the late 1960s we note less frequent less intense and shorter duration drought events ii between the late 1960s 70s and the 1990s drought events are more frequent more intense and tend to last longer iii in the post 1990s shorter duration droughts are less frequent and less intense large spatial variability is present in the change points observed in eastern africa meanwhile southern africa shows two regionally coherent change points one in 1955 and another in the early 1960s fig 4a c first from the start of the study period to 1955 and after the early 1960s to the end of the study period where droughts were more frequent more intense and longer duration floods than between 1955 and the early 1960s in addition some stations in this region show change points in the 1960s 70s and 1980 90s with similar patterns of change as in western and central africa fig 4a c in summary we identify different regions where temporal changes in drought characteristics are coherent west and central africa eastern africa and southern africa we also note that such historical changes in drought characteristics are highly consistent with those reported in flood characteristics but follow opposite trajectories in addition temporal and regional changes in flood and drought characteristics appear consistent with historical climate variations in these regions e g richard et al 2001 kizza et al 2009 lebel ali 2009 nicholson 2013 dieppois et al 2016 dieulin et al 2019 onyutha 2021 3 3 historical trends in flood and drought event characteristics to understand how trends have changed as informed by the change point analysis post 1990s trends are compared to the trends of a historical baseline period 1950 2014 3 3 1 trends in flood event characteristics fig 5 shows the trend patterns associated with all flood characteristics over the period 1950 2014 and the post 1990s although the regional patterns are generally quite similar in the different flood characteristics some differences are found regionally over the historical baseline period 1950 2014 we find significant and decreasing trends in all flood characteristics in most of southern africa and the western regions of western africa fig 5a c on the contrary a large region of equatorial africa shows consistent positive trends in flood characteristics especially in flood intensity and frequency between 1950 and 2014 fig 5a c contrasting trend patterns are found over the eastern part of western and eastern africa including the zambezi river basin where flood duration tends to become shorter but more frequent and intense over the historical baseline fig 5a c looking at the post 1990s period we find significant positive changes which are spanning a larger region of western central and eastern africa especially the western part of the zambezi river basin in flood intensity and frequency than in flood duration fig 5d f meanwhile in all flood characteristics there are significant negative trends in some parts of equatorial africa and the south eastern coast of ssa africa east central and indian ocean coasts fig 5d f according to the change point analysis fig 4d f non significant trends are found across most parts of southern africa fig 5d f we thus note a large variability in flood hazards in ssa with decreasing increasing trends over the historical baseline period switching to increasing decreasing trends over the post 1990s period which is fully consistent with the results of tramblay et al 2020a obtained with annual maxima sampling notably this variability is associated with an increase in flood duration intensity and frequency across most ssa except southern africa in the post 1990s 3 3 2 trends in drought event characteristics fig 6 shows the trends linked with all the drought characteristics over the 1950 2014 period and the post 1990s periods for the historical baseline period 1950 2014 we find significant increasing trends in all drought characteristics in the southwestern part of southern africa western regions of western africa lake chad and blue nile fig 6a c meanwhile the eastern part of western africa equatorial africa and the western part of the zambezi river basins show decreasing trends especially in drought duration and intensity between 1950 and 2014 fig 6a c thus over these regions drought events historically tend to become shorter less intense but more frequent this contrasts with the rest of ssa where the droughts are getting longer more intense and more frequent considering the post 1990s period trends in drought characteristics reverse from those noted over the historical baseline and we find significant decreasing trends over western africa lake chad zambezi and western southern africa for drought characteristics fig 6d f meanwhile significant increasing trends are found in equatorial africa white nile and the african east central coast basins and the south eastern coast of ssa africa east central and indian ocean coasts fig 6d f in addition in line with step change analysis fig 4d f non significant trends are found in drought characteristics across most parts of central and the northern region of southern africa fig 6d f we thus found large variability in hydrological drought over ssa with decreasing increasing trends over the historical baseline period switching to increasing decreasing trends over the post 1990s period in addition we note coherent variations with opposite phases in hydrological floods and droughts 3 4 trends versus variability in hydrological extremes to examine how potential decadal to multidecadal variations affect the detection of regional trends in flood and drought characteristics we re evaluated the trends using a multi temporal approach testing the trend robustness over each sequence of 10 years or more throughout the entire time series further details about how the multi temporal trend analysis is constructed and interpreted are available in supplementary material fig s1 as illustrated in figs 7 8a c by considering different starting and ending years we note that trends computed for each of the flood and drought characteristics in the major hydrological basins in ssa are highly variable both in space and time such strong spatio temporal variability in ssa catchments makes it difficult to discuss the presence of significant long term trends in all flood and drought characteristics between 1950 and 2014 most ssa catchments show alternating periods of increasing and decreasing trends in flood and drought duration intensity and frequency figs 7 8a c suggesting that significant decadal to multidecadal variations could be present in all flood and drought characteristics overall such variations show similar directional and temporal patterns or timing in either flood or drought characteristics for most of the catchments but these changes are generally in opposite directions between the floods and droughts more importantly however such variations are aperiodic i e magnitude changes over time and this can substantially affect trend detection analysis western and central african catchments show some of the strongest trends in flood characteristics and strong contrasts over time fig 7a c for instance in flood intensity and frequency we note one period when trends are negative the 1950s 1970s followed by one period with positive trends in the post 1980s fig 7b c thus over these regions studies analysing trends over a period spanning the last 30 years would tend to show an increase in flood intensity and frequency while studies using longer records tend to show a decreasing trend similarly including or excluding a couple of years at the start or the end of these time series could drastically change the trend detection and sign over western and central africa analogous results are found in flood duration however while our previous analysis suggested a post 1990s increase in flood duration fig 5d the multi temporal trend analysis reveals that this trend is highly unstable over the last 20 years fig 7a such temporal instability in trend patterns is particularly pronounced in eastern and southern african catchments fig 7a c such high variability thus could substantially limit the detection of long term change and trends in flood characteristics over eastern and southern africa regarding drought characteristics in western and central africa we found very similar but opposite trend patterns to flood characteristics over these regions studies analysing trends over a period spanning the last 30 years would tend to show a decrease in drought duration intensity and frequency fig 8a c like for flood characteristics this suggests that any long term trend analysis will be dependent on the length of the records and especially their starting and ending dates nevertheless unlike in flood duration we note that previously reported post 1990s trends for shorter droughts are more stable than in flood duration in recent years fig 6d 8a similarly over eastern and southern africa like for flood characteristics the multi temporal trend analysis reveals very high variability in drought characteristics from one decade to the next fig 8a c highlighting potentially large uncertainty in the detection of long term change and trends 3 5 contribution of decadal variability to hydrological extremes we then examine the magnitude of decadal to multidecadal variations greater than10 years in flood and drought characteristics using modwt fig 9 across ssa as illustrated in section 3 4 1 changes and trends in flood characteristics are significantly influenced by decadal variability fig 9a c however the amount of total variance explained by decadal variability is generally lower in flood duration than in flood intensity and frequency throughout the study region fig 9a c overall the relative amount of decadal variance in all flood characteristics is considerably higher in western africa as compared to the rest of ssa fig 9a c this difference is most apparent in the flood intensity where decadal variability explains more than 40 in stations located in the sahel and even more than 60 over the senegal river basin fig 9b meanwhile decadal variance in flood intensity is generally lower over the coastal regions of western africa most equatorial africa including the zambezi and especially southern africa fig 9b the magnitude of decadal variance is however generally stronger in flood frequency and shows similar spatial patterns to those observed for flood intensity fig 9b c for example over western central and south eastern africa the amount of variance explained is higher along the coastal regions 20 60 than in the intensity and duration of flooding fig 9a c according to section 3 4 2 drought characteristics across ssa are also found to be significantly influenced by decadal variability fig 9d f comparatively the amount of variance explained by decadal variability although generally lower than in floods is more nuanced fig 9d f for instance drought duration is more influenced by decadal variability than floods over western and central africa but not over eastern and southern africa fig 9d generally the amount of total variance explained by decadal variability is ranging between 20 and 40 for most stations and in all drought characteristics fig 9d f however the relative amount of variance is generally greater in western africa especially over the senegal river greater than40 60 and lower along the gulf of guinea coastal regions and over southern africa less than20 fig 9d f in summary both flood and drought characteristics are significantly impacted by decadal and multidecadal variability and this has major consequences on trend detections over the continent in addition we note that decadal variability is generally more important in flood than in drought characteristics across ssa except in western and central africa 4 discussion and conclusion the overall aim of this study is to characterize patterns of trends and variability in the frequency duration and intensity of both flood and hydrological drought events across ssa although some studies have attempted to characterize past changes in hydrological floods and droughts mostly based on annual maximum and minimum in western africa descroix et al 2013 2018 nka et al 2015 aich et al 2016 do et al 2017 wilcox et al 2018 tramblay et al 2020a eastern africa degefu et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020a and southern africa do et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020a these changes are not fully understood beyond the catchment scale this is largely due to a paucity of hydrological data therefore emphasizing the need for long term and complete records to fully interpret large scale changes in the hydrological regime across ssa mahe et al 2013 do et al 2017 dixon et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020a b using the rf algorithm we first reconstructed a new long term complete daily streamflow dataset across the entire ssa spanning the period between 1950 and 2014 the quality of the reconstruction was evaluated through cross validation using the kge and nse results showed that the performance was satisfactory over the entire sub continent with over 72 and 92 of the stations showing good and acceptable performances respectively the quality of the reconstruction is however lower in southern africa and this could be due to higher anthropogenic influences greater and or more chaotic climate variability over the region nevertheless the quality of the reconstruction of this new daily streamflow dataset shows equivalent performance with previous studies using different techniques and time steps over western and central africa sidibe et al 2018 demb√©l√© et al 2019 and over southern africa chawanda et al 2020 using the cp3o change point detection method zhang et al 2017 we identified two change points resulting in three hydrological regimes which primarily affect flood and drought characteristics in western and central africa i the 1950s 60s and after the 1980s 90s when floods droughts tend to be more less intense more less frequent and more less persistent and ii the 1970s 80s when floods droughts are less more intense less more frequent and less more persistent we also note similar change points in some parts of southern africa however eastern and southern africa show much larger spatial variability these results are consistent with trend patterns in the duration intensity and frequency of hydrological extremes with changing trends over the recent period post 1990s as compared to a historical baseline 1950 2014 these results also corroborate previous findings highlighting increasing frequency and intensity based on annual maximum in flood events or disasters after the 1980s 90s over western africa nka et al 2015 aich et al 2016 li et al 2016 fiorillo et al 2018 wilcox et al 2018 tazen et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020a the blue nile conway 2009 degefu et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020 eastern africa bernard et al 2013 tramblay et al 2020a and southern africa do et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020a and confirm significant variations in flood and drought hazards over the region more importantly using multi temporal trend analysis and modwt we found that analysis of long term changes and trends in flood and drought characteristics are significantly influenced by aperiodic decadal variability across ssa as such considering a fixed and relatively short study period will likely lead to misinterpretations of long term change and trend assessments in hydrological extreme characteristics reaffirming concerns by previous studies in europe and western africa e g svensson et al 2006 chen grasby 2009 hannaford et al 2013 sidibe et al 2018 for instance this could explain why previous studies present contrasting results in historical and recent trends over southern africa sch√§fer et al 2016 and over ethiopia e g melesse et al 2010 rientjes et al 2010 taye willems 2012 tesemma et al 2010 gebrehiwot et al 2014 degefu et al 2019 we found that the magnitude of such decadal variation in flood and drought characteristics is greater in western africa primarily over the sahelian band and lower in southern africa and the gulf of guinea we also note that flood duration and drought intensity are the least impacted by such decadal to multi decadal variability nevertheless this underlines the need for further understanding the mechanisms and drivers of these decadal variations to improve seamless prediction for flood and drought hazards at seasonal to decadal scales yuan et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2019 brunner et al 2021 while previous hydrological studies indeed highlighted the presence of interannual to decadal variability in hydrological regimes in western central and eastern africa taye willems 2012 nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 sidibe 2019 very few studies discussed the impacts of those decadal variations on hydrological extremes and their potential causes this is even though numerous studies in ssa highlighted significant decadal to multi decadal rainfall variability which is associated with large scale climate variations such as the atlantic multidecadal variation the other decadal modes of variability in the pacific ocean in the west african sahel mohino et al 2011 dieppois et al 2013 berntell et al 2018 eastern africa funk et al 2014 nicholson 2017 onyutha 2018 ummenhofer et al 2018 and southern africa dieppois et al 2016 2019 as highlighted in ficch√¨ stephens 2019 while el ni√±o southern oscillation often dominates the conversation about the predictability of early warning and preparedness for floods and drought climate modes of variability in other ocean basins could at least be equally important in various regions of ssa although the high level of cross correlation between ssa catchments suggests that the hydrological droughts and floods are significantly impacted by a large scale change the influence of local scale changes in land use water management and rainfall is not negligible for instance studies have shown that drought propagation strongly depends on local climate rainfall seasonality and aridity and catchment characteristics van loon van lanen 2012 van loon 2015 van loon et al 2014 likewise flood generation is greatly impacted by hydrometeorological processes and catchment properties keller et al 2018 stein et al 2020 2021 furthermore stochastic modelling studies have shown that small changes in mean rainfall or streamflow combined with strong decadal variability can severely change the rate of occurrence of extreme events zhang et al 2004 siebert ward 2011 similarly in other regions of the world previous studies demonstrated that reservoir regulation and water abstraction modulate drought and flood frequency severity and duration tijdeman et al 2018 brunner 2021 van loon et al 2022 which may not be negligible in southern africa chawanda et al 2020 future studies therefore should thus focus on identifying the relative role of large scale climate variations local hydroclimate variations and anthropogenic influences and their impacts on seasonal to decadal flood and drought prediction systems 5 data and materials availability not applicable 6 code availability not

2916,understanding hydrological variability is of crucial importance for water resource management in sub saharan africa ssa while existing studies typically focus on individual river basins and suffer from incomplete records this study provides a new perspective of trends and variability in hydrological flood and drought characteristics frequency duration and intensity across the entire ssa this is achieved by i creating a 65 year long complete daily streamflow dataset consisting of over 600 gauging stations ii quantifying changes in flood and drought characteristics between 1950 and 2014 iii evaluating how decadal variability influences historical trends results of daily streamflow reconstructions using random forests provide satisfactory performance over most of ssa except for parts of southern africa using change point and trend analyses we identify three periods that characterise historical variations affecting hydrological extremes in western and central africa and some parts of southern africa i the 1950s 60s and after the 1980s 90s when floods droughts tend to be more less intense more less frequent and more less persistent and ii the 1970s 80s when floods droughts are less more intense less more frequent and less more persistent finally we reveal significant decadal variations in all flood and drought characteristics which explain aperiodic increasing and decreasing trends this stresses the importance of considering multiple time periods when analysing recent trends as previous assessments may have been unrepresentative of long term changes keywords daily streamflow gap filling trend decadal to multidecadal variability hydrological drought and floods sub saharan africa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change is increasingly manifested by global increases in the frequency and magnitude of hydrological extremes i e floods and droughts with severe impacts on economies livelihoods and the environment jonkman 2005 di baldassarre et al 2010 winsemius et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 this is particularly important in sub saharan africa ssa where historical trends and variability in hydrological extremes have led to devastating consequences di baldassarre et al 2010 shiferaw et al 2014 for example in ssa over the 20th and 21st centuries drought alone has resulted in more than 800 000 deaths and 2 billion usd in economic damages according to the centre for research on the epidemiology of disasters masih et al 2014 similarly flood events have had an overwhelming impact on lives and economies bates et al 2008 di baldassarre et al 2010 winsemius et al 2018 lumbroso 2020 and these impacts have been steadily increasing over the last 70 years tramblay et al 2020a over the second half of the 20th century several studies report increasing trends in flood magnitude in western africa descroix et al 2013 2018 nka et al 2015 aich et al 2016 do et al 2017 wilcox et al 2018 tramblay et al 2020a eastern africa bernard et al 2013 degefu et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020a and southern africa do et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020a these studies however are too often restricted to the catchment scale limiting interpretations of the relative role of climate change from those of catchment properties e g groundwater support land use change and human consumption kingston et al 2020 this has been identified as one of the main challenges for the hydrological community over the coming decades bl√∂schl et al 2019 meanwhile little is known about historical trends in hydrological drought in ssa e g paturel et al 1998 servat et al 1998 tramblauer et al 2014 over this region most studies have indeed focused on meteorological drought e g masih et al 2014 malherbe et al 2016 lweendo et al 2017 onyutha 2017 degefu et al 2019 gebremeskel haile et al 2019 which does not necessarily translate into hydrological droughts van loon van lanen 2012 van lanen et al 2016 in addition most studies on hydrological extremes in ssa focus on one characteristic i e maximum and minimum flow yet the frequency duration and intensity of floods and droughts are equally vital metrics for effective water management because they determine the type of mitigation strategy that is most effective bond et al 2008 yang liu 2020 similarly most studies focus on either floods or droughts but not both despite a need for water management strategies plans and policies to consider both extremes di baldassarre et al 2010 rangecroft et al 2016 brunner et al 2021 data scarcity however remains a considerable challenge impacting the study of hydrological extremes across ssa mahe et al 2013 do et al 2017 dixon et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020a b and limiting such efforts global datasets used to study hydrological extremes such as the global runoff data centre grdc dataset are relatively short with several gaps in their record for the african continent dixon et al 2020 in addition these datasets are not always quality controlled especially over ssa hannah et al 2011 tencaliec et al 2015 giustarini et al 2016 recently by combining the grdc dataset with the data collected and analysed over the last 70 years by the french institute for research and development ird tramblay et al 2020b compiled the first daily african database of hydrometric indices adhi spanning the entire continent between 1950 and 2018 subsequently the adhi was used to further understand continental trends in annual maximum flow tramblay et al 2020a however the adhi dataset presents numerous and random gaps with varying lengths over most regions in ssa which could limit the accurate detection of trends and variability slater villarini 2017 therefore this paper aims at characterizing patterns of trends and variability in the frequency duration and intensity of both flood and drought events for the first time across ssa this is accomplished by presenting a new reconstructed gap free daily streamflow dataset enabling us to examine 65 complete years of data this long term record free of gaps is indeed crucial to separate the influence of interannual to decadal variations on potential trends hannaford et al 2013 dieppois et al 2016 sidibe et al 2018 the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the study area datasets and methods used in section 3 we evaluate the performance of the gap filling methods used to generate a robust and complete streamflow dataset for ssa then we examine changes abrupt and gradual and variability in streamflow in section 4 we summarize our main results and discuss their wider implications 2 methods and data 2 1 data daily streamflow data are collected from a large database of daily river discharge data obtained from the syst√®me d informations environnementales sur les ressources en eaux et leur mod√©lisation sierem http www hydrosciences fr sierem boyer et al 2006 and grdc https portal grdc bafg de databases from these databases we collected 1764 stations with a minimum of 10 years of data from 1950 to 2018 across ssa fig 1 a b geographic data for the major basins and river networks in the ssa are also extracted from the grdc database previous studies have restricted the selection of stations to those with no more than 50 of missing data e g sidibe et al 2018 arriagada et al 2021 here from the original 1764 daily streamflow gauges we first selected stations with a maximum of 60 missing data totalling 720 stations to ensure adequate spatial coverage fig 1a and then evaluated the data quality in the remaining stations i e checking for the presence of thresholding in the maximum streamflow due to gauge rating curve exceedances and the presence of anomalous data especially in southern africa as noted in previous studies e g valimba et al 2005 trambauer et al 2014 chawanda et al 2020 to retain 661 stations using all stations with a maximum of 60 missing data also ensures that the gap filling procedure is informed with sufficient data to identify robust statistical relationships cf section 2 2 as illustrated in fig 1a the density of the compiled database is particularly large over western and southern africa southern african stations also have the lowest percentage of missing data over the study period fig 1a however the congo river the largest basin in africa andsecond largest river in the world is very poorly covered by gauging stations with long time series although it represents about half of the freshwater flowing into the atlantic ocean from africa alsdorf et al 2016 time coverage of daily streamflow data is more limited in the 1950s 60s which is the beginning of the hydrological networks in many countries and the post 1990s fig 1b furthermore to simplify analysis and interpretation of trends and variability are stratified according to 19 major hydrological basins fig 1c 2 2 creating a complete daily streamflow dataset for ssa to reconstruct a complete daily streamflow dataset between 1950 and 2014 we use a random forest rf algorithm rf is a machine learning technique that relies on classification and regression algorithms to learn from a set of variables to predict another variable breiman 2001 rf algorithms have already been used successfully for reconstructing complete daily to monthly streamflow datasets in western africa sidibe et al 2018 and south america arriagada et al 2021 tyralis et al 2021 highlight that the rf reconstructing and forecasting skills are stronger than those of multiple linear regressions and neural networks specifically a new variant of the original rf known as missranger mr wright ziegler 2018 is chosen for this study the mr algorithm was designed to overcome some of the limitations of the original rf which does not scale well with increasing data wright ziegler 2018 additionally the mr algorithm is faster and less computationally demanding than the original rf wright ziegler 2018 cross validation of the results of the reconstruction is performed by running 1000 simulations randomly generating artificial gaps of six years for each station reconstructions from the mr algorithm are then evaluated against the original data using the kling gupta efficiency kge kling et al 2012 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 when all modelled values are equal to the mean of observations kge and nse are equal to 0 41 and 0 respectively knoben et al 2019 the best model performance is given by kge and nse equal to 1 thus in the present study all stations showing an nse less than 0 or kge 0 41 in the cross validation results are considered unacceptable in addition to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the goodness of fit we quantify the number of stations showing good performances i e nse and kge greater than 0 5 knoben et al 2019 2 3 hydrological extreme indicators we examine the duration intensity and frequency of both hydrological droughts and floods in ssa as the nature and development of floods and hydrological drought events are different their detection and characterization are too the following two sub sections discuss the methodology we employ to characterize them 2 3 1 flood event characterization although flood peaks play a crucial role the peak alone may not properly depict a flood nor its impact bl√∂schl et al 2013 aspects like the frequency intensity and duration of an event are vital characteristics of flood typology to be considered diederen et al 2019 fischer et al 2019 tarasova et al 2019 such characteristics can be estimated through event separation methods fischer et al 2019 here we use a peak over threshold pot approach that relies on a baseflow separation method to determine the start and end of flood events mangini et al 2018 oppel mewes 2020 as in mangini et al 2018 the start of each flood event is determined when the flow starts to increase suddenly while the end of the event is determined when the plot of log transformed flow versus time becomes straight to achieve this the baseflow is estimated using the chapman digital filter chapman 1999 and the recession constant is determined for each station using the approach by thomas et al 2013 the start and end of each event are defined using a 3 day centred moving average following recommendations from mangini et al 2018 recessions with durations lower than 10 days are not considered the direct runoff is then computed as the difference between the baseflow and streamflow mangini et al 2018 tarasova et al 2018 giani et al 2021 finally we compute the annual frequency of events and maximum flood duration meanwhile flood intensity is estimated from the ratio between the volume and duration of flood events note that we also tested different thresholds such as 2 4 5 and 8 events per year but this did not significantly impact our results not shown 2 3 2 drought event characterization understanding hydrological drought processes and impacts require one to examine drought characteristics like timing duration severity or intensity and extent tallaksen lanen 2004 mishra singh 2010 van loon 2015 oikonomou et al 2020 this can be accomplished using fixed or variable thresholds here we use a variable threshold because it considers the seasonality of drought van loon et al 2015 2019 kozek tomaszewski 2019 sutanto van lanen 2020 tomaszewski kozek 2021 for each month the flow duration curves are computed and the 80th percentile is calculated before being smoothed using a centred average of 30 days van loon 2015 then mutually dependent droughts are pooled based on the inter event time method fleig et al 2006 here for all catchments an inter event period of 10 days is used as recommended by tallaksen et al 1997 and fleig et al 2006 in our study according to previous studies e g van loon van lanen 2012 kozek tomaszewski 2019 van loon et al 2019 sutanto van lanen 2020 tomaszewski kozek 2021 we used a duration limit of 15 days for minor droughts as shorter drought duration could have also been used e g fleig et al 2006 we also tested shorter duration droughts such as 5 and 10 days but this did not significantly impact our results not shown from this procedure we estimate the annual frequency of drought events and maximum drought duration annual maximum drought intensity is estimated by dividing the volume deficit by the drought duration 2 4 detecting historical changes and trends in hydrological extremes 2 4 1 step changes detection to investigate potential long term changes in the different characteristics of flood and drought we first perform a change point analysis several change point tests are normally used to detect abrupt changes in streamflow time series here we use an algorithm for a non parametric multiple change point analysis that uses dynamic programming and pruning based on the kolmogorov smirnov statistics known as the change point procedure via pruned objectives cp3o zhang et al 2017 for any type of distribution within a given dataset this method detects the number of change points and their locations simultaneously this is particularly important for hydrological extremes whose distributions depart from the normal distribution 2 4 2 trend analysis we then investigate the presence of trends in the flood and drought characteristics we examine how the historical baseline trends 1950 2014 compared to those identified in a recent period defined by the step changes for the duration and intensity of events we use the mann kendall mk statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is a non parametric and rank based method that has been extensively used for detecting trends in hydrological variables kundzewicz radziejewski 2006 wang et al 2020 as the mk test can only be used when the data are independent and is not robust against serial correlation we use a modified mk trend test with iterative pre whitening of the series zhang et al 2000 zhang zwiers 2004 as recommended in b√ºrger 2017 to detect changes in the time series of discrete events i e flood and drought frequency we use poisson regression to quantify the trend statistical significance e g vormoor et al 2016 mangini et al 2018b hodgkins et al 2019 2 4 3 trend versus long term and decadal variability trend analysis strongly depends on the start and end dates chosen to compute them because long term and decadal variations are very likely to influence the trend magnitude over specific decades chen grasby 2009 hannaford et al 2013 onyutha 2016 sidibe et al 2018 to assess the contribution of long term trends and decadal variations we use a multi temporal trend analysis where trends are analysed recursively for every segment of 10 to 65 years within the time series here over each segment of the multi temporal trend analysis the rate of change is estimated using the theil sen approach which is less sensitive to outliers than linear regression methods theil 1950 sen 1968 to assess the significance of trends for the intensity and duration we use the mk test cf section 2 4 2 for the frequency of events we use a significance test based on poisson regression cf section 2 4 2 further details about how the multi temporal trend analysis is constructed and interpreted are available in supplementary material fig s1 to facilitate comparisons between regions this test is applied to regionally average duration intensity and frequency of events finally we examine how strong decadal variations in flood and drought characteristics are over ssa decadal variations 9 years in the frequency duration and intensity of flood and drought events have thus been extracted using maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt percival walden 2000 quilty adamowski 2018 sidibe et al 2019 to do so we use a least asymmetric la 8 wavelet filter as recommended for the decomposition of turbulent signals cornish et al 2006 roushangar alizadeh 2019 we then calculate the percentage of explained variance by comparing the variance of decadal variations to the total variance of the time series i e the variance of non filtered time series the significance of decadal variations has been estimated by quantifying the probability that decadal variance exceeds the variance that would be detected at the same timescale in random noise we thus use 1000 monte carlo simulations of a signal presenting the same autoregressive 1 coefficient at lag 1 ar 1 mean and standard deviation sidibe et al 2018 dieppois et al 2019 3 results 3 1 performances of daily streamflow reconstructions the rf algorithm is applied to all stations with less than 60 missing data 661 streamflow gauges note however that the results are overall similar using all stations with less than 50 missing data but the rf gap filling performance decreases when including stations with more than 70 90 of missing data not shown for all stations cross validated kge is greater than 0 4 but nse is less than 0 for 45 stations out of the 661 stations i e 7 fig 2 a b thus based on the kge and nse 616 daily streamflow gauges i e 93 are reconstructed with acceptable results cf section 2 2 in addition over 72 of stations are reconstructed with good performances according to the kge and nse i e kge and nse 0 5 cross validated nse and kge results are greater over western africa with an average performance higher than 0 9 fig 2a b due to the high density of stations available for this region similarly the performance of the rf algorithm is very high across the two major basins of central africa lake chad and congo where the mean kge and nse values are greater than 0 9 fig 2a b these results are therefore consistent with previous studies reconstructing daily streamflow over the volta basin using direct sampling demb√©l√© et al 2019 likewise these daily reconstructions provide similar performances to the monthly reconstructions of western and central african streamflow provided by sidibe et al 2018 using rf and multivariate imputations by chained equations across eastern africa the performances are generally good but appear lower in the nile basin kge and nse of 0 85 and 0 71 respectively fig 2a b across southern africa the performances show large differences between several catchments in the region greater performances are observed in the zambezi river and the south africa west coast basins where 63 of stations show nse greater than 0 6 fig 2a b results are generally lower over the orange river limpopo river and the namibia coastal basin with a mean kge and nse of 0 58 and 0 33 respectively fig 2 b nevertheless over some parts of southern africa our results show greater performances than previous studies modelling historical monthly streamflow chawanda et al 2020 we note that the presence of changed flows due to human influence i e river regulation dams irrigation in southern africa is the likely reason for the weakened model performance for instance brunner 2021 found that reservoir regulation impacts regional hazards by reducing spatial flood connectedness which could significantly reduce the performance of rf reconstructions overall the rf algorithm reproduces quite well the observed streamflow hydrographs fig 2c f as illustrated in fig 2c f both the high flow and low flow characteristics such as the timing duration and shape are generally well represented even in regions where cross validation results are lower fig 2c f nevertheless in some regions of southern africa where streamflow is more intermittent and highly seasonal the rf algorithm shows some limitations in reconstructing peak flows fig 2f 3 2 historical step changes in flood and drought event characteristics statistical analysis of multiple change points has been carried out for the annual maximum duration maximum intensity and frequency of flood and drought events between 1950 and 2014 using the cp3o approach zhang et al 2017 3 2 1 step changes in flood event characteristics spatial distribution and time location of the first and second step changes of flood event characteristics are summarized in fig 3 across ssa similar change points are observed in flood duration intensity and frequency compared to the rest of ssa temporal changes in the flood characteristics are significantly more consistent in western and central africa in these regions we detect two change points one in the late 1960s 70s and another in the 1980s 90s fig 3a c these two regional change points result in three distinct flood regimes in western and central africa i until the late 1960s we note more frequent more intense and longer duration flood events ii between the late 1960s 70s and the 1980s 90s flood events are less frequent less intense and tend to be shorter iii in the post 1990s longer duration flood events become more frequent more intense this is thus consistent with previous studies analysing temporal changes in rainfall and average flow e g lebel ali 2009 nicholson 2013 sidibe et al 2018 which according to our study may have affected all flood characteristics we note however that the high level of similarity in the detection of change points over the post 1990s in western and central africa may be exacerbated due to the gap filling procedure as this time period is less densely covered fig 1b in eastern and southern africa the change points analysis reveals different patterns while eastern africa seems to be affected by very large spatial variability southern africa shows two regionally coherent change points in 1955 and the early 1960s fig 3a c before 1955 and after the early 1960s most of southern africa experienced less frequent less intense and shorter duration floods than between 1955 and the early 1960s in addition several southern african stations show change points in the 1960s 70s and 1980 90s consistently with changes reported in western and central africa fig 3a c nevertheless we note that changes in mean characteristics of flood events are less coherent at the regional scale over the second half of the timeseries especially in southern africa fig 3a c this could be due to anthropogenic influence such as reservoir construction diversion of water from some basins and extensive water abstraction in parts of southern africa brunner 2021 however some studies of southern rainfall variability reported an increased variability which could potentially impact the detection of change points after the mid 1960s e g dieppois et al 2016 malherbe et al 2016 3 2 2 step changes in drought event characteristics spatial distribution and time location of the first and second step changes of drought events are summarized in fig 4 drought duration intensity and frequency show similar change points over most of western and central africa the change point patterns are temporally consistent the results show two change points one in the late 1960s 70s and another in the 1980s 90s fig 4a c resulting in three distinct drought regimes i until the late 1960s we note less frequent less intense and shorter duration drought events ii between the late 1960s 70s and the 1990s drought events are more frequent more intense and tend to last longer iii in the post 1990s shorter duration droughts are less frequent and less intense large spatial variability is present in the change points observed in eastern africa meanwhile southern africa shows two regionally coherent change points one in 1955 and another in the early 1960s fig 4a c first from the start of the study period to 1955 and after the early 1960s to the end of the study period where droughts were more frequent more intense and longer duration floods than between 1955 and the early 1960s in addition some stations in this region show change points in the 1960s 70s and 1980 90s with similar patterns of change as in western and central africa fig 4a c in summary we identify different regions where temporal changes in drought characteristics are coherent west and central africa eastern africa and southern africa we also note that such historical changes in drought characteristics are highly consistent with those reported in flood characteristics but follow opposite trajectories in addition temporal and regional changes in flood and drought characteristics appear consistent with historical climate variations in these regions e g richard et al 2001 kizza et al 2009 lebel ali 2009 nicholson 2013 dieppois et al 2016 dieulin et al 2019 onyutha 2021 3 3 historical trends in flood and drought event characteristics to understand how trends have changed as informed by the change point analysis post 1990s trends are compared to the trends of a historical baseline period 1950 2014 3 3 1 trends in flood event characteristics fig 5 shows the trend patterns associated with all flood characteristics over the period 1950 2014 and the post 1990s although the regional patterns are generally quite similar in the different flood characteristics some differences are found regionally over the historical baseline period 1950 2014 we find significant and decreasing trends in all flood characteristics in most of southern africa and the western regions of western africa fig 5a c on the contrary a large region of equatorial africa shows consistent positive trends in flood characteristics especially in flood intensity and frequency between 1950 and 2014 fig 5a c contrasting trend patterns are found over the eastern part of western and eastern africa including the zambezi river basin where flood duration tends to become shorter but more frequent and intense over the historical baseline fig 5a c looking at the post 1990s period we find significant positive changes which are spanning a larger region of western central and eastern africa especially the western part of the zambezi river basin in flood intensity and frequency than in flood duration fig 5d f meanwhile in all flood characteristics there are significant negative trends in some parts of equatorial africa and the south eastern coast of ssa africa east central and indian ocean coasts fig 5d f according to the change point analysis fig 4d f non significant trends are found across most parts of southern africa fig 5d f we thus note a large variability in flood hazards in ssa with decreasing increasing trends over the historical baseline period switching to increasing decreasing trends over the post 1990s period which is fully consistent with the results of tramblay et al 2020a obtained with annual maxima sampling notably this variability is associated with an increase in flood duration intensity and frequency across most ssa except southern africa in the post 1990s 3 3 2 trends in drought event characteristics fig 6 shows the trends linked with all the drought characteristics over the 1950 2014 period and the post 1990s periods for the historical baseline period 1950 2014 we find significant increasing trends in all drought characteristics in the southwestern part of southern africa western regions of western africa lake chad and blue nile fig 6a c meanwhile the eastern part of western africa equatorial africa and the western part of the zambezi river basins show decreasing trends especially in drought duration and intensity between 1950 and 2014 fig 6a c thus over these regions drought events historically tend to become shorter less intense but more frequent this contrasts with the rest of ssa where the droughts are getting longer more intense and more frequent considering the post 1990s period trends in drought characteristics reverse from those noted over the historical baseline and we find significant decreasing trends over western africa lake chad zambezi and western southern africa for drought characteristics fig 6d f meanwhile significant increasing trends are found in equatorial africa white nile and the african east central coast basins and the south eastern coast of ssa africa east central and indian ocean coasts fig 6d f in addition in line with step change analysis fig 4d f non significant trends are found in drought characteristics across most parts of central and the northern region of southern africa fig 6d f we thus found large variability in hydrological drought over ssa with decreasing increasing trends over the historical baseline period switching to increasing decreasing trends over the post 1990s period in addition we note coherent variations with opposite phases in hydrological floods and droughts 3 4 trends versus variability in hydrological extremes to examine how potential decadal to multidecadal variations affect the detection of regional trends in flood and drought characteristics we re evaluated the trends using a multi temporal approach testing the trend robustness over each sequence of 10 years or more throughout the entire time series further details about how the multi temporal trend analysis is constructed and interpreted are available in supplementary material fig s1 as illustrated in figs 7 8a c by considering different starting and ending years we note that trends computed for each of the flood and drought characteristics in the major hydrological basins in ssa are highly variable both in space and time such strong spatio temporal variability in ssa catchments makes it difficult to discuss the presence of significant long term trends in all flood and drought characteristics between 1950 and 2014 most ssa catchments show alternating periods of increasing and decreasing trends in flood and drought duration intensity and frequency figs 7 8a c suggesting that significant decadal to multidecadal variations could be present in all flood and drought characteristics overall such variations show similar directional and temporal patterns or timing in either flood or drought characteristics for most of the catchments but these changes are generally in opposite directions between the floods and droughts more importantly however such variations are aperiodic i e magnitude changes over time and this can substantially affect trend detection analysis western and central african catchments show some of the strongest trends in flood characteristics and strong contrasts over time fig 7a c for instance in flood intensity and frequency we note one period when trends are negative the 1950s 1970s followed by one period with positive trends in the post 1980s fig 7b c thus over these regions studies analysing trends over a period spanning the last 30 years would tend to show an increase in flood intensity and frequency while studies using longer records tend to show a decreasing trend similarly including or excluding a couple of years at the start or the end of these time series could drastically change the trend detection and sign over western and central africa analogous results are found in flood duration however while our previous analysis suggested a post 1990s increase in flood duration fig 5d the multi temporal trend analysis reveals that this trend is highly unstable over the last 20 years fig 7a such temporal instability in trend patterns is particularly pronounced in eastern and southern african catchments fig 7a c such high variability thus could substantially limit the detection of long term change and trends in flood characteristics over eastern and southern africa regarding drought characteristics in western and central africa we found very similar but opposite trend patterns to flood characteristics over these regions studies analysing trends over a period spanning the last 30 years would tend to show a decrease in drought duration intensity and frequency fig 8a c like for flood characteristics this suggests that any long term trend analysis will be dependent on the length of the records and especially their starting and ending dates nevertheless unlike in flood duration we note that previously reported post 1990s trends for shorter droughts are more stable than in flood duration in recent years fig 6d 8a similarly over eastern and southern africa like for flood characteristics the multi temporal trend analysis reveals very high variability in drought characteristics from one decade to the next fig 8a c highlighting potentially large uncertainty in the detection of long term change and trends 3 5 contribution of decadal variability to hydrological extremes we then examine the magnitude of decadal to multidecadal variations greater than10 years in flood and drought characteristics using modwt fig 9 across ssa as illustrated in section 3 4 1 changes and trends in flood characteristics are significantly influenced by decadal variability fig 9a c however the amount of total variance explained by decadal variability is generally lower in flood duration than in flood intensity and frequency throughout the study region fig 9a c overall the relative amount of decadal variance in all flood characteristics is considerably higher in western africa as compared to the rest of ssa fig 9a c this difference is most apparent in the flood intensity where decadal variability explains more than 40 in stations located in the sahel and even more than 60 over the senegal river basin fig 9b meanwhile decadal variance in flood intensity is generally lower over the coastal regions of western africa most equatorial africa including the zambezi and especially southern africa fig 9b the magnitude of decadal variance is however generally stronger in flood frequency and shows similar spatial patterns to those observed for flood intensity fig 9b c for example over western central and south eastern africa the amount of variance explained is higher along the coastal regions 20 60 than in the intensity and duration of flooding fig 9a c according to section 3 4 2 drought characteristics across ssa are also found to be significantly influenced by decadal variability fig 9d f comparatively the amount of variance explained by decadal variability although generally lower than in floods is more nuanced fig 9d f for instance drought duration is more influenced by decadal variability than floods over western and central africa but not over eastern and southern africa fig 9d generally the amount of total variance explained by decadal variability is ranging between 20 and 40 for most stations and in all drought characteristics fig 9d f however the relative amount of variance is generally greater in western africa especially over the senegal river greater than40 60 and lower along the gulf of guinea coastal regions and over southern africa less than20 fig 9d f in summary both flood and drought characteristics are significantly impacted by decadal and multidecadal variability and this has major consequences on trend detections over the continent in addition we note that decadal variability is generally more important in flood than in drought characteristics across ssa except in western and central africa 4 discussion and conclusion the overall aim of this study is to characterize patterns of trends and variability in the frequency duration and intensity of both flood and hydrological drought events across ssa although some studies have attempted to characterize past changes in hydrological floods and droughts mostly based on annual maximum and minimum in western africa descroix et al 2013 2018 nka et al 2015 aich et al 2016 do et al 2017 wilcox et al 2018 tramblay et al 2020a eastern africa degefu et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020a and southern africa do et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020a these changes are not fully understood beyond the catchment scale this is largely due to a paucity of hydrological data therefore emphasizing the need for long term and complete records to fully interpret large scale changes in the hydrological regime across ssa mahe et al 2013 do et al 2017 dixon et al 2020 tramblay et al 2020a b using the rf algorithm we first reconstructed a new long term complete daily streamflow dataset across the entire ssa spanning the period between 1950 and 2014 the quality of the reconstruction was evaluated through cross validation using the kge and nse results showed that the performance was satisfactory over the entire sub continent with over 72 and 92 of the stations showing good and acceptable performances respectively the quality of the reconstruction is however lower in southern africa and this could be due to higher anthropogenic influences greater and or more chaotic climate variability over the region nevertheless the quality of the reconstruction of this new daily streamflow dataset shows equivalent performance with previous studies using different techniques and time steps over western and central africa sidibe et al 2018 demb√©l√© et al 2019 and over southern africa chawanda et al 2020 using the cp3o change point detection method zhang et al 2017 we identified two change points resulting in three hydrological regimes which primarily affect flood and drought characteristics in western and central africa i the 1950s 60s and after the 1980s 90s when floods droughts tend to be more less intense more less frequent and more less persistent and ii the 1970s 80s when floods droughts are less more intense less more frequent and less more persistent we also note similar change points in some parts of southern africa however eastern and southern africa show much larger spatial variability these results are consistent with trend patterns in the duration intensity and frequency of hydrological extremes with changing trends over the recent period post 1990s as compared to a historical baseline 1950 2014 these results also corroborate previous findings highlighting increasing frequency and intensity based on annual maximum in flood events or disasters after the 1980s 90s over western africa nka et al 2015 aich et al 2016 li et al 2016 fiorillo et al 2018 wilcox et al 2018 tazen et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020a the blue nile conway 2009 degefu et al 2019 tramblay et al 2020 eastern africa bernard et al 2013 tramblay et al 2020a and southern africa do et al 2017 tramblay et al 2020a and confirm significant variations in flood and drought hazards over the region more importantly using multi temporal trend analysis and modwt we found that analysis of long term changes and trends in flood and drought characteristics are significantly influenced by aperiodic decadal variability across ssa as such considering a fixed and relatively short study period will likely lead to misinterpretations of long term change and trend assessments in hydrological extreme characteristics reaffirming concerns by previous studies in europe and western africa e g svensson et al 2006 chen grasby 2009 hannaford et al 2013 sidibe et al 2018 for instance this could explain why previous studies present contrasting results in historical and recent trends over southern africa sch√§fer et al 2016 and over ethiopia e g melesse et al 2010 rientjes et al 2010 taye willems 2012 tesemma et al 2010 gebrehiwot et al 2014 degefu et al 2019 we found that the magnitude of such decadal variation in flood and drought characteristics is greater in western africa primarily over the sahelian band and lower in southern africa and the gulf of guinea we also note that flood duration and drought intensity are the least impacted by such decadal to multi decadal variability nevertheless this underlines the need for further understanding the mechanisms and drivers of these decadal variations to improve seamless prediction for flood and drought hazards at seasonal to decadal scales yuan et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2019 brunner et al 2021 while previous hydrological studies indeed highlighted the presence of interannual to decadal variability in hydrological regimes in western central and eastern africa taye willems 2012 nyeko ogiramoi et al 2013 sidibe 2019 very few studies discussed the impacts of those decadal variations on hydrological extremes and their potential causes this is even though numerous studies in ssa highlighted significant decadal to multi decadal rainfall variability which is associated with large scale climate variations such as the atlantic multidecadal variation the other decadal modes of variability in the pacific ocean in the west african sahel mohino et al 2011 dieppois et al 2013 berntell et al 2018 eastern africa funk et al 2014 nicholson 2017 onyutha 2018 ummenhofer et al 2018 and southern africa dieppois et al 2016 2019 as highlighted in ficch√¨ stephens 2019 while el ni√±o southern oscillation often dominates the conversation about the predictability of early warning and preparedness for floods and drought climate modes of variability in other ocean basins could at least be equally important in various regions of ssa although the high level of cross correlation between ssa catchments suggests that the hydrological droughts and floods are significantly impacted by a large scale change the influence of local scale changes in land use water management and rainfall is not negligible for instance studies have shown that drought propagation strongly depends on local climate rainfall seasonality and aridity and catchment characteristics van loon van lanen 2012 van loon 2015 van loon et al 2014 likewise flood generation is greatly impacted by hydrometeorological processes and catchment properties keller et al 2018 stein et al 2020 2021 furthermore stochastic modelling studies have shown that small changes in mean rainfall or streamflow combined with strong decadal variability can severely change the rate of occurrence of extreme events zhang et al 2004 siebert ward 2011 similarly in other regions of the world previous studies demonstrated that reservoir regulation and water abstraction modulate drought and flood frequency severity and duration tijdeman et al 2018 brunner 2021 van loon et al 2022 which may not be negligible in southern africa chawanda et al 2020 future studies therefore should thus focus on identifying the relative role of large scale climate variations local hydroclimate variations and anthropogenic influences and their impacts on seasonal to decadal flood and drought prediction systems 5 data and materials availability not applicable 6 code availability not

2917,urban flood frequencies have increased and will continuously increase due to global climate change and rapid urbanization causing enormous economic problems and social impact resistant strategies are no longer the best option for disaster mitigation improving cities resilience to external disruptions is becoming a more important method for mitigating the impact of urban flooding however there are relatively little research has been conducted on the resilience of urban flood control systems the introduction of the concept of resilience can provide a new way of thinking for urban flood control research which can help to understand the coping process of the system during heavy rainfall emphasizing the absorption resistance and recovery stages to improve the system s adaptability to the changing environment and effectively alleviate the pressure of urban flooding this study discusses the impact of the design and configuration of urban flood control programs on the resilience of the system under heavy rainfall moreover the resilience benefit is presented to quantify the phased process of system resilience capacity for measuring the quantitative relationship between programs and system resilience finally the unit annual average cost of the program is combined with the resilience benefit to make decisions and ensure that cities are effectively reducing the risk of urban flooding with the optimal alternatives the proposed framework was applied to zhangjiagang city a highly urbanized and densely populated city in china the results showed that 1 during the same rainfall event the hydrological indicators characterizing the system s resilience process absorption resistance and recovery have distinct weights 2 rainfall has an effect on the index weight and the weight fluctuates when the system responds to rainfall in distinct return periods 3 rainfall return periods can have an impact on a program s effectiveness in improving the system s resilience at various stages and the extent to which different programs are affected by the return period varies and 4 combining large scale and micro scale programs improve the resilience of the system more effectively whereas concentrating on expanding storage volume without raising the water surface rate improves the resilience of the system less effective this framework can be used to assess the improvements in resilience acquired from various urban flood control program configurations and to assist city planners in selecting the optimal configuration so assisting in the decision making process for urban planning and disaster mitigation keywords resilience benefit urban flood urban flood control system urban flood control program multi scale optimal configuration data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction approximately 80 of the world s population lives in areas with high risk water security v√∂r√∂smarty et al 2010 many countries are facing increasingly serious water problems such as shortages floods and water pollution from 1980 to 2000 the number of floods increased by 230 worldwide and the number of affected people affected rose by 114 according to the united nations environment programme global environment outlook 5 unep 2012 on one hand global climate change has escalated continuously increasing the frequency and intensity of water disasters lawrence et al 2013 on the other hand with an increase in urbanization the impermeable area of urban surfaces has also increased constantly causing very low rainfall infiltration rates a smoother urban surface than the natural one and high rates of runoff and confluence these factors greatly affect both infiltration and runoff in the hydrological cycle jacobson 2011 line and white 2007 frequent water disasters have challenged the rationality of traditional engineering resistance strategies such as raising levees and water diversion ashley et al 2007 zevenbergen and gersonius 2007 since 2000 an increasing amount of research has been devoted to urban water management resilience strategies de bruijn 2005 dufty 2013 kuhlicke 2013 mcewen et al 2012 miller et al 2009 tourbier 2012 zhang et al 2011 the concept of resilience originated from ecology during the 1970s holling 1973 holling 1996 defined engineering resilience as the ability to maintain a stable state of a system and ecological resilience as the ability to transform into another stable state generally the concept of resilience refers to the ability of a system to resist absorb or recover from disturbances such as extreme floods or droughts and or timely and effectively adapt to changes in extreme environments or under different conditions such as climate change or urbanization bertilsson et al 2019 rezende et al 2019 sayers et al 2013 the resilience strategy refers to the approach that can increase and consolidate the resilience of the urban water management uwm cope with uncertain disturbances and adapt to various changes vis et al 2003 zevenbergen et al 2008 uwm resilience strategies include two types of measures the first type includes structural measures bowker 2007 choi et al 2010 kuhlicke 2013 mainly involving materials used in uwm such as urban drainage systems casal campos et al 2018 and green infrastructure systems mei et al 2018 the other type involves non structural measures such as adaptive governance hegger et al 2014 and social learning pahl wostl et al 2007 adaptive governance and social learning have been identified as essential for controlling social ecological systems during periods of sudden change buijs et al 2018 pahl wostl 2009 some measures of resilience strategies have been proposed from the perspective of learning and adaptation in the previous literature berkes et al 2008 nelson et al 2007 our research focuses on structure measures for resilience strategies in urban flood control systems and attempts to provide a quantitative measurement of resilience in complex external environments which can be considered in decision making processes in recent years the quantitative evaluation of resilience has been the focus of uwm the concept of an evaluation index system has been successfully constructed to gauge resilience in uwm these studies divide the way the indicator system is constructed into two categories according to whether or not external environmental such as rapid urbanization or climate change influences are taken into account the first type ignores the impact of changes in the external environment and uses the current situation to construct a system of indicators in terms of social ecological infrastructural economic institutional and hazard aspects to study current flood management strategies and their effectiveness in reducing flood losses and assessing flood resilience batica and gourbesville 2016 kotzee and reyers 2016 kusumastuti et al 2014 yawen et al 2020 kusumastuti et al 2014 used the ratio of disaster preparedness representing the ability to overcome disasters and vulnerability representing the risk of facing disasters to calculate the resilience of disaster prone areas they used 49 preparedness indicators and 18 vulnerability indicators batica and gourbesville 2016 developed a matrix for the resilience evaluation of flood risk management with 91 indicators this type of resilience assessment framework generally requires a sufficiently large number of indicators covers a wide range of areas and the data sources are mostly visits and surveys it is therefore more complex to construct and not easily operationalized the second way to construct an index system is to investigate urban drainage system resilience under increasing urbanization or and climate change bertilsson et al 2019 liu et al 2012 miguez and ver√≥l 2017 climate change and urbanization may cause more unexpected system failures and bring greater risks to local people and property vojinovic et al 2014 zhou 2014 moreover climate change is altering the hydrological cycle in many areas leading to increased rainfall intensity and changes in rainfall patterns as well as an increased likelihood of extreme weather events urbanization exacerbates flooding by increasing impervious areas and changing runoff pathways if urban planners and designers ignore these external environmental factors the design standards of urban drainage systems will increase the probability of urban flood disasters rezende et al 2019 rezende et al 2019 proposed the urban flood resilience index to quantitatively determine urban flood resilience the index takes into account the residual risk of infrastructure which is described as the risk of failure of structural systems or the risk of flooding being greater than the risk used to design defenses plate 2002 the study compares flood behaviors depth flow velocity and flood duration under different drainage system conditions e g large and concentrated reservoirs or minor and distributed reservoirs by performing simulations for several hydrological events with different rainfall return periods mugume et al 2015 developed a global resilience analysis method which combined link fault degree and fault duration in a resilience index they used it to quantify the residual function of the urban drainage system under internal structure damage caused by cumulative link failures this indicator system requires simpler indicators mostly physical indicators that can characterize the behavior of floods can usually be simulated using hydrological models and takes into account the uncertainty of future environments in previous studies the weights of resilience indicators are usually defined through consultation expert opinions or even simple equal weights bertilsson et al 2019 kusumastuti et al 2014 rezende et al 2019 this subjective weighting method which largely depends on the knowledge experience and preference of experts or local characteristics of social systems leads to great uncertainty of index weights in this paper we propose a relatively simple objective weighting method called entropy weighting which uses the amount of information provided by the entropy value of each indicator to determine its weight the design and preference of urban flood control programs should consider enhancing the adaptability of the urban flood control system in building sustainable cities dong et al 2017 in recent years low impact development has been deemed an effective and flexible adaptation strategy for the addition of infiltration detention storage and purification of rainwater at the source area bedan and clausen 2009 dunnett et al 2008 jin et al 2010 these procedures are often used to supplement conventional drainage systems given their more sustainable focus on the environment li et al 2019 palanisamy and chui 2015 wang et al 2018 generally low impact development consists of microscale sustainability based practices such as green roofs permeable pavements bio retention cells rain barrels and vegetative swales wang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 palla and gnecco 2015 on the contrary a large scale scheme refers to drainage networks river channels and city water bodies tavakol davani et al 2016 which mitigate urban floods by enhancing drainage capacity and increasing urban water surface rate and storage capacity urban flood control programs have been planned regionally in an increasing number of urban areas as a state of the art element in new urban areas or as a retrofit in old urban areas fang et al 2017 fryd et al 2013 in previous rainwater management literature comparative studies were conducted on the performance of the above two scales of programs in reducing the risk of urban flooding casal campos et al 2015 xie et al 2017 wang et al 2017 urban flood control programs are widely adopted over the world with numerous possible variations for example more than 30 cities in china are promoting the new sponge cities concept in urban flood control and implemented programs of more than us 10 billion within three years li et al 2016 zhang and chui 2018 therefore the optimal configuration of these program changes becomes increasingly important and should be carefully considered during the planning process however due to the complex interaction between programs and the environment optimizing its configuration is very challenging if the resilience of the urban flood control system could be incorporated as a key objective in the optimal configuration of urban flood control programs the performance of the configuration program can be demonstrated by the system resilience once the system resilience conveys the message that future conditions are not negatively affected by the configuration of current programs this will make an important contribution to a sustainable system by creating a quantitative measure of an index called resilience benefit which aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of programs on the response process of system when cities experience heavy rainfall we aim to provide a practical framework for quantitative analysis that can be used as a support tool for urban planning and decision making for the present flood control requirements in china s small and medium sized cities four rainfall scenarios were created and a numerical model of urban flooding was used to simulate the system s behavior the resilience benefit of various configurations of programs was evaluated the costs of programs are also considered to ensure that the program is optimized to effectively reduce the risk of urban flooding the proposed framework was applied to the city of zhangjiagang to test its performance and assess its usage in guiding the optimal program selection for urban flood prevention and control zhangjiagang is located in the taihu lake basin downstream of the yangtze river in china it is a typical basin where the hydrological processes are influenced by population growth and human intervention zhangjiagang faces problems common to developing countries the construction of the urban flood control system does not correspond with economic and social development further the city is vulnerable to the threat of severe urban flooding to gradually improve urban flood prevention and drainage capacity the municipal government plans to upgrade and transform the system adding some microscale sustainable infrastructures in combination with the city s development 2 study area and data the study area is the center of a riverside city zhangjiagang which is located on the southwest bank in the lower reaches of the yangtze river china 31 43 12 32 02 n 120 21 57 120 52 e fig 1 this highly urbanized area is located in the central and southern part of zhangjiagang city with a high population density high gdp and land area of 257 2 km2 the topography is relatively flat and there are abundant river systems in the humid climate zone in the south of the subtropical zone with a mild climate abundant rainfall and a distinct climate of four seasons over the past 50 years the average annual rainfall in zhangjiagang has been 1065 4 mm which is concentrated from may september from the historical flood disasters of zhangjiagang it can be seen that under the influence of its hydro meteorological and topographic conditions both prolonged plum rain and high intensity typhoon are meteorological factors inducing urban flood disasters in particular during the two periods of heavy rainfall in 2011 and 2015 the roads in zhangjiagang were seriously flooded especially in the central urban area frequent urban flood disasters reflected the deficiency of the traditional urban flood control system which only relies on the pipe drainage system to reduce the urban flooding disaster some microscale sustainable practices and large scale infrastructures will be applied for the first time in the study area the study of resilience in the multi scale configuration of the system in urban areas has reference value for the decision making of urban water management the data used in this study were mainly provided by zhangjiagang water resources bureau including terrain data river networks data ponding area distributions sluice pump station locations and dispatching rules the land use type distribution and proportions were obtained from the zhangjiagang city master plan 2011 2030 the characteristics of the drainage network were extracted from the rainwater planning map of downtown zhangjiagang the yangshe precipitation station is located in the center of the study area it is a stable site with a long rainfall data record a series of daily rainfall and hourly rainfall distribution data of the rainfall station in the study area from 1981 to 2015 was selected hourly real time river water level observation data were obtained from the dongheng river hydro junction the spatial distribution of the river networks and locations of the yangshe precipitation station and dongheng river hydro junction are shown in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 resilience benefit formulation since the current method of resilience analysis of urban water systems has a single selection of indicators the weighting of the indicators is determined subjectively therefore this paper proposes a new analysis method resilience benefit firstly the concept of resilience is introduced into the responding process of the urban flood control system when the city is hit by a rainfall and this process is defined as the system resilience process the resilience of the system is then divided into three stages absorb resist and recover and the corresponding indicators are selected the indicators are used to characterize the resilience of the system at each stage and the entropy weighting method is used to determine the weights of the indicators for each stage at different return periods by weighting the summation of the relative increases in resilience capacity at each stage the combined effect of the implementation of the urban flood control program on the resilience capacity of the system is finally determined the purpose of the proposed resilience benefit is to provide a scientific basis for flood control decisions by rationalizing the selection of urban flood control programs from the perspective of comprehensively improving the resilience of the system the basic framework of the resilience benefit is shown in fig 2 in this paper the resilient coping process of the system is divided into three stages the indicators for each stage are as follows i absorption stage the initial stage of a disturbance event in urban flood control systems is the absorption stage during which the system demonstrates its ability to absorb external disturbances for the system possible disturbance events include rainfall and changes in the urban underlying surface this paper focuses on the resilience process of the system after it has been exposed to rainfall the runoff coefficient rc is an important parameter for the volume of urban rainfall production the magnitude of the peak flow pf reflects the retention of higher flow runoff by the system therefore rc and pf are used to characterize the ability to absorb external disturbances during the absorption stage of the system ii resistance stage after the absorption stage rainfall that cannot be absorbed forms the urban flood and the system can withstand the disturbance continuously for a period of time when it is in direct contact with the urban flood the flood node fn and flood depth fd are used to indicate the capacity of the system in its resistance stage iii recovery stage the stage is the process that begins when an overload occurs on the system and continues until it is fully restored to normal this stage is represented by the flooding hour fh which is the time from the start of overflow at a node to the end of the period when the overflow volume drops to zero with the new definition the resilience benefit is an integrated consideration of the rainfall conditions for different return periods and the overall resilience process i e the combined effect of the scheme on the resilience capacity of the systems under the influence of different rainfall return periods the formulation of the resilience benefit resb is then as follows 1 resb t Œ¥ r c t w rc t Œ¥ p f t w pf t Œ¥ f n t w fn t Œ¥ f d t w fd t Œ¥ f h t w fh t where t is the different return periods of rainfalls Œ¥ r c t Œ¥ p f t Œ¥ f n t Œ¥ f d t Œ¥ f n t and Œ¥ f h t represent the relative reduction in rc pf fn fd and fh in the study area before and after the deployment of the system for a given return period respectively Œ¥ represents the relative increase in the resilience of the system w rc t w pf t w fn t w fd t and w fh t represent the weights of each indicator in the resilience process for different rainfall return periods a positive Œ¥ value indicates that the implementation of the scheme enhances the resilience of the system and a larger value indicates that the scheme has a greater impact on the resilience of the systems 3 2

worldwide rossman 2015 zahmatkesh et al 2015 the model meets the needs of urban underlying surface reconstruction in modern rainwater management some of the variables required in the resilience benefit formulation in this paper are taken from the swmm simulation results such as the runoff coefficient i e rc the peak flow pf the number of overflow nodes i e fn and so on the cad layout of the urban drainage network was used to extract the pipe data into arcgis determine the pipe network alignment generate inspection wells and complete the pipe network data framework combined with the digital elevation model dem of the study area the flow direction of the road and the drainage network divide the sub catchment area the flow direction slope and length of the stormwater pipes in the

paper the horton equation was used to estimate infiltration losses and a nonlinear reservoir approach and manning s equation were used to represent the rainfall runoff progress dynamic wave theory was used to solve the saint venant flow equations xu et al 2012 for flow routing because of the dense network of rivers in the study area and the uncertainty of the flow the boundary conditions are difficult to determine considering the stability of the boundary conditions and the integrity of the natural water system the generalization was extended to the south central urban area with a total of 1043 sub catchments 658 drainage pipes and 250 river sections the model generalization diagram is shown in fig s1 the hydrological parameters of the swmm model refer to measured and empirical

simulated water levels of the dongheng rive hydro junction the model can be fitted well by adjusting the above mentioned sensitive parameters the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used to estimate the degree of matching between the simulated and observed water levels based on the following eq 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n h i sim h i obs i 1 n h i obs h ave 2 2 where h i sim refers to the simulated water level at time i h i obs represents the observed water level at the same time and h ave is the mean observed water level 3 3 weighting methods for indicators in this paper the entropy weighting method is used to determine the weights of each indicator required for the resilience benefit calculation the concept of entropy was first introduced in information theory by shannon 1948 in information theory entropy measures objectively the amount of information an increase in the amount of information means a decrease in entropy the entropy weight method is a method to determine the weight using the concept of entropy weights are determined according to the degree of diversification of the information provided by the measured value of the attribute hsu and hsu 2008 for example an attribute does not function much when all alternatives have similar values for that attribute chen 2019 ji et al 2015 zou et al 2006 based on this weighting method the interference of human factors can be avoided and the evaluation results become more realistic delgado and romero 2016 in this paper the weight of entropy was used to indicate the roles of various hydrological indicators in measuring the resilience benefit of urban flood control programs let 3 x x ij m n be the matrix of original indicator values where are the number of evaluating objects n the number of the evaluating indicators and x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the value of the indicator for the i th object the decision matrix is normalized in order to eliminate the influence of the different scales of the indicators on the program decisions the normalization of the original matrix is given as 4 v v ij m n if the normalization is given by 5 v ij x ij min x j max x j min x j then bigger indicator values are better if the normalization is given by 6 v ij max x j x ij max x j min x j v ij 0 1 then smaller indicator values are better the characteristic ratio p ij of v ij is given as 7 p ij v ij i 1 m v ij and the entropy value of j th indicator is defined as 8 e j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij ultimately the weight of entropy is defined as 9 w j 1 e j j 1 n e j 3 4 design configurations for urban flood control programs in this paper the urban flood control program were divided into two categories according to the area with controlled rainwater micro scale and large scale the design of the micro scale programs refer to the technical guide for sponge cities construction of lid mei et al 2018 permeable pavement was adopted to replace the traditional impermeable ground which increases the storage of rainfall runoff and soil infiltration it is suitable for pedestrian streets squares and open parking spaces in urban areas the rain barrel as a low cost and high efficiency construction measure of a sponge city as it collects the rainwater from the roof for use has small location requirements and is mostly used in residential areas the design of rain gardens combines the landscape architecture concept with both runoff control functions and landscape effects because the rain garden has high requirements concerning land characteristics and a relatively big area must be transformed the transformation cost is relatively high thus the rain gardens are usually located in residential areas schools business districts and factories because the strength and density of buildings in the ponding area place certain restrictions on the arrangement of microscale practices the above mentioned three microscale infrastructures with small building and site requirements were chosen for this study large scale programs play significant roles in the storage and discharge of urban floods within a certain range from the perspective of the urban basin urban drainage and river systems are large scale programs large scale programs used in this paper include conduit transformations and the increase of water storage capacities referred to as river lake control the capacity of the drainage system depends on many factors such as the diameter slope siltation and connection of the drainage network which affect its drainage capacity therefore the main methods of conduit transformations include increasing the downstream conduit diameters cleaning up the conduit depositions and repairing the reverse slopes of conduit systems in addition the surface rate of the original artificial lake was expanded in this study to increase the city s water storage capacity determining sizing and siting options of low impact development within the watershed depends on not only characteristics such as elevation slope soil type and land cover but also the existing drainage network and areas of high runoff potential joyce et al 2017 according to the technical guide for sponge cites construction of low impact development for established urban areas the placement of urban flood control systems should be problem oriented mohurd 2014 therefore historical ponding areas and each sub catchment with an impermeable ratio of more than 50 in the study area were used to arrange micro scale programs fig s1 micro scale programs were deployed according to the specific characteristics and land use types of the sub catchment in the study area mei et al 2018 the design parameters corresponding to the micro scale programs were set regarding the research results of previous scholars kong et al 2017 peng et al 2015 as listed in table 1 based on the above mentioned methods used to set up multi scale programs 31 configurations of programs were designed including areas with microscale infrastructures length of conduit modifications and increased storage volumes table 2 3 5 design rainfall scenarios urban flood control programs are typically designed based on rainfall conditions with a certain duration intensity and frequency the duration of the designed rainfall has a great influence on its intensity and processes according to the hydrologic calculation principle the total duration of the designed rainfall should not be less than the catchment time in general when calculating the confluence within the city limits the maximum confluence time does not exceed 24 h local historical rainfall data are often used for statistical calculations e g frequency analysis to obtain design rainfalls probability distributions were used to correlate the severity of rainfall events with the return period in this paper a 24 h rainfall process with four return periods 2 yr 5 yr 10 yr and 20 yr was used to meet the design requirements of flooding drainage awadallah 2015 rahman et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2018 the maximum 1 3 6 12 and 24 hr rainfall data from 1981 to 2015 at the rainfall station yangshe precipitation station in the study area were obtained by the annual maximum method and the design rainfall of different duration in different recurrence periods was calculated by the pearson type iii frequency distribution curve the spatial attenuation of precipitation is considered and the point precipitation is transformed according to the areal reduction factor of the storm and flood atlas of jiangsu province to obtain the temporal distribution of the design surface precipitation under different recurrence periods the analysis of the historical heavy rainfall data that caused serious flood disasters in the study area shows that the main rainy season of 1991 has a large amount of rainfall high intensity and bad rain patterns which are not conducive to flood control safety of the study area therefore the 24 hour rainfall process from 22 00 on june 30 to 22 00 on july 1 1991 was selected as the typical rainfall process the 24 hour design rainfall process under different return periods was obtained by scaling according to the same frequency method technical details regarding the design rainfall inference process can be found in the literature code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering mohurd 2016 the 24 hr rainfall process in different recurrence periods is shown in fig 3 and the y axis in the log scale with base two 3 6 cost estimating methods cost control of the program is also an important aspect to consider in urban design planning life cycle cost analysis lcca is used to calculate the cost of a product throughout its life cycle from product construction and design to operation and maintenance o m the present value cost pvc considers all costs associated with the measure from a system perspective including initial cost operation maintenance cost and salvage value according to the life cycle cost analysis approach the present value of costs is calculated as follows 10 pvc c init t 0 n f r t c o m t f r n s v n where cint is the cost of the project at the initial stage assuming that the construction cost of all measures is linearly related to the number of measures c o m t is the annual o m cost in year t where the o m cost of each measure in the thesis is calculated as a percentage of the initial construction cost f r t is the present value factor of the discount rate at year t in the future and f r n is the present value factor of the discount rate r at the end of the design life of n years s v n is the residual value that can be recovered at the end of the design life of the measure and is assumed to be linearly related to the o m costs calculated as follows 11 s v n 1 i n c o m where i is the interval between the last maintenance year and the design life year based on previous research the value of i for the paper is taken as 1 following the principles of sponge city construction the permeable pavement rain garden rain barel and conduit transformations involved in the paper have been incorporated into existing or mandatory infrastructure so it can be assumed that the land cost of such programs is zero in addition the river lake control increases the volume of river and lake storage through dredging and expansion of the lake bottom without increasing the water surface ratio and without incurring land costs the initial cost is calculated as follows 12 c init c const c d p c const refers to the construction cost of the measure c d p refers to the design and planning cost of the measure calculated as a percentage of the construction cost the present value factors f r t and f r n are calculated as follows 13 f r t 1 1 r t r is taken to be 5 according to the latest monetary policy of the central bank in china the unit annual average cost uaac is introduced because of the different life cycles of the different programs eq 13 14 uaac p v c n 3 7 optimal selection method of urban flood control programs to help decision makers in the selection of optimal configuration urban flood control programs the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis method is used in this study to calculate the relative closeness of each alternative scheme this can be used to represent the comprehensive resilience of programs topsis is a systematic evaluation method for decision making when there are multi attributes cables et al 2012 kelemenis and askounis 2010 krohling and campanharo 2011 topsis simultaneously considers the weighted euclidean distances to both the positive ideal solution pis and the negative ideal solution nis and a preference order is ranked according to their relative closeness shih et al 2007 in this study 31 programs were ranked by topsis to make a well informed decision under unit annual average cost and resilience benefit the decision matrix is presented as follows 15 x x 11 x 12 x 21 x 22 x m 1 x m 2 where x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n since the evaluation indicators are unit annual average cost and resilience benefit n 2 for resilience benefit indicators i e the higher the value of the indicator the better the evaluation result the normalization is given by eq 16 16 v ij x ij min x j max x j min x j 0 v ij 1 then for unit annual average cost indicators i e the lower the value of the indicator the better the evaluation result the normalization is given by eq 17 17 v ij max x j x ij max x j min x j 0 v ij 1 the weighted decision matrix is constructed as 18 r r ij m n 19 r ij w i v ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 where w i was calculated by above eq 9 and v ij was calculated by above eq 5 and eq 6 the piss s j benefits and niss s j costs are identified as follows 20 s j max 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 1 min 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 2 21 s j min 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 1 max 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 2 where j 1 and j 2 represent the criteria benefit and cost respectively the euclidian distances from the pis and the nis for alternative x i formulas are calculated as follows 22 s d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 m 23 s d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 m the relative closeness Œ∑ i for each alternative x i with respect to pis is then given as eq 24 24 Œ∑ i s d i s d i s d i i 1 m by ranking the alternatives according to the value Œ∑ i the relative closeness is obtained to represent the alternatives performance achievement within their states a higher value Œ∑ i corresponds to better performance in this paper the relative closeness Œ∑ i can be used to represent the combined resilience of each program the higher value Œ∑ i indicates that the program has both high resilience benefit and relatively low unit annual average cost the best configuration of programs is those that have the highest value Œ∑ i 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation one specific rainfall event aug 13 2011 was used for calibration and another rainfall event jun 2 2015 was used for validation the model performances are listed based on the water level of the dongheng river hydro junction in table 3 and illustrated in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the simulated water level diagram for the calibration event is an acceptable representation of the observed water level the timing and water level were predicted reasonably well as indicated by the nse index value of 0 93 table 3 fig 4 b shows that the simulated water level accurately reproduces the change process of the observed water level and the nse index value was 0 83 table 3 during model calibration and validation an nse index greater than 0 7 indicated that the predicted time series was in good agreement with the monitored time series bennis and crobeddu 2007 the above mentioned calibration and verification results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the constructed urbanization process the best fit parameters are shown in table 4 4 2 indicator changes in the resilience process the results of the scenario simulations are discussed in terms of the resilience process the current state of the urban flood control system is used as a reference to analyze how the different urban flood control programs behave in terms of the resilience process and how the resilience of the system changes when subjected to different return periods 4 2 1 absorption stage the results are shown in fig 5 for the absorption stage of the resilience process based on the current status of the system means no additional programs and the impact of implementing different programs on the rc and pf in the study area under different rainfall return period conditions as shown in fig 5 the rc and pf in the study area are dominated by the micro scale programs when the large scale programs are deployed in combination with the micro scale programs and their evolutionary characteristics with the return period are the same as when the micro scale programs are deployed alone as the role of the conduit transformations in the process of confluence after runoff formation and is not involved in the process of runoff generation and the river lake control is based on the original artificial lake the storage volume is expanded through bottom dredging and does not change the original water surface rate therefore the control of runoff is not changed the micro scale programs are designed to control runoff at the source and can effectively reduce the rc and achieve control of pf therefore the micro scale programs provide a stronger increase in the resilience of the system than the large scale program during the absorption phase of the resilience process in addition the ranking of the micro scale urban flood control programs changes significantly under different rainfall scenarios both for rc and pf in the study area it shows that the effectiveness of the micro scale programs in improving system resilience is affected by the rainfall return periods 4 2 2 resistance stage the resistance stage of the resilience process is illustrated in fig 6 based on the existing state of the system and the effect of adopting various programs on the fn and fd in the study region under various rainfall return periods conditions in contrast to the absorption stage both large scale and micro scale programs are effective in the resistance to the disturbance phase fig 6 conduit transformations has a more significant effect in the resistance stage with the greatest impact on fn and fd the conduit transformations has the most direct impact on the nodes as it increases the pipe diameter and enhances the water transfer capacity of the pipe in addition as the response characteristics of the two types of programs to the return period are different there is no clear pattern in the extent to which fn and fd are affected by the return period when large programs are deployed in combination with micro scale programs and more diverse deployment programs e g pp rg ct 4 2 3 recovery stage based on the current status of the system and the influence of adopting different programs on the fh in the research region under varied rainfall return period conditions the results are given in fig 7 for the recovery stage of the resilience process fig 7 shows that both large scale and micro scale programs contribute to the recovery stage of the system with conduit transformations being the most significant in the recovery stage and significantly increasing the capacity of the combined programs in which it is located as conduit transformations enhances the capacity of the pipeline it reduces the overflow time at the node in addition the effect of the program on fh changes as the return period increases indicating that the increase in resilience of each program to the recovery stage of the system is influenced by rainfall and that the extent to which the program are influenced by rainfall varies the above results indicate that there are differences in the performance of progrms at different stages of the resilience process and that the effect of multi scale programs on improving the resilience of the system under different recurrence period rainfall conditions shows irregularities all these factors add difficulty and uncertainty to the selection of programs therefore to avoid falling into a decision making dilemma caused by the stripping of the evaluation results of each indicator this paper assigns resilience weights to the indicators characterizing the resilience stages analyses in depth the intrinsic links between the indicators and the degree of determination of the attributes of the strategy s merits and demerits and uses the objective assignment method to assign weights to the indicators 4 3 entropy weights of the indicators in previous studies the weights of the indicators used to characterize system resilience have usually been determined through consultation expert opinion or even simple equal weighting bertilsson et al 2019 kusumastuti et al 2014 rezende et al 2019 as this subjective method of assigning weights has more human uncertainties this paper uses the entropy method to determine the weights of the indicators more objectively to determine the effects of the urban flood control programs on system resilience response progress two steps were used in this paper to determine the entropy weights of the indicators step 1 the weight of each indicator under a specific design rainfall scenario was calculated that is the decision matrix with 31 5 values four sets of weights were obtained from four design rainfalls fig 8 fig 8 shows that the same indicator had different entropy weights under different rainfall recurrence periods as the indicator weights directly affect the judgment of the resilience benefit of the program and it is clear from the above results that the resilience weights of the indicator are not the same for different return period conditions the resilience of the programs different return period rainfall conditions are therefore different however the selection of a scheme cannot be judged based on the resilience benefit under one return period rainfall condition alone but requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple return periods of rainfall therefore the paper incorporates the return period into the consideration of resilience weights for a more recent study in step 2 the entropy weights of each indicator in each scenario of the evaluation object were calculated there were 31 evaluation objects 5 indexes and 4 evaluation scenarios therefore the decision matrix consisted of a total of 31 5 4 values by applying eqs 3 9 the entropy weight w j t j r c p f f h f d f n t 2 y r 5 y r 10 y r 20 y r was determined which considers both rainfall and the hydrological response table 5 based on the results w fd w fn w fh w rc w pf the entropy weight of pf was the largest after considering all design rainfall scenarios and that of fd was the smallest the order w 2 y r w 5 y r w 10 y r w 20 y r indicates that the greater the design rainfall return period is the larger the entropy weight for the resilience process the system has the highest weight of 0 498 in the absorption phase the second highest weight of 0 311 in the resistance phase and the lowest weight of 0 191 in the recovery phase 4 4 resilience benefit of different program configurations the corresponding programs were obtained according to the formula for calculating resilince benefit and the results are shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 the combined deployment scenario of large and micro programs is more effective in improving the resilience capacity of the system the solution with the greatest resilience benefit is the combined deployment all of large and micro programs rc ct rg rb pp with a resilience benefit of 0 323 the solution with the least resilience benefit is river lake control rc with a resilience of only 0 058 a difference of 4 6 times between the two the program with resilience benefit greater than 0 3 accounts for 19 of the total number of programs with 83 of the combined deployment of large and micro programs the resilience between 0 2 and 0 3 accounted for 51 6 of the total number of programs of which 68 were combined deployment programs of large and micro measures and the only individual program deployment was the conduit transformation ct the resilienc benefit of less than 0 2 accounted for 29 of the total number of programs of which 44 were individual measure programs and the same 44 were the combined deployment of both programs most of which were combinations of river lake controll rc and micro scale programs the combined deployment of large and micro programs compensate for each other s shortcomings in the resilience phase of the system for example conduit transformation ct can enhance the resilience of the system in the resisting and recovery phase while micro measures can enhance the resilience of the system in the absorption phase therefore the combined solution has higher resilience benefit than the individual measure solutions and is more advantageous in dealing with heavy rainfall in addition the resilience benefit of the river lake control rc was not high when deployed individually indicating that concentrating on increasing the storage volume without increasing the water surface rate is not effective in improving the resilience of the system 4 5 unit annual average cost of programs the cost information of the low impact development involved in the study refers to the domestic and international literature on the pricing of low impact development liu et al 2015 li et al 2017 and the cost information of the pipeline network renovation measures is based on the market price of the local municipal pipeline construction the unit annual average cost for single program is shown in table 6 table 6 shows that the present value cost pvc for the measures are from largest to smallest rain garden conduit transformation permeable pavement river lake control rain barrel rg ct pp rc rb however in terms of the unit annual average cost uaac the difference in life cycle between the measures leads to a difference in the magnitude of the unit annual average cost uaac for the different measures with the unit annual average cost uaac for river lake control rc being relatively low the unit annual average cost for each program is shown in table 7 below 4 6 identification of the optimal program configurations for urban planners and designers the selection of programs takes into account both their cost and value therefore the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit of the program are included in the decision matrix as important indicators when making decisions firstly the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit are assigned using the entropy weighting method at this point the indicator matrix is x x ik 31 2 where i is still the individual deployment program k are the two indicators of the program i e the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit the calculated weights for the resilience benefit and unit annual average cost uaac are 0 79 and 0 21 respectively the combined resilience of programs were calculated using the topsis method and the results are shown in table 8 table 8 contains two types of resilience ranking with scenario a which considers solely the resilience benefit of the deployment program in response to rainfalls ranked based on the magnitude of the resilience benefit and scenario b which considers both the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit of deployment programs ranked based on the relative closeness of the topsis calculation in consideration of meeting the need to reflect local urban flood control needs as accurately as possible and in consultation with experts the comprehensive resilience rating of the program has been divided into four classes high medium low and very low based on the interval of relative closeness a high resilience program when the relative closeness is 0 9 1 a medium resilience program when the relative closeness is 0 7 0 9 a low resilience program when the relative closeness is 0 5 0 7 and a very low resilience program when the relative closeness is Œ∑ i 0 5 as can be seen from table 8 there is a clear difference between the ranking of programs based on the resilience benefit and the ranking of programs that consider both resilience benefit unit annual average cost the program with the highest combined resilience changes from a combination of all measures rc ct rg rb pp to pp rb rg ct while the program with the lowest combined resilence remains unchanged at rc comparing the a and b options together the results show that there is a large variation in the options between the high resilience rating bands in the programs ranked 1 8 the combination program pp rg rb and rg rb rc in category a does not appear in the same interval as category b they are replaced by the combination program rc ct rg and pp rg ct respectively these programs vary across levels between high and medium resilience levels the order of the remaining programs is based on variations between the same class intervals the above results show that the unit annual average cost has an impact on the overall resilience of the program the cost of the project is also one of the factors that must be taken into account for the construction of the project therefore the choice of the programs should be determined by the overall resilience there are eight programs available to improve the resilience of the system in the face of heavy rainfall which is ranked according to their overall resilience as follows 1 pp rb rg ct 2 rc ct rg rb pp 3 rc ct rg rb 4 rg rb ct 5 pp rb rg rc 6 rc ct rg 7 rc ct pp rg 8 pp rg ct 5 conclusions urban flood resistance strategies are no longer the best approach to flood hazard mitigation and increasing the resilience of cities to cope with heavy rainfall attacks is increasingly becoming a key strategy to reduce the impact of urban flooding this paper proposes a new way of evaluating urban flood control programs and creates a methodological framework focusing on improving urban flood control system resilience the framework considers the use of a numerical model of urban flooding that can simulate the hydrological processes of urban response to rainfall events in a system configuration of programs moreover resilience benefit was built to quantitatively analyze programs from the perspective of comprehensively improving the resilience capacity of the system which helps to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of programs from the resilience process and provides the theoretical basis and technical support for the decision making of urban flooding control the results show that the hydrological indicators reflecting the resilience process absorption resistance recovery of the system have different weights during the same rainfall event moreover the index weightis affected by rainfall and the weightalso changes when the system responds to rainfall in different return periods in addition the indicator weightsare influenced by rainfall and change as the system responds to rainfall with different return periods rainfall return periods can influence the effectiveness of a program in improving the resilience of the system at various stages and in addition there are differences in the extent to which different programs are affected by the return period to scientifically measure the performance of the configuration options the interaction between system resilience and rainfall should be fully considered research on the methodological framework can make it a valuable tool in urban planning it can be used to measure the changes in resilience obtained through multi scale configuration urban flood control programs and to help city planners to choose the optimal configuration thereby contributing to the urban planning and disaster reduction decision making process finally it is important to highlight that this work is based on the local hydrologic environment and includes several infrastructures on multi scale urban flood control programs however other programs such as river dredging and additional water conservancy projects could also be chosen according to the needs of the city the combination of the ecological benefits that can be derived from the implementation of the program as well as the reduction of economic losses due to disasters will allow for a wide range of actions to support resilient urban planning and construction in addition this study only considers the disturbance of urban flood control systems by rainfall factors and as urbanization continues to progress changes in urban impermeability are bound to affect the system therefore changes in the impermeable surface area of the city will be used to interfere with the system this is to refine the framework for the evaluation of resilience benefits given the current gaps and further steps in this study it is also important to analyze trends in the resilience benefits of urban flood control programs in the event of future changes in urban impermeability it will be interesting to develop a resilient strategy that suits the changing environment funding this research is funded by the shandong agricultural university

2917,urban flood frequencies have increased and will continuously increase due to global climate change and rapid urbanization causing enormous economic problems and social impact resistant strategies are no longer the best option for disaster mitigation improving cities resilience to external disruptions is becoming a more important method for mitigating the impact of urban flooding however there are relatively little research has been conducted on the resilience of urban flood control systems the introduction of the concept of resilience can provide a new way of thinking for urban flood control research which can help to understand the coping process of the system during heavy rainfall emphasizing the absorption resistance and recovery stages to improve the system s adaptability to the changing environment and effectively alleviate the pressure of urban flooding this study discusses the impact of the design and configuration of urban flood control programs on the resilience of the system under heavy rainfall moreover the resilience benefit is presented to quantify the phased process of system resilience capacity for measuring the quantitative relationship between programs and system resilience finally the unit annual average cost of the program is combined with the resilience benefit to make decisions and ensure that cities are effectively reducing the risk of urban flooding with the optimal alternatives the proposed framework was applied to zhangjiagang city a highly urbanized and densely populated city in china the results showed that 1 during the same rainfall event the hydrological indicators characterizing the system s resilience process absorption resistance and recovery have distinct weights 2 rainfall has an effect on the index weight and the weight fluctuates when the system responds to rainfall in distinct return periods 3 rainfall return periods can have an impact on a program s effectiveness in improving the system s resilience at various stages and the extent to which different programs are affected by the return period varies and 4 combining large scale and micro scale programs improve the resilience of the system more effectively whereas concentrating on expanding storage volume without raising the water surface rate improves the resilience of the system less effective this framework can be used to assess the improvements in resilience acquired from various urban flood control program configurations and to assist city planners in selecting the optimal configuration so assisting in the decision making process for urban planning and disaster mitigation keywords resilience benefit urban flood urban flood control system urban flood control program multi scale optimal configuration data availability no data was used for

increasingly serious water problems such as shortages floods and water pollution from 1980 to 2000 the number of floods increased by 230 worldwide and the number of affected people affected rose by

water disasters lawrence et al 2013 on the other hand with an increase in urbanization the impermeable area of urban surfaces has also increased constantly causing very low rainfall infiltration rates a smoother urban surface than the natural one and high rates of runoff and confluence these factors greatly affect both infiltration and runoff in the hydrological cycle jacobson 2011 line and white

2012 zhang et al 2011 the concept of resilience originated from ecology during the 1970s holling 1973 holling 1996 defined engineering resilience as the ability to maintain a stable state of a system and ecological resilience as the ability to transform into another stable state generally the concept of resilience refers to the ability of a system to resist absorb or recover from disturbances such as extreme floods or droughts and or timely and effectively adapt to changes in extreme environments or under different conditions such as climate change or urbanization bertilsson et al 2019 rezende et al 2019 sayers et al 2013 the resilience strategy refers to the approach that can increase and consolidate the resilience of the urban water management uwm cope with uncertain disturbances and adapt to various changes vis et al 2003 zevenbergen et al 2008 uwm resilience strategies include two types of measures the first type includes structural measures bowker 2007 choi et al 2010 kuhlicke 2013 mainly involving materials used in uwm such as urban drainage systems casal campos et al 2018 and green infrastructure systems mei et al 2018 the other type involves non structural measures such as adaptive governance hegger et al 2014 and social learning pahl wostl et al 2007 adaptive governance and social learning have been identified as essential for controlling social ecological systems during periods of sudden change buijs et al 2018 pahl wostl 2009 some measures of resilience strategies have been proposed from the perspective of learning and adaptation in the previous literature berkes et al 2008 nelson et al 2007 our research focuses on structure measures for resilience strategies in urban flood control systems and attempts to provide a quantitative measurement of resilience in complex external environments which can be considered in decision making processes in recent years the quantitative evaluation of resilience has been the focus of uwm the concept of an evaluation index system has been successfully constructed to gauge resilience in uwm these studies divide the way the indicator system is constructed into two categories according to whether or not external environmental such as rapid urbanization or climate change influences are taken into account the first type ignores the impact of changes in the external environment and uses the current situation to construct a system of indicators in terms of social ecological infrastructural economic institutional and hazard aspects to study current flood management strategies and their effectiveness in reducing flood losses and assessing flood resilience batica and gourbesville 2016 kotzee and reyers 2016 kusumastuti et al 2014 yawen et al 2020 kusumastuti et al 2014 used the ratio of disaster preparedness representing the ability to overcome disasters and vulnerability representing the risk of facing disasters to calculate the resilience of disaster prone areas they used 49 preparedness indicators and 18 vulnerability indicators batica and gourbesville 2016 developed a matrix for the resilience evaluation of flood risk management with 91 indicators this type of resilience assessment framework generally requires a sufficiently large number of indicators covers a wide range of areas and the data sources are mostly visits and surveys it is therefore more complex to construct and not easily operationalized the second way to construct an index system is to investigate urban drainage system resilience under increasing urbanization or and climate change bertilsson et al 2019 liu et al 2012 miguez and ver√≥l 2017 climate change and urbanization may cause more unexpected system failures and bring greater risks to local people and property vojinovic et al 2014 zhou 2014 moreover climate change is altering the hydrological cycle in many areas leading to increased rainfall intensity and changes in rainfall patterns as well as an increased likelihood of extreme weather events urbanization exacerbates flooding by increasing impervious areas and changing runoff pathways if urban planners and designers ignore these external environmental factors the design standards of urban drainage systems will increase the probability of urban flood disasters rezende et al 2019 rezende et al 2019 proposed the urban flood resilience index to quantitatively determine urban flood resilience the index takes into account the residual risk of infrastructure which is described as the risk of failure of structural systems or the risk of flooding being greater than the risk used to design defenses plate 2002 the study compares flood behaviors depth flow velocity and flood duration under different drainage system conditions e g large and concentrated reservoirs or minor and distributed reservoirs by performing simulations for several hydrological events with different rainfall return periods mugume et al 2015 developed a global resilience analysis method which combined link fault degree and fault duration in a resilience index they used it to quantify the residual function of the urban drainage system under internal structure damage caused by cumulative link failures this indicator system requires simpler indicators mostly physical indicators that can characterize the behavior of floods can usually be simulated using hydrological models and takes into account the uncertainty of future environments in previous studies the weights of resilience indicators are usually defined through consultation expert opinions or even simple equal weights bertilsson et al 2019 kusumastuti et al 2014 rezende et al 2019 this subjective weighting method which largely depends on the knowledge experience and preference of experts or local characteristics of social systems leads to great uncertainty of index weights in this paper we propose a relatively simple objective weighting method called entropy weighting which uses the amount of information provided by the entropy value of each indicator to determine its weight the design and preference of urban flood control programs should consider enhancing the adaptability of the urban flood control system in building sustainable cities dong et al 2017 in recent years low impact development has been deemed an effective and flexible adaptation strategy for the addition of infiltration detention storage and purification of rainwater at the source area bedan and clausen 2009 dunnett et al 2008 jin et al 2010 these procedures are often used to supplement conventional drainage systems given their more sustainable focus on the environment li et al 2019 palanisamy and chui 2015 wang et al 2018 generally low impact development consists of microscale sustainability based practices such as green roofs permeable pavements bio retention cells rain barrels and vegetative swales wang et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 palla and gnecco 2015 on the contrary a large scale scheme refers to drainage networks river channels and city water bodies tavakol davani et al 2016 which mitigate urban floods by enhancing drainage capacity and increasing urban water surface rate and storage capacity urban flood control programs have been planned regionally in an increasing number of urban areas as a state of the art element in new urban areas or as a retrofit in old urban areas fang et al 2017 fryd et al 2013 in previous rainwater management literature comparative studies were conducted on the performance of the above two scales of programs in reducing the risk of urban flooding casal campos et al 2015 xie et al 2017 wang et al 2017 urban flood control programs are widely adopted over the world with numerous possible variations for example more than 30 cities in china are promoting the new sponge cities concept in urban flood control and implemented programs of more than us 10 billion within three years li et al 2016 zhang and chui 2018 therefore the optimal configuration of these program changes becomes increasingly important and should be carefully considered during the planning process however due to the complex interaction between programs and the environment optimizing its configuration is very challenging if the resilience of the urban flood control system could be incorporated as a key objective in the optimal configuration of urban flood control programs the performance of the configuration program can be demonstrated by the system resilience once the system resilience conveys the message that future conditions are not negatively affected by the configuration of current programs this will make an important contribution to a sustainable system by creating a quantitative measure of an index called resilience benefit which aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of programs on the response process of system when cities experience heavy rainfall we aim to provide a practical framework for quantitative analysis that can be used as a support tool for urban planning and decision making for the present flood control requirements in china s small and medium sized cities four rainfall scenarios were created and a numerical model of urban flooding was used to simulate the system s behavior the resilience benefit of various configurations of programs was evaluated the costs of programs are also considered to ensure that the program is optimized to effectively reduce the risk of urban flooding the proposed framework was applied to the city of zhangjiagang to test its performance and assess its usage in guiding the optimal program selection for urban flood prevention and control zhangjiagang is located in the taihu lake basin downstream of the yangtze river in china it is a typical basin where the hydrological processes are influenced by population growth and human intervention zhangjiagang faces problems common to developing countries the construction of the urban flood control system does not correspond with economic and social development further the city is vulnerable to the threat of severe urban flooding to gradually improve urban flood prevention and drainage capacity the municipal government plans to upgrade and transform the system adding some microscale sustainable infrastructures in combination with the city s development 2 study area and data the study area is the center of a riverside city zhangjiagang which is located on the southwest bank in the lower reaches of the yangtze river china 31 43 12 32 02 n 120 21 57 120 52 e fig 1 this highly urbanized area is located in the central and southern part of zhangjiagang city with a high population density high gdp and land area of 257 2 km2 the topography is relatively flat and there are abundant river systems in the humid climate zone in the south of the subtropical zone with a mild climate abundant rainfall and a distinct climate of four seasons over the past 50 years the average annual rainfall in zhangjiagang has been 1065 4 mm which is concentrated from may september from the historical flood disasters of zhangjiagang it can be seen that under the influence of its hydro meteorological and topographic conditions both prolonged plum rain and high intensity typhoon are meteorological factors inducing urban flood disasters in particular during the two periods of heavy rainfall in 2011 and 2015 the roads in zhangjiagang were seriously flooded especially in the central urban area frequent urban flood disasters reflected the deficiency of the traditional urban flood control system which only relies on the pipe drainage system to reduce the urban flooding disaster some microscale sustainable practices and large scale infrastructures will be applied for the first time in the study area the study of resilience in the multi scale configuration of the system in urban areas has reference value for the decision making of urban water management the data used in this study were mainly provided by zhangjiagang water resources bureau including terrain data river networks data ponding area distributions sluice pump station locations and dispatching rules the land use type distribution and proportions were obtained from the zhangjiagang city master plan 2011 2030 the characteristics of the drainage network were extracted from the rainwater planning map of downtown zhangjiagang the yangshe precipitation station is located in the center of the study area it is a stable site with a long rainfall data record a series of daily rainfall and hourly rainfall distribution data of the rainfall station in the study area from 1981 to 2015 was selected hourly real time river water level observation data were obtained from the dongheng river hydro junction the spatial distribution of the river networks and locations of the yangshe precipitation station and dongheng river hydro junction are shown in fig 1 3 methodology 3 1 resilience benefit formulation since the current method of resilience analysis of urban water systems has a single selection of indicators the weighting of the indicators is determined subjectively therefore this paper proposes a new analysis method resilience benefit firstly the concept of resilience is introduced into the responding process of the urban flood control system when the city is hit by a rainfall and this process is defined as the system resilience process the resilience of the system is then divided into three stages absorb resist and recover and the corresponding indicators are selected the indicators are used to characterize the resilience of the system at each stage and the entropy weighting method is used to determine the weights of the indicators for each stage at different return periods by weighting the summation of the relative increases in resilience capacity at each stage the combined effect of the implementation of the urban flood control program on the resilience capacity of the system is finally determined the purpose of the proposed resilience benefit is to provide a scientific basis for flood control decisions by rationalizing the selection of urban flood control programs from the perspective of comprehensively improving the resilience of the system the basic framework of the resilience benefit is shown in fig 2 in this paper the resilient coping process of the system is divided into three stages the indicators for each stage are as follows i absorption stage the initial stage of a disturbance event in urban flood control systems is the absorption stage during which the system demonstrates its ability to absorb external disturbances for the system possible disturbance events include rainfall and changes in the urban underlying surface this paper focuses on the resilience process of the system after it has been exposed to rainfall the runoff coefficient rc is an important parameter for the volume of urban rainfall production the magnitude of the peak flow pf reflects the retention of higher flow runoff by the system therefore rc and pf are used to characterize the ability to absorb external disturbances during the absorption stage of the system ii resistance stage after the absorption stage rainfall that cannot be absorbed forms the urban flood and the system can withstand the disturbance continuously for a period of time when it is in direct contact with the urban flood the flood node fn and flood depth fd are used to indicate the capacity of the system in its resistance stage iii recovery stage the stage is the process that begins when an overload occurs on the system and continues until it is fully restored to normal this stage is represented by the flooding hour fh which is the time from the start of overflow at a node to the end of the period when the overflow volume drops to zero with the new definition the resilience benefit is an integrated consideration of the rainfall conditions for different return periods and the overall resilience process i e the combined effect of the scheme on the resilience capacity of the systems under the influence of different rainfall return periods the formulation of the resilience benefit resb is then as follows 1 resb t Œ¥ r c t w rc t Œ¥ p f t w pf t Œ¥ f n t w fn t Œ¥ f d t w fd t Œ¥ f h t w fh t where t is the different return periods of rainfalls Œ¥ r c t Œ¥ p f t Œ¥ f n t Œ¥ f d t Œ¥ f n t and Œ¥ f h t represent the relative reduction in rc pf fn fd and fh in the study area before and after the deployment of the system for a given return period respectively Œ¥ represents the relative increase in the resilience of the system w rc t w pf t w fn t w fd t and w fh t represent the weights of each indicator in the resilience process for different rainfall return periods a positive Œ¥ value indicates that the implementation of the scheme enhances the resilience of the system and a larger value indicates that the scheme has a greater impact on the resilience of the systems 3 2 numerical model of urban flooding this study applies swmm storm water management model which is a dynamic rainfall runoff simulation model that computes runoff quantity and quality from primarily urban areas it was developed by the united states environmental protection agency epa the swmm simulates various hydrologic processes including precipitation interception infiltration evapotranspiration snow melting overland flow interflow between groundwater and drainage systems burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 chui et al 2016 in addition the low impact development module in the swmm model can simulate the hydrological response of various source control measures e g rain gardens permeable pavement rain barrels bio retention cells green roofs infiltration trenches vegetative swales rooftop disconnection the model can be used to track and simulate the water quality and quantity of runoff generated in each sub basin at any time at different time steps as well as the water flow water depth and water quality in each pipeline and channel the swmm is used worldwide for the planning analysis and design of rainfall combined sewers and other drainage systems in urban areas worldwide rossman 2015 zahmatkesh et al 2015 the model meets the needs of urban underlying surface reconstruction in modern rainwater management some of the variables required in the resilience benefit formulation in this paper are taken from the swmm simulation results such as the runoff coefficient i e rc the peak flow pf the number of overflow nodes i e fn and so on the cad layout of the urban drainage network was used to extract the pipe data into arcgis determine the pipe network alignment generate inspection wells and complete the pipe network data framework combined with the digital elevation model dem of the study area the flow direction of the road and the drainage network divide the sub catchment area the flow direction slope and length of the stormwater pipes in the study area were obtained with the help of arcgis the basic information of the pipes and inspection wells was processed and analyzed using arcgis and finally converted into swmm inp format in this paper the horton equation was used to estimate infiltration losses and a nonlinear reservoir approach and manning s equation were used to represent the rainfall runoff progress dynamic wave theory was used to solve the saint venant flow equations xu et al 2012 for flow routing because of the dense network of rivers in the study area and the uncertainty of the flow the boundary conditions are difficult to determine considering the stability of the boundary conditions and the integrity of the natural water system the generalization was extended to the south central urban area with a total of 1043 sub catchments 658 drainage pipes and 250 river sections the model generalization diagram is shown in fig s1 the hydrological parameters of the swmm model refer to measured and empirical values rossman 2015 the ranges of the module parameters in the model are listed in supplementary material table s1 parameter calibration is an important content in hydrologic simulation research and it can determine the model parameter values applicable to the study area to realize the reliable simulation of the study area the swmm model was calibrated and verified by comparing the measured and simulated water levels of the dongheng rive hydro junction the model can be fitted well by adjusting the above mentioned sensitive parameters the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 was used to estimate the degree of matching between the simulated and observed water levels based on the following eq 2 2 nse 1 i 1 n h i sim h i obs i 1 n h i obs h ave 2 2 where h i sim refers to the simulated water level at time i h i obs represents the observed water level at the same time and h ave is the mean observed water level 3 3 weighting methods for indicators in this paper the entropy weighting method is used to determine the weights of each indicator required for the resilience benefit calculation the concept of entropy was first introduced in information theory by shannon 1948 in information theory entropy measures objectively the amount of information an increase in the amount of information means a decrease in entropy the entropy weight method is a method to determine the weight using the concept of entropy weights are determined according to the degree of diversification of the information provided by the measured value of the attribute hsu and hsu 2008 for example an attribute does not function much when all alternatives have similar values for that attribute chen 2019 ji et al 2015 zou et al 2006 based on this weighting method the interference of human factors can be avoided and the evaluation results become more realistic delgado and romero 2016 in this paper the weight of entropy was used to indicate the roles of various hydrological indicators in measuring the resilience benefit of urban flood control programs let 3 x x ij m n be the matrix of original indicator values where are the number of evaluating objects n the number of the evaluating indicators and x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n the value of the indicator for the i th object the decision matrix is normalized in order to eliminate the influence of the different scales of the indicators on the program decisions the normalization of the original matrix is given as 4 v v ij m n if the normalization is given by 5 v ij x ij min x j max x j min x j then bigger indicator values are better if the normalization is given by 6 v ij max x j x ij max x j min x j v ij 0 1 then smaller indicator values are better the characteristic ratio p ij of v ij is given as 7 p ij v ij i 1 m v ij and the entropy value of j th indicator is defined as 8 e j 1 ln m i 1 m p ij ln p ij ultimately the weight of entropy is defined as 9 w j 1 e j j 1 n e j 3 4 design configurations for urban flood control programs in this paper the urban flood control program were divided into two categories according to the area with controlled rainwater micro scale and large scale the design of the micro scale programs refer to the technical guide for sponge cities construction of lid mei et al 2018 permeable pavement was adopted to replace the traditional impermeable ground which increases the storage of rainfall runoff and soil infiltration it is suitable for pedestrian streets squares and open parking spaces in urban areas the rain barrel as a low cost and high efficiency construction measure of a sponge city as it collects the rainwater from the roof for use has small location requirements and is mostly used in residential areas the design of rain gardens combines the landscape architecture concept with both runoff control functions and landscape effects because the rain garden has high requirements concerning land characteristics and a relatively big area must be transformed the transformation cost is relatively high thus the rain gardens are usually located in residential areas schools business districts and factories because the strength and density of buildings in the ponding area place certain restrictions on the arrangement of microscale practices the above mentioned three microscale infrastructures with small building and site requirements were chosen for this study large scale programs play significant roles in the storage and discharge of urban floods within a certain range from the perspective of the urban basin urban drainage and river systems are large scale programs large scale programs used in this paper include conduit transformations and the increase of water storage capacities referred to as river lake control the capacity of the drainage system depends on many factors such as the diameter slope siltation and connection of the drainage network which affect its drainage capacity therefore the main methods of conduit transformations include increasing the downstream conduit diameters cleaning up the conduit depositions and repairing the reverse slopes of conduit systems in addition the surface rate of the original artificial lake was expanded in this study to increase the city s water storage capacity determining sizing and siting options of low impact development within the watershed depends on not only characteristics such as elevation slope soil type and land cover but also the existing drainage network and areas of high runoff potential joyce et al 2017 according to the technical guide for sponge cites construction of low impact development for established urban areas the placement of urban flood control systems should be problem oriented mohurd 2014 therefore historical ponding areas and each sub catchment with an impermeable ratio of more than 50 in the study area were used to arrange micro scale programs fig s1 micro scale programs were deployed according to the specific characteristics and land use types of the sub catchment in the study area mei et al 2018 the design parameters corresponding to the micro scale programs were set regarding the research results of previous scholars kong et al 2017 peng et al 2015 as listed in table 1 based on the above mentioned methods used to set up multi scale programs 31 configurations of programs were designed including areas with microscale infrastructures length of conduit modifications and increased storage volumes table 2 3 5 design rainfall scenarios urban flood control programs are typically designed based on rainfall conditions with a certain duration intensity and frequency the duration of the designed rainfall has a great influence on its intensity and processes according to the hydrologic calculation principle the total duration of the designed rainfall should not be less than the catchment time in general when calculating the confluence within the city limits the maximum confluence time does not exceed 24 h local historical rainfall data are often used for statistical calculations e g frequency analysis to obtain design rainfalls probability distributions were used to correlate the severity of rainfall events with the return period in this paper a 24 h rainfall process with four return periods 2 yr 5 yr 10 yr and 20 yr was used to meet the design requirements of flooding drainage awadallah 2015 rahman et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2018 the maximum 1 3 6 12 and 24 hr rainfall data from 1981 to 2015 at the rainfall station yangshe precipitation station in the study area were obtained by the annual maximum method and the design rainfall of different duration in different recurrence periods was calculated by the pearson type iii frequency distribution curve the spatial attenuation of precipitation is considered and the point precipitation is transformed according to the areal reduction factor of the storm and flood atlas of jiangsu province to obtain the temporal distribution of the design surface precipitation under different recurrence periods the analysis of the historical heavy rainfall data that caused serious flood disasters in the study area shows that the main rainy season of 1991 has a large amount of rainfall high intensity and bad rain patterns which are not conducive to flood control safety of the study area therefore the 24 hour rainfall process from 22 00 on june 30 to 22 00 on july 1 1991 was selected as the typical rainfall process the 24 hour design rainfall process under different return periods was obtained by scaling according to the same frequency method technical details regarding the design rainfall inference process can be found in the literature code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering mohurd 2016 the 24 hr rainfall process in different recurrence periods is shown in fig 3 and the y axis in the log scale with base two 3 6 cost estimating methods cost control of the program is also an important aspect to consider in urban design planning life cycle cost analysis lcca is used to calculate the cost of a product throughout its life cycle from product construction and design to operation and maintenance o m the present value cost pvc considers all costs associated with the measure from a system perspective including initial cost operation maintenance cost and salvage value according to the life cycle cost analysis approach the present value of costs is calculated as follows 10 pvc c init t 0 n f r t c o m t f r n s v n where cint is the cost of the project at the initial stage assuming that the construction cost of all measures is linearly related to the number of measures c o m t is the annual o m cost in year t where the o m cost of each measure in the thesis is calculated as a percentage of the initial construction cost f r t is the present value factor of the discount rate at year t in the future and f r n is the present value factor of the discount rate r at the end of the design life of n years s v n is the residual value that can be recovered at the end of the design life of the measure and is assumed to be linearly related to the o m costs calculated as follows 11 s v n 1 i n c o m where i is the interval between the last maintenance year and the design life year based on previous research the value of i for the paper is taken as 1 following the principles of sponge city construction the permeable pavement rain garden rain barel and conduit transformations involved in the paper have been incorporated into existing or mandatory infrastructure so it can be assumed that the land cost of such programs is zero in addition the river lake control increases the volume of river and lake storage through dredging and expansion of the lake bottom without increasing the water surface ratio and without incurring land costs the initial cost is calculated as follows 12 c init c const c d p c const refers to the construction cost of the measure c d p refers to the design and planning cost of the measure calculated as a percentage of the construction cost the present value factors f r t and f r n are calculated as follows 13 f r t 1 1 r t r is taken to be 5 according to the latest monetary policy of the central bank in china the unit annual average cost uaac is introduced because of the different life cycles of the different programs eq 13 14 uaac p v c n 3 7 optimal selection method of urban flood control programs to help decision makers in the selection of optimal configuration urban flood control programs the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis method is used in this study to calculate the relative closeness of each alternative scheme this can be used to represent the comprehensive resilience of programs topsis is a systematic evaluation method for decision making when there are multi attributes cables et al 2012 kelemenis and askounis 2010 krohling and campanharo 2011 topsis simultaneously considers the weighted euclidean distances to both the positive ideal solution pis and the negative ideal solution nis and a preference order is ranked according to their relative closeness shih et al 2007 in this study 31 programs were ranked by topsis to make a well informed decision under unit annual average cost and resilience benefit the decision matrix is presented as follows 15 x x 11 x 12 x 21 x 22 x m 1 x m 2 where x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n since the evaluation indicators are unit annual average cost and resilience benefit n 2 for resilience benefit indicators i e the higher the value of the indicator the better the evaluation result the normalization is given by eq 16 16 v ij x ij min x j max x j min x j 0 v ij 1 then for unit annual average cost indicators i e the lower the value of the indicator the better the evaluation result the normalization is given by eq 17 17 v ij max x j x ij max x j min x j 0 v ij 1 the weighted decision matrix is constructed as 18 r r ij m n 19 r ij w i v ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 where w i was calculated by above eq 9 and v ij was calculated by above eq 5 and eq 6 the piss s j benefits and niss s j costs are identified as follows 20 s j max 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 1 min 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 2 21 s j min 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 1 max 1 i m r ij j 1 2 n j j 2 where j 1 and j 2 represent the criteria benefit and cost respectively the euclidian distances from the pis and the nis for alternative x i formulas are calculated as follows 22 s d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 m 23 s d i j 1 n s j r ij 2 i 1 m the relative closeness Œ∑ i for each alternative x i with respect to pis is then given as eq 24 24 Œ∑ i s d i s d i s d i i 1 m by ranking the alternatives according to the value Œ∑ i the relative closeness is obtained to represent the alternatives performance achievement within their states a higher value Œ∑ i corresponds to better performance in this paper the relative closeness Œ∑ i can be used to represent the combined resilience of each program the higher value Œ∑ i indicates that the program has both high resilience benefit and relatively low unit annual average cost the best configuration of programs is those that have the highest value Œ∑ i 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation one specific rainfall event aug 13 2011 was used for calibration and another rainfall event jun 2 2015 was used for validation the model performances are listed based on the water level of the dongheng river hydro junction in table 3 and illustrated in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that the simulated water level diagram for the calibration event is an acceptable representation of the observed water level the timing and water level were predicted reasonably well as indicated by the nse index value of 0 93 table 3 fig 4 b shows that the simulated water level accurately reproduces the change process of the observed water level and the nse index value was 0 83 table 3 during model calibration and validation an nse index greater than 0 7 indicated that the predicted time series was in good agreement with the monitored time series bennis and crobeddu 2007 the above mentioned calibration and verification results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the constructed urbanization process the best fit parameters are shown in table 4 4 2 indicator changes in the resilience process the results of the scenario simulations are discussed in terms of the resilience process the current state of the urban flood control system is used as a reference to analyze how the different urban flood control programs behave in terms of the resilience process and how the resilience of the system changes when subjected to different return periods 4 2 1 absorption stage the results are shown in fig 5 for the absorption stage of the resilience process based on the current status of the system means no additional programs and the impact of implementing different programs on the rc and pf in the study area under different rainfall return period conditions as shown in fig 5 the rc and pf in the study area are dominated by the micro scale programs when the large scale programs are deployed in combination with the micro scale programs and their evolutionary characteristics with the return period are the same as when the micro scale programs are deployed alone as the role of the conduit transformations in the process of confluence after runoff formation and is not involved in the process of runoff generation and the river lake control is based on the original artificial lake the storage volume is expanded through bottom dredging and does not change the original water surface rate therefore the control of runoff is not changed the micro scale programs are designed to control runoff at the source and can effectively reduce the rc and achieve control of pf therefore the micro scale programs provide a stronger increase in the resilience of the system than the large scale program during the absorption phase of the resilience process in addition the ranking of the micro scale urban flood control programs changes significantly under different rainfall scenarios both for rc and pf in the study area it shows that the effectiveness of the micro scale programs in improving system resilience is affected by the rainfall return periods 4 2 2 resistance stage the resistance stage of the resilience process is illustrated in fig 6 based on the existing state of the system and the effect of adopting various programs on the fn and fd in the study region under various rainfall return periods conditions in contrast to the absorption stage both large scale and micro scale programs are effective in the resistance to the disturbance phase fig 6 conduit transformations has a more significant effect in the resistance stage with the greatest impact on fn and fd the conduit transformations has the most direct impact on the nodes as it increases the pipe diameter and enhances the water transfer capacity of the pipe in addition as the response characteristics of the two types of programs to the return period are different there is no clear pattern in the extent to which fn and fd are affected by the return period when large programs are deployed in combination with micro scale programs and more diverse deployment programs e g pp rg ct 4 2 3 recovery stage based on the current status of the system and the influence of adopting different programs on the fh in the research region under varied rainfall return period conditions the results are given in fig 7 for the recovery stage of the resilience process fig 7 shows that both large scale and micro scale programs contribute to the recovery stage of the system with conduit transformations being the most significant in the recovery stage and significantly increasing the capacity of the combined programs in which it is located as conduit transformations enhances the capacity of the pipeline it reduces the overflow time at the node in addition the effect of the program on fh changes as the return period increases indicating that the increase in resilience of each program to the recovery stage of the system is influenced by rainfall and that the extent to which the program are influenced by rainfall varies the above results indicate that there are differences in the performance of progrms at different stages of the resilience process and that the effect of multi scale programs on improving the resilience of the system under different recurrence period rainfall conditions shows irregularities all these factors add difficulty and uncertainty to the selection of programs therefore to avoid falling into a decision making dilemma caused by the stripping of the evaluation results of each indicator this paper assigns resilience weights to the indicators characterizing the resilience stages analyses in depth the intrinsic links between the indicators and the degree of determination of the attributes of the strategy s merits and demerits and uses the objective assignment method to assign weights to the indicators 4 3 entropy weights of the indicators in previous studies the weights of the indicators used to characterize system resilience have usually been determined through consultation expert opinion or even simple equal weighting bertilsson et al 2019 kusumastuti et al 2014 rezende et al 2019 as this subjective method of assigning weights has more human uncertainties this paper uses the entropy method to determine the weights of the indicators more objectively to determine the effects of the urban flood control programs on system resilience response progress two steps were used in this paper to determine the entropy weights of the indicators step 1 the weight of each indicator under a specific design rainfall scenario was calculated that is the decision matrix with 31 5 values four sets of weights were obtained from four design rainfalls fig 8 fig 8 shows that the same indicator had different entropy weights under different rainfall recurrence periods as the indicator weights directly affect the judgment of the resilience benefit of the program and it is clear from the above results that the resilience weights of the indicator are not the same for different return period conditions the resilience of the programs different return period rainfall conditions are therefore different however the selection of a scheme cannot be judged based on the resilience benefit under one return period rainfall condition alone but requires a comprehensive consideration of multiple return periods of rainfall therefore the paper incorporates the return period into the consideration of resilience weights for a more recent study in step 2 the entropy weights of each indicator in each scenario of the evaluation object were calculated there were 31 evaluation objects 5 indexes and 4 evaluation scenarios therefore the decision matrix consisted of a total of 31 5 4 values by applying eqs 3 9 the entropy weight w j t j r c p f f h f d f n t 2 y r 5 y r 10 y r 20 y r was determined which considers both rainfall and the hydrological response table 5 based on the results w fd w fn w fh w rc w pf the entropy weight of pf was the largest after considering all design rainfall scenarios and that of fd was the smallest the order w 2 y r w 5 y r w 10 y r w 20 y r indicates that the greater the design rainfall return period is the larger the entropy weight for the resilience process the system has the highest weight of 0 498 in the absorption phase the second highest weight of 0 311 in the resistance phase and the lowest weight of 0 191 in the recovery phase 4 4 resilience benefit of different program configurations the corresponding programs were obtained according to the formula for calculating resilince benefit and the results are shown in fig 9 as can be seen from fig 9 the combined deployment scenario of large and micro programs is more effective in improving the resilience capacity of the system the solution with the greatest resilience benefit is the combined deployment all of large and micro programs rc ct rg rb pp with a resilience benefit of 0 323 the solution with the least resilience benefit is river lake control rc with a resilience of only 0 058 a difference of 4 6 times between the two the program with resilience benefit greater than 0 3 accounts for 19 of the total number of programs with 83 of the combined deployment of large and micro programs the resilience between 0 2 and 0 3 accounted for 51 6 of the total number of programs of which 68 were combined deployment programs of large and micro measures and the only individual program deployment was the conduit transformation ct the resilienc benefit of less than 0 2 accounted for 29 of the total number of programs of which 44 were individual measure programs and the same 44 were the combined deployment of both programs most of which were combinations of river lake controll rc and micro scale programs the combined deployment of large and micro programs compensate for each other s shortcomings in the resilience phase of the system for example conduit transformation ct can enhance the resilience of the system in the resisting and recovery phase while micro measures can enhance the resilience of the system in the absorption phase therefore the combined solution has higher resilience benefit than the individual measure solutions and is more advantageous in dealing with heavy rainfall in addition the resilience benefit of the river lake control rc was not high when deployed individually indicating that concentrating on increasing the storage volume without increasing the water surface rate is not effective in improving the resilience of the system 4 5 unit annual average cost of programs the cost information of the low impact development involved in the study refers to the domestic and international literature on the pricing of low impact development liu et al 2015 li et al 2017 and the cost information of the pipeline network renovation measures is based on the market price of the local municipal pipeline construction the unit annual average cost for single program is shown in table 6 table 6 shows that the present value cost pvc for the measures are from largest to smallest rain garden conduit transformation permeable pavement river lake control rain barrel rg ct pp rc rb however in terms of the unit annual average cost uaac the difference in life cycle between the measures leads to a difference in the magnitude of the unit annual average cost uaac for the different measures with the unit annual average cost uaac for river lake control rc being relatively low the unit annual average cost for each program is shown in table 7 below 4 6 identification of the optimal program configurations for urban planners and designers the selection of programs takes into account both their cost and value therefore the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit of the program are included in the decision matrix as important indicators when making decisions firstly the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit are assigned using the entropy weighting method at this point the indicator matrix is x x ik 31 2 where i is still the individual deployment program k are the two indicators of the program i e the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit the calculated weights for the resilience benefit and unit annual average cost uaac are 0 79 and 0 21 respectively the combined resilience of programs were calculated using the topsis method and the results are shown in table 8 table 8 contains two types of resilience ranking with scenario a which considers solely the resilience benefit of the deployment program in response to rainfalls ranked based on the magnitude of the resilience benefit and scenario b which considers both the unit annual average cost and resilience benefit of deployment programs ranked based on the relative closeness of the topsis calculation in consideration of meeting the need to reflect local urban flood control needs as accurately as possible and in consultation with experts the comprehensive resilience rating of the program has been divided into four classes high medium low and very low based on the interval of relative closeness a high resilience program when the relative closeness is 0 9 1 a medium resilience program when the relative closeness is 0 7 0 9 a low resilience program when the relative closeness is 0 5 0 7 and a very low resilience program when the relative closeness is Œ∑ i 0 5 as can be seen from table 8 there is a clear difference between the ranking of programs based on the resilience benefit and the ranking of programs that consider both resilience benefit unit annual average cost the program with the highest combined resilience changes from a combination of all measures rc ct rg rb pp to pp rb rg ct while the program with the lowest combined resilence remains unchanged at rc comparing the a and b options together the results show that there is a large variation in the options between the high resilience rating bands in the programs ranked 1 8 the combination program pp rg rb and rg rb rc in category a does not appear in the same interval as category b they are replaced by the combination program rc ct rg and pp rg ct respectively these programs vary across levels between high and medium resilience levels the order of the remaining programs is based on variations between the same class intervals the above results show that the unit annual average cost has an impact on the overall resilience of the program the cost of the project is also one of the factors that must be taken into account for the construction of the project therefore the choice of the programs should be determined by the overall resilience there are eight programs available to improve the resilience of the system in the face of heavy rainfall which is ranked according to their overall resilience as follows 1 pp rb rg ct 2 rc ct rg rb pp 3 rc ct rg rb 4 rg rb ct 5 pp rb rg rc 6 rc ct rg 7 rc ct pp rg 8 pp rg ct 5 conclusions urban flood resistance strategies are no longer the best approach to flood hazard mitigation and increasing the resilience of cities to cope with heavy rainfall attacks is increasingly becoming a key strategy to reduce the impact of urban flooding this paper proposes a new way of evaluating urban flood control programs and creates a methodological framework focusing on improving urban flood control system resilience the framework considers the use of a numerical model of urban flooding that can simulate the hydrological processes of urban response to rainfall events in a system configuration of programs moreover resilience benefit was built to quantitatively analyze programs from the perspective of comprehensively improving the resilience capacity of the system which helps to comprehensively understand the effectiveness of programs from the resilience process and provides the theoretical basis and technical support for the decision making of urban flooding control the results show that the hydrological indicators reflecting the resilience process absorption resistance recovery of the system have different weights during the same rainfall event moreover the index weightis affected by rainfall and the weightalso changes when the system responds to rainfall in different return periods in addition the indicator weightsare influenced by rainfall and change as the system responds to rainfall with different return periods rainfall return periods can influence the effectiveness of a program in improving the resilience of the system at various stages and in addition there are differences in the extent to which different programs are affected by the return period to scientifically measure the performance of the configuration options the interaction between system resilience and rainfall should be fully considered research on the methodological framework can make it a valuable tool in urban planning it can be used to measure the changes in resilience obtained through multi scale configuration urban flood control programs and to help city planners to choose the optimal configuration thereby contributing to the urban planning and disaster reduction decision making process finally it is important to highlight that this work is based on the local hydrologic environment and includes several infrastructures on multi scale urban flood control programs however other programs such as river dredging and additional water conservancy projects could also be chosen according to the needs of the city the combination of the ecological benefits that can be derived from the implementation of the program as well as the reduction of economic losses due to disasters will allow for a wide range of actions to support resilient urban planning and construction in addition this study only considers the disturbance of urban flood control systems by rainfall factors and as urbanization continues to progress changes in urban impermeability are bound to affect the system therefore changes in the impermeable surface area of the city will be used to interfere with the system this is to refine the framework for the evaluation of resilience benefits given the current gaps and further steps in this study it is also important to analyze trends in the resilience benefits of urban flood control programs in the event of future changes in urban impermeability it will be interesting to develop a resilient strategy that suits the changing environment funding this research is funded by the shandong agricultural university

2918,the effective drought index edi is designed to monitor and characterize the drought condition at a daily scale using the last 30 years of daily precipitation records as a climatic yardstick a critique of the edi is that the behavior of the index depends on the reference period making comparisons of edi values difficult over a long record period here a self calibrating edi scedi is calculated using the 244 year daily precipitation records 1777 2020 in seoul the republic of korea the scedi is evaluated by comparing with drought damage reports from the annals of the joseon dynasty 1807 1907 and relevant online search activity volumes from google trends and naver datalab data 2013 20 the scedi automatically calibrates the behavior of the index over time by calculating the normal condition of antecedent precipitation based on a rolling 30 year period as a result the scedi is more temporally comparable than the edi that is droughts with the same intensity have the same frequency throughout the entire record period regardless of wet and dry decades results show that a majority of drought damage records and spikes of public interest in droughts are found when droughts are moderate 1 4 of scedi and severe 2 0 respectively implying that social drought impacts response might occur during different intensities of an emerging drought this study highlights the importance of temporally self calibration when it comes to detecting and characterizing social droughts with social impact response data over multi centuries data availability i will share a data link and doi when the manuscript is accepted 1 introduction drought is defined as a period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance ams 2019 drought is classified into four types depending on their causes and major impact areas meteorological precipitation and evaporation agricultural soil moisture hydrological streamflow and reservoir water level and socio economic water use restriction and crop production reduction droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 the magnitude of an abnormal meteorological condition is determined by precipitation normalcy the normalcy of antecedent precipitation is commonly calculated over the last 30 years of the records when daily precipitation records are longer than 30 years normal precipitation conditions are calculated over the preceding 30 years to adjust for changes in climatic conditions epa 2021 there are two main advantages of using the preceding 30 years of the records when a drought index is calculated first it keeps the rarity of extreme drought conditions over the entire record period wells 2004 secondly it makes the magnitude of abnormal conditions temporally comparable for example the antecedent precipitation tool apt developed by the u s army corps of engineers usace also uses a rolling 30 year period to streamline the review of climate data https www epa gov wotus antecedent precipitation tool apt the apt is commonly used by the usace and u s environmental protection agency to supports decision making related to wetland delineations currently the rarity of extreme drought events has not been carefully considered particularly for climate change studies that a drought index is calculated based on the present day climatology throughout the entire record period failure to recognize this unique characteristic could overestimate underestimate the frequency of extreme drought events and make it difficult to compare the drought intensity over the record period epa 2021 however an extreme drought condition is defined as a naturally occurring but rare condition there is a lack of studies examining the importance of temporally self calibrating on drought detection and characterization to compare historical and future droughts over such regions using a rolling 30 year period is necessary for robust drought severity assessment common drought indices include standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 they have been used to monitor drought conditions at a monthly scale or longer mainly due to the availability of long term precipitation and other meteorological data dai 2011 spinoni et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2015 wang et al 2015 abatzoglou et al 2017 adnan et al 2018 yao et al 2018 park et al 2020a these monthly drought indices are not able to monitor the daily condition of cumulative antecedent precipitation deficits which is difficult for water resource managers and local stakeholders to make a timely response to an emerging drought also the estimates of drought characteristics based on these drought indices might be sensitive to the selected window size of mean precipitation calculation gonz√°lez and vald√©s 2006 kim et al 2009 byun and kim 2010 jain et al 2015 in the study of byun and wilhite 1999 the effective drought index edi was proposed to account for time varying accumulative period of antecedent precipitation deficits the edi is reliable to estimate the drought severity across the spatial and temporal scales e g morid et al 2006 pandey et al 2008 akhtari et al 2009 kim and byun 2009 park et al 2015 deo et al 2017a deo et al 2017b kamruzzaman et al 2019 malik et al 2021 the edi accounts for daily variations of available water resources by calculating accumulated amounts of antecedent daily precipitation with a time dependent reduction function accordingly the edi can determine the start and end date of drought duration at the daily scale however the edi uses the last 30 years of daily precipitation records as a climatic yardstick instead of a rolling 30 year period it might fail to maintain the rarity of extreme drought events and compare the characteristics of droughts over the record period this limitation of the edi is critical over regions with strong decadal multi decadal variability of precipitation for example the northeast asia climate system has decadal multi decadal variability of precipitation chiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2021 therefore drought characterization over northeast asia is sensitive to the reference period furthermore anthropogenic climate change will likely amplify or compensate natural variability of precipitation over northeast asia in the future beck et al 2018 park et al 2020b park et al 2021 to robustly assessing northeast asian droughts over a long term record e g over a century the edi needs temporally self calibrating by using the preceding 30 years of the records for normalcy of precipitation extremely severe droughts cause catastrophic socioeconomic impacts on affected communities zheng et al 2014 yu et al 2018a yu et al 2018b such socioeconomic impacts have been recorded in the documentary data drought damage reports in the documentary data are only the reference data source for validation and reconstruction of historic droughts br√°zdil et al 2018 a recent study evaluated the high resolution gridded drought index and climatic data 0 25 25 km spatial resolution for drought detection in india over 2000 2017 for the reliability evaluation of drought detection the state averages of drought index data were compared with the state wise records of historical drought declarations bhardwaj and mishra 2021 within a socio hydrologic approach changes in natural and human systems are interacted via the coupled dynamics kuil et al 2016 for example drought driven economic and ecological losses often increase the awareness interest of affected communities leading to changes in social response behavior pattern these changes in the human system consequently reduce the economic and ecological impacts of the ongoing drought in the recent decade the internet plays a role in increasing the level of awareness about an emerging drought of not only affected communities but also non affected communities through information sharing and risk communication kim et al 2019 however few studies have investigated changes of social response to drought over multiple centuries mainly due to lack of such a long record for precipitation and social impacts the annals of the joseon dynasty hereafter ajd include numerous reports of droughts and their socioeconomic impacts e g famines and epidemics for about 500 years and are a valuable documentation to understand how severe droughts were when it caused drought damage reports over the korean peninsula during the era of the joseon dynasty after the invent of chukwookee daily precipitation records at a seoul station are available over the two and half centuries from 1770 s which provides a unique research opportunity to investigate the reliability of a drought index against social drought impact records in the ajd nowadays the public is sensitive to online news and reports about the emergence of severe droughts and other disasters because of direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts on their lives kam et al 2019 ryu and min 2020 kam et al 2021a kam et al 2021b kam et al 2021c recent studies found that the levels of online search activities with a search term drought is a potential indicator of social response to an emerging drought over time kam et al 2019 kim et al 2019 this social monitoring data about online search activities have been used to understand the public interest in various natural disasters including drought gonzales and ajami 2017 kam et al 2019 kim et al 2019 flood shao and kam 2020 thompson et al 2022 air pollution ryu and min 2020 and earthquake gizzi et al 2020 kam et al 2021b therefore historical drought damage records and recent social monitoring data over the korean peninsula provide a unique opportunity to assess how the received risk of the regional community has been changed over time in this study a self calibrating edi scedi is proposed by using a rolling 30 year period the preceding 30 years when the effective precipitation normalcy is calculated the scedi is designed to adjust for multi decadal changes in precipitation normalcy which can make the scedi values comparable and maintain the rarity of extreme drought conditions over the entire record period this study aims to investigate the impact of temporally self calibrating on multi century drought assessment in this study the scientific questions are included 1 how does the scedi characterize droughts frequency intensity and duration differently from the edi 2 how consistent are extreme drought conditions detected by the scedi over the entire record period 3 how reliable is the scedi against the social impact data related to past and recent droughts the findings of this study will emphasize the importance of temporally self calibrating on the consistency of drought detection and characterization over multiple centuries in the next section the data used in this study the detailed procedure of the edi and scedi calculation and the definition of drought are described results from evaluation of the scedi and comparison with the edi are reported in section 3 in sections 4 and 5 the findings of this study are summarized and the potential applications of the scedi are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 daily precipitation data 1777 2020 the korean meteorological administration kma provides 240 year daily precipitation records of a station id 47108 in seoul the republic of korea https data kma go kr cmmn main do these records are constructed by integrating precipitation records from an ancient rain gauge chukwookee in the joseon dynasty 1777 1907 and modern rain gauge data in recent decades 1908 2020 kma 2015 due to the korean war 1950 1953 kma did not record daily precipitation data from september 1950 to december 1952 accordingly precipitation data from april 1951 to december 1952 was replaced by daily precipitation records of the air force at yeouido air base in seoul kim et al 2009 from september 1950 through march 1951 daily precipitation records were compensated by the climatological daily precipitation over 1935 1965 monthly precipitation from the seoul kma station and other 58 kma stations show a significantly positively pearson correlation coefficient 0 6 over 1979 2020 see fig s1 in supplementary materials while the stations with a strong positive correlation coefficient are mainly located near the seoul station daily edi values in seoul station also show high correlation coefficient 0 4 with other 58 kma stations except for the stations over the coastal regions 2 2 documentary data of historical droughts annals of joseon dynasty to evaluate the reliability of scedi for the social impact assessment for historical droughts we use monthly drought records in the ajd professional historiographers have maintained extensive records on national affairs and the activities including state affairs as well as diplomatic affairs the economy religion meteorological phenomena and so on in this study we use drought damage reports over 1807 1907 from the ajd the overlapped period of available daily precipitation records from chukwookee the ajd includes detailed descriptions of socioeconomic impacts and responses for example hold a ritual for rain during drought in this study the drought record count data are used which are available at the national drought information portal website https www drought go kr the ajd has been used to classify and evaluate extreme storm events over 1392 1901 yoo et al 2015 using the korean standard calendar organized by the korea institute of science and technology information kisti https manse kisti re kr english index html we also convert the date and year of drought damage reports to the gregorian calendar to investigate whether this is a certain seasonal pattern of the frequency of drought damage reports 2 3 search activity volume data google trends and naver datalab in this study monthly search activity volume data from google trends and naver datalab are retrieved from naver datalab https datalab naver com and google trends https trends google com naver and google currently occupy 60 and 25 respectively of the korean internet web search market chang 2021 they provide relative search activity volumes including a specific keyword a range between 0 and 100 it is worth noting that search activity volume is not zero even during a non drought period because korean peoples regularly use drought in search inquiries for different means from a natural disaster therefore first we compute the means of relative search activity volumes over the period of available data and then compute anomalies of search activity volumes compared to the mean values in this study we retrieved the monthly search activity volume data over 2016 2020 2013 2020 for the google trends data from the users in seoul in south korea and 2016 2020 for the naver datalab data it is worth noting that the naver datalab provides the volume data of search activities only at the national level 2 4 review of the edi calculation in this section the edi calculations proposed by byun and wilhite 1999 is revisited to calculate the edi at a gauge station first effective precipitation ep is computed by the summation of daily precipitation for a specific period weighted by the inverse of the antecedent precipitation dates eqn 1 note that the below eqns 1 12 is referred from byun and wilhite 1999 1 e p t n 1 ds m 1 n p t m n where p t m represents the antecedent daily precipitation m days before the daily time step t that is t 1 for january 1 1778 and t 88 695 243 years 365 days for december 31 2020 n is the period of the summation of the antecedent precipitation and ds is the duration of the summation for weighting the antecedent daily precipitation p t m to calculate the drought severity for example if the ds is equal to 2 because n varies from 1 to 2 e p t is calculated by the weighted antecedent precipitation of p t 1 p t 1 p t 2 2 in this study 365 is used for the dummy ds value in byun and wilhite 1999 the ds of the antecedent precipitation is initially 15 or 365 days for short term and long term drought detection respectively the ds value can be increased depending on the antecedent precipitation deficit therefore edi can account for the impact of accumulative precipitation deficits during a persistent dry spell realistically while the daily precipitation records start from january 1 1777 e p t can be computed from january 1 1778 t 1 because of the selected dummy ds value 365 for convenience the time steps t is presented in the two time dimension indices the day number k 1 365 and the calendar year y 1778 2020 eqn 2 it is worth noting that the day number range from 1 to 365 because we averaged the daily precipitation on february 29 with that of march 1 for every lunar year kim et al 2009 2 x k y x t where x k y is the interest variable on the day number k of the calendar year y then the climatology of precipitation cp is calculated from the last 30 years of records kim et al 2009 oh et al 2014 in this study the reference period for cp is from 1991 through 2020 following the eqn 2 p k y can be applied in eqn 3 before the mean of ep mep calculation eqn 4 3 c p k y 1991 2020 p k y 30 where c p k means the 30 year average of daily precipitation on the day number k of the climatological year k 1 365 which is year independent 4 m e p k n 1 ds m 1 n c p k m n in eqn 4 c p k m can be repeatedly applied in a periodic fashion depending on k and m for example m 1 3 c p 2 m is calculated by c p 1 c p 365 c p 364 the next step is to compute the deviations of ep dep using eqns 5 1 and convert them into one time dimension 5 2 5 1 d e p k y e p k y m e p k 5 2 d e p t d e p k y after computing daily deps the actual ds values d s k y can be determined based on the dep value if the dep value is negative on a certain date of the calendar year d s k y is increased by the number of consecutive days until the deps is zero or positive otherwise d s k y is still 365 it is worth noting that 30 of the study period have the initial dummy ds value 365 for edi yellow line in fig 1 despite the redundant calculation of ds the edi with this time varying ds values is eventually able to assess the drought characteristics at the sliding time scale that is time varying periods of summation of weighted antecedent precipitation therefore edi can account for cumulative precipitation deficits within a different time window size depending on the persistency of each drought event instead of the cumulative deficit within a fixed 365 day window when all the actual d s k y for each daily time step is determined ep and mep should be re calculated with the actual d s k y the calculations of dep with the actual ds value dep a are required through eqns 6 8 6 ep a k y ep a t n 1 d s t m 1 n p t m n 7 mep a k y n 1 d s k y m 1 n c p k m n 8 dep a k y ep a k y mep a k y next the mean and standard deviation for dep with the actual ds value and the edi are computed from eqns 9 to 12 9 dep c k y c n 1 d s k y m 1 n p k y c m n n 1 d s k y m 1 n c p k m n 10 dep c k y y c 1991 2020 dep c k y c 30 11 s t d dep c k y y c 1991 2020 dep c k y c dep c k y 2 30 12 edi a k y dep a k y s t d dep c k y in eqn 9 yc stands for the last 30 years of the records which is from 1991 through 2020 therefore depc k y is the dep value using the fixed climatological years 1991 through 2020 with the specific ds value on the kth day of a clander year y the edia is computed by normalizing depa by the standard deviation of depc which makes the range of edia spatially consistent across the stations the negative positive value of the edia indicates how anomalously dry wet the current condition is compared to the chosen climatology 2 5 calculation of self calibrating edi scedi the scedi is a modified version of edi using a rolling 30 year period the preceding 30 years for the calculation of mep and dep climatology fig 2 shows the difference between the scedi and edi for rmep and mep calculations respectively the scedi can adjust automatically for changes in precipitation climatology self calibrating changes mainly the estimates of c p k m e p k mep a and std dep c while e p t is still computed using eqn 1 13 r c p k y l y 29 y p k l 30 where l is a rolling 30 year period depending on y year using a rolling 30 year period avoids the bias in the edi based drought severity assessment based on the present day climatology the mep values over a rolling 30 year period r m e p are computed with the dummy ds value 365 using eqn 14 r c p k y is repeatedly applied in a periodic fashion like eqn 4 14 r m e p k y n 1 ds m 1 n r c p k m y n the dep with the moving time windows rdep are computed using eqn 15 15 r d e p k y e p k y r m e p k y to take an advantage of the strength of edi time varying dry durations depending on antecedent precipitation surplus deficit the actual ds values for each time step d s k y are calculated after computing r d e p k y therefore the calculations of dep for moving time window with the actual ds values rdep a are required through eqns 6 16 and 17 it is worth noting that 48 of the study period have the initial dummy ds value 365 for scedi black line in fig 1 16 rmep a k y n 1 d s k y m 1 n r c p k m y n 17 rdep a k y ep a k y rmep a k y then the means and standard deviations for rdep a k y are computed in eqns 18 20 18 rdep c k y l n 1 d s k y m 1 n p k y l m n n 1 d s k y m 1 n r c p k m y l n 19 rdep c k y l y l y 29 y rdep c k y l 30 20 s t d r dep c k y y l y 29 y rdep c k y l rdep c k y 2 30 in eqn 18 yl stands for the rolling 30 years of the records which is from 29 years before a calendar year y 29 through a calendar year y therefore rdepc k y is the rdep value using the time varying climatological years y 29 through y with the specific ds value on the kth day of a clander year y lastly the scedia with the actual ds value can be computed from eqns 21 and can be transformed from two time indices k and y to one time index t 21 scedi a k y rdep a k y s t d r dep c k y the scedi with a rolling 30 year period mathematically represent the impact of temporally self calibrating on the edi calculation using rcp and rmep in eqns 13 and 14 respectively 2 6 definition of drought to detect historical drought events the threshold values for drought onset and recovery are 0 5 and 0 5 of scedi respectively fig 3 using a higher value of scedi for drought recovery than that for drought onset we can identify the fully recovery date of the on going drought leading to reliable assessment of drought frequency and duration mo 2011 kam et al 2021a kam et al 2021b kam et al 2021c in this study drought duration is defined as the consecutive period from the start to the end days under the threshold values drought intensity is often calculated as an average of drought indices over the drought duration e g dracup et al 1980 andreadis et al 2005 ma et al 2020 however it possibly estimates the drought intensity much weaker than the real condition depending on the drought duration to overcome this weakness and consider the timing of socioeconomic impacts from droughts drought intensity is defined in this study by the minimum index value over the drought duration following the methods of previous studies kim and byun 2009 oh et al 2014 park et al 2015 deo et al 2017 kam et al 2019 based on the drought intensity droughts are categorized into three categories moderate severe and extreme drought table 1 kim and byun 2009 oh et al 2014 park et al 2015 in this study droughts with the duration of 90 days or longer are assessed the mean intensity duration are calculated by averaging intensities durations for the identified drought events within the 31 year time windows to conduct the sensitivity of the edi to the reference period the edi indices are calculated based on the three different 30 year reference periods for mep 1807 1836 hereafter edi1807 1886 1915 edi1886 and 1991 2020 edi1991 3 result 3 1 comparison of scedi and edi based drought characteristics fig 4 shows daily time series of the scedi and edi values results from the edis with different reference periods show that the characteristics of the identified droughts are sensitive to their reference period for example edi1991 detects severe and or the long sustained droughts more frequently while edi1886 and edi1807 detect moderate and short droughts more frequently the scedi clearly shows self calibration adjustment for drought characteristics over time for example the daily propagations of scedi are correlated with that of edi1807 edi1886 and edi1991 in 1830 s 1910 s and 2010 s respectively which can be identified overlapped time series in fig 4 these results confirm that scedi succeeds to self calibrate the characterization of identified drought temporally table 2 shows the total numbers of drought events and their mean intensity and duration over 1807 2020 from the scedi edi1807 edi1886 and edi1991 respectively the detected droughts by the scedi are relatively moderate compared to the detected drought by the edis the estimated drought characteristics based on scedi are between drought characteristics from edi1991 relatively severe and long sustained and edi1886 relatively moderate and short among the top five multi year droughts according to their duration and intensity please see table s1 and s2 in supplmentary materials the 1899 1903 longest and 1866 1868 lowest droughts are the most severe droughts in both the scedi and the edi1886 these long and severe droughts are still ranked in the 2nd longest and 2nd most severe droughts from edi1991 and edi1807 respectively these findings confirm that the droughts in 1899 1903 and 1866 1868 are typical mega droughts in the history of korea which is supported by catastrophic socio economic damages recorded in the documentation ndip 2021 fig 5 shows the total numbers of identified drought events by scedi and edis and their mean intensity and duration within the 31 year moving time windows over 1807 2020 results show significant different changes in the drought characteristics among three edis for example edi1807 identifies drought events frequently in 1900 s than other periods detected droughts in 1800 s show a relatively low intensity with a long duration compared with those over 20th century 1920 s 1990 s the detected droughts by edi1886 shows significant decadal change in terms of the intensity between 1950 and 1975 while the detected droughts by edi1991 are similar to those by edi1807 the drought frequency patterns are different from each other the results clearly show the impact of different precipitation climatology at the multi decadal scale on the edi based drought assessment the scedi shows that the occurrence frequency and mean intensity duration of identified droughts are temporally consistent and the impact of multi decadal decreased precipitation in early 1900 s is accounted see fig s2 in supplementary materials furthermore the sensitivity of edi based drought characteristics to the reference period for mep climatology is tested please see fig s3 in supplementary materials the results indicate that the edi based drought characteristics are arbitrarily estimated by a constraint of the length of records which can cause the reference period based bias in drought severity assessment our findings confirm that temporally self calibrating in the edi calculation is a necessary step to robustly detect and characterize drought characteristics particularly over regions with decadal multi decadal changes of precipitation 3 2 evaluations with drought damage documentary data the performance of scedi for drought detection is evaluated comparing with the socioeconomic impact reports in the ajd the histogram of the minimum scedi values is constructed based on the month of social drought impact records in ajd during 1807 1907 fig 6 in general the social drought impact records in the era of joseon dynasty are found when the scedi values are between 0 2 and 2 6 it is noteworthy that the historical drought records are found most frequently when the scedi value is around 1 4 which can be considered as the moderate drought category meanwhile social drought impact reports are found when the scedi values are positive 0 2 to 2 6 indicating the limitation of the scedi from a seoul station that other regional droughts can be missed fig 7 shows the seasonal variations of percentage for the historical drought records in the ajd and for the drought stages based on the scedi values during 1807 1907 the drought stages are determined by the definitions in fig 3 we found that the number of drought damage reports grows gradually from may and reach a peak in july which is more related to the drought onset stage fig 7a with the result from fig 6 this result suggests that the scedi is reliable for social drought impact assessment in the era of the joseon dynasty 3 3 social response of drought via online search to investigate recent temporal changes of social response to an emerging drought the scedi values are compared with the level of the public interest over 2013 2017 fig 8 a over this period the 2013 16 drought is included which is the 2nd long lasted and severe drought over the entire study period see please see tables s1 s2 in supplementary materials according to the scedi the 2013 16 drought event was initiated in the late summer of 2013 persisted until the winter of 2015 and was recovered in the spring of 2016 during this period a large volume of internet search activities was found particularly when the scedi value reaches about 2 0 june and july 2015 indicating a high level of the public awareness of the on going drought the high volume of online search activities continued in the winter of 2015 it is worth noting that although the summer of 2016 shows a normal climatic condition the public interest in drought is relatively higher than other years the drought reemerged in about the late summer of 2016 and was terminated in the summer of 2017 internet search activities about droughts was significantly increased in may 2017 and persisted until july 2017 when the drought was rapidly recovered which is in line with the findings of kam et al 2019 that severe california storms and floods in early 2017 surged the level of public awareness of drought when californians wonder whether the ongoing drought would continue or retreat histograms for the number of days of certain scedi is constructed with different levels of the public interest fig 8b most of high internet search activity volumes are in a range of scedi values between 1 5 and 2 5 results show that high online search activity volumes greater than40 the maximum value is 100 are often found when the scedi is near 2 0 interestingly the days with high internet search activity volumes greater than60 occurred most frequently when the scedi values range from 2 0 through 2 5 in other words the level of public awareness about the on going drought is low until it is categorized into a severe drought state the number of days of scedi value greater than 0 0 are related to the rapid recovery stage of drought in july 2017 fig 8a these results indicate the social response to an emerging drought was not in a timely manner and the role of the government in increasing the level of the public s drought awareness was missing during the 2013 16 drought the results suggest that with daily drought monitoring information more efficient risk communication between the government and communities are warranted for future drought mitigation overall the scedi values related to the socioeconomic response are different in the era of the joseon dynasty and the recent decade as aforementioned while the drought damage records in joseon dynasty are found when the drought is moderate 1 4 of scedi online search activities with the search term drought are the maximum when an emerging drought is severe about 2 0 this may imply that the threshold values of drought index to detect socioeconomic droughts can vary over time depending on the socioeconomic structure and resilience of the affected nations and communities we speculate that a possible reason for the different threshold values between the past and the present periods may be change in socioeconomic structures from agriculture based to industrial based society over the south korean peninsula however potential reasons should be further investigated through studies with a more comprehensive socioeconomic data or over other countries which is beyond the scope of this study 4 discussion standardized indices are useful to investigate changes in the characteristics of future droughts and associated risk directly compared to the current past climatology however these standardized drought indices such as edi and spi are designed under the assumption of stationarity it is a matter of the time window size to determine whether the system is stationary or not the global hydroclimate system has been non stationary due to anthropogenic influence milly et al 2008 if a regional climate system experiences non stationarity due to climate change then the frequency of moderate severe and extreme droughts will be significantly increased for example 15 87 of the edi values are expectedly below 1 moderate drought in a regional climate system if the regional climate system becomes warmer and drier that is non stationary then droughts become more frequent regardless of the severity in other words more than 15 87 of the edi values are below 1 however the frequency of droughts with 1 of scedi is statistically consistent 15 87 since it is calculated the time varying climatology via a rolling 30 year period this statistical consistency of scedi makes possible to track changes in coupled dynamics between the nature and human systems during the occurrence of a drought considering changes in climatological normalcy and resilience of affected communities under non stationarity of the regional climate system and technology development of social systems therefore temporally self calibrating is necessary for drought driven social impact assessment particularly at multi decadal and century scales previous studies using the multi century daily precipitation records from the seoul kma mainly investigated the characteristics of historic mega droughts and exceptional storm events over the korean peninsula jhun and moon 1997 wang et al 2006 wang et al 2007 kim et al 2009 kim et al 2011 this study introduced big data from documentary records and online information search activities to investigate the timeliness of social response to different stages onset persistence and recovery of historical droughts this comparison between drought detection and associated social impact response advanced understanding how the social response to drought have been changed between the joseon dynasty and modern era long term daily precipitation records at least 30 years are required for scedi calculation the long term daily precipitation data are available over limited regions around the world mainly europe and north america when edi was proposed lately multiple long term global daily precipitation data 1950 to present from in situ measurement menne et al 2012 contractor et al 2016 and reanalysis data kobayashi et al 2015 hersbach et al 2020 are available therefore scedi is now applicable for global drought monitoring and characterization the scedi is calculated by the precipitation alone following the edi calculation however scedi with the 365 day initial ds value captures well propagations of water thickness anomalies and simulated root zone soil moisture anomalies over the south korean peninsula from the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on remotely sensed data https grace jpl nasa gov data get data and the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas respectively please see fig s4 in supplementary materials this implies that scedi with the 365 day initial ds value accounts for propagations of soil moisture and water thickness due to the accumulation of daily precipitation deficit which is useful for those regions where the long term daily precipitation data but not soil moisture and hydrologic data to monitor agricultural and hydrologic droughts 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of self calibrating on edi using multi century daily precipitation records from the seoul kma station in the southern korean peninsula the proposed scedi in this study broadens the utility of the edi for social drought detection which is the least understood type of drought advanced knowledge about social behavior pattern during the occurrence of a drought can help policy makers water resources managers and local stakeholders develop proactive drought mitigation response and preparation plans in a timely manner this study provides an insight of how social drought can be detected with a combination of drought index data and social monitoring data herein social impact reports or online social monitoring data in the cyberspace this study suggest a timely need for further investigation of social droughts with traditional survey and interview data which will provide more practical guidelines for drought mitigation and eventually transform our society to be drought ready data availability statement daily precipitation data

2918,the effective drought index edi is designed to monitor and characterize the drought condition at a daily scale using the last 30 years of daily precipitation records as a climatic yardstick a critique of the edi is that the behavior of the index depends on the reference period making comparisons of edi values difficult over a long record period here a self calibrating edi scedi is calculated using the 244 year daily precipitation records 1777 2020 in seoul the republic of korea the scedi is evaluated by comparing with drought damage reports from the annals of the joseon dynasty 1807 1907 and relevant online search activity volumes from google trends and naver datalab data 2013 20 the scedi automatically calibrates the behavior of the index over time by calculating the normal condition of antecedent precipitation based on a rolling 30 year period as a result the scedi is more temporally comparable than the edi that is droughts with the same intensity have the same frequency throughout the entire record period regardless of wet and dry decades results show that a majority of drought damage records and spikes of public interest in droughts are found when droughts are moderate 1 4 of scedi and severe 2 0 respectively implying that social drought impacts response might occur during different intensities of an emerging drought this study highlights the importance of temporally self calibration when it comes to detecting and characterizing social droughts with social impact response data over multi centuries data availability i will share a data link and doi when the manuscript is accepted 1 introduction drought is defined as a period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance ams 2019 drought is classified into four types depending on their causes and major impact areas meteorological precipitation and evaporation agricultural soil moisture hydrological streamflow and reservoir water level and socio economic water use restriction and crop production reduction droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 the magnitude of an abnormal meteorological condition is determined by precipitation normalcy the normalcy of antecedent precipitation is commonly calculated over the last 30 years of the records when daily precipitation records are longer than 30 years normal precipitation conditions are calculated over the preceding 30 years to adjust for changes in climatic conditions epa 2021 there are two main advantages of using the preceding 30 years of the records when a drought index is calculated first it keeps the rarity of extreme drought conditions over the entire record period wells 2004 secondly it makes the magnitude of abnormal conditions temporally comparable for example the antecedent precipitation tool apt developed by the u s army corps of engineers usace also uses a rolling 30 year period to streamline the review of climate data https www epa gov wotus antecedent precipitation tool apt the apt is commonly used by the usace and u s environmental protection agency to supports decision making related to wetland delineations currently the rarity of extreme drought events has not been carefully considered particularly for climate change studies that a drought index is calculated based on the present day climatology throughout the entire record period failure to recognize this unique characteristic could overestimate underestimate the frequency of extreme drought events and make it difficult to compare the drought intensity over the record period epa 2021 however an extreme drought condition is defined as a naturally occurring but rare condition there is a lack of studies examining the importance of temporally self calibrating on drought detection and characterization to compare historical and future droughts over such regions using a rolling 30 year period is necessary for robust drought severity assessment common drought indices include standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 and palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 they have been used to monitor drought conditions at a monthly scale or longer mainly due to the availability of long term precipitation and other meteorological data dai 2011 spinoni et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2015 wang et al 2015 abatzoglou et al 2017 adnan et al 2018 yao et al 2018 park et al 2020a these monthly drought indices are not able to monitor the daily condition of cumulative antecedent precipitation deficits which is difficult for water resource managers and local stakeholders to make a timely response to an emerging drought also the estimates of drought characteristics based on these drought indices might be sensitive to the selected window size of mean precipitation calculation gonz√°lez and vald√©s 2006 kim et al 2009 byun and kim 2010 jain et al 2015 in the study of byun and wilhite 1999 the effective drought index edi was proposed to account for time varying accumulative period of antecedent precipitation deficits the edi is reliable to estimate the drought severity across the spatial and temporal scales e g morid et al 2006 pandey et al 2008 akhtari et al 2009 kim and byun 2009 park et al 2015 deo et al 2017a deo et al 2017b kamruzzaman et al 2019 malik et al 2021 the edi accounts for daily variations of available water resources by calculating accumulated amounts of antecedent daily precipitation with a time dependent reduction function accordingly the edi can determine the start and end date of drought duration at the daily scale however the edi uses the last 30 years of daily precipitation records as a climatic yardstick instead of a rolling 30 year period it might fail to maintain the rarity of extreme drought events and compare the characteristics of droughts over the record period this limitation of the edi is critical over regions with strong decadal multi decadal variability of precipitation for example the northeast asia climate system has decadal multi decadal variability of precipitation chiang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 sun et al 2021 therefore drought characterization over northeast asia is sensitive to the reference period furthermore anthropogenic climate change will likely amplify or compensate natural variability of precipitation over northeast asia in the future beck et al 2018 park et al 2020b park et al 2021 to robustly assessing northeast asian droughts over a long term record e g over a century the edi needs temporally self calibrating by using the preceding 30 years of the records for normalcy of precipitation extremely severe droughts cause catastrophic socioeconomic impacts on affected communities zheng et al 2014 yu et al 2018a yu et al 2018b such socioeconomic impacts have been recorded in the documentary data drought damage reports in the documentary data are only the reference data source for validation and reconstruction of historic droughts br√°zdil et al 2018 a recent study evaluated the high resolution gridded drought index and climatic data 0 25 25 km spatial resolution for drought detection in india over 2000 2017 for the reliability evaluation of drought detection the state averages of drought index data were compared with the state wise records of historical drought declarations bhardwaj and mishra 2021 within a socio hydrologic approach changes in natural and human systems are interacted via the coupled dynamics kuil et al 2016 for example drought driven economic and ecological losses often increase the awareness interest of affected communities leading to changes in social response behavior pattern these changes in the human system consequently reduce the economic and ecological impacts of the ongoing drought in the recent decade the internet plays a role in increasing the level of awareness about an emerging drought of not only affected communities but also non affected communities through information sharing and risk communication kim et al 2019 however few studies have investigated changes of social response to drought over multiple centuries mainly due to lack of such a long record for precipitation and social impacts the annals of the joseon dynasty hereafter ajd include numerous reports of droughts and their socioeconomic impacts e g famines and epidemics for about 500 years and are a valuable documentation to understand how severe droughts were when it caused drought damage reports over the korean peninsula during the era of the joseon dynasty after the invent of chukwookee daily precipitation records at a seoul station are available over the two and half centuries from 1770 s which provides a unique research opportunity to investigate the reliability of a drought index against social drought impact records in the ajd nowadays the public is sensitive to online news and reports about the emergence of severe droughts and other disasters because of direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts on their lives kam et al 2019 ryu and min 2020 kam et al 2021a kam et al 2021b kam et al 2021c recent studies found that the levels of online search activities with a search term drought is a potential indicator of social response to an emerging drought over time kam et al 2019 kim et al 2019 this social monitoring data about online search activities have been used to understand the public interest in various natural disasters including drought gonzales and ajami 2017 kam et al 2019 kim et al 2019 flood shao and kam 2020 thompson et al 2022 air pollution ryu and min 2020 and earthquake gizzi et al 2020 kam et al 2021b therefore historical drought damage records and recent social monitoring data over the korean peninsula provide a unique opportunity to assess how the received risk of the regional community has been changed over time in this study a self calibrating edi scedi is proposed by using a rolling 30 year period the preceding 30 years when the effective precipitation normalcy is calculated the scedi is designed to adjust for multi decadal changes in precipitation normalcy which can make the scedi values comparable and maintain the rarity of extreme drought conditions over the entire record period this study aims to investigate the impact of temporally self calibrating on multi century drought assessment in this study the scientific questions are included 1 how does the scedi characterize droughts frequency intensity and duration differently from the edi 2 how consistent are extreme drought conditions detected by the scedi over the entire record period 3 how reliable is the scedi against the social impact data related to past and recent droughts the findings of this study will emphasize the importance of temporally self calibrating on the consistency of drought detection and characterization over multiple centuries in the next section the data used in this study the detailed procedure of the edi and scedi calculation and the definition of drought are described results from evaluation of the scedi and comparison with the edi are reported in section 3 in sections 4 and 5 the findings of this study are summarized and the potential applications of the scedi are discussed 2 data and methods 2 1 daily precipitation data 1777 2020 the korean meteorological administration kma provides 240 year daily precipitation records of a station id 47108 in seoul the republic of korea https data kma go kr cmmn main do these records are constructed by integrating precipitation records from an ancient rain gauge chukwookee in the joseon dynasty 1777 1907 and modern rain gauge data in recent decades 1908 2020 kma 2015 due to the korean war 1950 1953 kma did not record daily precipitation data from september 1950 to december 1952 accordingly precipitation data from april 1951 to december 1952 was replaced by daily precipitation records of the air force at yeouido air base in seoul kim et al 2009 from september 1950 through march 1951 daily precipitation records were compensated by the climatological daily precipitation over 1935 1965 monthly precipitation from the seoul kma station and other 58 kma stations show a significantly positively pearson correlation coefficient 0 6 over 1979 2020 see fig s1 in supplementary materials while the stations with a strong positive correlation coefficient are mainly located near the seoul station daily edi values in seoul station also show high correlation coefficient 0 4 with other 58 kma stations except for the stations over the coastal regions 2 2 documentary data of historical droughts annals of joseon dynasty to evaluate the reliability of scedi for the social impact assessment for historical droughts we use monthly drought records in the ajd professional historiographers have maintained extensive records on national affairs and the activities including state affairs as well as diplomatic affairs the economy religion meteorological phenomena and so on in this study we use drought damage reports over 1807 1907 from the ajd the overlapped period of available daily precipitation records from chukwookee the ajd includes detailed descriptions of socioeconomic impacts and responses for example hold a ritual for rain during drought in this study the drought record count data are used which are available at the national drought information portal website https www drought go kr the ajd has been used to classify and evaluate extreme storm events over 1392 1901 yoo et al 2015 using the korean standard calendar organized by the korea institute of science and technology information kisti https manse kisti re kr english index html we also convert the date and year of drought damage reports to the gregorian calendar to investigate whether this is a certain seasonal pattern of the frequency of drought damage reports 2 3 search activity volume data google trends and naver datalab in this study monthly search activity volume data from google trends and naver datalab are retrieved from naver datalab https datalab naver com and google trends https trends google com naver and google currently occupy 60 and 25 respectively of the korean internet web search market chang 2021 they provide relative search activity volumes including a specific keyword a range between 0 and 100 it is worth noting that search activity volume is not zero even during a non drought period because korean peoples regularly use drought in search inquiries for different means from a natural disaster therefore first we compute the means of relative search activity volumes over the period of available data and then compute anomalies of search activity volumes compared to the mean values in this study we retrieved the monthly search activity volume data over 2016 2020 2013 2020 for the google trends data from the users in seoul in south korea and 2016 2020 for the naver datalab data it is worth noting that the naver datalab provides the volume data of search activities only at the national level 2 4 review of the edi calculation in this section the edi calculations proposed by byun and wilhite 1999 is revisited to calculate the edi at a gauge station first effective precipitation ep is computed by the summation of daily precipitation for a specific period weighted by the inverse of the antecedent precipitation dates eqn 1 note that the below eqns 1 12 is referred from byun and wilhite 1999 1 e p t n 1 ds m 1 n p t m n where p t m represents the antecedent daily precipitation m days before the daily time step t that is t 1 for january 1 1778 and t 88 695 243 years 365 days for december 31 2020 n is the period of the summation of the antecedent precipitation and ds is the duration of the summation for weighting the antecedent daily precipitation p t m to calculate the drought severity for example if the ds is equal to 2 because n varies from 1 to 2 e p t is calculated by the weighted antecedent precipitation of p t 1 p t 1 p t 2 2 in this study 365 is used for the dummy ds value in byun and wilhite 1999 the ds of the antecedent precipitation is initially 15 or 365 days for short term and long term drought detection respectively the ds value can be increased depending on the antecedent precipitation deficit therefore edi can account for the impact of accumulative precipitation deficits during a persistent dry spell realistically while the daily precipitation records start from january 1 1777 e p t can be computed from january 1 1778 t 1 because of the selected dummy ds value 365 for convenience the time steps t is presented in the two time dimension indices the day number k 1 365 and the calendar year y 1778 2020 eqn 2 it is worth noting that the day number range from 1 to 365 because we averaged the daily precipitation on february 29 with that of march 1 for every lunar year kim et al 2009 2 x k y x t where x k y is the interest variable on the day number k of the calendar year y then the climatology of precipitation cp is calculated from the last 30 years of records kim et al 2009 oh et al 2014 in this study the reference period for cp is from 1991 through 2020 following the eqn 2 p k y can be applied in eqn 3 before the mean of ep mep calculation eqn 4 3 c p k y 1991 2020 p k y 30 where c p k means the 30 year average of daily precipitation on the day number k of the climatological year k 1 365 which is year independent 4 m e p k n 1 ds m 1 n c p k m n in eqn 4 c p k m can be repeatedly applied in a periodic fashion depending on k and m for example m 1 3 c p 2 m is calculated by c p 1 c p 365 c p 364 the next step is to compute the deviations of ep dep using eqns 5 1 and convert them into one time dimension 5 2 5 1 d e p k y e p k y m e p k 5 2 d e p t d e p k y after computing daily deps the actual ds values d s k y can be determined based on the dep value if the dep value is negative on a certain date of the calendar year d s k y is increased by the number of consecutive days until the deps is zero or positive otherwise d s k y is still 365 it is worth noting that 30 of the study period have the initial dummy ds value 365 for edi yellow line in fig 1 despite the redundant calculation of ds the edi with this time varying ds values is eventually able to assess the drought characteristics at the sliding time scale that is time varying periods of summation of weighted antecedent precipitation therefore edi can account for cumulative precipitation deficits within a different time window size depending on the persistency of each drought event instead of the cumulative deficit within a fixed 365 day window when all the actual d s k y for each daily time step is determined ep and mep should be re calculated with the actual d s k y the calculations of dep with the actual ds value dep a are required through eqns 6 8 6 ep a k y ep a t n 1 d s t m 1 n p t m n 7 mep a k y n 1 d s k y m 1 n c p k m n 8 dep a k y ep a k y mep a k y next the mean and standard deviation for dep with the actual ds value and the edi are computed from eqns 9 to 12 9 dep c k y c n 1 d s k y m 1 n p k y c m n n 1 d s k y m 1 n c p k m n 10 dep c k y y c 1991 2020 dep c k y c 30 11 s t d dep c k y y c 1991 2020 dep c k y c dep c k y 2 30 12 edi a k y dep a k y s t d dep c k y in eqn 9 yc stands for the last 30 years of the records which is from 1991 through 2020 therefore depc k y is the dep value using the fixed climatological years 1991 through 2020 with the specific ds value on the kth day of a clander year y the edia is computed by normalizing depa by the standard deviation of depc which makes the range of edia spatially consistent across the stations the negative positive value of the edia indicates how anomalously dry wet the current condition is compared to the chosen climatology 2 5 calculation of self calibrating edi scedi the scedi is a modified version of edi using a rolling 30 year period the preceding 30 years for the calculation of mep and dep climatology fig 2 shows the difference between the scedi and edi for rmep and mep calculations respectively the scedi can adjust automatically for changes in precipitation climatology self calibrating changes mainly the estimates of c p k m e p k mep a and std dep c while e p t is still computed using eqn 1 13 r c p k y l y 29 y p k l 30 where l is a rolling 30 year period depending on y year using a rolling 30 year period avoids the bias in the edi based drought severity assessment based on the present day climatology the mep values over a rolling 30 year period r m e p are computed with the dummy ds value 365 using eqn 14 r c p k y is repeatedly applied in a periodic fashion like eqn 4 14 r m e p k y n 1 ds m 1 n r c p k m y n the dep with the moving time windows rdep are computed using eqn 15 15 r d e p k y e p k y r m e p k y to take an advantage of the strength of edi time varying dry durations depending on antecedent precipitation surplus deficit the actual ds values for each time step d s k y are calculated after computing r d e p k y therefore the calculations of dep for moving time window with the actual ds values rdep a are required through eqns 6 16 and 17 it is worth noting that 48 of the study period have the initial dummy ds value 365 for

and rmep in eqns 13 and 14 respectively 2 6 definition of drought to detect historical drought events the threshold values for drought onset and recovery are 0 5 and 0 5 of scedi respectively fig 3 using a higher value of scedi for drought recovery than that for drought onset we can identify the fully recovery date of the on going drought leading to reliable assessment of drought frequency and duration mo 2011 kam et al 2021a kam et al 2021b kam et al 2021c in this study drought duration is defined as the consecutive period from the start to the end days under the threshold values drought intensity is often calculated as an average of drought indices over the drought duration e g dracup et al 1980 andreadis et al 2005 ma et al 2020 however it possibly estimates the drought intensity much weaker than the real condition depending on the drought duration to overcome this weakness and consider the timing of socioeconomic impacts from droughts drought intensity is defined in this study by the minimum index value over the drought duration following the methods of previous studies kim and byun 2009 oh et al 2014 park et al 2015 deo et al 2017 kam et al 2019 based on the drought intensity droughts are categorized into three categories moderate severe and extreme drought table 1 kim and byun 2009 oh et al 2014 park et al 2015 in this study droughts with the duration of 90 days or longer are assessed the mean intensity duration are calculated by averaging intensities durations for the identified drought events within the 31 year time windows to conduct the sensitivity of the edi to the reference period the edi indices are calculated based on the three different 30 year reference periods for mep 1807 1836 hereafter edi1807 1886 1915 edi1886 and 1991 2020 edi1991 3 result 3 1 comparison of scedi and edi based drought characteristics fig 4 shows daily time series of the scedi and edi values results from the edis with different reference periods show that the characteristics of the identified droughts are sensitive to their reference period for example edi1991 detects severe and or the long sustained droughts more frequently while edi1886 and edi1807 detect moderate and short droughts more frequently the scedi clearly shows self calibration adjustment for drought characteristics over time for example the daily propagations of scedi are correlated with that of edi1807 edi1886 and edi1991 in 1830 s 1910 s and 2010 s respectively which can be identified overlapped time series in fig 4 these results confirm that scedi succeeds to self calibrate the characterization of identified drought temporally table 2 shows the total numbers of drought events and their mean intensity and duration over 1807 2020 from the scedi edi1807 edi1886 and edi1991 respectively the detected droughts by the scedi are relatively moderate compared to the detected drought by the edis the estimated drought characteristics based on scedi are between drought characteristics from edi1991 relatively severe and long sustained and edi1886 relatively moderate and short among the top five multi year droughts according to their duration and intensity please see table s1 and s2 in supplmentary materials the 1899 1903 longest and 1866 1868 lowest droughts are the most severe droughts in both the scedi and the edi1886 these long and severe droughts are still ranked in the 2nd longest and 2nd most severe droughts from edi1991 and edi1807 respectively these findings confirm that the droughts in 1899 1903 and 1866 1868 are typical mega droughts in the history of korea which is supported by catastrophic socio economic damages recorded in the documentation ndip 2021 fig 5 shows the total numbers of identified drought events by scedi and edis and their mean intensity and duration within the 31 year moving time windows over 1807 2020 results show significant different changes in the drought characteristics among three edis for example edi1807 identifies drought events frequently in 1900 s than other periods detected droughts in 1800 s show a relatively low intensity with a long duration compared with those over 20th century 1920 s 1990 s the detected droughts by edi1886 shows significant decadal change in terms of the intensity between 1950 and 1975 while the detected droughts by edi1991 are similar to those by edi1807 the drought frequency patterns are different from each other the results clearly show the impact of different precipitation climatology at the multi decadal scale on the edi based drought assessment the scedi shows that the occurrence frequency and mean intensity duration of identified droughts are temporally consistent and the impact of multi decadal decreased precipitation in early 1900 s is accounted see fig s2 in supplementary materials furthermore the sensitivity of edi based drought characteristics to the reference period for mep climatology is tested please see fig s3 in supplementary materials the results indicate that the edi based drought characteristics are arbitrarily estimated by a constraint of the length of records which can cause the reference period based bias in drought severity assessment our findings confirm that temporally self calibrating in the edi calculation is a necessary step to robustly detect and characterize drought characteristics particularly over regions with decadal multi decadal changes of precipitation 3 2 evaluations with drought damage documentary data the performance of scedi for drought detection is evaluated comparing with the socioeconomic impact reports in the ajd the histogram of the minimum scedi values is constructed based on the month of social drought impact records in ajd during 1807 1907 fig 6 in general the social drought impact records in the era of joseon dynasty are found when the scedi values are between 0 2 and 2 6 it is noteworthy that the historical drought records are found most frequently when the scedi value is around 1 4 which can be considered as the moderate drought category meanwhile social drought impact reports are found when the scedi values are positive 0 2 to 2 6 indicating the limitation of the scedi from a seoul station that other regional droughts can be missed fig 7 shows the seasonal variations of percentage for the historical drought records in the ajd and for the drought stages based on the scedi values during 1807 1907 the drought stages are determined by the definitions in fig 3 we found that the number of drought damage reports grows gradually from may and reach a peak in july which is more related to the drought onset stage fig 7a with the result from fig 6 this result suggests that the scedi is reliable for social drought impact assessment in the era of the joseon dynasty 3 3 social response of drought via online search to investigate recent temporal changes of social response to an emerging drought the scedi values are compared with the level of the public interest over 2013 2017 fig 8 a over this period the 2013 16 drought is included which is the 2nd long lasted and severe drought over the entire study period see please see tables s1 s2 in supplementary materials according to the scedi the 2013 16 drought event was initiated in the late summer of 2013 persisted until the winter of 2015 and was recovered in the spring of 2016 during this period a large volume of internet search activities was found particularly when the scedi value reaches about 2 0 june and july 2015 indicating a high level of the public awareness of the on going drought the high volume of online search activities continued in the winter of 2015 it is worth noting that although the summer of 2016 shows a normal climatic condition the public interest in drought is relatively higher than other years the drought reemerged in about the late summer of 2016 and was terminated in the summer of 2017 internet search activities about droughts was significantly increased in may 2017 and persisted until july 2017 when the drought was rapidly recovered which is in line with the findings of kam et al 2019 that severe california storms and floods in early 2017 surged the level of public awareness of drought when californians wonder whether the ongoing drought would continue or retreat histograms for the number of days of certain scedi is constructed with different levels of the public interest fig 8b most of high internet search activity volumes are in a range of scedi values between 1 5 and 2 5 results show that high online search activity volumes greater than40 the maximum value is 100 are often found when the scedi is near 2 0 interestingly the days with high internet search activity volumes greater than60 occurred most frequently when the scedi values range from 2 0 through 2 5 in other words the level of public awareness about the on going drought is low until it is categorized into a severe drought state the number of days of scedi value greater than 0 0 are related to the rapid recovery stage of drought in july 2017 fig 8a these results indicate the social response to an emerging drought was not in a timely manner and the role of the government in increasing the level of the public s drought awareness was missing during the 2013 16 drought the results suggest that with daily drought monitoring information more efficient risk communication between the government and communities are warranted for future drought mitigation overall the scedi values related to the socioeconomic response are different in the era of the joseon dynasty and the recent decade as aforementioned while the drought damage records in joseon dynasty are found when the drought is moderate 1 4 of scedi online search activities with the search term drought are the maximum when an emerging drought is severe about 2 0 this may imply that the threshold values of drought index to detect socioeconomic droughts can vary over time depending on the socioeconomic structure and resilience of the affected nations and communities we speculate that a possible reason for the different threshold values between the past and the present periods may be change in socioeconomic structures from agriculture based to industrial based society over the south korean peninsula however potential reasons should be further investigated through studies with a more comprehensive socioeconomic data or over other countries which is beyond the scope of this study 4 discussion standardized indices are useful to investigate changes in the characteristics of future droughts and associated risk directly compared to the current past climatology however these standardized drought indices such as edi and spi are designed under the assumption of stationarity it is a matter of the time window size to determine whether the system is stationary or not the global hydroclimate system has been non stationary due to anthropogenic influence milly et al 2008 if a regional climate system experiences non stationarity due to climate change then the frequency of moderate severe and extreme droughts will be significantly increased for example 15 87 of the edi values are expectedly below 1 moderate drought in a regional climate system if the regional climate system becomes warmer and drier that is non stationary then droughts become more frequent regardless of the severity in other words more than 15 87 of the edi values are below 1 however the frequency of droughts with 1 of scedi is statistically consistent 15 87 since it is calculated the time varying climatology via a rolling 30 year period this statistical consistency of scedi makes possible to track changes in coupled dynamics between the nature and human systems during the occurrence of a drought considering changes in climatological normalcy and resilience of affected communities under non stationarity of the regional climate system and technology development of social systems therefore temporally self calibrating is necessary for drought driven social impact assessment particularly at multi decadal and century scales previous studies using the multi century daily precipitation records from the seoul kma mainly investigated the characteristics of historic mega droughts and exceptional storm events over the korean peninsula jhun and moon 1997 wang et al 2006 wang et al 2007 kim et al 2009 kim et al 2011 this study introduced big data from documentary records and online information search activities to investigate the timeliness of social response to different stages onset persistence and recovery of historical droughts this comparison between drought detection and associated social impact response advanced understanding how the social response to drought have been changed between the joseon dynasty and modern era long term daily precipitation records at least 30 years are required for scedi calculation the long term daily precipitation data are available over limited regions around the world mainly europe and north america when edi was proposed lately multiple long term global daily precipitation data 1950 to present from in situ measurement menne et al 2012 contractor et al 2016 and reanalysis data kobayashi et al 2015 hersbach et al 2020 are available therefore scedi is now applicable for global drought monitoring and characterization the scedi is calculated by the precipitation alone following the edi calculation however scedi with the 365 day initial ds value captures well propagations of water thickness anomalies and simulated root zone soil moisture anomalies over the south korean peninsula from the gravity recovery and climate experiment follow on remotely sensed data https grace jpl nasa gov data get data and the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas respectively please see fig s4 in supplementary materials this implies that scedi with the 365 day initial ds value accounts for propagations of soil moisture and water thickness due to the accumulation of daily precipitation deficit which is useful for those regions where the long term daily precipitation data but not soil moisture and hydrologic data to monitor agricultural and hydrologic droughts 5 conclusions this study investigated the impact of self calibrating on edi using multi century daily precipitation records from the seoul kma station in the southern korean peninsula the proposed scedi in this study broadens the utility of the edi for social drought detection which is the least understood type of drought advanced knowledge about social behavior pattern during the occurrence of a drought can help policy makers water resources managers and local stakeholders develop proactive drought mitigation response and preparation plans in a timely manner this study provides an insight of how social drought can be detected with a combination of drought index data and social monitoring data herein social impact reports or online social monitoring data in the cyberspace this study suggest a timely need for further investigation of social droughts with traditional survey and interview data which will provide more practical guidelines for drought mitigation and eventually transform our society to be drought ready data availability statement daily precipitation data

2919,the estimation of catchment response time tr plays an important role in several hydrological and civil engineering design problems the non linear relationship between tr and rainfall intensity necessitates the estimation of an event based set of tr values instead of a characteristic constant value however there is no generally accepted method to define individual rainfall runoff events from time series here we propose a new automated method which results in the selection of rainfall runoff events and the corresponding tr values the proposed method yields an event based set of tr values more efficiently than other existing methods and has only two parameters the results of the new method were compared to those of a statistical and a semi manual event selection approach the latter calculates eight different tr values including the time of concentration lag time time to peak and time to equilibrium the median tr value of the proposed method yields the strongest agreement with the median of the time elapsed between the maxima of the total rainfall and runoff with a root mean square error of 4 94 h it is also demonstrated that a median time of concentration value can be estimated as the maximum of the event based tr values by the current method a sensitivity analysis explores the robustness of the proposed method and also yields the optima of its two parameters once calibrated the present automated methodology dispenses with any event selection procedure keywords catchment response time time of concentration event selection detrending moving average cross correlation analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data the code is shared at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6822134 1 introduction quantification of the catchment response to precipitation via time parameters is essential for engineering tasks such as peak flow estimation rainfall runoff modeling or flood risk environmental hazard mapping the most frequently used catchment response time tr parameters are the time of concentration tc the lag time tl the time to peak tp and the time to equilibrium te langridge et al 2020 for example the rational method chow 1988 is widely used to estimate the peak flow value to a given precipitation input and requires the calculation of tc however the estimation error of the peak flow value may reach 75 due to the uncertainty in the tc estimates bondelid et al 1982 the response time of a catchment to extreme precipitation limits the time interval available for flood defense or mitigation of environmental disasters hence its accurate estimation can also assist in disaster prevention many rainfall runoff models apply the unit hydrograph theory in some form beven 2012 therefore tc tl and tp often appear as model parameters tl in a broader context is the time between the occurrence of an event and the emergence of a response in the system of interest the same interpretation of tl can be used to estimate how long rainfall will take to be translated into runoff in a given catchment amiri et al 2019 tp is defined as the rise time of a storm hydrograph encompassing the time from the first stream contributions from a precipitation event to the arrival of the peak flow of the event langridge et al 2020 the international glossary of hydrology wmo 1974 defines tc as the period of time required for storm runoff to flow from the most remote part of a drainage basin to the outlet in this definition storm runoff is replaced with a drop of water and the most remote part becomes the furthest point in many hydrologic texts however as beven 2020 emphasizes it is not the flow velocities that should be used to define the response times in a catchment but the relevant surface subsurface and channel flow celerities or wave velocities the latter yields the te as it is obtained by integrating the celerity from upslope to a downslope outlet and can be interpreted as the time from the start of rainfall to peak response for an initially dry catchment and steady rainfall by definition since the publication of minshall s 1960 classical work on storm runoff from small experimental watersheds hydrologists agree that the rainfall runoff response is fundamentally nonlinear szilagyi 2007 minshall 1960 derived response functions for certain small catchments which showed a pronounced dependence of tl on the intensity of rainfall excess the value of tr was proven to be decreasing with increasing rainfall intensity by many authors since reed et al 1975 loukas and quick 1996 saghafian et al 2002 szilagyi 2007 zhang et al 2007 kjeldsen et al 2016 mathias et al 2016 meyersohn 2016 michailidi et al 2018 cuevas et al 2019 therefore the event based estimation may be of great use in hydrological applications such as rainfall runoff modelling or peak flow estimation these tasks are especially challenging at ungauged sites since the value of tr is usually estimated by empirical formulas however the accuracy of empirical equations can be improved with the help of more reliable observed values of tr from studies focusing on time parameter estimation methods the three main assessment procedures are based on i measured data ii hydraulic equations loukas quick 1996 liang melching 2012 sabzevari et al 2015 baiamonte singh 2016 michailidi et al 2018 and iii empirical or semi empirical formulas fang et al 2008 mccuen 2009 grimaldi et al 2012 nagy et al 2016 abdel fattah et al 2017 kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 ravazzani et al 2019 measurements can be made employing i laboratory models black 1972 zhang et al 2007 liang melching 2012 ii a tracer substance pilgrim 1976 azizian 2019 bj√∂rn rodriguez et al 2021 or iii registering rainfall and runoff data loukas quick 1996 mccuen 2009 grimaldi et al 2012 wu et al 2016 gericke smithers 2017 kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 cuevas et al 2019 ravazzani et al 2019 langridge et al 2020 giani et al 2021 tracer measurements can yield detailed information on the runoff generation process of a catchment however it is mainly adaptable to small catchments such monitoring systems can be operated only for research and not for an operational purpose pilgrim 1976 nevertheless only a tracer measurement can be considered as a direct measurement of tr the results obtained by employing laboratory models are not necessarily valid for natural catchments ga√°l et al 2012 due to the above mentioned applicability issues of tracer measurements and laboratory models the present authors chose to estimate the observed value of tr indirectly from recorded rainfall and runoff data the main disadvantages of calculating tr using observed rainfall and runoff time series are i difficulties with event selection and ii the assessment of time instants on the hyeto and hydrographs that require the separation of effective precipitation and direct runoff the event selection can be performed manually but this task is quite cumbersome and hard to reproduce especially in the case of a large dataset thiesen et al 2019 several of the automated event selection methods rely on base flow separation e g merz bl√∂schl 2009 mei anagnostou 2015 tarasova et al 2018 the main disadvantage of these methods is that base flow is an elusive process to quantify compared to other components of the water balance such as precipitation and total runoff szilagyi et al 2003 the true value of the base flow is usually unknown therefore its value can never be precisely quantified from just rainfall runoff records additionally these event selection methods may involve empirical estimation of parameters further reducing objectivity while other methods relying on machine learning require training table 1 lists some recently published automated event selection methods with their weaknesses explained considering the attributes of the available event selection approaches the statistical method of fischer et al 2021 appeared to be the most appropriate to compare the event selection capability of the proposed technique additionally a method requiring expert knowledge from here on referred to as the semi manual method and involves visual screening of the selected events is also employed in conjunction with the present one in order to ensure a base set of regular hyeto and hydrographs for the estimation of tr once the events are selected the observed value of tr can be derived for each event from temporal differences between specific time instants on the hyeto and hydrographs via so called graphical definitions although the study of response time parameters dates back more than 150 years their definition and calculation are still intricate tasks time parameters cannot be uniquely identified due to their various interpretations this is underlined by the existence of numerous graphical definitions for tc in the literature mccuen 2009 for example lists six definitions of tc out of which one is a definition of tp and two are definitions of tl even the most often used definition has two slightly different versions namely the time from the end or center of mass of rainfall excess to the end of direct runoff i e the inflection point on the total runoff hydrograph coincidentally giani et al 2021 recently published a novel method to estimate tr relatively easily and objectively from observed time series the new methodology called detrending moving average cross correlation analysis dmca introduced by giani et al 2021 greatly facilitates the calculation of tr it allows the user to estimate the characteristic value of tr from long time series while making possible the estimation of tr at the event scale using pre defined subsections of the observed data for specific events for performing the latter event selection must be done separately and beforehand the event selection approach applied by giani et al 2021 is automated but includes the empirical estimation of tl and a screening criterion regarding peak flow magnitude the present authors aim to extend the dmca based tr estimation method of giani et al 2021 by performing the event selection and estimation of a set of tr values for the selected events simultaneously this is achieved by introducing an additional parameter from here on the currently proposed method is to be referred to as event scale dmca or shortly e dmca method consequently the study presented in this paper has three main foci i validating the applicability of the proposed event scale dmca based tr estimation method for accurate event selection by comparing the results of the new approach with the results of a state of the art statistical and an expert knowledge based semi manual event selection method ii assessing the robustness and validity of the proposed range of the two parameters needed to perform the event scale dmca based tr estimation method by performing a thorough sensitivity analysis iii exploring the relationship between the event based tr values resulting from the often used graphical definitions and the event scale dmca based tr estimation toward the first goal we performed the previously mentioned semi manual event selection see section 3 1 and assessed the value of tr from each event by applying eight different graphical definitions collected from literature then the new event scale dmca based tr estimation method was applied see section 3 3 which concurrently performs the event selection and the calculation of tr using the dmca based method of giani et al 2021 obliterating the need for external event selection required by the dmca based tr estimation method next the statistics based event selection method of fischer et al 2021 was evaluated to provide a comparative basis for the event selection capability of the proposed event scale dmca based method see section 3 2 the results of the three methods were compared in terms of the event selection and tr values see sections 4 1 and 4 2 respectively the sensitivity analysis mentioned in ii is introduced in section 3 4 while its results are presented in section 4 3 a discussion on the performance of the event scale dmca based tr estimation method is provided in section 5 including a more detailed comparison of the tr values given by the graphical definitions and those obtained by the proposed method the conclusions of the present study are found in section 6 similar to giani et al 2021 the term of catchment response time tr is employed throughout the text in general and the other time parameters tc tl tp and te are specified only when it is theoretically plausible in what follows the method presented by giani et al 2021 is referred to as the dmca based tr estimation dmca method while the approach presented in this paper is called the event scale dmca based tr estimation e dmca method or proposed method the two event selection methods for testing the e dmca results are referred to as the semi manual event selection sm method and the statistics based automated flood event separation sbes method 2 study area and data in this study 61 small to medium sized hungarian catchments six of them nested were examined fig 1 provides an overview of the catchments location while relevant statistical measures are given in table 2 the list of catchments is provided in supplementary material s1 the catchment ids appearing throughout the text correspond to the ones presented in supplementary material s1 the mean catchment area is 206 km2 from a range of 8 74 810 km2 54 of the catchments are smaller than 150 km2 and 6 5 have an area larger than 500 km2 based on the high resolution copernicus land use land cover products copernicus 2020a copernicus 2020b the minimum forest coverage is 3 8 the maximum is 88 7 while the range of impervious area is 0 3 19 9 a third of the catchments are located within karst regions the dominant soil parent types are deposits glacial and alluvial loess and loess like tertiary and older deposits volcanic rocks such as andesite rhyolite and basalt dominate only in a few 5 catchments while sandstone shale and phyllite cover even fewer catchments according to the k√∂ppen climate classification peel et al 2007 hungary s climate is predominantly warm summer humid continental the time window of the study extends from 2000 to 2017 during this period the minimum amount of annual rainfall and catchment runoff were 394 and 21 1 mm respectively while the maxima were 1377 and 642 mm the aridity index varies between 0 75 and 1 25 among the catchments the catchments were delineated using the copernicus land monitoring services eu dem v1 1 digital surface model a freely available raster format dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 m copernicus 2016 high resolution 5 min discharge and precipitation time series were provided by the local water directorates for 64 and 17 stations respectively observed discharge were derived using measured water levels and rating curves the three main catchment selection criteria applied were i no considerable human influence on flow ii high temporal resolution of measurements and iii continuous record available for at least ten years similar to sauquet catalogne 2011 the first criterion was ensured by checking digital maps and consulting the local water directorates not every catchment has a rainfall gauging station near or in the catchment and sub daily precipitation data is not provided by the hungarian meteorological service free of charge to obtain interpolated values the 17 precipitation gauging stations operated by the local water directorates do not cover the whole study area therefore they could not be used to interpolate precipitation data instead european centre of medium range weather forecast ecmwf re analysis data from the copernicus climate data store were used in addition to the gauging station values for catchments without a gauging station ecmwf data were used the era5 land product copernicus climate change service 2019 provides hourly precipitation time series with a 0 1 x 0 1 9 km 9 km spatial resolution the applicability of the ecmwf re analysis data was examined separately in a previous study by nagy szilagyi 2020 where the results of the sm approach see section 3 1 for details employing measured and also re analysis data were compared at 38 catchments having or the closest assigned a precipitation gauging station we found that the ecmwf data is adequate for tr estimation especially when the centers of masses and also peaks of the observed runoff and rainfall time series are used 3 methodology 3 1 calculating catchment response time for events sm method during a previous study nagy szilagyi 2021 eight graphical definitions of tr were collected and analyzed the interpretation of definitions a h is presented in fig 2 definition a is the most often used i e conventional definition of tc and definition b is a slightly different version of the latter however definition a is much more often used definitions e and f are infrequently used i e unconventional interpretations of tc reported by mccuen 2009 not used for any other time parameter i e tl tp or te both definitions c and d stand for tl even though only definition d is correct by the unit hydrograph theory chow 1988 definition g represents tp and definition h is the te unfortunately all definitions can be found in the literature as the definition of tc wisnovszky 1958 loukas quick 1996 mccuen 2009 most of the definitions a e and g require the separation of base flow and or effective precipitation in this study the former was performed using a recursive filtering method nathan mcmahon 1990 the latter was calculated by assuming a constant rate loss and equaling the direct runoff and excess rainfall volumes known as the œÜ index method dingman 2015 this way only one parameter had to be adjusted the coefficient of the recursive filter it was manually calibrated for every catchment using the ten largest runoff events resulting from steps i ii see below and validated for the smaller events the aim of the calibration procedure by a trial and error fashion was to find a coefficient for each watershed that ensures the temporal coincidence of the end of the direct runoff and the inflection point on the recession limb the latter was identified visually on the hydrographs after the separations all eight graphical definitions were calculated the initial data set consisted of 64 catchments and 7189 events after quality control and screening see steps i vi below 2152 events remained for 61 catchments for these events the observed values of tr were derived by the eight definitions presented in fig 2 the number of events per watershed ranges from 11 to 69 on average 35 events were available for a catchment the runoff event identification and screening procedure included the following steps i first the peak flows were found in the streamflow time series only peaks from the snow free period april 1 until october 31 were selected with a value higher than double the long term mean flow the beginning and the end of runoff events were found as the first time instant when base flow reached 90 of the total flow before and after the peak respectively applying this approach 7189 events were collected and sorted in the decreasing order of peaks for 64 catchments automatically ii the selected events were then screened manually in order to provide a base set of regular hydrographs these consist of a clear rising and falling limb but can have multiple peaks events with unwanted shapes e g having oscillating discharge i e discharge changing continuously and periodically between two values indicating measurement error of the water level a long constant discharge segment linearly increasing decreasing segments etc were identified visually and removed from the set of events reducing the number of events by 61 5 the two main reasons causing an unwanted hydrograph shape were identified as measurement errors and missing measurements iii next the precipitation event related to each runoff event had to be determined first the algorithm found the beginning of the precipitation event as the first non zero value before the start of direct runoff second it defined the end of the precipitation event by searching for the last none zero value after the peak flow iv after the separation of direct runoff and effective precipitation employing a recursive filter and the œÜ index method respectively events with insufficient rainfall were dropped causing a further 7 0 loss of events v three catchments were excluded from the dataset having less than ten events the number of events dropped by 0 2 vi after defining the necessary characteristic points on the hydro and hyetographs all eight definitions were calculated events producing negative tr values were excluded which meant another 1 4 reduction ending up with a total of 2152 events for the 61 catchments 3 2 comparison of the event selection methods sbes method the adequacy of the e dmca method in terms of event selection was demonstrated by comparing with one of the state of the art event separation methods however no objectively verifiable rainfall runoff event separation exists therefore an objective evaluation of the proposed method is not possible the statistics based automated flood event separation sbes method of fischer et al 2021 was chosen for a comparison with the e dmca and sm methods the main reasons for selecting this method were its i reproducibility due to the freely available r package ii applicability for hourly time series iii suitability to select both runoff and the corresponding rainfall events and iv convertibility to select not only floods but also smaller runoff events however the sbes method was only tested for one catchment at an hourly temporal resolution by fischer et al 2021 as they state their method should not be easily transferred from daily to hourly values because of the different behavior of the runoff data fischer et al 2021 published recommended values for the nine parameters employed by the sbes method however these values were calibrated to select flood events from daily time series the parameters are the window for the moving variance of the 1 day or 1 hour discharge differences dvar this parameter is generally catchment dependent and can be chosen based on catchment size the present authors used a single constant value for every catchment similar to fischer et al 2021 the parameter for the variance threshold Œ∏ a smaller Œ∏ leads to the selection of more events therefore it can be used to adjust the number of events selected per year if desired the three thresholds for defining the start of the flood event Œ∑ Œ≥ and Œ∫ parameter Œ∑ provides a threshold for the relative 1 day or 1 hour discharge difference for the flood event to start parameter Œ∫ controls the level of significant contribution a pre flood has to have to be part of the flood event if there is an increase in magnitude in excess of Œ∫ of the total peak within Œ≥ 1 days before the flood event this pre flood is included in the flood event the parameter Œ≥ can be also chosen according to catchment size and climate region of the catchment two parameters Œ¥ and œâ to specify the end of the flood event to find the end of the events two criteria are compared first it is checked if the baseflow level at the start of the event is reached again second it inspects whether the next œâ time steps after the potential end of the flood event would add less than Œ¥ of the discharge volume of the falling limb if they were included if either of these criteria are met the end of the event is found the parameter ddur to specify a time window for superpositioned flood events an extraordinary duration of a separated flood event with multiple peaks becomes an indicator for a series of superimposed flood events the parameter ddur can be chosen according to the catchment size and the climatic conditions for the separation of the flood inducing precipitation the buffer b had to be defined by parameter Œæ where Œæ is the minimum time lag between the start of precipitation and ensuing flood event its value can also depend on catchment size the parameter values suggested by fischer et al 2021 include dvar 3 Œ∏ 0 25 Œ∑ 0 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ∫ 0 4 Œ¥ 0 2 œâ 2 ddur 40 they also found that dvar 14 5 and Œ∏ 0 33 were suitable parameter values for the hourly resolution at their selected test catchment since the e dmca and sm methods identify not only floods but also runoff events the present authors aimed to find a parameter set for the sbes method which also yields runoff events this was achieved by lowering the value of Œ∏ to 0 01 the value of Œ∑ was also reduced to 0 01 since neither 0 25 nor 0 33 produced acceptable starting points for the runoff events another modification was made by the present authors regarding the identification of the corresponding precipitation the original script appeared to run for hours for one catchment due to the high number of fitted linear regressions regression fitting is computationally expensive therefore the present authors optimized the script and ran it on a shorter section of the data the results of the optimized script were checked for one catchment to ensure the agreement between the results of the original and the optimized code this way the runtime was reduced from days to hours for the 61 catchments examined in this study 3 3 calculating catchment response time for events dmca and e dmca methods giani et al 2021 successfully applied the dmca method to directly estimate characteristic tr from rainfall and streamflow observations as they state this method s strength is to find the timescale at which two time series are linked even when they exhibit different frequency spectra and are nonlinearly related the dmca based correlation coefficient œÅdmca for time series with length t and applying a window length l can be calculated as 1 œÅ dmca l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 r t r t l q t q t l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 r t r t l 2 t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 q t q t l 2 w i t h 1 œÅ dmca l 1 where rt and qt are the cumulative time series of the rainfall r and streamflow q data while r t l and q t l are the centered moving averages of the cumulative rainfall and streamflow time series given as 2 3 r t i 1 t r i q t i 1 t q i f o r t 1 2 t 4 5 r t l 1 l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 r t q t l 1 l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 q t the rainfall and streamflow time series must have the same length and temporal resolution this study employed hourly time series similar to giani et al 2021 the window length l must be defined in units of time steps in this case hours and must have an odd value since a centered moving average is calculated the value of tr can be estimated as half of lmin 1 where lmin is the window length resulting in the minimum value of œÅdmca œÅmin in order to find this optimum several window lengths need to be applied the maximum possible value of tr tr max hr can be attributed to the maximum tested window length lmax hr this lmax value can be considered as the only parameter of this approach this parameter limits the maximum value of tr as lmax 1 2 tr max the numerator in equation 1 represents the bivariate fluctuation of streamflow and runoff while the denominator contains the squared fluctuations of the rainfall and streamflow time series the sign of the rainfall and streamflow fluctuations carries physical meaning the center of mass is preceded by a negative fluctuation and followed by a positive one giani et al 2021 therefore œÅmin is achieved when the value of l is closest to the time between the centers of masses a detailed step by step introduction to the dmca method is presented by giani et al 2021 along with a detailed description of the calculation steps interpretation the proposed e dmca method takes advantage of the fluctuations mentioned above by introducing a new parameter pth the dmca method applied to the whole time series results in a single characteristic value of tr tr char using the time window lmin attributed to this characteristic tr and relying on the cumulative rainfall and streamflow time series fluctuations rainfall runoff events are expected to be located at sections having positive rainfall and negative streamflow fluctuations these sections can be found by applying a threshold value pth as a new parameter based on this hypothesis the steps of event selection and tr calculation were defined as follows i estimating the characteristic tr and the corresponding value of lmin using the dmca method of giani et al 2021 on the entire time series ii normalizing the rainfall and streamflow fluctuation time series nrain lmin and nflow lmin attributed to lmin the normalization of the fluctuation time series is only performed to facilitate data comparison and visualization but it does not affect the result of the event selection iii finding the time instants in the normalized fluctuation time series where rainfall fluctuations are higher than 1 pth and streamflow fluctuations are lower than the pth threshold value the threshold value is defined as a percentile of the entire normalized fluctuation time series nflow lmin and nrain lmin the selection criteria can be written as p nrain lmin 1 pth p nflow lmin pth where p represents percentiles the time instants meeting the criteria form continuous sections of consecutive time steps iv selecting the first time instant i e the beginning of the events for each continuous section identified in step iii v calculating the value of tr for each event tr event with the dmca method the time window for each event starts tr max hours before the first time instant and ends two times tr max hours after the first time instant vi excluding ill conditioned events with œÅmin 0 and with tr event tr max see further explanation below vii removing outliers from the final set of event based values outliers were defined as elements in excess of triple the scaled median absolute deviation from the median of the original set of values the interpretation of these steps is visualized in fig 3 for sections of real data step i utilizes the dmca method presented by giani et al 2021 steps ii iv build on the outcome tr char or lmin of step i to perform the event selection since both the original and normalized fluctuation time series follow a symmetric distribution the event selection threshold pth was defined as percentiles in step iii this way the event selection criteria are adjusted to the characteristics of the rainfall and streamflow time series for each catchment step iii results in continuous sections where the threshold criteria are met in step iv every first time instant of these sections will be selected as the start of the event the time windows had to be fitted to each starting point in the next step these time windows specify the beginning and endpoints of the time periods for which the dmca method is applied again separately for every event the length of the time window was selected based on the rule of thumb applied in the unit hydrograph method see step v above since the base of the triangular unit response hydrograph is often described in relation to tr feh institute of hydrology 1999 this way a set of tr values tr event can be retrieved from the whole time series for each watershed please note that in steps i v the event selection and tr estimation for every event is performed in step vi and vii some of the inadequate values are removed from tr event ill conditioned events consist of rainfall and runoff time series the dmca method yields inadequate tr values with events resulting in a positive value of œÅmin are not necessarily unacceptable but it was found that a positive coefficient indicates ill conditioned events in most cases events resulting in tr values equivalent of tr max may also be ill conditioned or have longer tr than tr max therefore these values were also excluded an example of œÅmin 0 and another for tr event tr max can be seen in fig 3 along with an example of a well conditioned event the ratio of ill conditioned events ranged between 0 and 3 18 and 1 93 2 96 respectively the filtered outliers made 0 1 16 of the initially selected events the strengths and weaknesses of the presented event selection method are discussed in more detail in section 4 1 the matlab function of the e dmca method nagy 2022 is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6822134 3 4 sensitivity analysis and goodness of fit measures the e dmca method has two parameters a the maximum value of tr tr max lmax 1 2 and b the threshold value of fluctuations identifying events pth a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of the proposed method during this analysis a wide range of the two parameters were tested see section 4 3 for results the consistency of the sensitivity analysis was ensured by a twofold cross validation approach the sensitivity analysis was performed for two subsets of the catchments of equal number the catchments were sorted into the subsets randomly the goodness of fit was measured between the median of tr event and the median of definition f as the dmca method tends to match the maxima of the rainfall and streamflow time series for details see section 5 2 during the sensitivity analysis and comparison of the results of event selection methods the following goodness of fit measures were applied pearson correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse hr and the sum of relative differences Œ¥tr these were calculated as 6 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 7 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 8 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 9 Œ¥ t r i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 where xi is the value of tr yielded by the baseline sm or sbes method yi is the value of tr resulting from the e dmca method and n is the number of observations the value of r can range from 1 to 1 meaning perfect inverse linear and linear relationship respectively the value of nse shows the model s capability of yielding a better estimate than the mean of the observed values and its value can range from to 1 if nse is in the range of 0 1 the model provides a better estimation than the observed values mean an nse value of 1 represents a perfect fit the rmse value is zero for a perfect fit and the lower the value the better is the fit the value of Œ¥tr defines the fit s estimation error in percentage relative to the observed values a negative Œ¥tr implies a general underestimation of the observed values a value of 0 does not represent a perfect fit it only means that there is no significant under or overestimation 4 results 4 1 comparison of event characteristics from different selection methods the three methods selected different sets of events and as a result the statistical characteristics of various parameters may considerably differ although the three methods cannot be compared objectively based on the number of events we provide the number of selected events per catchment per year for each event selection method in supplementary material s2 section 3 the largest number of events is obtained by the e dmca method followed by the sbes and the sm respectively the lowest number by sm is due to the discharge threshold and the visual inspection when any disturbed runoff event was rejected step i and ii in section 3 1 in order to compare the event selection capability of the e dmca approach the runoff ratio Œ± and the value of tr was assessed for every event selected by the sm e dmca and sbes methods the runoff ratio was calculated as the ratio of the total runoff and the total precipitation while tr was calculated using the dmca method for each subsection of rainfall and runoff data figs 4 and 5 present the different percentiles of the calculated tr and Œ± values for every selected event sections 1 and 2 in supplementary material s2 includes more details separately for every percentile including plots for all events and only matched events the value of tr demonstrates a stronger correlation between the results of the e dmca and the sbes methods than the e dmca and the sm methods the middle range of the values p 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 is captured well while the low and high values p 0 1 and 0 9 less so both e dmca and sbes methods result in slightly smaller tr values than the sm one in contrast e dmca shows considerably less scatter than sbes when they are compared to sm considering the Œ± values the best agreement is obtained between sm and e dmca not only the variation of the median values from the sbes method œÉ 0 5 3 20 10 3 is higher than that either from the e dmca œÉ 0 5 6 04 10 4 or sm œÉ 0 5 7 59 10 4 method but also the deviation from the 1 1 line the sbes method shows remarkable under and overestimations in the range of 0 02 0 09 against both the sm and e dmca methods we highlight that the runoff ratio is explicitly checked only in the case of the expert based sm method during the event selection procedure the median values of Œ± yielded by the sbes method are higher on average than of the e dmca method the interpretation of these results is given in section 5 1 4 2 comparison of the catchment response time values resulting from different methods the sm event selection resulted in eight different tr values according to the definitions shown in fig 2 for the 61 catchments 2152 events another set of event based values tr event for each catchment was provided by the e dmca method while the original dmca method gave a characteristic tr tr char value for the whole time series the final results were obtained by employing tr max 150 h and pth 0 05 based on the sensitivity analysis results see section 4 3 the difference between the characteristic value tr char obtained by the dmca method and the median of the values tr median resulting from the e dmca method is presented in fig 6 the characteristic tr shows good agreement with tr median having a pearson correlation of 0 967 and nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 935 the difference is equal to or higher than 40 in six watersheds shown by red markers which is 10 of the total number of catchments the difference is only 1 3 h in the case of four watersheds 14 16 29 55 which have a smaller area and therefore a smaller tr in one case 37 the flow may be distorted by measurement errors yielding irregular nflow curves in this case the e dmca method captures a fewer number of events than the sm method the proposed method appears to capture a higher number of the smaller peaks and fewer large ones at catchment 7 therefore yields a shorter response time than the characteristic tr nevertheless 85 of the watersheds has an error 20 in case of the sm event selection all eight definitions see fig 2 were applied for each event the median values from each definition were compared to the medians tr median of the e dmca method both considering every selected events and only those selected by both methods in fig 7 the goodness of fit measures described in section 3 4 were also calculated table 3 a figure figure s4 similar to fig 7 is provided in supplementary material s2 comparing the values yielded by the combination of the sbes and dmca methods and the values resulting from the different definitions the median of the eight different tr definitions gave diverse results the two traditional definitions of tc a and b resulted in the highest values followed by the medians of te and tp definitions g and h the remaining four definitions yielded similar values from these four definitions e and d standing for tl and definitions f and c the two unconventional definitions of tc expressed the best agreement with the values of tr median respectively the match is the closest to the 1 1 line in case of definition f which is the time elapsed between the peaks of total rainfall and streamflow the four best performing definitions resulted in nse values higher than 0 8 and rmse values under 6 2 h Œ¥tr shows negative values in every case which means that tr median somewhat underestimates the values resulting from the different definitions this estimation error ranges two orders of magnitude and the smallest value is over 1 the absolute value of Œ¥tr is under 2 for definitions d f as the e dmca procedure appeared to capture the median of definition f it is instructive to compare the distributions of the event based values resulting from the sm and the proposed method for this definition therefore the values representing the p 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 0 9 percentiles p 0 5 being the median were compared the plots of the five percentiles can be seen in fig 8 the goodness of fit measures for each percentile can be found in table 4 for a better comparison the different percentiles are also plotted for the events selected by both methods in fig 8 in table 4 the corresponding goodness of fit measures are also provided in parentheses the different percentiles of the e dmca method gave satisfactory results overall the percentile plot is generally symmetric along the 1 1 line and the length of the whiskers are similar in most cases see fig 8 the value of nse is 0 708 on average while the value of r exceeds 0 875 in every case rmse shows a considerable increase as the estimated percentile increases the increase of error is expected since the range of the estimated values also increases however the relative error varies the p 0 1 and 0 75 percentiles are over while the other percentiles are underestimated the largest relative error is somewhat higher than 10 in the case of the largest values p 0 9 as it appears in fig 8 the e dmca values tend to overestimate the larger values and underestimate the lower ones in case of the higher percentiles p 0 75 and 0 9 4 3 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis introduced in section 3 4 are presented in fig 9 the event selection was performed using the parameter value ranges of pth 0 0 01 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 4 0 5 and tr max values from 50 to 350 hr incremented by 25 hr note that pth 0 results in the selection of no events and pth 0 5 results in selecting every possible event due to the symmetry of the rainfall and flow fluctuation distributions tr max 0 hr also results in the selection of no events therefore the lowest value of the tested range was set to 50 hr while the highest value was set to 350 hr the optimal combination of the two parameters tr max and pth was identified for all goodness of fit measures introduced in section 3 4 the goodness of fit measures were calculated between the median of the tr values yielded by the proposed method tr median and the median of the values resulting from definition f tr def f the number of selected events per watershed per year was also calculated the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the number of events selected with the e dmca approach only depends on the value of the threshold pth fig 9e this was expected since the event selection relies on the fluctuations calculated using the characteristic tr yielded by the dmca method which is not changing if the tr s value is higher than the characteristic tr however the number of events selected increases exponentially as the value of the threshold increases a number of 20 events per watershed per year is reached near the value of pth 0 05 which can be considered a high value based on other studies see table 1 the value of tr max has more effect on the set of event based values as it limits the upper part of the tr event s distribution this effect becomes clearly visible when the value of tr max goes under 150 h as all the goodness of fit measures show a sharp increase decline when tr max 150 hr and pth 0 05 the different goodness of fit measures show somewhat different distributions for the two sets of catchments see section 3 4 the range of optimal tr max goes from 75 to 150 h and the value of optimal pth is between 0 025 and 0 1 the optimum values match in the case of nse and rmse fig 9a 9d Œ¥tr yielded slightly different optima while r resulted in considerably different optima fig 9b 9c however r can be misleading since its value denotes a linear relationship and does not give information on the estimation error s extent consequently the strongest linear relation between the modeled and estimated values does not necessarily coincide with the smallest estimation error based on the sensitivity analysis results displayed in fig 9 application of the parameter values tr max 150 h and p 0 05 is considered well justified to run the e dmca method for the whole dataset 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of event characteristics from different selection methods fig 10 provides examples for the results of the event selection from the three different methods fig 10a demonstrates that the sm method is the most restrictive as it missed many of the events selected by the other two methods fig 10b provides examples for overlapping time windows in the case of the e dmca method overlaps between events also occur with the sbes method but rarely fig 10a and 10b represent two catchments with relatively short and long response times at some of the catchments the sbes method failed to choose the largest observed flood events fig 10c but in a few cases 5 5 of the years it selected a higher number of events than the other two methods fig 10d this suggest that the applied parameters of the sbes method should be calibrated individually for each catchment the strongly variable performance of the three applied methods can be best observed in march and april of fig 10e fig 10f h provide further examples for the various performance the e dmca method was able to select more events than the sbes or both methods fig 10f g respectively based on the results selecting a few events by all three methods in one year as in fig 10h can be considered a relatively good match among the methods at this catchment the observed differences may stem from the different selection strategies of the applied methods the general aim of the sm method was to provide a set of hydrologically reliable events through a strict selection procedure this included the visual screening of the runoff events to provide floods with a clear rising and recession limb lacking missing interpolated values and measurement error and the removal of events with less precipitation than direct runoff see section 3 1 for more details this lead to the exclusion of a large proportion 61 5 of the events but this does not mean that these excluded events were falsely identified by the other two methods furthermore the comparison of all selected events with the matched ones figs 7 and 8 showed that the exclusion of these events does not result in a bias in other words a less strict selection strategy would lead to same results and the proposed method can provide a great number of reliable events for other hydrological analyses the sbes method relies on the variance of the runoff time series which varies at different temporal resolutions since the sbes method was developed using daily time series the occasionally poor performance of the sbes method presented in this paper using hourly time series could be further improved through a more extensive calibration of the method s numerous parameters this means a re calibration of the parameters for each catchment even though the runoff event selection could be likely enhanced as mentioned before the runoff ratios would not necessarily improve since the sbes method does not account for the amount of rainfall attributed to the runoff events in contrast to the e dmca and sm methods the e dmca method fails to identify some of the events due to two main reasons a the event is identified but it is ill conditioned see section 3 3 or b the corresponding precipitation arrives too early late or is quantitatively insufficient i e the selection criteria introduced in section 3 3 is not fulfilled despite these cases the e dmca method appeared to perform well as discussed in the following sections regarding the runoff ratios the sm and e dmca values showed the strongest correlation while the values from the sbes method showed little agreement with the values yielded by the other two sm and e dmca methods the values were also plotted using every selected event and only for the events selected by the two compared methods see supplementary material s2 sections 1 and 2 the runoff ratios resulting from the sbes method show stronger correlation with the values yielded by the sm method when only the matching events are compared the difference between examining all events and only the matching events is not notable when comparing the e dmca and sm methods this means to us that in contrast to the e dmca method the further selected events by the sbes method may not be reliable and a visual inspection would be necessary this is a clear disadvantage in the case of an automated method the sbes method s values generally overestimate the runoff ratios resulting from the e dmca method see fig 5 and the overestimation grows more significant as the percentile decreases the above mentioned discrepancies can be attributed again to the selection strategies of the different methods the sm method employs several strict and arbitrary criteria in order to produce a smaller but hydrologically reliable set of rainfall runoff events since the sm method requires the separation of base flow and effective precipitation leading to the exclusion of events with less precipitation than direct runoff its results can be considered the most reliable an important aspect of the sbes method is that it does not consider the volume of the precipitation therefore it does not ensure that the amount of the attributed rainfall is sufficient to produce the identified runoff this could lead to the larger differences between the values of the sm and sbes methods when comparing every selected event instead of matching events the e dmca method builds upon both the rainfall and the runoff fluctuation time series meaning the method cannot select a runoff event if there is no precipitation or the precipitation is too small to produce fluctuation above pth this may result in the stronger correlation between the sm and e dmca methods considering the tr values resulting from the different methods the sbes and e dmca methods exhibit the strongest correlation in contrast the tr values yielded by the sm method are somewhat longer than the tr resulting from the other two sbes and e dmca methods this can be attributed to two main factors first the number of matching events is very low 0 871 and 1 76 events per catchment per year on average between the sm and the other two methods for more details see supplementary material s2 section 3 if some of these events are not well defined i e the beginning and or the end of the event is mispositioned the resulting tr can be easily distorted second the sm method defines longer time windows for the events than the other two event selection methods this can lead to longer tr values after the application of the dmca method based on the comparative analysis of the Œ± and tr values the events selected by the proposed e dmca method appears to be appropriate when considering the time requirements to evaluate the sm sbes and e dmca methods they can yield results in days hours and minutes respectively furthermore the proposed e dmca method employs only two parameters while the sbes method requires nine these properties of the proposed method underline that the e dmca method is the most efficient tool to assess an event based set of tr values from rainfall and runoff time series a more detailed assessment of additional event characteristics e g event duration ratio of peak discharge to base flow etc could highlight further strengths and weaknesses of the examined methods the evaluation of other available event selection methods see table 1 could reveal further insights of the different approaches of event selection 5 2 evaluation of the various catchment response times resulting from the sm and e dmca methods the e dmca method yielded satisfactory results in every examined aspect the median of tr event matched the characteristic tr estimated with the original method of giani et al 2021 quite well rmse 2 87 hr since the dmca tr estimation method can only yield integers for hourly time series the relative error can be high for smaller catchments with shorter tr using a shorter time step for smaller catchments could produce a better estimation in these cases application of the different tr definitions resulted in theoretically plausible relations definitions c f gave the best results with only slight differences rmse 6 13 4 88 hr the dmca method defines the time between the centroids of total rainfall and streamflow but it tends to give more weight to higher peaks giani et al 2021 as we tested the original dmca tr estimation method we also found that it appears to match the peaks of the observed rainfall and runoff time series in the case of multi peaked events this is especially true when the rainfall and streamflow peak is close to each other i e the last peak of the rainfall and the first peak of the streamflow are the largest ones for this reason we aimed to test the efficiency of the e dmca method against definition f however the relatively small difference in performance among definitions c f implies that this choice did not affect the efficiency of the proposed method considerably by definition tc is calculated based on velocity while te is calculated based on celerity beven 2020 since celerity is normally higher than velocity beven 2020 the value of tc is expected to be larger than the value of te in fact tc s value can be considered an upper limit of catchment response time giani et al 2021 even though giani et al 2021 used definition a to calculate tr for the selected events in their study their results showed a 1 1 match between the characteristic tr calculated with the original dmca method and the median of the values assessed using definition a however the results presented in this study are more plausible since the dmca method should yield a value closer to tl by nature and tl must be shorter than tc based on their definitions for a deeper understanding of the connection between the various time parameters we attributed different percentiles of the tr event values resulting from the e dmca method to the median values of definitions a f g and h fig 11 displays the value of rmse in relation to the different percentiles of tr event p along with the best fit for definitions a f g and h for the events selected by both methods for example the rmse is the lowest near p 0 5 in the case of definition f since the e dmca method was optimized to the median of definition f the characteristic value of tc can be estimated by picking the maximum of the tr event values resulting from the e dmca approach at a satisfactory level rmse 13 1 hr this is reasonable since tc can be considered an upper limit of a catchment s tr by definition the median of tp can also be estimated as the p 0 61 percentile of tr event with rmse 5 30 hr however the value of te was assessed with much lower precision rmse 10 0 hr nevertheless the range of these time parameters increase in the expected order namely tc te tp tl in addition to the work of giani et al 2021 the e dmca method presented in this paper managed to assess different percentiles of the tr distribution at a satisfactory level rmse 3 32 12 9 hr it cannot be undoubtedly decided which event selection method gives more realistic results since there is no unified method to collect rainfall runoff events the sm method involves arbitrary choices which makes the process less objective and unreproducible the proposed method is more of a stochastic approach since it collects rainfall runoff events based on probability through the parameter pth this method produces a set of values including a higher number of the extremely short and long tr values which results in the observed differences however the e dmca method is able to capture the variable nature of tr and yields its distribution in minutes 5 3 sensitivity analysis based on the sensitivity analysis results the parameters tr max 150 hr and pth 0 05 can be used for similar catchments and identical climatic conditions the analysis illustrated that it is safer to overestimate the value of tr max than to underestimate it since tr max is the upper boundary of the event based set of values if tr max is underestimated it leads to a sharp decrease in the performance of the e dmca method see section 4 3 fig 9 the estimation error does not vary considerably in the range of pth 0 01 0 05 when tr max 150 hr the value of tr max matched the maximum of the values defined using definition f and approximately equals three times the maximum of the characteristic tr values yielded by the original dmca method therefore we suggest two methods to estimate tr max a assess tr max manually from the time series of the largest catchment by finding the longest response b perform the original dmca method for long time series then choose tr max equal to or greater than the triple of the longest characteristic tr to keep the number of selected events under an average of 20 events per catchment per year we suggest using a value of pth smaller than 0 05 however the number of selected events can strongly vary across different climatic regions applied methods and criteria see table 1 therefore the values of pth can be adjusted to the specific conditions and requirements the parameter values suggested above could be used for similar catchments making the evaluation of the event selection externally dispensable however the method should be tested on a larger more variable set of catchments in order to extend the applicability of the e dmca method and assess the robustness of the two parameters in more detail the sm method could be performed more sufficiently using only definition f for a larger dataset since the separation of effective rainfall and direct runoff is not necessary in this case 6 conclusions the e dmca method presented in this study was able to select rainfall runoff events to estimate the range of possible tr values in the case of 61 medium sized hungarian catchments the following conclusions can be drawn from the performed analysis the e dmca method is capable of selecting events from long time series and yield an event based set of tr values tr event in an automated fashion thus effectively obliterating days of work normally required to perform a non automated approach based on the results of the sensitivity analysis an optimal range value was identified for the two parameters pth and tr max needed to perform the presented method see section 3 3 the range for pth is 0 01 0 05 while the value of tr max can be estimated as triple the maximum of the characteristic tr values resulting from the application of the original dmca method on long time series compared to the values resulting from the different graphical definitions the tr values of the new method are the closest to the time elapsed between the peaks of the total rainfall and runoff in addition the characteristic value of tc can be estimated as the maximum of the event based set of values tr event yielded by the e dmca method the application of the event selection method of fischer et al 2021 highlighted that the rainfall runoff events identified by the e dmca method are hydrologically reliable considering rainfall runoff ratios this is due to the fact that the e dmca method cannot select a runoff event if there is no sufficient preceding precipitation while the method of fischer et al 2021 does not consider the amount of rainfall it was also demonstrated that the proposed method is easier to implement as it has only two parameters instead of nine this is especially true at the hourly temporal resolution since the runtime of the e dmca method is considerably shorter the added value of the proposed method is that it yields a range of physically possible values instead of a characteristic value per watershed in one step and within minutes this is an important step toward future implementation of modeling non linear and stochastic catchment behavior in everyday engineering hydrological applications the proposed e dmca method yielded promising results assessed by the runoff ratio and catchment response time the authors intend to broaden the analysis of the proposed method in the future with regard to the number of i event selection methods tested ii rainfall runoff event characteristics assessed iii catchments examined and iv temporal resolution investigated which could further contribute in general to the hydrological analysis and modeling of rainfall runoff events credit authorship contribution statement eszter d nagy conceptualization

2919,the estimation of catchment response time tr plays an important role in several hydrological and civil engineering design problems the non linear relationship between tr and rainfall intensity necessitates the estimation of an event based set of tr values instead of a characteristic constant value however there is no generally accepted method to define individual rainfall runoff events from time series here we propose a new automated method which results in the selection of rainfall runoff events and the corresponding tr values the proposed method yields an event based set of tr values more efficiently than other existing methods and has only two parameters the results of the new method were compared to those of a statistical and a semi manual event selection approach the latter calculates eight different tr values including the time of concentration lag time time to peak and time to equilibrium the median tr value of the proposed method yields the strongest agreement with the median of the time elapsed between the maxima of the total rainfall and runoff with a root mean square error of 4 94 h it is also demonstrated that a median time of concentration value can be estimated as the maximum of the event based tr values by the current method a sensitivity analysis explores the robustness of the proposed method and also yields the optima of its two parameters once calibrated the present automated methodology dispenses with any event selection procedure keywords catchment response time time of concentration event selection detrending moving average cross correlation analysis data availability the authors do not have permission to share data the code is shared at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6822134 1 introduction quantification of the catchment response to precipitation via time parameters is essential for engineering tasks such as peak flow estimation rainfall runoff modeling or flood risk environmental hazard mapping the most frequently used catchment response time tr parameters are the time of concentration tc the lag time tl the time to peak tp and the time to equilibrium te langridge et al 2020 for example the rational method chow 1988 is widely used to estimate the peak flow value to a given precipitation input and requires the calculation of tc however the estimation error of the peak flow value may reach 75 due to the uncertainty in the tc estimates bondelid et al 1982 the response time of a catchment to extreme precipitation limits the time interval available for flood defense or mitigation of environmental disasters hence its accurate estimation can also assist in disaster prevention many rainfall runoff models apply the unit hydrograph theory in some form beven 2012 therefore tc tl and tp often appear as model parameters tl in a broader context is the time between the occurrence of an event and the emergence of a response in the system of interest the same interpretation of tl can be used to estimate how long rainfall will take to be translated into runoff in a given catchment amiri et al 2019 tp is defined as the rise time of a storm hydrograph encompassing the time from the first stream contributions from a precipitation event to the arrival of the peak flow of the event langridge et al 2020 the international glossary of hydrology wmo 1974 defines tc as the period of time required for storm runoff to flow from the most remote part of a drainage basin to the outlet in this definition storm runoff is replaced with a drop of water and the most remote part becomes the furthest point in many hydrologic texts however as beven 2020 emphasizes it is not the flow velocities that should be used to define the response times in a catchment but the relevant surface subsurface and channel flow celerities or wave velocities the latter yields the te as it is obtained by integrating the celerity from upslope to a downslope outlet and can be interpreted as the time from the start of rainfall to peak response for an initially dry catchment and steady rainfall by definition since the publication of minshall s 1960 classical work on storm runoff from small experimental watersheds hydrologists agree that the rainfall runoff response is fundamentally nonlinear szilagyi 2007 minshall 1960 derived response functions for certain small catchments which showed a pronounced dependence of tl on the intensity of rainfall excess the value of tr was proven to be decreasing with increasing rainfall intensity by many authors since reed et al 1975 loukas and quick 1996 saghafian et al 2002 szilagyi 2007 zhang et al 2007 kjeldsen et al 2016 mathias et al 2016 meyersohn 2016 michailidi et al 2018 cuevas et al 2019 therefore the event based estimation may be of great use in hydrological applications such as rainfall runoff modelling or peak flow estimation these tasks are especially challenging at ungauged sites since the value of tr is usually estimated by empirical formulas however the accuracy of empirical equations can be improved with the help of more reliable observed values of tr from studies focusing on time parameter estimation methods the three main assessment procedures are based on i measured data ii hydraulic equations loukas quick 1996 liang melching 2012 sabzevari et al 2015 baiamonte singh 2016 michailidi et al 2018 and iii empirical or semi empirical formulas fang et al 2008 mccuen 2009 grimaldi et al 2012 nagy et al 2016 abdel fattah et al 2017 kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 ravazzani et al 2019 measurements can be made employing i laboratory models black 1972 zhang et al 2007 liang melching 2012 ii a tracer substance pilgrim 1976 azizian 2019 bj√∂rn rodriguez et al 2021 or iii registering rainfall and runoff data loukas quick 1996 mccuen 2009 grimaldi et al 2012 wu et al 2016 gericke smithers 2017 kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 cuevas et al 2019 ravazzani et al 2019 langridge et al 2020 giani et al 2021 tracer measurements can yield detailed information on the runoff generation process of a catchment however it is mainly adaptable to small catchments such monitoring systems can be operated only for research and not for an operational purpose pilgrim 1976 nevertheless only a tracer measurement can be considered as a direct measurement of tr the results obtained by employing laboratory models are not necessarily valid for natural catchments ga√°l et al 2012 due to the above mentioned applicability issues of tracer measurements and laboratory models the present authors chose to estimate the observed value of tr indirectly from recorded rainfall and runoff data the main disadvantages of calculating tr using observed rainfall and runoff time series are i difficulties with event selection and ii the assessment of time instants on the hyeto and hydrographs that require the separation of effective precipitation and direct runoff the event selection can be performed manually but this task is quite cumbersome and hard to reproduce especially in the case of a large dataset thiesen et al 2019 several of the automated event selection methods rely on base flow separation e g merz bl√∂schl 2009 mei anagnostou 2015 tarasova et al 2018 the main disadvantage of these methods is that base flow is an elusive process to quantify compared to other components of the water balance such as precipitation and total runoff szilagyi et al 2003 the true value of the base flow is usually unknown therefore its value can never be precisely quantified from just rainfall runoff records additionally these event selection methods may involve empirical estimation of parameters further reducing objectivity while other methods relying on machine learning require training table 1 lists some recently published automated event selection methods with their weaknesses explained considering the attributes of the available event selection approaches the statistical method of fischer et al 2021 appeared to be the most appropriate to compare the event selection capability of the proposed technique additionally a method requiring expert knowledge from here on referred to as the semi manual method and involves visual screening of the selected events is also employed in conjunction with the present one in order to ensure a base set of regular hyeto and hydrographs for the estimation of tr once the events are selected the observed value of tr can be derived for each event from temporal differences between specific time instants on the hyeto and hydrographs via so called graphical definitions although the study of response time parameters dates back more than 150 years their definition and calculation are still intricate tasks time parameters cannot be uniquely identified due to their various interpretations this is underlined by the existence of numerous graphical definitions for tc in the literature mccuen 2009 for example lists six definitions of tc out of which one is a definition of tp and two are definitions of tl even the most often used definition has two slightly different versions namely the time from the end or center of mass of rainfall excess to the end of direct runoff i e the inflection point on the total runoff hydrograph coincidentally giani et al 2021 recently published a novel method to estimate tr relatively easily and objectively from observed time series the new methodology called detrending moving average cross correlation analysis dmca introduced by giani et al 2021 greatly facilitates the calculation of tr it allows the user to estimate the characteristic value of tr from long time series while making possible the estimation of tr at the event scale using pre defined subsections of the observed data for specific events for performing the latter event selection must be done separately and beforehand the event selection approach applied by giani et al 2021 is automated but includes the empirical estimation of tl and a screening criterion regarding peak flow magnitude the present authors aim to extend the dmca based tr estimation method of giani et al 2021 by performing the event selection and estimation of a set of tr values for the selected events simultaneously this is achieved by introducing an additional parameter from here on the currently proposed method is to be referred to as event scale dmca or shortly e dmca method consequently the study presented in this paper has three main foci i validating the applicability of the proposed event scale dmca based tr estimation method for accurate event selection by comparing the results of the new approach with the results of a state of the art statistical and an expert knowledge based semi manual event selection method ii assessing the robustness and validity of the proposed range of the two parameters needed to perform the event scale dmca based tr estimation method by performing a thorough sensitivity analysis iii exploring the relationship between the event based tr values resulting from the often used graphical definitions and the event scale dmca based tr estimation toward the first goal we performed the previously mentioned semi manual event selection see section 3 1 and assessed the value of tr from each event by applying eight different graphical definitions collected from literature then the new event scale dmca based tr estimation method was applied see section 3 3 which concurrently performs the event selection and the calculation of tr using the dmca based method of giani et al 2021 obliterating the need for external event selection required by the dmca based tr estimation method next the statistics based event selection method of fischer et al 2021 was evaluated to provide a comparative basis for the event selection capability of the proposed event scale dmca based method see section 3 2 the results of the three methods were compared in terms of the event selection and tr values see sections 4 1 and 4 2 respectively the sensitivity analysis mentioned in ii is introduced in section 3 4 while its results are presented in section 4 3 a discussion on the performance of the event scale dmca based tr estimation method is provided in section 5 including a more detailed comparison of the tr values given by the graphical definitions and those obtained by the proposed method the conclusions of the present study are found in section 6 similar to giani et al 2021 the term of catchment response time tr is employed throughout the text in general and the other time parameters tc tl tp and te are specified only when it is theoretically plausible in what follows the method presented by giani et al 2021 is referred to as the dmca based tr estimation dmca method while the approach presented in this paper is called the event scale dmca based tr estimation e dmca method or proposed method the two event selection methods for testing the e dmca results are referred to as the semi manual event selection sm method and the statistics based automated flood event separation sbes method 2 study area and data in this study 61 small to medium sized hungarian catchments six of them nested were examined fig 1 provides an overview of the catchments location while relevant statistical measures are given in table 2 the list of catchments is provided in supplementary material s1 the catchment ids appearing throughout the text correspond to the ones presented in supplementary material s1 the mean catchment area is 206 km2 from a range of 8 74 810 km2 54 of the catchments are smaller than 150 km2 and 6 5 have an area larger than 500 km2 based on the high resolution copernicus land use land cover products copernicus 2020a copernicus 2020b the minimum forest coverage is 3 8 the maximum is 88 7 while the range of impervious area is 0 3 19 9 a third of the catchments are located within karst regions the dominant soil parent types are deposits glacial and alluvial loess and loess like tertiary and older deposits volcanic rocks such as andesite rhyolite and basalt dominate only in a few 5 catchments while sandstone shale and phyllite cover even fewer catchments according to the k√∂ppen climate classification peel et al 2007 hungary s climate is predominantly warm summer humid continental the time window of the study extends from 2000 to 2017 during this period the minimum amount of annual rainfall and catchment runoff were 394 and 21 1 mm respectively while the maxima were 1377 and 642 mm the aridity index varies between 0 75 and 1 25 among the catchments the catchments were delineated using the copernicus land monitoring services eu dem v1 1 digital surface model a freely available raster format dataset with a spatial resolution of 25 m copernicus 2016 high resolution 5 min discharge and precipitation time series were provided by the local water directorates for 64 and 17 stations respectively observed discharge were derived using measured water levels and rating curves the three main catchment selection criteria applied were i no considerable human influence on flow ii high temporal resolution of measurements and iii continuous record available for at least ten years similar to sauquet catalogne 2011 the first criterion was ensured by checking digital maps and consulting the local water directorates not every catchment has a rainfall gauging station near or in the catchment and sub daily precipitation data is not provided by the hungarian meteorological service free of charge to obtain interpolated values the 17 precipitation gauging stations operated by the local water directorates do not cover the whole study area therefore they could not be used to interpolate precipitation data instead european centre of medium range weather forecast ecmwf re analysis data from the copernicus climate data store were used in addition to the gauging station values for catchments without a gauging station ecmwf data were used the era5 land product copernicus climate change service 2019 provides hourly precipitation time series with a 0 1 x 0 1 9 km 9 km spatial resolution the applicability of the ecmwf re analysis data was examined separately in a previous study by nagy szilagyi 2020 where the results of the sm approach see section 3 1 for details employing measured and also re analysis data were compared at 38 catchments having or the closest assigned a precipitation gauging station we found that the ecmwf data is adequate for tr estimation especially when the centers of masses and also peaks of the observed runoff and rainfall time series are used 3 methodology 3 1 calculating catchment response time for events sm method during a previous study nagy szilagyi 2021 eight graphical definitions of tr were collected and analyzed the interpretation of definitions a h is presented in fig 2 definition a is the most often used i e conventional definition of tc and definition b is a slightly different version of the latter however definition a is much more often used definitions e and f are infrequently used i e unconventional interpretations of tc reported by mccuen 2009 not used for any other time parameter i e tl tp or te both definitions c and d stand for tl even though only definition d is correct by the unit hydrograph theory chow 1988 definition g represents tp and definition h is the te unfortunately all definitions can be found in the literature as the definition of tc wisnovszky 1958 loukas quick 1996 mccuen 2009 most of the definitions a e and g require the separation of base flow and or effective precipitation in this study the former was performed using a recursive filtering method nathan mcmahon 1990 the latter was calculated by assuming a constant rate loss and equaling the direct runoff and excess rainfall volumes known as the œÜ index method dingman 2015 this way only one parameter had to be adjusted the coefficient of the recursive filter it was manually calibrated for every catchment using the ten largest runoff events resulting from steps i ii see below and validated for the smaller events the aim of the calibration procedure by a trial and error fashion was to find a coefficient for each watershed that ensures the temporal coincidence of the end of the direct runoff and the inflection point on the recession limb the latter was identified visually on the hydrographs after the separations all eight graphical definitions were calculated the initial data set consisted of 64 catchments and 7189 events after quality control and screening see steps i vi below 2152 events remained for 61 catchments for these events the observed values of tr were derived by the eight definitions presented in fig 2 the number of events per watershed ranges from 11 to 69 on average 35 events were available for a catchment the runoff event identification and screening procedure included the following steps i first the peak flows were found in the streamflow time series only peaks from the snow free period april 1 until october 31 were selected with a value higher than double the long term mean flow the beginning and the end of runoff events were found as the first time instant when base flow reached 90 of the total flow before and after the peak respectively applying this approach 7189 events were collected and sorted in the decreasing order of peaks for 64 catchments automatically ii the selected events were then screened manually in order to provide a base set of regular hydrographs these consist of a clear rising and falling limb but can have multiple peaks events with unwanted shapes e g having oscillating discharge i e discharge changing continuously and periodically between two values indicating measurement error of the water level a long constant discharge segment linearly increasing decreasing segments etc were identified visually and removed from the set of events reducing the number of events by 61 5 the two main reasons causing an unwanted hydrograph shape were identified as measurement errors and missing measurements iii next the precipitation event related to each runoff event had to be determined first the algorithm found the beginning of the precipitation event as the first non zero value before the start of direct runoff second it defined the end of the precipitation event by searching for the last none zero value after the peak flow iv after the separation of direct runoff and effective precipitation employing a recursive filter and the œÜ index method respectively events with insufficient rainfall were dropped causing a further 7 0 loss of events v three catchments were excluded from the dataset having less than ten events the number of events dropped by 0 2 vi after defining the necessary characteristic points on the hydro and hyetographs all eight definitions were calculated events producing negative tr values were excluded which meant another 1 4 reduction ending up with a total of 2152 events for the 61 catchments 3 2 comparison of the event selection methods sbes method the adequacy of the e dmca method in terms of event selection was demonstrated by comparing with one of the state of the art event separation methods however no objectively verifiable rainfall runoff event separation exists therefore an objective evaluation of the proposed method is not possible the statistics based automated flood event separation sbes method of fischer et al 2021 was chosen for a comparison with the e dmca and sm methods the main reasons for selecting this method were its i reproducibility due to the freely available r package ii applicability for hourly time series iii suitability to select both runoff and the corresponding rainfall events and iv convertibility to select not only floods but also smaller runoff events however the sbes method was only tested for one catchment at an hourly temporal resolution by fischer et al 2021 as they state their method should not be easily transferred from daily to hourly values because of the different behavior of the runoff data fischer et al 2021 published recommended values for the nine parameters employed by the sbes method however these values were calibrated to select flood events from daily time series the parameters are the window for the moving variance of the 1 day or 1 hour discharge differences dvar this parameter is generally catchment dependent and can be chosen based on catchment size the present authors used a single constant value for every catchment similar to fischer et al 2021 the parameter for the variance threshold Œ∏ a smaller Œ∏ leads to the selection of more events therefore it can be used to adjust the number of events selected per year if desired the three thresholds for defining the start of the flood event Œ∑ Œ≥ and Œ∫ parameter Œ∑ provides a threshold for the relative 1 day or 1 hour discharge difference for the flood event to start parameter Œ∫ controls the level of significant contribution a pre flood has to have to be part of the flood event if there is an increase in magnitude in excess of Œ∫ of the total peak within Œ≥ 1 days before the flood event this pre flood is included in the flood event the parameter Œ≥ can be also chosen according to catchment size and climate region of the catchment two parameters Œ¥ and œâ to specify the end of the flood event to find the end of the events two criteria are compared first it is checked if the baseflow level at the start of the event is reached again second it inspects whether the next œâ time steps after the potential end of the flood event would add less than Œ¥ of the discharge volume of the falling limb if they were included if either of these criteria are met the end of the event is found the parameter ddur to specify a time window for superpositioned flood events an extraordinary duration of a separated flood event with multiple peaks becomes an indicator for a series of superimposed flood events the parameter ddur can be chosen according to the catchment size and the climatic conditions for the separation of the flood inducing precipitation the buffer b had to be defined by parameter Œæ where Œæ is the minimum time lag between the start of precipitation and ensuing flood event its value can also depend on catchment size the parameter values suggested by fischer et al 2021 include dvar 3 Œ∏ 0 25 Œ∑ 0 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ∫ 0 4 Œ¥ 0 2 œâ 2 ddur 40 they also found that dvar 14 5 and Œ∏ 0 33 were suitable parameter values for the hourly resolution at their selected test catchment since the e dmca and sm methods identify not only floods but also runoff events the present authors aimed to find a parameter set for the sbes method which also yields runoff events this was achieved by lowering the value of Œ∏ to 0 01 the value of Œ∑ was also reduced to 0 01 since neither 0 25 nor 0 33 produced acceptable starting points for the runoff events another modification was made by the present authors regarding the identification of the corresponding precipitation the original script appeared to run for hours for one catchment due to the high number of fitted linear regressions regression fitting is computationally expensive therefore the present authors optimized the script and ran it on a shorter section of the data the results of the optimized script were checked for one catchment to ensure the agreement between the results of the original and the optimized code this way the runtime was reduced from days to hours for the 61 catchments examined in this study 3 3 calculating catchment response time for events dmca and e dmca methods giani et al 2021 successfully applied the dmca method to directly estimate characteristic tr from rainfall and streamflow observations as they state this method s strength is to find the timescale at which two time series are linked even when they exhibit different frequency spectra and are nonlinearly related the dmca based correlation coefficient œÅdmca for time series with length t and applying a window length l can be calculated as 1 œÅ dmca l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 r t r t l q t q t l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 r t r t l 2 t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 q t q t l 2 w i t h 1 œÅ dmca l 1 where rt and qt are the cumulative time series of the rainfall r and streamflow q data while r t l and q t l are the centered moving averages of the cumulative rainfall and streamflow time series given as 2 3 r t i 1 t r i q t i 1 t q i f o r t 1 2 t 4 5 r t l 1 l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 r t q t l 1 l t 0 5 l 1 t 0 5 l 1 q t the rainfall and streamflow time series must have the same length and temporal resolution this study employed hourly time series similar to giani et al 2021 the window length l must be defined in units of time steps in this case hours and must have an odd value since a centered moving average is calculated the value of tr can be estimated as half of lmin 1 where lmin is the window length resulting in the minimum value of œÅdmca œÅmin in order to find this optimum several window lengths need to be applied the maximum possible value of tr tr max hr can be attributed to the maximum tested window length lmax hr this lmax value can be considered as the only parameter of this approach this parameter limits the maximum value of tr as lmax 1 2 tr max the numerator in equation 1 represents the bivariate fluctuation of streamflow and runoff while the denominator contains the squared fluctuations of the rainfall and streamflow time series the sign of the rainfall and streamflow fluctuations carries physical meaning the center of mass is preceded by a negative fluctuation and followed by a positive one giani et al 2021 therefore œÅmin is achieved when the value of l is closest to the time between the centers of masses a detailed step by step introduction to the dmca method is presented by giani et al 2021 along with a detailed description of the calculation steps interpretation the proposed e dmca method takes advantage of the fluctuations mentioned above by introducing a new parameter pth the dmca method applied to the whole time series results in a single characteristic value of tr tr char using the time window lmin attributed to this characteristic tr and relying on the cumulative rainfall and streamflow time series fluctuations rainfall runoff events are expected to be located at sections having positive rainfall and negative streamflow fluctuations these sections can be found by applying a threshold value pth as a new parameter based on this hypothesis the steps of event selection and tr calculation were defined as follows i estimating the characteristic tr and the corresponding value of lmin using the dmca method of giani et al 2021 on the entire time series ii normalizing the rainfall and streamflow fluctuation time series nrain lmin and nflow lmin attributed to lmin the normalization of the fluctuation time series is only performed to facilitate data comparison and visualization but it does not affect the result of the event selection iii finding the time instants in the normalized fluctuation time series where rainfall fluctuations are higher than 1 pth and streamflow fluctuations are lower than the pth threshold value the threshold value is defined as a percentile of the entire normalized fluctuation time series nflow lmin and nrain lmin the selection criteria can be written as p nrain lmin 1 pth p nflow lmin pth where p represents percentiles the time instants meeting the criteria form continuous sections of consecutive time steps iv selecting the first time instant i e the beginning of the events for each continuous section identified in step iii v calculating the value of tr for each event tr event with the dmca method the time window for each event starts tr max hours before the first time instant and ends two times tr max hours after the first time instant vi excluding ill conditioned events with œÅmin 0 and with tr event tr max see further explanation below vii removing outliers from the final set of event based values outliers were defined as elements in excess of triple the scaled median absolute deviation from the median of the original set of values the interpretation of these steps is visualized in fig 3 for sections of real data step i utilizes the dmca method presented by giani et al 2021 steps ii iv build on the outcome tr char or lmin of step i to perform the event selection since both the original and normalized fluctuation time series follow a symmetric distribution the event selection threshold pth was defined as percentiles in step iii this way the event selection criteria are adjusted to the characteristics of the rainfall and streamflow time series for each catchment step iii results in continuous sections where the threshold criteria are met in step iv every first time instant of these sections will be selected as the start of the event the time windows had to be fitted to each starting point in the next step these time windows specify the beginning and endpoints of the time periods for which the dmca method is applied again separately for every event the length of the time window was selected based on the rule of thumb applied in the unit hydrograph method see step v above since the base of the triangular unit response hydrograph is often described in relation to tr feh institute of hydrology 1999 this way a set of tr values tr event can be retrieved from the whole time series for each watershed please note that in steps i v the event selection and tr estimation for every event is performed in step vi and vii some of the inadequate values are removed from tr event ill conditioned events consist of rainfall and runoff time series the dmca method yields inadequate tr values with events resulting in a positive value of œÅmin are not necessarily unacceptable but it was found that a positive coefficient indicates ill conditioned events in most cases events resulting in tr values equivalent of tr max may also be ill conditioned or have longer tr than tr max therefore these values were also excluded an example of œÅmin 0 and another for tr event tr max can be seen in fig 3 along with an example of a well conditioned event the ratio of ill conditioned events ranged between 0 and 3 18 and 1 93 2 96 respectively the filtered outliers made 0 1 16 of the initially selected events the strengths and weaknesses of the presented event selection method are discussed in more detail in section 4 1 the matlab function of the e dmca method nagy 2022 is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6822134 3 4 sensitivity analysis and goodness of fit measures the e dmca method has two parameters a the maximum value of tr tr max lmax 1 2 and b the threshold value of fluctuations identifying events pth a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of the proposed method during this analysis a wide range of the two parameters were tested see section 4 3 for results the consistency of the sensitivity analysis was ensured by a twofold cross validation approach the sensitivity analysis was performed for two subsets of the catchments of equal number the catchments were sorted into the subsets randomly the goodness of fit was measured between the median of tr event and the median of definition f as the dmca method tends to match the maxima of the rainfall and streamflow time series for details see section 5 2 during the sensitivity analysis and comparison of the results of event selection methods the following goodness of fit measures were applied pearson correlation coefficient r nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 root mean squared error rmse hr and the sum of relative differences Œ¥tr these were calculated as 6 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 7 nse 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 8 rmse i 1 n y i x i 2 n 9 Œ¥ t r i 1 n y i x i i 1 n x i 100 where xi is the value of tr yielded by the baseline sm or sbes method yi is the value of tr resulting from the e dmca method and n is the number of observations the value of r can range from 1 to 1 meaning perfect inverse linear and linear relationship respectively the value of nse shows the model s capability of yielding a better estimate than the mean of the observed values and its value can range from to 1 if nse is in the range of 0 1 the model provides a better estimation than the observed values mean an nse value of 1 represents a perfect fit the rmse value is zero for a perfect fit and the lower the value the better is the fit the value of Œ¥tr defines the fit s estimation error in percentage relative to the observed values a negative Œ¥tr implies a general underestimation of the observed values a value of 0 does not represent a perfect fit it only means that there is no significant under or overestimation 4 results 4 1 comparison of event characteristics from different selection methods the three methods selected different sets of events and as a result the statistical characteristics of various parameters may considerably differ although the three methods cannot be compared objectively based on the number of events we provide the number of selected events per catchment per year for each event selection method in supplementary material s2 section 3 the largest number of events is obtained by the e dmca method followed by the sbes and the sm respectively the lowest number by sm is due to the discharge threshold and the visual inspection when any disturbed runoff event was rejected step i and ii in section 3 1 in order to compare the event selection capability of the e dmca approach the runoff ratio Œ± and the value of tr was assessed for every event selected by the sm e dmca and sbes methods the runoff ratio was calculated as the ratio of the total runoff and the total precipitation while tr was calculated using the dmca method for each subsection of rainfall and runoff data figs 4 and 5 present the different percentiles of the calculated tr and Œ± values for every selected event sections 1 and 2 in supplementary material s2 includes more details separately for every percentile including plots for all events and only matched events the value of tr demonstrates a stronger correlation between the results of the e dmca and the sbes methods than the e dmca and the sm methods the middle range of the values p 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 is captured well while the low and high values p 0 1 and 0 9 less so both e dmca and sbes methods result in slightly smaller tr values than the sm one in contrast e dmca shows considerably less scatter than sbes when they are compared to sm considering the Œ± values the best agreement is obtained between sm and e dmca not only the variation of the median values from the sbes method œÉ 0 5 3 20 10 3 is higher than that either from the e dmca œÉ 0 5 6 04 10 4 or sm œÉ 0 5 7 59 10 4 method but also the deviation from the 1 1 line the sbes method shows remarkable under and overestimations in the range of 0 02 0 09 against both the sm and e dmca methods we highlight that the runoff ratio is explicitly checked only in the case of the expert based sm method during the event selection procedure the median values of Œ± yielded by the sbes method are higher on average than of the e dmca method the interpretation of these results is given in section 5 1 4 2 comparison of the catchment response time values resulting from different methods the sm event selection resulted in eight different tr values according to the definitions shown in fig 2 for the 61 catchments 2152 events another set of event based values tr event for each catchment was provided by the e dmca method while the original dmca method gave a characteristic tr tr char value for the whole time series the final results were obtained by employing tr max 150 h and pth 0 05 based on the sensitivity analysis results see section 4 3 the difference between the characteristic value tr char obtained by the dmca method and the median of the values tr median resulting from the e dmca method is presented in fig 6 the characteristic tr shows good agreement with tr median having a pearson correlation of 0 967 and nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 935 the difference is equal to or higher than 40 in six watersheds shown by red markers which is 10 of the total number of catchments the difference is only 1 3 h in the case of four watersheds 14 16 29 55 which have a smaller area and therefore a smaller tr in one case 37 the flow may be distorted by measurement errors yielding irregular nflow curves in this case the e dmca method captures a fewer number of events than the sm method the proposed method appears to capture a higher number of the smaller peaks and fewer large ones at catchment 7 therefore yields a shorter response time than the characteristic tr nevertheless 85 of the watersheds has an error 20 in case of the sm event selection all eight definitions see fig 2 were applied for each event the median values from each definition were compared to the medians tr median of the e dmca method both considering every selected events and only those selected by both methods in fig 7 the goodness of fit measures described in section 3 4 were also calculated table 3 a figure figure s4 similar to fig 7 is provided in supplementary material s2 comparing the values yielded by the combination of the sbes and dmca methods and the values resulting from the different definitions the median of the eight different tr definitions gave diverse results the two traditional definitions of tc a and b resulted in the highest values followed by the medians of te and tp definitions g and h the remaining four definitions yielded similar values from these four definitions e and d standing for tl and definitions f and c the two unconventional definitions of tc expressed the best agreement with the values of tr median respectively the match is the closest to the 1 1 line in case of definition f which is the time elapsed between the peaks of total rainfall and streamflow the four best performing definitions resulted in nse values higher than 0 8 and rmse values under 6 2 h Œ¥tr shows negative values in every case which means that tr median somewhat underestimates the values resulting from the different definitions this estimation error ranges two orders of magnitude and the smallest value is over 1 the absolute value of Œ¥tr is under 2 for definitions d f as the e dmca procedure appeared to capture the median of definition f it is instructive to compare the distributions of the event based values resulting from the sm and the proposed method for this definition therefore the values representing the p 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 0 9 percentiles p 0 5 being the median were compared the plots of the five percentiles can be seen in fig 8 the goodness of fit measures for each percentile can be found in table 4 for a better comparison the different percentiles are also plotted for the events selected by both methods in fig 8 in table 4 the corresponding goodness of fit measures are also provided in parentheses the different percentiles of the e dmca method gave satisfactory results overall the percentile plot is generally symmetric along the 1 1 line and the length of the whiskers are similar in most cases see fig 8 the value of nse is 0 708 on average while the value of r exceeds 0 875 in every case rmse shows a considerable increase as the estimated percentile increases the increase of error is expected since the range of the estimated values also increases however the relative error varies the p 0 1 and 0 75 percentiles are over while the other percentiles are underestimated the largest relative error is somewhat higher than 10 in the case of the largest values p 0 9 as it appears in fig 8 the e dmca values tend to overestimate the larger values and underestimate the lower ones in case of the higher percentiles p 0 75 and 0 9 4 3 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis introduced in section 3 4 are presented in fig 9 the event selection was performed using the parameter value ranges of pth 0 0 01 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 4 0 5 and tr max values from 50 to 350 hr incremented by 25 hr note that pth 0 results in the selection of no events and pth 0 5 results in selecting every possible event due to the symmetry of the rainfall and flow fluctuation distributions tr max 0 hr also results in the selection of no events therefore the lowest value of the tested range was set to 50 hr while the highest value was set to 350 hr the optimal combination of the two parameters tr max and pth was identified for all goodness of fit measures introduced in section 3 4 the goodness of fit measures were calculated between the median of the tr values yielded by the proposed method tr median and the median of the values resulting from definition f tr def f the number of selected events per watershed per year was also calculated the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the number of events selected with the e dmca approach only depends on the value of the threshold pth fig 9e this was expected since the event selection relies on the fluctuations calculated using the characteristic tr yielded by the dmca method which is not changing if the tr s value is higher than the characteristic tr however the number of events selected increases exponentially as the value of the threshold increases a number of 20 events per watershed per year is reached near the value of pth 0 05 which can be considered a high value based on other studies see table 1 the value of tr max has more effect on the set of event based values as it limits the upper part of the tr event s distribution this effect becomes clearly visible when the value of tr max goes under 150 h as all the goodness of fit measures show a sharp increase decline when tr max 150 hr and pth 0 05 the different goodness of fit measures show somewhat different distributions for the two sets of catchments see section 3 4 the range of optimal tr max goes from 75 to 150 h and the value of optimal pth is between 0 025 and 0 1 the optimum values match in the case of nse and rmse fig 9a 9d Œ¥tr yielded slightly different optima while r resulted in considerably different optima fig 9b 9c however r can be misleading since its value denotes a linear relationship and does not give information on the estimation error s extent consequently the strongest linear relation between the modeled and estimated values does not necessarily coincide with the smallest estimation error based on the sensitivity analysis results displayed in fig 9 application of the parameter values tr max 150 h and p 0 05 is considered well justified to run the e dmca method for the whole dataset 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of event characteristics from different selection methods fig 10 provides examples for the results of the event selection from the three different methods fig 10a demonstrates that the sm method is the most restrictive as it missed many of the events selected by the other two methods fig 10b provides examples for overlapping time windows in the case of the e dmca method overlaps between events also occur with the sbes method but rarely fig 10a and 10b represent two catchments with relatively short and long response times at some of the catchments the sbes method failed to choose the largest observed flood events fig 10c but in a few cases 5 5 of the years it selected a higher number of events than the other two methods fig 10d this suggest that the applied parameters of the sbes method should be calibrated individually for each catchment the strongly variable performance of the three applied methods can be best observed in march and april of fig 10e fig 10f h provide further examples for the various performance the e dmca method was able to select more events than the sbes or both methods fig 10f g respectively based on the results selecting a few events by all three methods in one year as in fig 10h can be considered a relatively good match among the methods at this catchment the observed differences may stem from the different selection strategies of the applied methods the general aim of the sm method was to provide a set of hydrologically reliable events through a strict selection procedure this included the visual screening of the runoff events to provide floods with a clear rising and recession limb lacking missing interpolated values and measurement error and the removal of events with less precipitation than direct runoff see section 3 1 for more details this lead to the exclusion of a large proportion 61 5 of the events but this does not mean that these excluded events were falsely identified by the other two methods furthermore the comparison of all selected events with the matched ones figs 7 and 8 showed that the exclusion of these events does not result in a bias in other words a less strict selection strategy would lead to same results and the proposed method can provide a great number of reliable events for other hydrological analyses the sbes method relies on the variance of the runoff time series which varies at different temporal resolutions since the sbes method was developed using daily time series the occasionally poor performance of the sbes method presented in this paper using hourly time series could be further improved through a more extensive calibration of the method s numerous parameters this means a re calibration of the parameters for each catchment even though the runoff event selection could be likely enhanced as mentioned before the runoff ratios would not necessarily improve since the sbes method does not account for the amount of rainfall attributed to the runoff events in contrast to the e dmca and sm methods the e dmca method fails to identify some of the events due to two main reasons a the event is identified but it is ill conditioned see section 3 3 or b the corresponding precipitation arrives too early late or is quantitatively insufficient i e the selection criteria introduced in section 3 3 is not fulfilled despite these cases the e dmca method appeared to perform well as discussed in the following sections regarding the runoff ratios the sm and e dmca values showed the strongest correlation while the values from the sbes method showed little agreement with the values yielded by the other two sm and e dmca methods the values were also plotted using every selected event and only for the events selected by the two compared methods see supplementary material s2 sections 1 and 2 the runoff ratios resulting from the sbes method show stronger correlation with the values yielded by the sm method when only the matching events are compared the difference between examining all events and only the matching events is not notable when comparing the e dmca and sm methods this means to us that in contrast to the e dmca method the further selected events by the sbes method may not be reliable and a visual inspection would be necessary this is a clear disadvantage in the case of an automated method the sbes method s values generally overestimate the runoff ratios resulting from the e dmca method see fig 5 and the overestimation grows more significant as the percentile decreases the above mentioned discrepancies can be attributed again to the selection strategies of the different methods the sm method employs several strict and arbitrary criteria in order to produce a smaller but hydrologically reliable set of rainfall runoff events since the sm method requires the separation of base flow and effective precipitation leading to the exclusion of events with less precipitation than direct runoff its results can be considered the most reliable an important aspect of the sbes method is that it does not consider the volume of the precipitation therefore it does not ensure that the amount of the attributed rainfall is sufficient to produce the identified runoff this could lead to the larger differences between the values of the sm and sbes methods when comparing every selected event instead of matching events the e dmca method builds upon both the rainfall and the runoff fluctuation time series meaning the method cannot select a runoff event if there is no precipitation or the precipitation is too small to produce fluctuation above pth this may result in the stronger correlation between the sm and e dmca methods considering the tr values resulting from the different methods the sbes and e dmca methods exhibit the strongest correlation in contrast the tr values yielded by the sm method are somewhat longer than the tr resulting from the other two sbes and e dmca methods this can be attributed to two main factors first the number of matching events is very low 0 871 and 1 76 events per catchment per year on average between the sm and the other two methods for more details see supplementary material s2 section 3 if some of these events are not well defined i e the beginning and or the end of the event is mispositioned the resulting tr can be easily distorted second the sm method defines longer time windows for the events than the other two event selection methods this can lead to longer tr values after the application of the dmca method based on the comparative analysis of the Œ± and tr values the events selected by the proposed e dmca method appears to be appropriate when considering the time requirements to evaluate the sm sbes and e dmca methods they can yield results in days hours and minutes respectively furthermore the proposed e dmca method employs only two parameters while the sbes method requires nine these properties of the proposed method underline that the e dmca method is the most efficient tool to assess an event based set of tr values from rainfall and runoff time series a more detailed assessment of additional event characteristics e g event duration ratio of peak discharge to base flow etc could highlight further strengths and weaknesses of the examined methods the evaluation of other available event selection methods see table 1 could reveal further insights of the different approaches of event selection 5 2 evaluation of the various catchment response times resulting from the sm and e dmca methods the e dmca method yielded satisfactory results in every examined aspect the median of tr event matched the characteristic tr estimated with the original method of giani et al 2021 quite well rmse 2 87 hr since the dmca tr estimation method can only yield integers for hourly time series the relative error can be high for smaller catchments with shorter tr using a shorter time step for smaller catchments could produce a better estimation in these cases application of the different tr definitions resulted in theoretically plausible relations definitions c f gave the best results with only slight differences rmse 6 13 4 88 hr the dmca method defines the time between the centroids of total rainfall and streamflow but it tends to give more weight to higher peaks giani et al 2021 as we tested the original dmca tr estimation method we also found that it appears to match the peaks of the observed rainfall and runoff time series in the case of multi peaked events this is especially true when the rainfall and streamflow peak is close to each other i e the last peak of the rainfall and the first peak of the streamflow are the largest ones for this reason we aimed to test the efficiency of the e dmca method against definition f however the relatively small difference in performance among definitions c f implies that this choice did not affect the efficiency of the proposed method considerably by definition tc is calculated based on velocity while te is calculated based on celerity beven 2020 since celerity is normally higher than velocity beven 2020 the value of tc is expected to be larger than the value of te in fact tc s value can be considered an upper limit of catchment response time giani et al 2021 even though giani et al 2021 used definition a to calculate tr for the selected events in their study their results showed a 1 1 match between the characteristic tr calculated with the original dmca method and the median of the values assessed using definition a however the results presented in this study are more plausible since the dmca method should yield a value closer to tl by nature and tl must be shorter than tc based on their definitions for a deeper understanding of the connection between the various time parameters we attributed different percentiles of the tr event values resulting from the e dmca method to the median values of definitions a f g and h fig 11 displays the value of rmse in relation to the different percentiles of tr event p along with the best fit for definitions a f g and h for the events selected by both methods for example the rmse is the lowest near p 0 5 in the case of definition f since the e dmca method was optimized to the median of definition f the characteristic value of tc can be estimated by picking the maximum of the tr event values resulting from the e dmca approach at a satisfactory level rmse 13 1 hr this is reasonable since tc can be considered an upper limit of a catchment s tr by definition the median of tp can also be estimated as the p 0 61 percentile of tr event with rmse 5 30 hr however the value of te was assessed with much lower precision rmse 10 0 hr nevertheless the range of these time parameters increase in the expected order namely tc te tp tl in addition to the work of giani et al 2021 the e dmca method presented in this paper managed to assess different percentiles of the tr distribution at a satisfactory level rmse 3 32 12 9 hr it cannot be undoubtedly decided which event selection method gives more realistic results since there is no unified method to collect rainfall runoff events the sm method involves arbitrary choices which makes the process less objective and unreproducible the proposed method is more of a stochastic approach since it collects rainfall runoff events based on probability through the parameter pth this method produces a set of values including a higher number of the extremely short and long tr values which results in the observed differences however the e dmca method is able to capture the variable nature of tr and yields its distribution in minutes 5 3 sensitivity analysis based on the sensitivity analysis results the parameters tr max 150 hr and pth 0 05 can be used for similar catchments and identical climatic conditions the analysis illustrated that it is safer to overestimate the value of tr max than to underestimate it since tr max is the upper boundary of the event based set of values if tr max is underestimated it leads to a sharp decrease in the performance of the e dmca method see section 4 3 fig 9 the estimation error does not vary considerably in the range of pth 0 01 0 05 when tr max 150 hr the value of tr max matched the maximum of the values defined using definition f and approximately equals three times the maximum of the characteristic tr values yielded by the original dmca method therefore we suggest two methods to estimate tr max a assess tr max manually from the time series of the largest catchment by finding the longest response b perform the original dmca method for long time series then choose tr max equal to or greater than the triple of the longest characteristic tr to keep the number of selected events under an average of 20 events per catchment per year we suggest using a value of pth smaller than 0 05 however the number of selected events can strongly vary across different climatic regions applied methods and criteria see table 1 therefore the values of pth can be adjusted to the specific conditions and requirements the parameter values suggested above could be used for similar catchments making the evaluation of the event selection externally dispensable however the method should be tested on a larger more variable set of catchments in order to extend the applicability of the e dmca method and assess the robustness of the two parameters in more detail the sm method could be performed more sufficiently using only definition f for a larger dataset since the separation of effective rainfall and direct runoff is not necessary in this case 6 conclusions the e dmca method presented in this study was able to select rainfall runoff events to estimate the range of possible tr values in the case of 61 medium sized hungarian catchments the following conclusions can be drawn from the performed analysis the e dmca method is capable of selecting events from long time series and yield an event based set of tr values tr event in an automated fashion thus effectively obliterating days of work normally required to perform a non automated approach based on the results of the sensitivity analysis an optimal range value was identified for the two parameters pth and tr max needed to perform the presented method see section 3 3 the range for pth is 0 01 0 05 while the value of tr max can be estimated as triple the maximum of the characteristic tr values resulting from the application of the original dmca method on long time series compared to the values resulting from the different graphical definitions the tr values of the new method are the closest to the time elapsed between the peaks of the total rainfall and runoff in addition the characteristic value of tc can be estimated as the maximum of the event based set of values tr event yielded by the e dmca method the application of the event selection method of fischer et al 2021 highlighted that the rainfall runoff events identified by the e dmca method are hydrologically reliable considering rainfall runoff ratios this is due to the fact that the e dmca method cannot select a runoff event if there is no sufficient preceding precipitation while the method of fischer et al 2021 does not consider the amount of rainfall it was also demonstrated that the proposed method is easier to implement as it has only two parameters instead of nine this is especially true at the hourly temporal resolution since the runtime of the e dmca method is considerably shorter the added value of the proposed method is that it yields a range of physically possible values instead of a characteristic value per watershed in one step and within minutes this is an important step toward future implementation of modeling non linear and stochastic catchment behavior in everyday engineering hydrological applications the proposed e dmca method yielded promising results assessed by the runoff ratio and catchment response time the authors intend to broaden the analysis of the proposed method in the future with regard to the number of i event selection methods tested ii rainfall runoff event characteristics assessed iii catchments examined and iv temporal resolution
