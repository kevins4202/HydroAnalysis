9470,agrivoltaic systems avs are emerging mixed production systems where crops are cultivated below the photovoltaic pv panels this study investigated the effects of different pv shading levels on kiwifruit growth yield and water productivity wpc with three densities of 19 0 t1 30 4 t2 and 38 0 t3 of translucent pv panels installed on the south oriented avs roof the avs perimeter was left open with the full sun treatment outside the avs as the control treatment ckl results showed that the solar radiation in t1 t2 and t3 was reduced by 43 8 0 6 50 5 0 6 and 55 0 0 5 respectively compared with ckl whereas the air temperature was uniform and the relative humidity increased with increased pv shading the leaf area index and leaf light use efficiency improved while the leaf transpiration rate photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency decreased with increased shading the accumulated transpiration t was higher in ckl 419 9 9 9 mm than shading treatments 380 8 26 7 319 2 15 1 and 308 8 12 9 mm in t1 t2 and t3 respectively and shading also reduced soil evaporation e 63 4 1 0 51 9 3 1 and 47 4 3 8 mm in t1 t2 and t3 respectively compared to 79 4 1 1 mm in ckl and thus decreased the total evapotranspiration etc act e t requirement the kiwifruit volume and yield were slightly reduced 7 3 to 5 5 and 6 5 to 2 6 in t1 relative to ckl 101 4 106 8 cm3 and 17 6 18 9 t ha while the negative effects of shading on the volume and yield were significant p 0 05 in t2 and t3 the water productivity wpc was improved in t1 8 2 5 7 and t2 5 8 1 9 relative to ckl however it was significantly reduced in t3 9 8 1 4 it was concluded that 19 t1 pv coverage was a suitable shading treatment management in the avs as kiwifruit growth and yield were less affected and wpc was increased with reduced water consumption the total potential profit can be largely promoted from electricity production especially for dry rainfed and no electricity remote areas where they can benefit from using produced electricity locally for irrigation keywords sustainable production photovoltaic shading kiwifruit growth water use light use efficiency 1 introduction the balance between the environment and energy consumption with the rapid population growth has attracted the attention of government decision makers allardyce et al 2017 keating et al 2014 soni et al 2013 recently solar photovoltaic pv has been widely utilized because of the advantageous government policy support for green energy production and significantly reduced carbon emissions during their usage abel et al 2018 traditional pv power generation is installed on the ground occupying large agricultural cultivated lands adeh et al 2019 agrivoltaic systems avs appear to be an optimal practice allowing the production of crop and electricity power simultaneously on the same land area allardyce et al 2017 dupraz et al 2011 such systems are being designed to conciliate the growing competition for land use resulting from the need for increased agricultural production and a green renewable energy supply adeh et al 2019 hassanien et al 2018 ren et al 2016 pv panels filter the wavelengths more or less

production e g lettuce cucumber onion tomato and pepper in replicated or prototyped avs hassanien et al 2018 kadowaki et al 2012 marrou et al 2013b 2013c zisis et al 2019 besides the changes in the microclimate under pv panels may also arouse heterogeneous leaf photosynthesis and water uptake marrou et al 2013c for example marrou et al 2013a demonstrated that shading by the pv panels could change the canopy leaf latent heat exchange by affecting canopy resistance loik et al 2017 proved that shading by the pv coverage decreased tomato photosynthesis and water use the changed microclimate and crop growth in avs therefore have significant impacts on their yield fankhauser and batschauer 2016 liu et al 2018 marrou et al 2013c however the effect of shading on crop yield is controversial and closely related to the pv coverage ratio on the roof no significant inhibitory effects on tomato and cucumber productions were found when the pv coverage ratio was lower than 20 hassanien et al 2018 marrou et al 2013c the negative effect of pv shading on the size and hardness of tomatoes was observed but there was no significant effect on yield under a 9 8 pv roof coverage ezzaeri et al 2018 in fact by covering a small portion of roof area crop yields are comparable or even improved due to pest control and environmental protection compared to those planted outside however the detrimental effects on crop growth development and yield were worsened as the increased pv coverage ratio affected the avs microclimate to a greater extent ezzaeri et al 2018 kadowaki et al 2012 besides the development and physiological processes of lettuces durum wheat and cucumber in an avs were tested and responded differently to the same level of shade marrou et al 2013b as shade intolerance is a species special physiological constraint cossu et al 2020 rizzalli et al 2002 crop growth and production are closely related to shading level crop species and climate characteristics therefore this necessitates a deeper understanding of pv shade on crop production which is the premise for optimized economic productivity evaluation in such a mixed system using tinted semi transparent solar panels for avs has been recommended previously but there is no research investigating the effects of avs on fruit tree growth kiwifruit plantation in southwest china has increased rapidly during the last few years because of its commercial significance accounting for about 20 4 of the national kiwifruit planting area until 2017 however no irrigation restricts high efficient kiwifruit production in most rural parts of southwest china due to a lack of electricity support besides kiwifruit was chosen as a tested crop because it belongs to a shade loving species with high humidity requirements g montanaro et al 2009 the unclear characterization of kiwifruit growth and water use with different pv shading levels makes it difficult for the growers to determine the proper pv coverage ratio in their agricultural production the present study aimed to determine 1 whether the spectral characteristics and internal climate significantly change in avs 2 if kiwifruit tree leaf photosynthetic characteristics and canopy transpiration can adapt to pv shade and 3 to what extent different shading levels influence kiwifruit fruit growth and yield such experiments can provide the scientific basis for the combined production of kiwifruit and electric power in southwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in the experimental kiwifruit base in fuxing township pujiang county located in chengdu plain china 30 19 n 103 25 e approximately 560 m a s l over three consecutive growing seasons from early april in 2018 to late october in 2020 this region is classified as a subtropical humid monsoon climate in the köppen climate classification with an average annual air temperature of 16 3 precipitation of 1301 mm and relative humidity of 84 from 1960 to 2019 at a nearby meteorological station the saturated volumetric soil water content θs and field water capacity were 0 47 cm3 cm 3 and 0 34 cm3 cm 3 respectively the orchard field was approximately 133 ha in size 15 year old kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan were chosen as the experimental trees the trees were equally spaced with planting spacing of 4 0 m and row spacing of 5 0 m along the kiwi fruit row direction there were cement pillars installed every 8 m with a height of 1 8 m on which 3 iron wires were pulled left and right respectively fig s1 in supplementary materials the kiwi shoots were fixed on the iron wires the height of the trees ranged between 1 8 and 2 2 m with a crown size of 4 0 m 3 5 m 2 2 experimental design the pvs had an area of 360 m2 without the wall around the roof was held at 3 0 m above the ground by a steel structure spaced on a 4 0 m 5 0 m grid the south s oriented roofs were made with translucent thin film pv panels and plastic polycarbonate hollow sheets pcs with a tilt angle of 16 fig 1a and they were installed alternately the north n oriented roofs were made with pcs only with a tilt angle of 28 the simulated optimal angle was 28 for maximum annual generated electric energy by the polysun program however the tilt angle was chosen to be 16 to fit the length of the pv panel in s oriented roofs with the avs structure the dust accumulating on the roofs was cleaned once a month to reduce the impact on photovoltaic output the layout and size of the experimental avs were shown in fig 1 the pv panels adopted in this study were made of thin film amorphous silicon with a transparent zinc oxide back conductive layer and clear front glass coated with fluorine tin oxide to protect sandwiched pv layers the pv panels could mainly absorb blue and green light while letting through the red light spectrum leading to the pv panels with an orange tint the transmission rate of the pv panels was 19 and the specific parameters of the pv panels were given in table s1 the panel transmission rate of the pcs was 85 a total of four treatments were designed in the field experiment the full sun treatment outside the avs was taken as the control ckl and the shade level was 0 the combination of pv panels and pcs resulted in three shading levels corresponding to three coverage ratios of pv panels on the roof the supporting structure was not calculated 19 0 treatment 1 t1 30 4 treatment 2 t2 and 38 0 treatment 3 t3 of the roof area covered with pv panels fig 1a c each treatment was 120 m2 24 0 m long 5 0 m

independent drip irrigation system the pv arrays run an electric motor 600 w connected to a pv pump the pv pump was installed near the water tank and connected to the drip fertigation system the peak rated power of the pv array was 6624 w which provided full energy for the pv pump to run the drip irrigation system the drip irrigation tape was arranged in a loop and each tree had 14 drippers with a flow rate of 2 0 l h irrigation was applied only when the swc at 20 60 cm depth of ckl fell below about 65 θf and the swc was irrigated to about 85 θf the swc was measured using a portable soil moisture meter pr2 delta t uk the trees were free of water deficit during the experimental period the irrigation frequency and quantity were the same for all the treatments ckl t1 t2 and t3 the

roof of each shading treatment the detailed calculation was shown in appendix a 2 3 4 tree transpiration and soil evaporation the sap flux density f d m3 m 2 s 1 was measured during the 2019 2020 growing seasons using the thermal dissipation method with granier type sensors e g granier 1987 each sensor consisted of a pair of probes the upper probe was a heater supplied with 0 2 w constant power and the lower probe was unheated as a reference two sensors were installed for each treatment and the probes were installed at 0 60 m above ground besides the sensors were placed on the north facing side of the trees to avoid the effect of the sun exposed side of the trunk and the part of the trunk where the sensors were inserted was fully isolated by the film to prevent any direct radiation the temperature differences between the heated probe and lower referred probe were recorded on a data logger rr1016 with a multiplexer ad16 24 grant uk every 30 s and were averaged over 30 min the measured data were then converted to fd according to the granier method granier 1987 6 f d 118 99 10 6 δ t max δ t δ t 1 231 where δtmax is the maximal temperature difference when ν 0 to determine mass flow at the insertion level fd is multiplied by the area of the conducting xylem section per unit of cover area as to obtain tree transpiration t mm h 1 in an hour 7 t f d a s 3 6 10 6 sapwood thickness of each sampling tree was measured on a core extracted with a 5 mm increment borer at about 0 6 m above ground the sapwood thickness was assessed as the mean of two orthogonal measurements the conducting xylem section area was calculated as a circular area the hourly sap flow rate for each treatment was calculated as the average sap flow rate for the two sampling trees the daily water use was the sum of hourly t in a day mm d 1 daily soil evaporation e was determined by eight micro lysimeters in 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the micro lysimeters were made with stainless steel with a diameter of 10 cm and a depth of 15 cm two micro lysimeters were installed in each treatment to make the operation more convenient the outer cylinders with a slightly larger diameter 11 cm in diameter and 15 cm in depth were pre buried into the ground the inner cylinders were weighted every day at 9 00 am beijing time using an electronic balance with a resolution of 0 01 g the soil of inner cylinders was replaced after each irrigation event or precipitation the e during the rainy days was ignored and regarded as zero in this study 2 3 5 fruit growth yield and water productivity kiwifruit shape parameters middle transverse diameter xi cm middle lateral diameter yi cm and longitudinal diameter zi cm were measured using a digital vernier caliper 500 197 20 mitutoyo japan every 1 2 weeks after the physiological fruit drop early may the volume was calculated using the cylinder volume formula as the shape of kiwifruit is approximate to a cylinder the absolute growth rate of the kiwifruit agr cm3 d 1 was assessed by the difference in volume δv cm3 and the days d between the two measurements perez perez et al 2014 campi et al 2020 five fruits were labeled and continuously measured in each tree during the season and two trees were measured in each treatment 8 v 1 5 i 1 5 1 4 β π x i y i z i 9 a g r δ v d where β is the empirical coefficient β 0 8 the total yield y t ha

shading severity on microclimate kiwifruit leaf characteristics yield and wpc during the growing season trait mean differences among the treatments were separated by duncan s multiple range test at a significance level of p 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss software version 20 0 ibm spss statistics usa 3 results 3 1 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on microclimate mean daily ta was uniform across the different shading treatment areas fig 2 while the rh inside the avs was significantly higher than that observed outside especially after may table s2 under the proof s pc received the highest amount of rs followed by n pc and s pv with a reduction of 28 8 0 8 39 6 0 7 and 83 2 0 2 compared to the rs outside the avs respectively table 1 the integrated rs in t1 t2 and t3 resulted in a reduction of 43 8 0 6 50 5 0 6 and 55 0 0 5 respectively compared to the ckl besides kiwifruit canopy leaves underwent an alternation of light and shade bands several times a day due to the spatial arrangement of the pv and pc panels in the avs roof the measured spectral encompassing 350 1100 nm signature inside and outside the avs on april 28 2018 from 13 00 13 10 beijing time was illustrated in fig 3a the rs encompassing 350 1100 nm inside the avs closing to the pc panel was maximum and the rs inside the avs closing to the pv panels was minimum fig 3a c the optical transparency of the pv and pc in the par region was between 0 2 30 2 and 8 5 78 5 respectively fig s2 the rs was 672 0 and 114 5 w m 2 closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs respectively which was reduced by 30 2 and 88 1 respectively compared to the rs potentially incident outside ckl fig 3c photosynthetic active radiation par encompassing 400 700 nm was 507 8 and 53 5 w m 2 closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs respectively which was reduced by 33 0 and 93 0 respectively the different light transmission rates and roof pv coverage rates caused a non uniform light intensity distribution inside the avs fig 3c the integrated rs decreased following a transversal ckl t1 t2 t3 gradient among the treatments fig 3d the integrated rs in 350 1100 nm in t1 t2 and t3 was reduced by 51 5 67 8 and 75 9 respectively the integrated par in t1 t2 and t3 was decreased by 54 3 70 8 and 78 7 respectively compared to that of ckl the transmissivity of the pv panels varied with the light wavelengths the green light intensity rs encompassing 500 570 nm was 111 8 w m 2 and 2 5 w m 2 at the positions closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs fig 3e which was reduced by 29 6 and 98 4 respectively compared to that of ckl 158 7 w m 2 the red and orange light intensity rs encompassing 600 780 nm was 222 7 w m 2 and 57 7 w m 2 at the positions closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs fig 3e which was decreased by 26 8 and 81 0 respectively compared to that of ckl 304 4 w m 2 the integrated green light intensity in t1 t2 and t3 was decreased by 51 8 72 9 and 81 2 respectively relative to the ckl similarly the integrated red and orange light intensity in t1 t2 and t3 was reduced by 47 7 62 8 and 71 3 respectively compared to that of ckl fig 3 f however the ratio of red and orange light intensity to green light intensity increased with the increase of pv coverage ratio on the roof with values of 2 2 2 6 and 2 9 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 3 f the increased ratio proved that more green lights were absorbed by pvs 3 2 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on the growth rhythm of kiwifruit the estimated relative chlorophyll content increased gradually with the leaf expansion and tended to be stable until the leaves matured fig 4 but the values in different shading treatments was not significantly affected lai in different treatments increased gradually and then decreased due to leaf senescence fig 5a the significantly increased lai was found with the increase of shading severity especially after may p 0 05 fig 5a the number of leaves diameter 1 cm decreased with the increase of shading on three shambling dates only the shambling date on 2018 7 11 was depicted in fig 5 fig 5c f however the average leaf diameter increased with the increase of shade compared to that of ckl and the 95th quantile and 90th quantile leaf diameter in shading treatments were also larger than that of ckl fig 5b 3 3 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on leaf water light use efficiency the typical diurnal variation of leaf tr and pn in different shading treatments was illustrated in fig 6 tr in different shading treatments varied with the par and showed consistency with the variation of par fig 6a b pn generally increased with the increase of par but the variations were diverse compared to that of tr fig 6b c tr and pn were generally decreased with the increased shading severity fig 6b c however in the typical day with high par in 2019 8 12 both tr and pn in t1 were higher than that of ckl fig 6 c3 the typical diurnal variation and averaged leaf wuei and lue under different shading treatments were illustrated in fig 7 the wuei and lue in different treatments generally decreased at first and then increased fig 7a the averaged wuei generally decreased significantly with increasing shading fig 7b while wuei in ckl 1 73 0 16 µmol mmol 1 was sometimes lower than that of t1 1 83 0 15 µmol mmol 1 fig 7b the diurnal leaf lue increased with the reduction of par in different shading treatments fig 7c therefore lue generally significantly increased with increasing shading fig 7d the seasonal variations of tree t in the four treatments were portrayed in fig 8 the t of different treatments increased gradually and then decreased due to leaf senescence during the two growing seasons fig 8a b the accumulated t in ckl t1 t2 and t3 was 420 0 354 0 304 1 and 295 9 mm in 2019 growing season and 439 6 407 5 334 3 and 321 7 mm in 2020 growing season respectively fig 8e f the accumulated e in ckl t1 t2 and t3 was 80 5 62 5 55 0 and 51 2 mm in 2019 growing season 78 2 64 4 48 8 and 43 7 mm in 2020 growing season respectively fig 8g h the accumulated growing season etc act was highest in ckl reaching 500 4 mm in 2019 and 517 9 mm in 2020 respectively table 2 etc act in t1 t2 and t3 was respectively reduced by 16 8 28 3 and 30 6 in 2019 growing season 7 5 26 0 and 29 4 in 2020 growing season 3 4 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on single kiwifruit volume and total yield kiwifruit growth and physiological activities were affected by the decrease of solar radiation consequently significant differences were observed in fruit development among the treatments fig 9 in 2018 the average kiwifruit volume was largest in t1 with the value of 107 02 9 75 cm3 followed by ckl t2 and t3 with the values of 101 4 3 70 cm3 96 18 9 02 cm3 and 86 73 7 63 cm3 respectively fig 9a however in 2019 and 2020 the highest volume was observed in ckl fig 9b c the kiwifruit volume in t3 showed a significant reduction compared to that in ckl p 0 05 the volumes in t1 t2 and t3 were reduced by 7 3 9 6 and 16 0 respectively compared to ckl 106 78 7 99 cm3 in 2019 and 3 9 8 8 and 28 5 respectively compared with ckl 103 30 3 41 cm3 in 2020 growing season the agr of different treatments showed a consistent trend and they firstly increased until achieving the maximum value of about 2 0 cm 3 d 1 and then decreased quickly but stabilized after july fig 9d f the agr followed an order of ckl t1 t2 t3 which caused the same rank for the fruit volume the effects of different pv cover ratios on kiwifruit yield were illustrated in fig 10 in 2018 the yields in t1 t2 and t3 were reduced by 2 6 20 4 and 39 4 respectively compared to ckl 17 91 1 42 t ha 1 the yields in t1 t2 and t3 were reduced by 6 5 25 0 and 26 8 respectively in 2019 and 5 1 27 7 and 37 1 respectively compared to ckl in 2020 growing season the yield was similar between the ckl and t1 while was significantly different in t2 and t3 p 0 05 the wpc in ckl was 5 39 0 72 g kg 1 in 2019 and 5 83 0 52 g kg 1 in 2020 growing season the wpc in t1 and t2 was improved 4 2 12 3 and 4 5 7 2 but the wpc in t3 was significantly reduced 8 9 10 8 compared to that of ckl in the two growing seasons fig 10 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of pv shading on microclimate conditions in avs although significant differences in ta might be expected between the shading and control treatments as the shading of the pv panels contributed to reducing the temperature difference between the external and the internal environment in avs cossu et al 2017 hassanien et al 2018 the comparison of ta at different shading treatments and ckl in the present study did not show significant differences air masses heat exchange in the avs is in equilibrium with the external environment due to the open design therefore such design was given the low variability monitored between shading treatments which is different from the closed pv greenhouse system marrou et al 2013b differently a significant difference was observed among the treatments in terms of rh especially after the leaf expansion stage may and rh in t3 was 6 5 higher than ckl treatment the canopy development and structure of avs probably affected boundary layer resistance which could hinder the diffusion of canopy water vapor due to windbreak effects ahemd et al 2016 hassanien et al 2018 it has to be admitted that the experimental area in this study 360 m2 was relatively small compared to the avs prototype used for actual crop production several hectares while designing such replications would have involved a huge land area occupation and costly investment further experiments should be conducted to explore the impact of pv coverage on water heat exchange characteristics over the bigger size avs 4 2 the performance of kiwifruit leaf morphology under pv shading the estimated leaf chlorophyll content was not significantly affected by shading treatments indicating that shading may not change the kiwifruit leaf nitrogen concentration dai et al 2009 hassanien et al 2018 consistently a former study also proved that shading only weakly affected leaf nitrogen contents in trees niinemets et al 2015 in addition some other studies found that shading considerably altered nitrogen reallocation within a leaf dong et al 2015 niinemets et al 2015 sessa and givnish 2014 and an increase in nitrogen allocation into water soluble proteins can improve photosynthetic capacity in conifer cunninghamia lanceolata dong et al 2015 nevertheless there is still limited information on how nitrogen reallocation changes within kiwifruit leaves under pv shading compared to ckl kiwifruit laic in the shading treatments increased which was consistent with previous studies valle et al 2017 marrou et al 2013c besides it seemed that the enhanced canopy vegetative growth was caused by the increased leaf size fig 5 this favored light interception by the plant leaves that were partially shaded by pv panels thereby compensating for the deficit in transmitted light in avs in agreement with this previous studies have also proved that plants can adapt to shading conditions by enhancing radiation interception efficiency for compensating the light shortage in avs cossu et al 2020 valle et al 2017 thus kiwifruit trees can modify the leaf morphology and physiological process to adapt to the shaded environment 4 3 leaf photosynthesis and water use of kiwifruit under pv shading this study showed that tr and pn were reduced with the increasing shading in kiwifruit leaves in particular the pn in t3 was considerably lower than that in ckl the pn and tr were closely related to the available par excessive shading decreased solar radiation intercepted by the canopy affecting photosynthetic electron transport and key enzyme activity and consequently resulted in insufficient photosynthetic product synthesis and supply capacity in leaves dong et al 2015 in the current study decreases in wuei were mainly due to the significant reductions in pn rather than tr as pn was more restricted than tr activity due to stomal adjustment adapting to the shading conditions resulting in significantly lower wuei than those in ckl dong et al 2015 g montanaro et al 2009 li et al 2013 the increase in leaf lue under shading was observed in this study implying that kiwifruit leaves had a certain ability to acclimate shading conditions bloor 2003 adriano sofo et al 2009 found that shading leaves increased the distribution ratio of electron transport quantum in the psii reaction center and reduced the quantum ratio for heat dissipation thereby enhancing the lue of the shading leaves in addition the stronger solar radiation in ckl might have photoinhibition the photosynthesis of kiwifruit leaves was light saturated at approx 960 μmol photon m 2 s 1 fig s3 the higher radiation intensity could inactivate key enzymes or induce the photodamage risk simultaneously restrict the transpiration rate due to stomatal closure figs 7 c3 which could finally result in the decrease of pn and wuei yano and cossu 2019 therefore pv shading is a potential benefit to protect crops from excessive radiation in strong radiation regions ahemd et al 2016 marrou et al 2013a the reduced etc act requirements were found in the avs compared to the ckl due to reduced solar radiation aroca delgado et al 2019 ahemd et al 2016 consequently a reduction in reduced irrigation requirements can be expected cossu et al 2014 it could be verified that the e and t in shading treatments decreased as the intensity of the radiation decreased following a transversal t1 t3 gradient among the treatments besides it was found that the cumulative t in t2 was slightly higher than that of t3 it seems that shading enhanced canopy vegetative growth which compensated the reduced tr at the leaf level leading to higher transpiration even under shaded conditions köhler et al 2013 similar findings for accelerated vegetative growth of cacao under shade was previously reported isaac et al 2007 and higher transpiration per individual tree under shade due to enhanced vegetative growth was also observed in coffee van kanten and vaast 2006 and cacao trees cossu et al 2020 4 4 the performance of kiwifruit volume and yield under pv shading the average kiwifruit volume significantly decreased with the increasing shading in avs the reduced yield was remarkable under the avs compared to the ckl treatment the negative effects of shading on crop yield were previously reported on tomato under 50 pv panels coverage cossu et al 2014 and welsh onion under 13 pv coverage kadowaki et al 2012 the reduction in photosynthesis due to the constraints in par could result in a significant decrease in yield cockshull et al 1992 dai et al 2009 heuvelink 1995 however a maintained or even improved yield of lettuce marrou et al 2013c valle et al 2017 urena sanchez et al 2012 and pepper plants were found despite shading zisis et al 2019 plants adapt species specific physiological responses to shading and react by optimizing their photosynthetic rate or by modifying leaf development to harvest light more efficiently avoiding the severe sunlight deficit therefore the improved lettuce and pepper growth in their studies may be caused by improved radiation interception efficiency due to increased vegetative growth ahemd et al 2016 zisis et al 2019 kiwifruit adapted to shade by increasing its vegetative growth on the leaves while the improved intercepted light by enhanced leaves cover seemed could hardly compensate for the light shortage caused by the pv shade resulting in lower yield allardyce et al 2017 indicated that the accessible yield production not only depended on the total biomass resources produced by photosynthesis but also how they were distributed through the plant allardyce et al 2017 for instance tomato plants initiate shade avoidance strategies by rapid growth aiming to push leaves above the canopy and in this situation organic matter produced by photosynthesis are allocated into the stem and leaf growth rather than fruit yield marrou et al 2013c zisis et al 2019 such distribution of assimilates may benefit for leafy vegetable production i e lettuce but result in a reduction of fruit yields 4 5 application and limitation the advantage of avs is to combine the electricity produced and crop production although the yields may be reduced by the shading the economic income from the pv power may compensate for such losses besides the pv array maybe more useful for dry rainfed and no electricity remote areas where they can benefit to secure electricity access in rural areas far from commercial power lines using electricity locally produced and reducing the dependence of agricultural productions on fossil fuel in fact potential crop yields may increase because avs can provide continuous power for drip irrigation systems which can increase crop yields and save a great amount of irrigation water importantly the environmental benefits of using pv panels are considerable due to the reduction of co2 emission from burning fossil fuels hassanien et al 2018 the electricity generated from pv panels can also be injected into energy production of grid connected systems or consumed for light and greenhouse environment control for greenhouse crops the balance between electricity and food production has previously led to estimations of an optimal 30 maximum coverage of the roof kadowaki et al 2012 marrou et al 2013c currently an acceptable compromise between horticultural crop production and electricity generation is usually achieved when pv coverage is around or lower than 20 with slight yield losses and negligible influence on fruit quality aroca delgado et al 2019 urena sanchez et al 2012 the results in the present study indicated that suitable shading t1 may not cause a significant reduction in kiwifruit yield or adverse effects on kiwifruit growth nonetheless the excessive shading significantly reduced kiwifruit yield and wpc due to canopy vegetative growth therefore it is recommended that the avs can be designed with 19 coverage for kiwifruit production in southwest china with the advantage of improved wpc slight yield loss and compensation from electricity income these structures may increase the pay back time of the investment but they already represent a good compromise between electricity production and crop cultivation it has to be mentioned that there were no rows between the neighboring treatments as a buffer in the current field experiment which may arise the intervention between the neighboring treatments especially during the early morning and late afternoon period see fig s4 however in the present study the crown of the trees was 4 0 m 3 5 m and there was about a 1 5 m gap between the neighboring treatments thus there should be no interactive influence between the different treatments during the most time of the day and therefore the overlapped influences could be ignored in this study besides the irrigation frequency and amount of water were the same for all the treatments ckl t1 t2 and t3 and this could result in different swc due to different water requirements between the treatments it is difficult to keep the same swc in different shading treatments in a field experiment since the trees were free of water deficit the difference between the treatments were mainly attributed to the pv shading levels 5 conclusion the shading treatments t1 t2 and t3 with translucent thin film pv panels under avs resulted in a significant reduction of solar radiation compared to ckl no significant difference was monitored for ta among the treatments whereas significantly increased rh was observed with increasing shading expanding kiwifruit leaf area was a species specific response to shading for intercepting more light though estimated leaf chlorophyll content did not show a significant difference among the treatments p 0 05 leaf tr pn and wuei generally decreased while lue increased with increasing shading besides suitable shading may benefit the leaf physiological process for avoiding excessive radiation shading reduced tree t soil e and total etc act demonstrating a reduced irrigation requirement in the avs the kiwifruit volume and yield were slightly reduced in t1 relative to ckl while the negative effects of shading were significant p 0 05 in t2 and t3 the shading t1 at 19 0 improved wpc by reducing etc act and decreased yield slightly compared to ckl p 0 05 thus t1 represented a good compromise between fruit production and pv coverage and the avs can be designed with 19

9470,agrivoltaic systems avs are emerging mixed production systems where crops are cultivated below the photovoltaic pv panels this study investigated the effects of different pv shading levels on kiwifruit growth yield and water productivity wpc with three densities of 19 0 t1 30 4 t2 and 38 0 t3 of translucent pv panels installed on the south oriented avs roof the avs perimeter was left open with the full sun treatment outside the avs as the control treatment ckl results showed that the solar radiation in t1 t2 and t3 was reduced by 43 8 0 6 50 5 0 6 and 55 0 0 5 respectively compared with ckl whereas the air temperature was uniform and the relative humidity increased with increased pv shading the leaf area index and leaf light use efficiency improved while the leaf transpiration rate photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency decreased with increased shading the accumulated transpiration t was higher in ckl 419 9 9 9 mm than shading treatments 380 8 26 7 319 2 15 1 and 308 8 12 9 mm in t1 t2 and t3 respectively and shading also reduced soil evaporation e 63 4 1 0 51 9 3 1 and 47 4 3 8 mm in t1 t2 and t3 respectively compared to 79 4 1 1 mm in ckl and thus decreased the total evapotranspiration etc act e t requirement the kiwifruit volume and yield were slightly reduced 7 3 to 5 5 and 6 5 to 2 6 in t1 relative to ckl 101 4 106 8 cm3 and 17 6 18 9 t ha while the negative effects of shading on the volume and yield were significant p 0 05 in t2 and t3 the water productivity wpc was improved in t1 8 2 5 7 and t2 5 8 1 9 relative to ckl however it was significantly reduced in t3 9 8 1 4 it was concluded that 19 t1 pv coverage was a suitable shading treatment management in the avs as kiwifruit growth and yield were less affected and wpc was increased with reduced water consumption the total potential profit can be largely promoted from electricity production especially for dry rainfed and no electricity remote areas where they can benefit from using produced electricity locally for irrigation keywords sustainable production photovoltaic shading kiwifruit growth water use light use efficiency 1 introduction the balance between the environment and energy consumption with the rapid population growth has attracted the attention of government decision makers allardyce et al 2017 keating et al 2014 soni et al 2013 recently solar photovoltaic pv has been widely utilized because of the advantageous government policy support for green energy production and significantly reduced carbon emissions during their usage abel et al 2018 traditional pv power generation is installed on the ground occupying large agricultural cultivated lands adeh et al 2019 agrivoltaic systems avs appear to be an optimal practice allowing the production of crop and electricity power simultaneously on the same land area allardyce et al 2017 dupraz et al 2011 such systems are being designed to conciliate the growing competition for land use resulting from the need for increased agricultural production and a green renewable energy supply adeh et al 2019 hassanien et al 2018 ren et al 2016 pv panels filter the wavelengths more or less

production e g lettuce cucumber onion tomato and pepper in replicated or prototyped avs hassanien et al 2018 kadowaki et al 2012 marrou et al 2013b 2013c zisis et al 2019 besides the changes in the microclimate under pv panels may also arouse heterogeneous leaf photosynthesis and water uptake marrou et al 2013c for example marrou et al 2013a demonstrated that shading by the pv panels could change the canopy leaf latent heat exchange by affecting canopy resistance loik et al 2017 proved that shading by the pv coverage decreased tomato photosynthesis and water use the changed microclimate and crop growth in avs therefore have significant impacts on their yield fankhauser and batschauer 2016 liu et al 2018 marrou et al 2013c however the effect of shading on crop yield is controversial and closely related to the pv coverage ratio on the roof no significant inhibitory effects on tomato and cucumber productions were found when the pv coverage ratio was lower than 20 hassanien et al 2018 marrou et al 2013c the negative effect of pv shading on the size and hardness of tomatoes was observed but there was no significant effect on yield under a 9 8 pv roof coverage ezzaeri et al 2018 in fact by covering a small portion of roof area crop yields are comparable or even improved due to pest control and environmental protection compared to those planted outside however the detrimental effects on crop growth development and yield were worsened as the increased pv coverage ratio affected the avs microclimate to a greater extent ezzaeri et al 2018 kadowaki et al 2012 besides the development and physiological processes of lettuces durum wheat and cucumber in an avs were tested and responded differently to the same level of shade marrou et al 2013b as shade intolerance is a species special physiological constraint cossu et al 2020 rizzalli et al 2002 crop growth and production are closely related to shading level crop species and climate characteristics therefore this necessitates a deeper understanding of pv shade on crop production which is the premise for optimized economic productivity evaluation in such a mixed system using tinted semi transparent solar panels for avs has been recommended previously but there is no research investigating the effects of avs on fruit tree growth kiwifruit plantation in southwest china has increased rapidly during the last few years because of its commercial significance accounting for about 20 4 of the national kiwifruit planting area until 2017 however no irrigation restricts high efficient kiwifruit production in most rural parts of southwest china due to a lack of electricity support besides kiwifruit was chosen as a tested crop because it belongs to a shade loving species with high humidity requirements g montanaro et al 2009 the unclear characterization of kiwifruit growth and water use with different pv shading levels makes it difficult for the growers to determine the proper pv coverage ratio in their agricultural production the present study aimed to determine 1 whether the spectral characteristics and internal climate significantly change in avs 2 if kiwifruit tree leaf photosynthetic characteristics and canopy transpiration can adapt to pv shade and 3 to what extent different shading levels influence kiwifruit fruit growth and yield such experiments can provide the scientific basis for the combined production of kiwifruit and electric power in southwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted in the experimental kiwifruit base in fuxing township pujiang county located in chengdu plain china 30 19 n 103 25 e approximately 560 m a s l over three consecutive growing seasons from early april in 2018 to late october in 2020 this region is classified as a subtropical humid monsoon climate in the köppen climate classification with an average annual air temperature of 16 3 precipitation of 1301 mm and relative humidity of 84 from 1960 to 2019 at a nearby meteorological station the saturated volumetric soil water content θs and field water capacity were 0 47 cm3 cm 3 and 0 34 cm3 cm 3 respectively the orchard field was approximately 133 ha in size 15 year old kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan were chosen as the experimental trees the trees were equally spaced with planting spacing of 4 0 m and row spacing of 5 0 m along the kiwi fruit row direction there were cement pillars installed every 8 m with a height of 1 8 m on which 3 iron wires were pulled left and right respectively fig s1 in supplementary materials the kiwi shoots were fixed on the iron wires the height of the trees ranged between 1 8 and 2 2 m with a crown size of 4 0 m 3 5 m 2 2 experimental design the pvs had an area of 360 m2 without the wall around the roof was held at 3 0 m above the ground by a steel structure spaced on a 4 0 m 5 0 m grid the south s oriented roofs were made with translucent thin film pv panels and plastic polycarbonate hollow sheets pcs with a tilt angle of 16 fig 1a and they were installed alternately the north n oriented roofs were made with pcs only with a tilt angle of 28 the simulated optimal angle was 28 for maximum annual generated electric energy by the polysun program however the tilt angle was chosen to be 16 to fit the length of the pv panel in s oriented roofs with the avs structure the dust accumulating on the roofs was cleaned once a month to reduce the impact on photovoltaic output the layout and size of the experimental avs were shown in fig 1 the pv panels adopted in this study were made of thin film amorphous silicon with a transparent zinc oxide back conductive layer and clear front glass coated with fluorine tin oxide to protect sandwiched pv layers the pv panels could mainly absorb blue and green light while letting through the red light spectrum leading to the pv panels with an orange tint the transmission rate of the pv panels was 19 and the specific parameters of the pv panels were given in table s1 the panel transmission rate of the pcs was 85 a total of four treatments were designed in the field experiment the full sun treatment outside the avs was taken as the control ckl and the shade level was 0 the combination of pv panels and pcs resulted in three shading levels corresponding to three coverage ratios of pv panels on the roof the

independent drip irrigation system the pv arrays run an electric motor 600 w connected to a pv pump the pv pump was installed near the water tank and connected to the drip fertigation system the peak rated power of the pv array was 6624 w which provided full energy for the pv pump to run the drip irrigation system the drip irrigation tape was arranged in a loop and each tree had 14 drippers with a flow rate of 2 0 l h irrigation was applied only when the swc at 20 60 cm depth of ckl fell below about 65 θf and the swc was irrigated to about 85 θf the swc was measured using a portable soil moisture meter pr2 delta t uk the trees were free of water deficit during the experimental period the irrigation frequency and quantity were the same for all the treatments ckl t1 t2 and t3 the

growing seasons using the thermal dissipation method with granier type sensors e g granier 1987 each sensor consisted of a pair of probes the upper probe was a heater supplied with 0 2 w constant power and the lower probe was unheated as a reference two sensors were installed for each treatment and the probes were installed at 0 60 m above ground besides the sensors were placed on the north facing side of the trees to avoid the effect of the sun exposed side of the trunk and the part of the trunk where the sensors were inserted was fully isolated by the film to prevent any direct radiation the temperature differences between the heated probe and lower referred probe were recorded on a data logger rr1016 with a multiplexer ad16 24 grant uk every 30 s and were averaged over 30

sapwood thickness of each sampling tree was measured on a core extracted with a 5 mm increment borer at about 0 6 m above ground the sapwood thickness was assessed as the mean of two orthogonal measurements the conducting xylem section area was calculated as a circular area the hourly sap flow rate for each treatment was calculated as the average sap flow rate for the two sampling trees the daily water use was the sum of hourly t in a day mm d 1 daily soil evaporation e was determined by eight micro lysimeters in 2019 and 2020 growing seasons the micro lysimeters were made with stainless steel with a diameter of 10 cm and a depth of 15 cm two micro lysimeters were installed in each treatment to make the operation more convenient the outer cylinders with a slightly larger diameter 11 cm in diameter and 15 cm in depth were pre buried into the ground the inner cylinders were weighted every day at 9 00 am beijing time using an electronic balance with a resolution of 0 01 g the soil of inner cylinders was replaced after each irrigation event or precipitation the e during the rainy days was ignored and regarded as zero in this study 2 3 5 fruit growth yield and water productivity kiwifruit shape parameters middle transverse diameter xi cm middle lateral diameter yi cm and longitudinal diameter zi cm were measured using a digital vernier caliper 500 197 20 mitutoyo japan every 1 2 weeks after the physiological fruit drop early may the volume was calculated using the cylinder volume formula as the shape of kiwifruit is approximate to a cylinder the absolute growth rate of the kiwifruit agr cm3 d 1 was assessed by the difference in volume δv cm3 and the days d between the two measurements perez perez et al 2014 campi et al 2020 five fruits were labeled and continuously

shading severity on microclimate kiwifruit leaf characteristics yield and wpc during the growing season trait mean differences among the treatments were separated by duncan s multiple range test at a significance level of p 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss software version 20 0 ibm spss statistics usa 3 results 3 1 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on microclimate mean daily ta was uniform across the different shading treatment areas fig 2 while the rh inside the avs was significantly higher than that observed outside especially after may table s2 under the proof s pc received the highest amount of rs followed by n pc and s pv with a reduction of 28 8 0 8 39 6 0 7 and 83 2 0 2 compared to the rs outside the avs respectively table 1 the integrated rs in t1 t2 and t3 resulted in a reduction of 43 8 0 6 50 5 0 6 and 55 0 0 5 respectively compared to the ckl besides kiwifruit canopy leaves underwent an alternation of light and shade bands several times a day due to the spatial arrangement of the pv and pc panels in the avs roof the measured spectral encompassing 350 1100 nm signature inside and outside the avs on april 28 2018 from 13 00 13 10 beijing time was illustrated in fig 3a the rs encompassing 350 1100 nm inside the avs closing to the pc panel was maximum and the rs inside the avs closing to the pv panels was minimum fig 3a c the optical transparency of the pv and pc in the par region was between 0 2 30 2 and 8 5 78 5 respectively fig s2 the rs was 672 0 and 114 5 w m 2 closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs respectively which was reduced by 30 2 and 88 1 respectively compared to the rs potentially incident outside ckl fig 3c photosynthetic active radiation par encompassing 400 700 nm was 507 8 and 53 5 w m 2 closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs respectively which was reduced by 33 0 and 93 0 respectively the different light transmission rates and roof pv coverage rates caused a non uniform light intensity distribution inside the avs fig 3c the integrated rs decreased following a transversal ckl t1 t2 t3 gradient among the treatments fig 3d the integrated rs in 350 1100 nm in t1 t2 and t3 was reduced by 51 5 67 8 and 75 9 respectively the integrated par in t1 t2 and t3 was decreased by 54 3 70 8 and 78 7 respectively compared to that of ckl the transmissivity of the pv panels varied with the light wavelengths the green light intensity rs encompassing 500 570 nm was 111 8 w m 2 and 2 5 w m 2 at the positions closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs fig 3e which was reduced by 29 6 and 98 4 respectively compared to that of ckl 158 7 w m 2 the red and orange light intensity rs encompassing 600 780 nm was 222 7 w m 2 and 57 7 w m 2 at the positions closing to the pc and pv panel inside the avs fig 3e which was decreased by 26 8 and 81 0 respectively compared to that of ckl 304 4 w m 2 the integrated green light intensity in t1 t2 and t3 was decreased by 51 8 72 9 and 81 2 respectively relative to the ckl similarly the integrated red and orange light intensity in t1 t2 and t3 was reduced by 47 7 62 8 and 71 3 respectively compared to that of ckl fig 3 f however the ratio of red and orange light intensity to green light intensity increased with the increase of pv coverage ratio on the roof with values of 2 2 2 6 and 2 9 in t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 3 f the increased ratio proved that more green lights were absorbed by pvs 3 2 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on the growth rhythm of kiwifruit the estimated relative chlorophyll content increased gradually with the leaf expansion and tended to be stable until the leaves matured fig 4 but the values in different shading treatments was not significantly affected lai in different treatments increased gradually and then decreased due to leaf senescence fig 5a the significantly increased lai was found with the increase of shading severity especially after may p 0 05 fig 5a the number of leaves diameter 1 cm decreased with the increase of shading on three shambling dates only the shambling date on 2018 7 11 was depicted in fig 5 fig 5c f however the average leaf diameter increased with the increase of shade compared to that of ckl and the 95th quantile and 90th quantile leaf diameter in shading treatments were also larger than that of ckl fig 5b 3 3 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on leaf water light use efficiency the typical diurnal variation of leaf tr and pn in different shading treatments was illustrated in fig 6 tr in different shading treatments varied with the par and showed consistency with the variation of par fig 6a b pn generally increased with the increase of par but the variations were diverse compared to that of tr fig 6b c tr and pn were generally decreased with the increased shading severity fig 6b c however in the typical day with high par in 2019 8 12 both tr and pn in t1 were higher than that of ckl fig 6 c3 the typical diurnal variation and averaged leaf wuei and lue under different shading treatments were illustrated in fig 7 the wuei and lue in different treatments generally decreased at first and then increased fig 7a the averaged wuei generally decreased significantly with increasing shading fig 7b while wuei in ckl 1 73 0 16 µmol mmol 1 was sometimes lower than that of t1 1 83 0 15 µmol mmol 1 fig 7b the diurnal leaf lue increased with the reduction of par in different shading treatments fig 7c therefore lue generally significantly increased with increasing shading fig 7d the seasonal variations of tree t in the four treatments were portrayed in fig 8 the t of different treatments increased gradually and then decreased due to leaf senescence during the two growing seasons fig 8a b the accumulated t in ckl t1 t2 and t3 was 420 0 354 0 304 1 and 295 9 mm in 2019 growing season and 439 6 407 5 334 3 and 321 7 mm in 2020 growing season respectively fig 8e f the accumulated e in ckl t1 t2 and t3 was 80 5 62 5 55 0 and 51 2 mm in 2019 growing season 78 2 64 4 48 8 and 43 7 mm in 2020 growing season respectively fig 8g h the accumulated growing season etc act was highest in ckl reaching 500 4 mm in 2019 and 517 9 mm in 2020 respectively table 2 etc act in t1 t2 and t3 was respectively reduced by 16 8 28 3 and 30 6 in 2019 growing season 7 5 26 0 and 29 4 in 2020 growing season 3 4 the effects of different pv coverage ratios on single kiwifruit volume and total yield kiwifruit growth and physiological activities were affected by the decrease of solar radiation consequently significant differences were observed in fruit development among the treatments fig 9 in 2018 the average kiwifruit volume was largest in t1 with the value of 107 02 9 75 cm3 followed by ckl t2 and t3 with the values of 101 4 3 70 cm3 96 18 9 02 cm3 and 86 73 7 63 cm3 respectively fig 9a however in 2019 and 2020 the highest volume was observed in ckl fig 9b c the kiwifruit volume in t3 showed a significant reduction compared to that in ckl p 0 05 the volumes in t1 t2 and t3 were reduced by 7 3 9 6 and 16 0 respectively compared to ckl 106 78 7 99 cm3 in 2019 and 3 9 8 8 and 28 5 respectively compared with ckl 103 30 3 41 cm3 in 2020 growing season the agr of different treatments showed a consistent trend and they firstly increased until achieving the maximum value of about 2 0 cm 3 d 1 and then decreased quickly but stabilized after july fig 9d f the agr followed an order of ckl t1 t2 t3 which caused the same rank for the fruit volume the effects of different pv cover ratios on kiwifruit yield were illustrated in fig 10 in 2018 the yields in t1 t2 and t3 were reduced by 2 6 20 4 and 39 4 respectively compared to ckl 17 91 1 42 t ha 1 the yields in t1 t2 and t3 were reduced by 6 5 25 0 and 26 8 respectively in 2019 and 5 1 27 7 and 37 1 respectively compared to ckl in 2020 growing season the yield was similar between the ckl and t1 while was significantly different in t2 and t3 p 0 05 the wpc in ckl was 5 39 0 72 g kg 1 in 2019 and 5 83 0 52 g kg 1 in 2020 growing season the wpc in t1 and t2 was improved 4 2 12 3 and 4 5 7 2 but the wpc in t3 was significantly reduced 8 9 10 8 compared to that of ckl in the two growing seasons fig 10 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 effect of pv shading on microclimate conditions in avs although significant differences in ta might be expected between the shading and control treatments as the shading of the pv panels contributed to reducing the temperature difference between the external and the internal environment in avs cossu et al 2017 hassanien et al 2018 the comparison of ta at different shading treatments and ckl in the present study did not show significant differences air masses heat exchange in the avs is in equilibrium with the external environment due to the open design therefore such design was given the low variability monitored between shading treatments which is different from the closed pv greenhouse system marrou et al 2013b differently a significant difference was observed among the treatments in terms of rh especially after the leaf expansion stage may and rh in t3 was 6 5 higher than ckl treatment the canopy development and structure of avs probably affected boundary layer resistance which could hinder the diffusion of canopy water vapor due to windbreak effects ahemd et al 2016 hassanien et al 2018 it has to be admitted that the experimental area in this study 360 m2 was relatively small compared to the avs prototype used for actual crop production several hectares while designing such replications would have involved a huge land area occupation and costly investment further experiments should be conducted to explore the impact of pv coverage on water heat exchange characteristics over the bigger size avs 4 2 the performance of kiwifruit leaf morphology under pv shading the estimated leaf chlorophyll content was not significantly affected by shading treatments indicating that shading may not change the kiwifruit leaf nitrogen concentration dai et al 2009 hassanien et al 2018 consistently a former study also proved that shading only weakly affected leaf nitrogen contents in trees niinemets et al 2015 in addition some other studies found that shading considerably altered nitrogen reallocation within a leaf dong et al 2015 niinemets et al 2015 sessa and givnish 2014 and an increase in nitrogen allocation into water soluble proteins can improve photosynthetic capacity in conifer cunninghamia lanceolata dong et al 2015 nevertheless there is still limited information on how nitrogen reallocation changes within kiwifruit leaves under pv shading compared to ckl kiwifruit laic in the shading treatments increased which was consistent with previous studies valle et al 2017 marrou et al 2013c besides it seemed that the enhanced canopy vegetative growth was caused by the increased leaf size fig 5 this favored light interception by the plant leaves that were partially shaded by pv panels thereby compensating for the deficit in transmitted light in avs in agreement with this previous studies have also proved that plants can adapt to shading conditions by enhancing radiation interception efficiency for compensating the light shortage in avs cossu et al 2020 valle et al 2017 thus kiwifruit trees can modify the leaf morphology and physiological process to adapt to the shaded environment 4 3 leaf photosynthesis and water use of kiwifruit under pv shading this study showed that tr and pn were reduced with the increasing shading in kiwifruit leaves in particular the pn in t3 was considerably lower than that in ckl the pn and tr were closely related to the available par excessive shading decreased solar radiation intercepted by the canopy affecting photosynthetic electron transport and key enzyme activity and consequently resulted in insufficient photosynthetic product synthesis and supply capacity in leaves dong et al 2015 in the current study decreases in wuei were mainly due to the significant reductions in pn rather than tr as pn was more restricted than tr activity due to stomal adjustment adapting to the shading conditions resulting in significantly lower wuei than those in ckl dong et al 2015 g montanaro et al 2009 li et al 2013 the increase in leaf lue under shading was observed in this study implying that kiwifruit leaves had a certain ability to acclimate shading conditions bloor 2003 adriano sofo et al 2009 found that shading leaves increased the distribution ratio of electron transport quantum in the psii reaction center and reduced the quantum ratio for heat dissipation thereby enhancing the lue of the shading leaves in addition the stronger solar radiation in ckl might have photoinhibition the photosynthesis of kiwifruit leaves was light saturated at approx 960 μmol photon m 2 s 1 fig s3 the higher radiation intensity could inactivate key enzymes or induce the photodamage risk simultaneously restrict the transpiration rate due to stomatal closure figs 7 c3 which could finally result in the decrease of pn and wuei yano and cossu 2019 therefore pv shading is a potential benefit to protect crops from excessive radiation in strong radiation regions ahemd et al 2016 marrou et al 2013a the reduced etc act requirements were found in the avs compared to the ckl due to reduced solar radiation aroca delgado et al 2019 ahemd et al 2016 consequently a reduction in reduced irrigation requirements can be expected cossu et al 2014 it could be verified that the e and t in shading treatments decreased as the intensity of the radiation decreased following a transversal t1 t3 gradient among the treatments besides it was found that the cumulative t in t2 was slightly higher than that of t3 it seems that shading enhanced canopy vegetative growth which compensated the reduced tr at the leaf level leading to higher transpiration even under shaded conditions köhler et al 2013 similar findings for accelerated vegetative growth of cacao under shade was previously reported isaac et al 2007 and higher transpiration per individual tree under shade due to enhanced vegetative growth was also observed in coffee van kanten and vaast 2006 and cacao trees cossu et al 2020 4 4 the performance of kiwifruit volume and yield under pv shading the average kiwifruit volume significantly decreased with the increasing shading in avs the reduced yield was remarkable under the avs compared to the ckl treatment the negative effects of shading on crop yield were previously reported on tomato under 50 pv panels coverage cossu et al 2014 and welsh onion under 13 pv coverage kadowaki et al 2012 the reduction in photosynthesis due to the constraints in par could result in a significant decrease in yield cockshull et al 1992 dai et al 2009 heuvelink 1995 however a maintained or even improved yield of lettuce marrou et al 2013c valle et al 2017 urena sanchez et al 2012 and pepper plants were found despite shading zisis et al 2019 plants adapt species specific physiological responses to shading and react by optimizing their photosynthetic rate or by modifying leaf development to harvest light more efficiently avoiding the severe sunlight deficit therefore the improved lettuce and pepper growth in their studies may be caused by improved radiation interception efficiency due to increased vegetative growth ahemd et al 2016 zisis et al 2019 kiwifruit adapted to shade by increasing its vegetative growth on the leaves while the improved intercepted light by enhanced leaves cover seemed could hardly compensate for the light shortage caused by the pv shade resulting in lower yield allardyce et al 2017 indicated that the accessible yield production not only depended on the total biomass resources produced by photosynthesis but also how they were distributed through the plant allardyce et al 2017 for instance tomato plants initiate shade avoidance strategies by rapid growth aiming to push leaves above the canopy and in this situation organic matter produced by photosynthesis are allocated into the stem and leaf growth rather than fruit yield marrou et al 2013c zisis et al 2019 such distribution of assimilates may benefit for leafy vegetable production i e lettuce but result in a reduction of fruit yields 4 5 application and limitation the advantage of avs is to combine the electricity produced and crop production although the yields may be reduced by the shading the economic income from the pv power may compensate for such losses besides the pv array maybe more useful for dry rainfed and no electricity remote areas where they can benefit to secure electricity access in rural areas far from commercial power lines using electricity locally produced and reducing the dependence of agricultural productions on fossil fuel in fact potential crop yields may increase because avs can provide continuous power for drip irrigation systems which can increase crop yields and save a great amount of irrigation water importantly the environmental benefits of using pv panels are considerable due to the reduction of co2 emission from burning fossil fuels hassanien et al 2018 the electricity generated from pv panels can also be injected into energy production of grid connected systems or consumed for light and greenhouse environment control for greenhouse crops the balance between electricity and food production has previously led to estimations of an optimal 30 maximum coverage of the roof kadowaki et al 2012 marrou et al 2013c currently an acceptable compromise between horticultural crop production and electricity generation is usually achieved when pv coverage is around or lower than 20 with slight yield losses and negligible influence on fruit quality aroca delgado et al 2019 urena sanchez et al 2012 the results in the present study indicated that suitable shading t1 may not cause a significant reduction in kiwifruit yield or adverse effects on kiwifruit growth nonetheless the excessive shading significantly reduced kiwifruit yield and wpc due to canopy vegetative growth therefore it is recommended that the avs can be designed with 19 coverage for kiwifruit production in southwest china with the advantage of improved wpc slight yield loss and compensation from electricity income these structures may increase the pay back time of the investment but they already represent a good compromise between electricity production and crop cultivation it has to be mentioned that there were no rows between the neighboring treatments as a buffer in the current field experiment which may arise the intervention between the neighboring treatments especially during the early morning and late afternoon period see fig s4 however in the present study the crown of the trees was 4 0 m 3 5 m and there was about a 1 5 m gap between the neighboring treatments thus there should be no interactive influence between the different treatments during the most time of the day and therefore the overlapped influences could be ignored in this study besides the irrigation frequency and amount of water were the same for all the treatments ckl t1 t2 and t3 and this could result in different swc due to different water requirements between the treatments it is difficult to keep the same swc in different shading treatments in a field experiment since the trees were free of water deficit the difference between the treatments were mainly attributed to the pv shading levels 5 conclusion the shading treatments t1 t2 and t3 with translucent thin film pv panels under avs resulted in a significant reduction of solar radiation compared to ckl no significant difference was monitored for ta among the treatments whereas significantly increased rh was observed with increasing shading expanding kiwifruit leaf area was a species specific response to shading for intercepting more light though estimated leaf chlorophyll content did not show a significant difference among the treatments p 0 05 leaf tr pn and wuei generally decreased while lue increased with increasing shading besides suitable shading may benefit the leaf physiological process for avoiding excessive radiation shading reduced tree t soil e and total etc act demonstrating a reduced irrigation requirement in the avs the kiwifruit volume and yield were slightly reduced in t1 relative to ckl while the negative effects of shading were significant p 0 05 in t2 and t3 the shading t1 at 19 0 improved wpc by reducing etc act and decreased yield slightly compared to ckl p 0 05 thus t1 represented a good compromise between fruit production and pv coverage and the avs can be designed with 19

9471,sufficient freshwater is needed for water dependent sectors such as agriculture nature drinking water and industry however even in low lying flood prone countries like the netherlands climate change weather extremes economic growth urbanization land subsidence and increased food production will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors furthermore the frequency and amplitude of extremely dry and wet weather conditions is expected to increase the current dutch water management system is not designed to anticipate these extremes over the last decades drained dutch agricultural fields land consolidation and urbanization resulted in declining groundwater tables additionally the fresh water demand of different sectors agriculture industry drinking water increased causing an increased pressure on the regional groundwater system as a consequence the annual groundwater table in sandy soil areas dropped over time with the effect that nowadays fresh water is becoming scarce in dry periods in this paper we provide insight in the shifting water management strategy in the netherlands 1950 2020 with the corresponding drainage systems developing from conventional drainage approx 1950 1990 to controlled drainage 1990 s onwards climate adaptive drainage 2010 onwards and subirrigation systems 2018 onwards furthermore we provide insight in the effect of subirrigation on groundwater levels and crop yields based on both international literature and measurements of dutch field pilots although subirrigation can contribute to improved soil moisture conditions for crop growth on field scale we show that the water volume needed for subirrigation can be large and could put a significant pressure on the available regional water sources therefore efficient and responsible use of the available external water sources for subirrigation e g surface water treated waste water or groundwater is required finally the implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation asks for correct implementation in the regional balance it requires an integral catchment wide approach keywords drainage sub irrigation drought mitigation water retention water logging drainage water management 1 introduction the netherlands is a low lying flood prone country located in a delta in western europe 50º 54º n and 3º 7º e fig 1 i sufficient freshwater is needed for the water dependent sectors as agriculture nature drinking water and industry these sectors account for 193 billion euros 16 of the dutch economy ministerie van and ministerie van 2016 however climate change weather extremes economic growth urbanization land subsidence and increased food production among other things will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors due to climate change the range of weather extremes from extremely dry to extremely wet is expected to increase and to occur more frequently klein tank et al 2014 philip et al 2020 van oldenborgh et al 2009 the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands fig 1 i are particularly drought sensitive as these are rain fed and water supply from rivers is limited deltaprogramma 2014 however june 2016 was extremely wet in parts of the pleistocene uplands with flooding as a result the years 2018 2019 and 2020 were extremely dry in these regions van den eertwegh et al 2021 fig 1 ii however the water management system is not designed to anticipate both weather extremes the challenge is therefore to design a resilient soil water system to be able to anticipate both extremely wet and dry periods in the netherlands most agricultural fields have been drained to quickly get rid of excess water ritzema and stuyt 2015 lower groundwater tables and an increase in crop production were the results over the past decades however excessive drainage contributed to desiccation additionally groundwater is used for drinking water production and industrial applications resulting in declining groundwater tables these activities affect nature areas by drought stress less upward seepage water and brooks and fens that become dry hoogland et al 2010 the combination of the increasing food production a reduction of the available amount of fresh water and an increase in the fresh water demand will lead to more fresh water scarcity and necessity for more efficient use of fresh water resources witte et al 2019 these future challenges ask for a good understanding of historic developments and future needs in the use of drainage systems within the regional water management subsurface drainage is essential to make the areas suitable for agriculture because of the otherwise too shallow groundwater table from 1000 a d onwards several drainage systems have been applied in the netherlands haartsen et al 2010 hoeksema 2007 hooghoudt 1952 ritzema and stuyt 2015 ritzema and van loon steensma 2018 van baars 2005 after the second world war the dutch population grew and more food production was needed agricultural fields were intensively drained to lower the groundwater table fig 2 furthermore land consolidation van den noort 1987 vitikainen 2004 and urbanization impacted the water levels witte et al 2019 fig 2 nowadays drainage systems still quickly discharge fresh water out of regions additionally the water demand for irrigation agriculture drinking water production and industry increased resulting in increased groundwater abstractions as a consequence of this intensified drainage urbanization and increased groundwater abstractions the yearly average groundwater table in the sandy pleistocene uplands fig 1 i dropped by 33 cm over the last century knotters and jansen 2005 this desiccation fig 2 negatively affects biodiversity hoogland et al 2010 witte et al 2019 besides measures to anticipate flooding and waterlogging measures for water retention are needed to be able to anticipate weather extremes to lower the anthropogenic pressure on the groundwater system and to guarantee the water availability for different sectors in dry periods drainage systems can contribute to this besides discharging water they have the potential to retain and recharge water in the soil water system as well in the latter case drainage systems are used for subirrigation these systems are typically relevant for areas with relatively shallow 1 3 m ss phreatic groundwater levels like the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands because of the highest urgency regarding declining groundwater levels and increased irrigation water demand the objective of this article is to provide insight into the development of drainage systems including the corresponding drainage strategies and the consequences for the groundwater and surface water system fig 2 this article includes the functionality of different drainage systems in agriculture and the effect of drainage subirrigation systems on the groundwater table and water balance components based on both international literature and field experiments in the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands we describe drainage subirrigation systems applied in the netherlands over the last decades including their effect on the field water balance additionally we discuss the challenges for future implementation of drainage subirrigation systems in the regional water system balancing between discharge retention and recharge 2 drainage systems 2 1 strategy drainage systems in the netherlands from the second world war onwards the dutch strategy was to increase drainage capacity and quickly discharge water surplus fig 2 later on drainage systems were adapted to also be able to conserve water during periods when drainage was not needed the water management approach shifted in 2008 to a three step approach with decreasing priority 1 retain excess of water in the field 2 store water in the regional drainage system and finally 3 discharge water to the river deltacommissie 2008 ritzema and stuyt 2015 this approach anticipates hydrological events a decrease in peak discharges during heavy rainfall to prevent flooding and an increase in water storage for use in dry periods ritzema and van loon steensma 2018 such adaptive water management is necessary to create enough storage capacity before heavy rainfall occurs the different water strategies resulted in an evolution of drainage systems over the last decades table 1 as further described in the next paragraph 2 2 subsurface drainage systems in the netherlands 2 2 1 no drainage the term drainage is internationally used to describe that the groundwater table is lowered through measures as ditches and drainage pipes stuyt 2013 here we focus on fields with subsurface pipe drainage stuyt 2013 the period with no drainage is mainly the period before the second world war agricultural fields were surrounded by ditches but pipe drainage was not common resulting in bulging groundwater tables between the ditches fig 3 i yield losses occurred in wet years due to waterlogging 2 2 2 conventional drainage conventional drainage consists of single drainage pipes discharging on a ditch fig 3 ii the drainage pipes are installed higher than the maintained ditch level drainage stops if the groundwater level is below the height of the drainage system stuyt 2013 conventional drainage was installed on a large scale after the second world war stuyt 2013 the primary purpose of conventional drainage is to reduce high groundwater tables in winter and early spring for tillage purposes and to prevent water logging during the growing season ritzema et al 2008 2006 lowering the groundwater table results in a flatter groundwater table however conventional drainage may also introduce drought stress in the summer period as less water is available tan et al 2002 nowadays about 34 of the dutch agricultural land contains pipe drainage massop and schuiling 2016 2 2 3 controlled drainage controlled drainage or level controlled drainage stuyt 2013 consists of single drainage pipes connected to the ditch comparable with conventional drainage but with drainage pipes below the maintained ditch level fig 3 iii doing so conventional drainage is modified to control the drainage outflow through controlling the water level in a ditch by a weir the purpose of controlled drainage is to i prevent unnecessary drainage and conserve water in the regional water system during rainfall and ii reduce peak outflows during discharge the ditch level is often controlled for a region by water management authorities this means that effects of controlled drainage can be different for upstream and downstream parcels 2 2 4 composite controlled drainage composite controlled drainage contains a drainage system where the single drains are connected by one collector pipe at the end of the field fig 3 iv 1 the collector pipe is connected with the control pit and the control pit is connected with the adjacent ditch the difference between controlled drainage and composite controlled drainage is that the drainage level by composite controlled drainage is regulated by the control pit via the farmer for one agricultural field instead of by a water management authority for a larger region the control pit contains a fixed weir structure the water level in the control pit is equal to the water pressure in the drainage pipes the system allows to retain water within agricultural parcels and to maintain specific groundwater levels controlled by the farmer 1 discharge water to lower the groundwater level during wet periods drainage outflows can be reduced and controlled drainage occurs if the weir crest in the control pit the water level in the control pit 2 retain and store water in the soil water system to prevent fast decline of the groundwater level during dry periods and raise the groundwater level during periods of rainfall water retention occurs if the weir crest in the control pit the water level in the control pit the dual purpose of this system fluctuates several times during a crop season with a focus on water management at field scale the timing of these functions depends on the geographical characteristics of the area as local rainfall patterns regional surface water management winter and summer water levels maintained by water authorities water supply area or free drainage area soil type and regional groundwater flow composite controlled drainage works effectively in areas that are nearly flat surface slope 1 ayars et al 2006 carstensen et al 2020 massey et al 1983 in field differences in the groundwater table are automatically levelled 2 2 5 climate adaptive drainage climate adaptive drainage cad is a technological advanced example of composite controlled drainage where the weir structure in the control pit can be automatically online controlled van den eertwegh et al 2013 fig 3 iv 2 an important difference between a basic composite controlled drainage and cad is the process of managing the drainage level in the control pit for cad the drainage level can be controlled remotely through the internet and any drainage level between a physical maximum and minimum can be set for basic composite controlled drainage the drainage level can only be controlled manually and only few drainage levels can normally be set by combining the cad system with a cad management algorithm the required drainage level can be set automatically based on weather forecasts and the current hydrological status of the field thus actively controlling the soil moisture conditions in the root zone bartholomeus et al 2015 the cad management algorithm bartholomeus et al 2015 combines field measurements precipitation groundwater table soil moisture content crest level and ditch level the actual weather forecast and the numerical hydrological swap model for the unsaturated zone kroes et al 2017 combined with the optimization algorithm pest doherty 2010 to estimate the optimal crest level the algorithm takes into account preventing oxygen stress according to bartholomeus et al 2008 and preventing unnecessary discharge 2 2 6 composite controlled drainage with subirrigation the current composite controlled drainage systems can be modified to systems for controlled drainage with subirrigation fig 3 v by supplying external water into the control pit this water could flow into the control pit directly or through active pumping the water pressure in the drainage systems raises as consequence of subirrigation if the water pressure in the drainage system is higher than the groundwater level water infiltrates from the drainage pipes into the soil the goal of subirrigation is to raise the groundwater level fig 4 and to increase the soil moisture content in the root zone thus controlled drainage with subirrigation could serve three purposes 1 discharge water 2 retain water 3 recharge water an external source of water should be available for subirrigation this can be surface water water from ponds recycled drainage water groundwater or treated industrial or domestic waste water allred et al 2003 ayars et al 2006 bartholomeus et al 2018a 2017 2018b de wit et al 2021a drury et al 1996 hay et al 2021 narain ford et al 2020 2021 ng et al 2002 smith et al 1985 tan et al 2002 composite controlled drainage with subirrigation is applied in various field experiments in the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands bartholomeus et al 2018a 2017 2016 2018b de wit et al 2021b fig 4 shows the measured and modeled groundwater table of two dutch field experiments lieshout and america de wit et al 2021a the groundwater table raises directly once water is pumped into the drainage system grey blocks in fig 4 as a result the groundwater table fluctuates 70 80 cm below soil surface at the start of the crop season fig 4 the groundwater table is 100 cm higher with external water supply than without water supply in the mid crop season fig 4 however fig 4 also shows that the water supply is not enough to maintain the groundwater level in extremely dry seasons 2018 and 2019 the average water supply was 400 mm year in lieshout using treated industrial waste water and 900 mm year in america using groundwater in the growing season 160 190 days de wit et al 2021a that is a high amount compared to the average yearly precipitation surplus in the netherlands of about 250 mm y fig 1 ii additionally the amount is considerably higher than the average precipitation deficit in the summer period of about 50 100 mm y philip et al 2020 so although subirrigation could alleviate drought stress at agricultural fields it could also provide a significant pressure on available water sources therefore it is important to recognize that the use of a specific water supply source for subirrigation will propagate through the regional water system and will affect different components of the regional water balance subirrigation using surface water for example can be critical in areas without supplemental water as ditches can become dry in drought periods additionally especially when using treated wastewater or surface water as supply source water quality issues are important beard et al 2019 dingemans et al 2018 narain ford et al 2020 2021 all in all responsible use of available water resources for subirrigation is a key issue 3 effects of drainage systems on the water balance drainage systems directly affect the ground water system and all components of the water balance at field scale fig 5 besides in countries like the netherlands drainage systems are commonly applied in the usa doty and parsons 1979 skaggs et al 2012 in arid regions with irrigated agriculture like egypt and pakistan abdel dayem and ritzema 1990 ritzema 2007 in australia christen et al 2001 and in india ritzema et al 2008 tables 2 and 3 provide an overview of field experiments on conventional drainage vs controlled drainage and controlled drainage vs subirrigation respectively providing quantitative information on the effect of the different drainage systems on water retention and water supply 3 1 controlled drainage vs conventional drainage the main difference in strategy between controlled drainage and conventional drainage is retention of water fig 3 table 2 to reduce discharge and keep the groundwater level and soil moisture availability at a sufficient level for crop growth this process affects different water balance components pipe drainage decreases compared to conventional drainage because the ditch water level could be controlled bonaiti and borin 2010 drury et al 1996 hornbuckle et al 2005 the decrease of pipe drainage follows partly due to an increased soil water storage capacity through the controlled drainage riley et al 2009 showed a decreased pipe drainage of 14 in a lysimeter experiment skaggs et al 2010 reported in different controlled drainage field experiments in the usa a decrease in pipe drainage of 16 29 in clay soils and 17 85 in sandy loam jeong et al 2018 reported a decrease of 51 in silty clay soils wesström and messing 2007 observed a decrease of 5 35 in sandy loam rozemeijer et al 2016 published data for the netherlands with drainage values november april in a reference period of 303 mm for conventional drainage compared to 163 mm 2009 2010 and 127 mm 2010 2011 for controlled drainage controlled drainage thus leads to an increase in water retention table 2 i e water that would have been discharged to the surface water when using conventional drainage remains in the groundwater system with controlled drainage skaggs et al 2010 actual evapotranspiration et act increases through improving drainage conditions and improved soil moisture conditions abdel dayem and ritzema 1990 and herewith less drought stress in summertime this leads to increased crop yields table 2 the reviewed field studies in skaggs et al 2010 showed a maximum et act increase of 10 for corn with controlled drainage compared to conventional drainage evans and skaggs 1985 reported an increase of 2 5 for corn yield in the usa doty et al 1975 found a general rule that the silage yield of corn could increase by 0 5 t ha for each day that the water table was maintained at less than 100 cm below soil surface in a sandy coastal plains soil usa however grigg et al 2004 reported a decrease of 3 in corn yield with controlled drainage in the usa table 2 because of a too shallow water table for the roots early in the growing season this shows that proper management of controlled drainage systems is required in order to increase water availability to prevent drought stress while preventing oxygen stress too bartholomeus et al 2008 hack ten broeke et al 2016 surface runoff could either increase or decrease depending on the hydrological boundary conditions soil physical properties and rain intensities an increase is modeled by singh et al 2007 and skaggs et al 2010 and observed in a lysimeter experiment riley et al 2009 and field experiment drury et al 1996 grigg et al 2004 wesström et al 2014 reported a decrease in runoff through controlled drainage compared to conventional drainage from 254 to 319 mm to 151 187 mm per year 1 july 30 june downward seepage groundwater recharge increases as result of controlled drainage singh et al 2007 however downward seepage is a difficult water balance term to measure skaggs et al 2010 stated therefore that the downward seepage rate with controlled drainage will be approximately equal to the natural drainage rate that occurred before installing the controlled drainage system this will be the case if et act with controlled drainage is equal to et act of the original situation controlled drainage thus leads to an increase in water retention this water is available for crops recharges the groundwater or slowly discharges to the surface water through the subsoil it should be noted however that significant water retention with controlled drainage could only be achieved if shallow drainage levels are maintained already in spring furthermore once water has been discharged in early spring significant water retention can only be realized as significant rainfall occurs too all in all the development of difference drainage systems affected the water balance terms over time table 2 no drainage et act is limited as consequence of too wet conditions because of the wet conditions surface runoff and ditch drainage are high conventional drainage compared to no drainage discharge through pipe drainage increases groundwater recharge and runoff decrease et act increases as result of less oxygen stress and earlier opportunities for tillage however excessive drainage and herewith too low groundwater levels in summertime may result in drought stress and reduced et act controlled drainage compared to conventional drainage pipe drainage decreases and downward seepage increases table 2 surface runoff may either increase or decrease et act mainly increased but can decrease with poor water level control i e creating too wet conditions 3 2 composite controlled drainage with subirrigation vs composite controlled drainage the main difference in strategy between composite controlled drainage and subirrigation is active recharge of water fig 3 table 2 to raise the groundwater level and increase soil moisture availability for crops water balance components are strongly affected by subirrigation pipe infiltration increases through subirrigation which is by definition the main difference between composite controlled drainage and composite controlled drainage with subirrigation water is actively added to the system the infiltration amount found in international literature varies between 170 and 410 mm but the water supply periods differ as well table 3 when the water supply data from table 3 are transposed to a standard growing season of 180 days cumulative infiltration ranges between approximately 250 1500 mm 180days ranges are high due to differences in required raise of groundwater level length of the growing season and water losses through lateral ditch drainage and downward seepage smith et al 1985 the groundwater table is typically raised by approximately 30 40 cm table 3 the main water supply source used for subirrigation is surface water table 3 et act increases through subirrigation but it is strongly related to the effects in groundwater table due to a shallower groundwater table an upward flux is expected from the water table through the unsaturated zone to the root zone however the rate of upward flux decreases rapidly when the distance between the water table and the rootzone increases smith et al 1985 for example the upward flux could be 6 mm d at a water table depth of 70 cm below the rootzone but decreases to 2 mm d at water table of 90 cm below the rootzone for a sandy loam soil smith et al 1985 however this flux strongly varies between soil types table 2 increased yields have been found ranging from 6 6 mejia et al 2000 to 64 for corn in the usa ng et al 2002 assuming a linear relationship between relative yield and relative transpiration de wit 1958 transpiration will show a similar increase downward seepage increases through subirrigation massey et al 1983 smith et al 1985 downward seepage values are strongly site dependent as recharge depends on the soil hydraulic conductivity the natural water table depth and the water level in adjacent ditches or canals massey et al 1983 smith et al 1985 in general higher ditch levels result in less lateral drainage to ditches and more downward seepage hooghoudt 1952 the exact annual effects of subirrigation on water balance components depend on the required increase in groundwater level soil properties site conditions ditch water level crop characteristics and drain criteria singh et al 2007 skaggs et al 2010 2012 the maintained drainage and ditch level have been identified as most important factors for the results on the increased groundwater table and water balance components hooghoudt 1952 jouni et al 2018 mejia et al 2000 most advantages with subirrigation are reached in drier summers rather than in wet summers mejia et al 2000 given the large amounts of water recharged through subirrigation systems the order of magnitude of different water balance components will be mostly in the range of hundreds of mm on a yearly basis all in all the development of subirrigation caused differences in water balance terms compared to only composite controlled drainage table 3 composite controlled drainage the water balance components are similar to controlled drainage composite controlled drainage with subirrigation the modified composite controlled drainage aims to recharge water as well during periods of drainage discharge the water balance components will be similar to composite controlled drainage in subirrigation periods the components pipe infiltration downward seepage groundwater recharge and et act increase compared to composite controlled drainage table 3 the differences in water balance terms caused by development of drainage systems are summarized in table 4 4 local and regional implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation changes in drainage systems were mainly triggered by land use changes as consequence of social and economic changes as clearly showed in literature resulting in declining groundwater tables fig 6 although the water management is now in a process towards a more adaptive approach van der brugge et al 2005 a resilient soil water system is needed to anticipate the expected future weather extremes fig 2 tables 2 and 3 show that controlled drainage systems can contribute to water retention when compared to conventional drainage systems but also that subirrigation could be applied to actively recharge the groundwater doing so crop water availability could be managed in a more adaptive manner however literature also shows that only part of the water used for subirrigation is used for root water uptake and part of the applied water feeds the groundwater system increased downward seepage furthermore the total amount of water used for subirrigation can be large which could put a significant claim on the available water sources therefore subirrigation systems should be implemented in such a way that they fit within the regional management local and regional scale components affect the desired effects of controlled drainage systems with subirrigation fig 7 requirements for such a system on local field scale are the technical design of the drainage system in relation to environmental characteristics local characteristics directly affect the water table and thus the growing conditions of crops depth and spacing of drain pipes varies throughout the reported field experiments tables 2 and 3 drain spacing is often a function of drainage criteria ayars et al 2006 ritzema et al 2008 skaggs et al 2012 two reasons for a narrower drain spacing are a faster water removal in drainage mode and a more uniform water distribution in the soil in subirrigation mode allred et al 2003 the required pump capacity depends on the required water supply frequency and capacity and the determined drainage level more efficient water use can be obtained through non continuous pumping or to store and infiltrate drainage water in the winter period for the growing season massey et al 1983 the intended drainage level can be constant e g 0 7 m ss or can be varied according to the crop stage and thus root development jeong et al 2018 or the groundwater table giardini et al 1995 proper management is necessary to avoid too shallow water tables in the early growing season that negatively impacts the root proliferation or might result in oxygen stress and thereby limit crop growth grigg et al 2004 the pumping strategy could be optimized to reach the intended drainage level while minimizing the water supply smith et al 1985 soil characteristics are not changeable but effects of controlled drainage with subirrigation differ with soil characteristics doty and parsons 1979 fox et al 1956 and yu et al 2020 reported that a soil layer with limited permeability at a shallow depth is needed with subirrigation to avoid extreme downward seepage losses finally ditch levels surrounded by the field are important as a shallow groundwater table with low ditch levels results in lateral drainage an unfavorable effect giardini et al 1995 adjusting surface water levels in adjacent canals streams is recommended to minimize lateral drainage of infiltrated water the implementation of a controlled drainage system with subirrigation should thus include the soil crop hydrological and meteorological characteristics of a site ayars and evans 2015 skaggs 1981 1987 applied sources of water supply are collected rain water drury et al 1996 surface water tan et al 1999 and collected drain water allred et al 2003 besides these relatively common water sources use of alternative water sources like treated wastewater is being explored narain ford et al 2021 first of all the water source must be of a sufficient quality to use it for subirrigation however given the significant changes of water balance components due to subirrigation see previous section also in terms of water quantity the propagation of the water use for subirrigation throughout the whole water system should be quantified hardly any literature is available about the application of different water sources for subirrigation and the impact of the used water source on the regional water system however in many countries there are competing claims on water sources the water demand not only comes from the agriculture sector but also from the industry drinking water and nature zikos and hagedorn 2017 when subirrigation is applied on regional scale the implementation requires knowledge of the entire regional water cycle including the anthropogenic water demand of different sectors that are already putting claims on the same water sources fig 8 pronk et al 2021 besides that efficient use of water sources is required to sustain the regional groundwater table xue et al 2017 in this context controlled drainage with subirrigation is a special method as water is used for increased evapotranspiration and crop yields while limiting ground water abstractions for sprinkler irrigation but also to replenish groundwater table 4 doing so subirrigation has the potential to keep water within the regional groundwater system that would have been discharged otherwise in order to incorporate subirrigation within the regional water balance insights in the regional water availability and the propagation of water use for subirrigation throughout the whole water system needs to be quantified given the large ranges in water needs found in literature it is clear that regional scale water needs for subirrigation systems should be known before they could be incorporated in the regional water management in a responsible manner controlled drainage with subirrigation has been described in literature over the past decades focusing on effects on local scale table 3 it is important to apply this field scale knowledge in the current changing water strategy of water retention and water recharge on regional scale fig 2 correct implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation in the regional water system is an integral catchment wide question with different challenges fig 7 insight is necessary in the water availability for subirrigation of each location both in space and time efficient water supply and minimizing the water supply could be reached through optimized pumping strategy smith et al 1985 water resources other than surface water could be used for water supply like industrial or treated wastewater important conditions are sufficient water quality and limited negative side effects during the propagation through the entire water system pronk et al 2021 5 conclusion this paper gives insight in the development of drainage systems over time in the netherlands occurring parallel to the structurally declining groundwater levels literature showed clearly that changes in drainage systems were mainly triggered by land use changes as consequence of social and economic changes fig 6 however the main dutch water management system is still focused on discharging water ritzema and stuyt 2015 ritzema and van loon steensma 2018 to cope with the imbalance in water demand and water supply and climate change controlled drainage with subirrigation could be a viable measure to i discharge ii retain and iii recharge water this system has the potential to 1 improve growing conditions for crops at field scale 2 reduce peak discharges at regional scale and 3 discharge less water at regional scale and increase groundwater recharge drainage systems affect most water balance components table 4 controlled drainage increases especially et act downward seepage and runoff while pipe drainage decreases the biggest advantage of controlled drainage with subirrigation is to supply water raise the groundwater level and improve the soil moisture conditions for crop growth while still having the option to discharge water when needed another advantage of controlled drainage with subirrigation compared to controlled drainage is that it could contribute to increased water retention and recharge table 4 however it could significantly alter water balance components therefore correct and responsible implementation of subirrigation in the regional system is needed fig 7 which requires knowledge on the effects of controlled drainage with subirrigation throughout the entire water system funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration

9471,sufficient freshwater is needed for water dependent sectors such as agriculture nature drinking water and industry however even in low lying flood prone countries like the netherlands climate change weather extremes economic growth urbanization land subsidence and increased food production will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors furthermore the frequency and amplitude of extremely dry and wet weather conditions is expected to increase the current dutch water management system is not designed to anticipate these extremes over the last decades drained dutch agricultural fields land consolidation and urbanization resulted in declining groundwater tables additionally the fresh water demand of different sectors agriculture industry drinking water increased causing an increased pressure on the regional groundwater system as a consequence the annual groundwater table in sandy soil areas dropped over time with the effect that nowadays fresh water is becoming scarce in dry periods in this paper we provide insight in the shifting water management strategy in the netherlands 1950 2020 with the corresponding drainage systems developing from conventional drainage approx 1950 1990 to controlled drainage 1990 s onwards climate adaptive drainage 2010 onwards and subirrigation systems 2018 onwards furthermore we provide insight in the effect of subirrigation on groundwater levels and crop yields based on both international literature and measurements of dutch field pilots although subirrigation can contribute to improved soil moisture conditions for crop growth on field scale we show that the water volume needed for subirrigation can be large and could put a significant pressure on the available regional water sources therefore efficient and responsible use of the available external water sources for subirrigation e g surface water treated waste water or groundwater is required finally the implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation asks for correct implementation in the regional balance it requires an integral catchment wide approach keywords drainage sub irrigation drought mitigation water retention water logging drainage water management 1 introduction the netherlands is a low lying flood prone country located in a delta in western europe 50º 54º n and 3º 7º e fig 1 i sufficient freshwater is needed for the water dependent sectors as agriculture nature drinking water and industry these sectors account for 193 billion euros 16 of the dutch economy ministerie van and ministerie van 2016 however climate change weather extremes economic growth urbanization land subsidence and increased food production among other things will make it more complex to guarantee sufficient freshwater for all sectors due to climate change the range of weather extremes from extremely dry to extremely wet is expected to increase and to occur more frequently klein tank et al 2014 philip et al 2020 van oldenborgh et al 2009 the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands fig 1 i are particularly drought sensitive as these are rain fed and water supply from rivers is limited deltaprogramma 2014 however june 2016 was extremely wet in parts of the pleistocene uplands with flooding as a result the years 2018 2019 and 2020 were extremely dry in these regions van den eertwegh et al 2021 fig 1 ii however the water management system is not designed to anticipate both weather extremes the challenge is therefore to design a resilient soil water system to be able to anticipate both extremely wet and dry periods in the netherlands most agricultural fields have been drained to quickly get rid of excess water ritzema and stuyt 2015 lower groundwater tables and an increase in crop production were the results over the past decades however excessive drainage contributed to desiccation additionally groundwater is used for drinking water production and industrial applications resulting in declining groundwater tables these activities affect nature areas by drought stress less upward seepage water and brooks and fens that become dry hoogland et al 2010 the combination of the increasing food production a reduction of the available amount of fresh water and an increase in the fresh water demand will lead to more fresh water scarcity and necessity for more efficient use of fresh water resources witte et al 2019 these future challenges ask for a good understanding of historic developments and future needs in the use of drainage systems within the regional water management subsurface drainage is essential to make the areas suitable for agriculture because of the otherwise too shallow groundwater table from 1000 a d onwards several drainage systems have been applied in the netherlands haartsen et al 2010 hoeksema 2007 hooghoudt 1952 ritzema and stuyt 2015 ritzema and van loon steensma 2018 van baars 2005 after the second world war the dutch population grew and more food production was needed agricultural fields were intensively drained to lower the groundwater table fig 2 furthermore land consolidation van den noort 1987 vitikainen 2004 and urbanization impacted the water levels witte et al 2019 fig 2 nowadays drainage systems still quickly discharge fresh water out of regions additionally the water demand for irrigation agriculture drinking water production and industry increased resulting in increased groundwater abstractions as a consequence of this intensified drainage urbanization and increased groundwater abstractions the yearly average groundwater table in the sandy pleistocene uplands fig 1 i dropped by 33 cm over the last century knotters and jansen 2005 this desiccation fig 2 negatively affects biodiversity hoogland et al 2010 witte et al 2019 besides measures to anticipate flooding and waterlogging measures for water retention are needed to be able to anticipate weather extremes to lower the anthropogenic pressure on the groundwater system and to guarantee the water availability for different sectors in dry periods drainage systems can contribute to this besides discharging water they have the potential to retain and recharge water in the soil water system as well in the latter case drainage systems are used for subirrigation these systems are typically relevant for areas with relatively shallow 1 3 m ss phreatic groundwater levels like the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands because of the highest urgency regarding declining groundwater levels and increased irrigation water demand the objective of this article is to provide insight into the development of drainage systems including the corresponding drainage strategies and the consequences for the groundwater and surface water system fig 2 this article includes the functionality of different drainage systems in agriculture and the effect of drainage subirrigation systems on the groundwater table and water balance components based on both international literature and field experiments in the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands we describe drainage subirrigation systems applied in the netherlands over the last decades including their effect on the field water balance additionally we discuss the challenges for future implementation of drainage subirrigation systems in the regional water system balancing between discharge retention and recharge 2 drainage systems 2 1 strategy drainage systems in the netherlands from the second world war onwards the dutch strategy was to increase drainage capacity and quickly discharge water surplus fig 2 later on drainage systems were adapted to also be able to conserve water during periods when drainage was not needed the water management approach shifted in 2008 to a three step approach with decreasing priority 1 retain excess of water in the field 2 store water in the regional drainage system and finally 3 discharge water to the river deltacommissie 2008 ritzema and stuyt 2015 this approach anticipates hydrological events a decrease in peak discharges during heavy rainfall to prevent flooding and an increase in water storage for use in dry periods ritzema and van loon steensma 2018 such adaptive water management is necessary to create enough storage capacity before heavy rainfall occurs the different water strategies resulted in an evolution of drainage systems over the last decades table 1 as further described in the next paragraph 2 2 subsurface drainage systems in the netherlands 2 2 1 no drainage the term drainage is internationally used to describe that the groundwater table is lowered through measures as ditches and drainage pipes stuyt 2013 here we focus on fields with subsurface pipe drainage stuyt 2013 the period with no drainage is mainly the period before the second world war agricultural fields were surrounded by ditches but pipe drainage was not common resulting in bulging groundwater tables between the ditches fig 3 i yield losses occurred in wet years due to waterlogging 2 2 2 conventional drainage conventional drainage consists of single drainage pipes discharging on a ditch fig 3 ii the drainage pipes are installed higher than the maintained ditch level drainage stops if the groundwater level is below the height of the drainage system stuyt 2013 conventional drainage was installed on a large scale after the second world war stuyt 2013 the primary purpose of conventional drainage is to reduce high groundwater tables in winter and early spring for tillage purposes and to prevent water logging during the growing season ritzema et al 2008 2006 lowering the groundwater table results in a flatter groundwater table however conventional drainage may also introduce drought stress in the summer period as less water is available tan et al 2002 nowadays about 34 of the dutch agricultural land contains pipe drainage massop and schuiling 2016 2 2 3 controlled drainage controlled drainage or level controlled drainage stuyt 2013 consists of single drainage pipes connected to the ditch comparable with conventional drainage but with drainage pipes below the maintained ditch level fig 3 iii doing so conventional drainage is modified to control the drainage outflow through controlling the water level in a ditch by a weir the purpose of controlled drainage is to i prevent unnecessary drainage and conserve water in the regional water system during rainfall and ii reduce peak outflows during discharge the ditch level is often controlled for a region by water management authorities this means that effects of controlled drainage can be different for upstream and downstream parcels 2 2 4 composite controlled drainage composite controlled drainage contains a drainage system where the single drains are connected by one collector pipe at the end of the field fig 3 iv 1 the collector pipe is connected with the control pit and the control pit is connected with the adjacent ditch the difference between controlled drainage and composite controlled drainage is that the drainage level by composite controlled drainage is regulated by the control pit via the farmer for one agricultural field instead of by a water management authority for a larger region the control pit contains a fixed weir structure the water level in the control pit is equal to the water pressure in the drainage pipes the system allows to retain water within agricultural parcels and to maintain specific groundwater levels controlled by the farmer 1 discharge water to lower the groundwater level during wet periods drainage outflows can be reduced and controlled drainage occurs if the weir crest in the control pit the water level in the control pit 2 retain and store water in the soil water system to prevent fast decline of the groundwater level during dry periods and raise the groundwater level during periods of rainfall water retention occurs if the weir crest in the control pit the water level in the control pit the dual purpose of this system fluctuates several times during a crop season with a focus on water management at field scale the timing of these functions depends on the geographical characteristics of the area as local rainfall patterns regional surface water management winter and summer water levels maintained by water authorities water supply area or free drainage area soil type and regional groundwater flow composite controlled drainage works effectively in areas that are nearly flat surface slope 1 ayars et al 2006 carstensen et al 2020 massey et al 1983 in field differences in the groundwater table are automatically levelled 2 2 5 climate adaptive drainage climate adaptive drainage cad is a technological advanced example of composite controlled drainage where the weir structure in the control pit can be automatically online controlled van den eertwegh et al 2013 fig 3 iv 2 an important difference between a basic composite controlled drainage and cad is the process of managing the drainage level in the control pit for cad the drainage level can be controlled remotely through the internet and any drainage level between a physical maximum and minimum can be set for basic composite controlled drainage the drainage level can only be controlled manually and only few drainage levels can normally be set by combining the cad system with a cad management algorithm the required drainage level can be set automatically based on weather forecasts and the current hydrological status of the field thus actively controlling the soil moisture conditions in the root zone bartholomeus et al 2015 the cad management algorithm bartholomeus et al 2015 combines field measurements precipitation groundwater table soil moisture content crest level and ditch level the actual weather forecast and the numerical hydrological swap model for the unsaturated zone kroes et al 2017 combined with the optimization algorithm pest doherty 2010 to estimate the optimal crest level the algorithm takes into account preventing oxygen stress according to bartholomeus et al 2008 and preventing unnecessary discharge 2 2 6 composite controlled drainage with subirrigation the current composite controlled drainage systems can be modified to systems for controlled drainage with subirrigation fig 3 v by supplying external water into the control pit this water could flow into the control pit directly or through active pumping the water pressure in the drainage systems raises as consequence of subirrigation if the water pressure in the drainage system is higher than the groundwater level water infiltrates from the drainage pipes into the soil the goal of subirrigation is to raise the groundwater level fig 4 and to increase the soil moisture content in the root zone thus controlled drainage with subirrigation could serve three purposes 1 discharge water 2 retain water 3 recharge water an external source of water should be available for subirrigation this can be surface water water from ponds recycled drainage water groundwater or treated industrial or domestic waste water allred et al 2003 ayars et al 2006 bartholomeus et al 2018a 2017 2018b de wit et al 2021a drury et al 1996 hay et al 2021 narain ford et al 2020 2021 ng et al 2002 smith et al 1985 tan et al 2002 composite controlled drainage with subirrigation is applied in various field experiments in the dutch sandy pleistocene uplands bartholomeus et al 2018a 2017 2016 2018b de wit et al 2021b fig 4 shows the measured and modeled groundwater table of two dutch field experiments lieshout and america de wit et al 2021a the groundwater table raises directly once water is pumped into the drainage system grey blocks in fig 4 as a result the groundwater table fluctuates 70 80 cm below soil surface at the start of the crop season fig 4 the groundwater table is 100 cm higher with external water supply than without water supply in the mid crop season fig 4 however fig 4 also shows that the water supply is not enough to maintain the groundwater level in extremely dry seasons 2018 and 2019 the average water supply was 400 mm year in lieshout using treated industrial waste water and 900 mm year in america using groundwater in the growing season 160 190 days de wit et al 2021a that is a high amount compared to the average yearly precipitation surplus in the netherlands of about 250 mm y fig 1 ii additionally the amount is considerably higher than the average precipitation deficit in the summer period of about 50 100 mm y philip et al 2020 so although subirrigation could alleviate drought stress at agricultural fields it could also provide a significant pressure on available water sources therefore it is important to recognize that the use of a specific water supply source for subirrigation will propagate through the regional water system and will affect different components of the regional water balance subirrigation using surface water for example can be critical in areas without supplemental water as ditches can become dry in drought periods additionally especially when using treated wastewater or surface water as supply source water quality issues are important beard et al 2019 dingemans et al 2018 narain ford et al 2020 2021 all in all responsible use of available water resources for subirrigation is a key issue 3 effects of drainage systems on the water balance drainage systems directly affect the ground water system and all components of the water balance at field scale fig 5 besides in countries like the netherlands drainage systems are commonly applied in the usa doty and parsons 1979 skaggs et al 2012 in arid regions with irrigated agriculture like egypt and pakistan abdel dayem and ritzema 1990 ritzema 2007 in australia christen et al 2001 and in india ritzema et al 2008 tables 2 and 3 provide an overview of field experiments on conventional drainage vs controlled drainage and controlled drainage vs subirrigation respectively providing quantitative information on the effect of the different drainage systems on water retention and water supply 3 1 controlled drainage vs conventional drainage the main difference in strategy between controlled drainage and conventional drainage is retention of water fig 3 table 2 to reduce discharge and keep the groundwater level and soil moisture availability at a sufficient level for crop growth this process affects different water balance components pipe drainage decreases compared to conventional drainage because the ditch water level could be controlled bonaiti and borin 2010 drury et al 1996 hornbuckle et al 2005 the decrease of pipe drainage follows partly due to an increased soil water storage capacity through the controlled drainage riley et al 2009 showed a decreased pipe drainage of 14 in a lysimeter experiment skaggs et al 2010 reported in different controlled drainage field experiments in the usa a decrease in pipe drainage of 16 29 in clay soils and 17 85 in sandy loam jeong et al 2018 reported a decrease of 51 in silty clay soils wesström and messing 2007 observed a decrease of 5 35 in sandy loam rozemeijer et al 2016 published data for the netherlands with drainage values november april in a reference period of 303 mm for conventional drainage compared to 163 mm 2009 2010 and 127 mm 2010 2011 for controlled drainage controlled drainage thus leads to an increase in water retention table 2 i e water that would have been discharged to the surface water when using conventional drainage remains in the groundwater system with controlled drainage skaggs et al 2010 actual evapotranspiration et act increases through improving drainage conditions and improved soil moisture conditions abdel dayem and ritzema 1990 and herewith less drought stress in summertime this leads to increased crop yields table 2 the reviewed field studies in skaggs et al 2010 showed a maximum et act increase of 10 for corn with controlled drainage compared to conventional drainage evans and skaggs 1985 reported an increase of 2 5 for corn yield in the usa doty et al 1975 found a general rule that the silage yield of corn could increase by 0 5 t ha for each day that the water table was maintained at less than 100 cm below soil surface in a sandy coastal plains soil usa however grigg et al 2004 reported a decrease of 3 in corn yield with controlled drainage in the usa table 2 because of a too shallow water table for the roots early in the growing season this shows that proper management of controlled drainage systems is required in order to increase water availability to prevent drought stress while preventing oxygen stress too bartholomeus et al 2008 hack ten broeke et al 2016 surface runoff could either increase or decrease depending on the hydrological boundary conditions soil physical properties and rain intensities an increase is modeled by singh et al 2007 and skaggs et al 2010 and observed in a lysimeter experiment riley et al 2009 and field experiment drury et al 1996 grigg et al 2004 wesström et al 2014 reported a decrease in runoff through controlled drainage compared to conventional drainage from 254 to 319 mm to 151 187 mm per year 1 july 30 june downward seepage groundwater recharge increases as result of controlled drainage singh et al 2007 however downward seepage is a difficult water balance term to measure skaggs et al 2010 stated therefore that the downward seepage rate with controlled drainage will be approximately equal to the natural drainage rate that occurred before installing the controlled drainage system this will be the case if et act with controlled drainage is equal to et act of the original situation controlled drainage thus leads to an increase in water retention this water is available for crops recharges the groundwater or slowly discharges to the surface water through the subsoil it should be noted however that significant water retention with controlled drainage could only be achieved if shallow drainage levels are maintained already in spring furthermore once water has been discharged in early spring significant water retention can only be realized as significant rainfall occurs too all in all the development of difference drainage systems affected the water balance terms over time table 2 no drainage et act is limited as consequence of too wet conditions because of the wet conditions surface runoff and ditch drainage are high conventional drainage compared to no drainage discharge through pipe drainage increases groundwater recharge and runoff decrease et act increases as result of less oxygen stress and earlier opportunities for tillage however excessive drainage and herewith too low groundwater levels in summertime may result in drought stress and reduced et act controlled drainage compared to conventional drainage pipe drainage decreases and downward seepage increases table 2 surface runoff may either increase or decrease et act mainly increased but can decrease with poor water level control i e creating too wet conditions 3 2 composite controlled drainage with subirrigation vs composite controlled drainage the main difference in strategy between composite controlled drainage and subirrigation is active recharge of water fig 3 table 2 to raise the groundwater level and increase soil moisture availability for crops water balance components are strongly affected by subirrigation pipe infiltration increases through subirrigation which is by definition the main difference between composite controlled drainage and composite controlled drainage with subirrigation water is actively added to the system the infiltration amount found in international literature varies between 170 and 410 mm but the water supply periods differ as well table 3 when the water supply data from table 3 are transposed to a standard growing season of 180 days cumulative infiltration ranges between approximately 250 1500 mm 180days ranges are high due to differences in required raise of groundwater level length of the growing season and water losses through lateral ditch drainage and downward seepage smith et al 1985 the groundwater table is typically raised by approximately 30 40 cm table 3 the main water supply source used for subirrigation is surface water table 3 et act increases through subirrigation but it is strongly related to the effects in groundwater table due to a shallower groundwater table an upward flux is expected from the water table through the unsaturated zone to the root zone however the rate of upward flux decreases rapidly when the distance between the water table and the rootzone increases smith et al 1985 for example the upward flux could be 6 mm d at a water table depth of 70 cm below the rootzone but decreases to 2 mm d at water table of 90 cm below the rootzone for a sandy loam soil smith et al 1985 however this flux strongly varies between soil types table 2 increased yields have been found ranging from 6 6 mejia et al 2000 to 64 for corn in the usa ng et al 2002 assuming a linear relationship between relative yield and relative transpiration de wit 1958 transpiration will show a similar increase downward seepage increases through subirrigation massey et al 1983 smith et al 1985 downward seepage values are strongly site dependent as recharge depends on the soil hydraulic conductivity the natural water table depth and the water level in adjacent ditches or canals massey et al 1983 smith et al 1985 in general higher ditch levels result in less lateral drainage to ditches and more downward seepage hooghoudt 1952 the exact annual effects of subirrigation on water balance components depend on the required increase in groundwater level soil properties site conditions ditch water level crop characteristics and drain criteria singh et al 2007 skaggs et al 2010 2012 the maintained drainage and ditch level have been identified as most important factors for the results on the increased groundwater table and water balance components hooghoudt 1952 jouni et al 2018 mejia et al 2000 most advantages with subirrigation are reached in drier summers rather than in wet summers mejia et al 2000 given the large amounts of water recharged through subirrigation systems the order of magnitude of different water balance components will be mostly in the range of hundreds of mm on a yearly basis all in all the development of subirrigation caused differences in water balance terms compared to only composite controlled drainage table 3 composite controlled drainage the water balance components are similar to controlled drainage composite controlled drainage with subirrigation the modified composite controlled drainage aims to recharge water as well during periods of drainage discharge the water balance components will be similar to composite controlled drainage in subirrigation periods the components pipe infiltration downward seepage groundwater recharge and et act increase compared to composite controlled drainage table 3 the differences in water balance terms caused by development of drainage systems are summarized in table 4 4 local and regional implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation changes in drainage systems were mainly triggered by land use changes as consequence of social and economic changes as clearly showed in literature resulting in declining groundwater tables fig 6 although the water management is now in a process towards a more adaptive approach van der brugge et al 2005 a resilient soil water system is needed to anticipate the expected future weather extremes fig 2 tables 2 and 3 show that controlled drainage systems can contribute to water retention when compared to conventional drainage systems but also that subirrigation could be applied to actively recharge the groundwater doing so crop water availability could be managed in a more adaptive manner however literature also shows that only part of the water used for subirrigation is used for root water uptake and part of the applied water feeds the groundwater system increased downward seepage furthermore the total amount of water used for subirrigation can be large which could put a significant claim on the available water sources therefore subirrigation systems should be implemented in such a way that they fit within the regional management local and regional scale components affect the desired effects of controlled drainage systems with subirrigation fig 7 requirements for such a system on local field scale are the technical design of the drainage system in relation to environmental characteristics local characteristics directly affect the water table and thus the growing conditions of crops depth and spacing of drain pipes varies throughout the reported field experiments tables 2 and 3 drain spacing is often a function of drainage criteria ayars et al 2006 ritzema et al 2008 skaggs et al 2012 two reasons for a narrower drain spacing are a faster water removal in drainage mode and a more uniform water distribution in the soil in subirrigation mode allred et al 2003 the required pump capacity depends on the required water supply frequency and capacity and the determined drainage level more efficient water use can be obtained through non continuous pumping or to store and infiltrate drainage water in the winter period for the growing season massey et al 1983 the intended drainage level can be constant e g 0 7 m ss or can be varied according to the crop stage and thus root development jeong et al 2018 or the groundwater table giardini et al 1995 proper management is necessary to avoid too shallow water tables in the early growing season that negatively impacts the root proliferation or might result in oxygen stress and thereby limit crop growth grigg et al 2004 the pumping strategy could be optimized to reach the intended drainage level while minimizing the water supply smith et al 1985 soil characteristics are not changeable but effects of controlled drainage with subirrigation differ with soil characteristics doty and parsons 1979 fox et al 1956 and yu et al 2020 reported that a soil layer with limited permeability at a shallow depth is needed with subirrigation to avoid extreme downward seepage losses finally ditch levels surrounded by the field are important as a shallow groundwater table with low ditch levels results in lateral drainage an unfavorable effect giardini et al 1995 adjusting surface water levels in adjacent canals streams is recommended to minimize lateral drainage of infiltrated water the implementation of a controlled drainage system with subirrigation should thus include the soil crop hydrological and meteorological characteristics of a site ayars and evans 2015 skaggs 1981 1987 applied sources of water supply are collected rain water drury et al 1996 surface water tan et al 1999 and collected drain water allred et al 2003 besides these relatively common water sources use of alternative water sources like treated wastewater is being explored narain ford et al 2021 first of all the water source must be of a sufficient quality to use it for subirrigation however given the significant changes of water balance components due to subirrigation see previous section also in terms of water quantity the propagation of the water use for subirrigation throughout the whole water system should be quantified hardly any literature is available about the application of different water sources for subirrigation and the impact of the used water source on the regional water system however in many countries there are competing claims on water sources the water demand not only comes from the agriculture sector but also from the industry drinking water and nature zikos and hagedorn 2017 when subirrigation is applied on regional scale the implementation requires knowledge of the entire regional water cycle including the anthropogenic water demand of different sectors that are already putting claims on the same water sources fig 8 pronk et al 2021 besides that efficient use of water sources is required to sustain the regional groundwater table xue et al 2017 in this context controlled drainage with subirrigation is a special method as water is used for increased evapotranspiration and crop yields while limiting ground water abstractions for sprinkler irrigation but also to replenish groundwater table 4 doing so subirrigation has the potential to keep water within the regional groundwater system that would have been discharged otherwise in order to incorporate subirrigation within the regional water balance insights in the regional water availability and the propagation of water use for subirrigation throughout the whole water system needs to be quantified given the large ranges in water needs found in literature it is clear that regional scale water needs for subirrigation systems should be known before they could be incorporated in the regional water management in a responsible manner controlled drainage with subirrigation has been described in literature over the past decades focusing on effects on local scale table 3 it is important to apply this field scale knowledge in the current changing water strategy of water retention and water recharge on regional scale fig 2 correct implementation of controlled drainage with subirrigation in the regional water system is an integral catchment wide question with different challenges fig 7 insight is necessary in the water availability for subirrigation of each location both in space and time efficient water supply and minimizing the water supply could be reached through optimized pumping strategy smith et al 1985 water resources other than surface water could be used for water supply like industrial or treated wastewater important conditions are sufficient water quality and limited negative side effects during the propagation through the entire water system pronk et al 2021 5 conclusion this paper gives insight in the development of drainage systems over time in the netherlands occurring parallel to the structurally declining groundwater levels literature showed clearly that changes in drainage systems were mainly triggered by land use changes as consequence of social and economic changes fig 6 however the main dutch water management system is still focused on discharging water ritzema and stuyt 2015 ritzema and van loon steensma 2018 to cope with the imbalance in water demand and water supply and climate change controlled drainage with subirrigation could be a viable measure to i discharge ii retain and iii recharge water this system has the potential to 1 improve growing conditions for crops at field scale 2 reduce peak discharges at regional scale and 3 discharge less water at regional scale and increase groundwater recharge drainage systems affect most water balance components table 4 controlled drainage increases especially et act downward seepage and runoff while pipe drainage decreases the biggest advantage of controlled drainage with subirrigation is to supply water raise the groundwater level and improve the soil moisture conditions for crop growth while still having the option to discharge water when needed another advantage of controlled drainage with subirrigation compared to controlled drainage is that it could contribute to increased water retention and recharge table 4 however it could significantly alter water balance components therefore correct and responsible implementation of subirrigation in the regional system is needed fig 7 which requires knowledge on the effects of controlled drainage with subirrigation throughout the entire water system funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors declaration

9472,plant plant interactions in the intercropping system can significantly affect crop productivity however it is poorly understood how the interactions affect the land equivalent ratios ler in the cereal legumes and cereal cereal intercropping systems in semi arid agroecosystems a two year 2019 2020 field experiment was conducted in the dryland agricultural experimental station of lanzhou university a semiarid rainfed site of northwest china to quantify the impact of crop diversification on land equivalent ratio and its moisture dependent mechanisms in three intercropping systems of maize wheat maize soybean and wheat soybean the soybean involved intercropping systems showed positive interactions which substantially promoted crop productivity of maize and wheat by 18 1 20 9 the soil water in soybean strips can be used by intercropped wheat or maize which in turn promoted soil water storage sws in maize or wheat strips by 0 6 and 11 0 respectively during the co growth period this further improved the photosynthetic rate pn instantaneous growth rate igr and water use efficiency wue for each species and thereafter elevated the land equivalence ratio ler 1 however in the wheat maize intercropping system interspecific competition was dominated with wheat as dominant species and maize as inferior one respectively the competition plundered available water of maize strips sws decreased by 10 5 and thus decreased its pn and wue by 12 7 and 20 0 p 0 05 respectively importantly maize yield and ler were not improved via the compensation effect during the post harvest period of wheat while soil water was to some extent restored the pn and igr of intercropped maize were still lower than those of monoculture maize this trend resulted in maize yield loss during the reproductive period and ultimately lower ler for the first time we found a rarely reported phenomenon i e negative relationships between crop diversity and land equivalent ratios in semiarid agroecosystem since the yield loss caused by competition was not compensated during the co growth period therefore a positive relationship between crop diversification and land equivalent ratio

intercropping system land equivalent ratio positive and negative interactions water use efficiency compensation effect semi arid regions 1 introduction intercropping system has been widely used in the semiarid regions due to high and stable productivity and efficient utilization of resources yin et al 2020 in this aspect the positive relationships between crop diversity and productivity have been reported brooker et al 2015 li et al 2020 the mixture of grass and legume can result in greater biomass and yield relative to monoculture duchene et al 2017 this phenomenon was closely associated with positive plant plant interactions in the cropping systems donald 1963 harper et al 1961 yet the limited resource pool and the overlap of niche would lead to the occurrence of plant competition resulting in poor growth of inferior species aschehoug et al 2016 under the field condition low resource availability frequently leads to positive interaction in the intercropping systems brooker et al 2015 intercrops usually produce more yields per unit area than sole crops as measured by land equivalent ratio ler i e the relative area of land under sole cropping to the intercropping required to produce equal amounts of yield cong et al 2015 li et al 2020a 2020b willey 1979 for a given intercropping system the mechanism of yield improvement is mainly focused on nutrient enrichment resource sharing and niche complementarity nutrient enrichment is generally found in promoting the nodulation of legume crops li et al 2016 improving the activation of insoluble nutrients li et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 sharing resource and enhancing the fixed nitrogen transport from legumes to neighboring plants jensen et al 2020 in this regard niche complementarity is the tendency for coexisting species that occupy a similar position along one niche dimension to differ from the other liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 yu et al 2015 in the intercropping system early sowing or early maturing crop can utilize greater amount of water resources for higher biomass while the late sowing or late maturing one turns to improve biomass via the compensation effect after early crop is harvested li et al 2001 recent meta analysis results indicated that global average ler for intercropping systems was 1 21 1 35 li et al 2020a 2020b martin guay et al 2018 similarly many empirical studies have shown yield advantages in cereal legume and cereal cereal intercropping systems such as maize faba bean maize soybean and wheat maize li et al 2011 yang et al 2011 yin et al 2017 till now many studies on intercropping systems have been reported in the irrigated areas and the areas with high rainfall however few studies are carried out in the semi arid regions although it is more necessary to apply ecological principles to increase yield and water use efficiency in the semiarid rainfed agricultural region of china regional climate is characterized by low rainfall 15 year average rainfall 346 mm high evaporation rate 1592 mm and no irrigation mo et al 2017 thus yield improvement in the intercropping system is strongly allied with water use efficiency yin et al 2020 in this study we hypothesized that intercropping practice would contribute to the improvement of water use efficiency through the compensation effect and land equivalent ratio in the semiarid region the objectives of this study are designed as 1 to evaluate the differentiate performance of crop productivity in monoculture and intercropping conditions maize soybean wheat soybean and maize wheat 2 to demonstrate the dynamic competitive trajectories of crop growth and development during the co growth period 3 to explore the interspecific relationships in different intercropping systems and its association with soil water availability and 4 to reveal how crop interactions affect the land equivalent ratio via the compensation effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site two year 2019 2020 field experiments were established in the dryland agricultural experimental station of lanzhou university lanzhou gansu p r china 35 51 n 104 07 e and altitude of 1620 m this region is mainly characterized as semi arid climate type with low rainfall and high evaporation rate the average rainfall evaporation rate and the average temperature were 346 mm 1592 mm and 7 81 ºc respectively during last 15 years and about 70 of annual precipitation occurred from july to september in this site annual precipitation was 418 6 mm in 2019 and 361 6 mm in 2020 respectively while the average temperature was 6 88ºc and 7 51ºc respectively fig 1 the soil type of the experimental site was yellow loam soil the soil bulk density organic carbon content ph 1 2 5 h2o total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the 0 40 cm soil layer were 1 36 g cm 3 7 20 g kg 1 8 16 0 81 g kg 1 3 51 mg kg 1 and 121 54 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized block design was made with three crop species maize wheat and soybean and two cropping patterns intercropping and monoculture there were 6 treatments to allocate monoculture and intercropping systems each plot was arranged with 7 m 7 m area and repeated with three times in this study hexaploid spring wheat triticum aestivum l longchun 29 diploid spring maize zea mays l shengdan no 16 and soybean variety glycine max linn merr zhonghuang 30 were used according to local crop phenology wheat was sown in late march while maize and soybean in late april during each year respectively wheat was harvested in late july soybean in the middle september and maize in the middle october respectively the distance between rows was 40 cm in maize and 20 cm in soybean and wheat for both sole crops and intercrops similarly the distance between adjacent maize and wheat rows maize and soybean rows and wheat and soybean rows was 30 cm 40 2 20 2 30 30 cm 40 2 20 2 30 and 20 cm 20 2 20 2 20 respectively fig 1 intercropping and single cropping planting density was kept same planting density was identified according to the local convention i e the planting density of soybean was 2 25 106 plants ha 1 wheat was 650 105 seeds ha 1 and maize was 6 5 105 seeds ha 1 respectively consistent field management measures were adopted for all treatments across two growing seasons before sowing a 225 kg ha 1 of urea and 150 kg ha 1 of superphosphate were applied uniformly to ensure nutrient sufficiency in the experimental field weeds were manually controlled and disease pest management was applied to maintain healthy crop growth across two growing seasons all the treatments were under normal field management and there was no irrigation across the whole growth period except natural rainfall 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 aboveground and belowground biomass at maturity 2 square meter of maize plants 1 square meter of wheat and 1 square meter of soybean was randomly selected from each plot these plants were carefully harvested and kept at 80ºc for 72 h for constant weight root biomass was determined for each treatment at the time of maximum root biomass late june for wheat milking stage middle august for soybean flowering stage and late august for maize milking stage respectively soil column 20 cm in depth 20 cm in length 20 cm in width for maize 20 50 20 cm for wheat and 20 20 20 cm for soybean was dug out around each plant root and roots were carefully collected and washed these samples were placed in an oven at 80ºc for 72 h and weighted 2 3 2 logistic model and competitive trajectory fitting in order to clarify the effects of different species composition on interspecific competition processes biomass accumulation and instantaneous growth rates of different crops were calculated by dynamic fitting logistic model the destructive sampling method was used in the present study trinder et al 2012 thirty days after seed germination the aboveground parts two plants from each plot i e 2 plants 3 replicates for a total 6 samples were sampled every 15 days with 10 times of sampling for maize after the sample collection quickly put it into the oven to be sterilized at 100 c for 2 h and then kept at 80 c until dried and weighed then a logistic model was fitted to the biomass data of each treatment according to the eq 1 as described by zhang et al 2017 1 m t k 1 exp r t 50 t where m t kg ha 1 is the biomass per unit area of the plant in a specific time k kg ha 1 refers to the maximum biomass that the crop can reach r d 1 represents the intrinsic growth rate d m t dt 1 m t and t 50 is the time in which a crop reaches the maximum growth rate respectively these factors can be obtained by fitting the logistic 1 model in origin 2018 on the other hand the instantaneous growth rate of plants was obtained by the following formula 2 d m t dt r m t 1 m t k as the instantaneous growth rate of plants reaches the maximum at m t k 2 the maximum growth rate is i max rk 4 following the data harvest of dry matter accumulation and instantaneous growth rate we fitted species 1 and 2 as x axis and y axis respectively to sketch the competitive trajectory this would help dynamically present how the species interacted with each other promoted or inhibited 2 3 3 interspecific plant competition intensity and land equivalent ratio in order to quantify the effects of interspecific plant competition we assessed the magnitude of potential competition among different plant species in the three mixed treatments as the rii armas et al 2004 3 rii b mix i b sin i b mix i b sin i where bmix i is the average biomass of the three species in the mixed treatments and bsin i is the average biomass of the three species in the single treatment the rii values ranged from 1 1 when the rii value is less than 0 this indicates negative interaction greater than 0 indicates positive interaction conceptually land equivalent ratio ler represents the relative land area that is required to achieve the same yield or biomass per unit area as sole crops in the intercrops it is expressed as follows mead and willey 1980 4 ler y 1 m 1 y 2 m 2 where y1 is yield of species 1 in intercrop m1 is the yield in sole crop and the same for species 2 when the ler is greater than 1 there is a land use advantage of intercropping the calculation of ler is mainly based on the yield per unit area under the condition of ensuring the same planting density 2 3 4 yield and yield components after maturity nine maize plants 1 square meter of wheat and 1 square meter of soybeans were randomly selected from each plot mazie plant ear length ear diameter kernel number 100 kernel weight kernel weight per plant and bare tip length of maize were assessed wheat plant ear length number of grains per ear grain weight 1000 grain weight and effective spike numbers per unit area were determined soybean biomass and yield was recorded accordingly 2 3 5 leaf physiological characteristics crop physiological traits can provide a good understanding of the mechanism of yield increase or loss caused by positive and negative interactions leaf photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content are important factors controlling plant photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen content is closely related to chlorophyll content in present study the data were collected and determined instantaneously according to the methods in the published studies franco et al 2018 the net photosynthetic rate was measured from of three plants for each treatment between 08 30 h and 10 30 h using a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor lincoln ne usa leaf were collected in liquid nitrogen and transferred them to the laboratory samples were dried at 85 and then crushed to determine nitrogen content fresh leaf sample was used to assess chlorophyll content the leaf nitrogen content was measured using an elementar analyzer vario macro cns elementar germany the leaf chlorophyll content was determined by extraction with 85 propanol he et al 2005 using propanol as the control solution the chlorophyll content was measured as the light absorption value of the chlorophyll pigment extract at 663 nm and 645 nm using spectrophotometer during the whole growth period leaf samples were made for twice to determine leaf physiological characteristics i e in the mid june competitive growth stage and the mid august stages compensation growth stage it was noted that in the mid june wheat was at flowering maize at jointing and soybean at branching respectively in the mid august wheat was harvested when maize was still at silking and soybeans still at podding respectively 2 3 6 soil moisture and water use efficiency in order to confirm the causes of the different interspecific effects soil moisture content of 0 100 cm was measured at different growing stage the specific sampling times were april 1 june 15 july 25 september 15 and october 15 in 2019 and april 2 june 13 july 26 september 18 and october 18 in 2020 a soil core sampler 5 cm internal diameter was used to collect soil samples from different depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 100 cm three soil cores were collected in each strip and then calculated the average soil water content for each soil depth soil water storage sws mm was calculated from soil water content swc that was determined gravimetrically at each measurement depth soil water content swc soil water storage sws and water use efficiency wue of 0 100 cm soil layer were calculated in each species strips according to the method of wang et al 2016 specifically the swc sws wue and et were calculated according to the following formula 5 swc water weight dry soil weight 100 6 sws mm swc ρ b g cm 3 sd mm 7 wue y et 8 et mm p sws where ρb is soil bulk density in each soil layer sd refers to as soil depth y is yield kg ha 1 et mm is evapotranspiration p mm is total rainfall amount during each growing season and sws mm is the change in soil water storage i e water storage at harvesting minus water storage at sowing in the 100 cm soil depth in each growing season 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was performed to compare the differences among the treatment an independent sample t test was used to compare whether rii and ler values in three intercropping treatments were significantly different from 0 and 1 at 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 levels respectively the difference of soil water content among the treatments were compared using the least significant difference lsd all statistical analysis were performed with spss 22 spss inc chicago usa figures were plotted using the origin 2018 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 logistic function biomass accumulation of different species in general different crop combinations significantly affected biomass accumulation process of different crops fig 2 in monoculture system average aboveground biomass was 22 9 ton ha 1 in maize 8 1 ton ha 1 in soybean and 11 8 ton ha 1 for wheat respectively when intercropped with soybean maize and wheat biomass was increased by 14 5 and 17 9 and the maximum instantaneous growth rate of maize and wheat was increased by 29 4 and 34 0 respectively fig 2a however the maximum biomass of maize was decreased by 20 2 in maize wheat intercropping condition while wheat biomass increased by 10 2 fig 2a d intercropping did not affect soybean biomass accumulation and growth rate fig 2e f similar results were observed during both growing seasons 3 2 competition trajectories of different species in co growth period in general the competition trajectories showed that the biomass accumulation of soybean was smaller than that of either maize or wheat during the co growth period however no significant difference in biomass accumulation between intercropped soybean and monoculture soybean was observed fig 3 intercropping with soybean significantly increased maize and wheat biomass accumulation during the co growth period comparing with monocropping however in the co growth period of maize with wheat biomass accumulation was significantly lower in maize than that of wheat thus wheat showed an opposite trend relative to maize fig 3c d on the other hand the competition trajectories of instantaneous growth rate igr showed that the growth rate of intercropped wheat was significantly higher than that of maize at the early stage of co growth 97d indicating that wheat was more competitive than maize in particular intercropping delayed the time when maize igr exceeded wheat it was noted that the intercropping with soybean significantly promoted the instantaneous growth rate of either wheat or maize while the intercropping with wheat and maize did not affect the igr of soybean similar results were observed in both growing seasons moreover the intercropping with soybean significantly increased the root biomass of maize and wheat by 24 7 and 25 5 respectively while the intercropping with wheat significantly lowered the root biomass of maize by 24 9 fig 3i j interestingly no significant changes were observed in soybean root biomass among all treatments fig 4 3 3 relative interaction intensity and land equivalent ratio regardless of growing seasons the average rii was significantly greater than 0 and the ler was greater than 1 in soybean maize intercropping and soybean wheat intercropping systems fig 5 the data indicated that two intercropping systems could improve crop productivity per unit area however in the maize wheat intercropping system the rii of wheat was significantly greater than 0 but that of maize was significantly lower than 0 fig 5a this phenomenon resulted in an average rii of less than 0 and the ler showed non significant differences with 1 showing no significant effects on crop productivity per unit area fig 5 specifically the results of ler showed that the biomass of maize and soybean intercropping and wheat and soybean intercropping were 1 10 and 1 11 respectively and the yield equivalent ratio was 1 09 and 1 12 respectively that showed an obvious advantage in increasing crop productivity per unit area 3 4 leaf physiological activity and yield formation a general trend was that compared with its monoculture the intercropping with soybean significantly improved leaf nitrogen content chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of either maize or wheat by 22 02 16 37 and 14 61 in mid august 2019 and 30 82 15 7 and 13 5 in mid june 2019 respectively table 1 however the intercropping with soybeans did not affect the physiological activity of maize in mid june 2019 in the wheat maize intercropping system the co growth with wheat significantly decreased leaf nitrogen content chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of maize leaves by 19 04 19 46 and 13 96 in mid june 2019 respectively importantly during the compensatory growth stage mid august the physiological activity of maize intercropped with wheat was still significantly lower than that of maize monoculture totally the intercropping species did not affect the physiological activity of soybean and there was no significant difference between intercropping and monoculture table 1 similar results were obtained in both years compared with monoculture intercropping with soybean significantly increased ear length kernel number and kernel weight per ear while significantly decreased bare tip length and kernel abortion rate of maize specifically the kernel abortion rate was decreased by 25 4 and the grain number and grain weight were increased by 4 88 and 18 06 table 2 compared with mono cropped wheat intercropping with soybean significantly increased spike length kernel number kernel weight and effective spike number by 19 08 12 90 11 11 and 7 43 respectively at the same time the intercropping with maize also significantly improved wheat spike length kernel number kernel weight and effective spike number by 16 9 10 8 12 3 and 4 6 however the intercropping with wheat significantly lowered ear length kernel number and kernel weight by 9 2 11 5 and 21 9 respectively while significantly promoting bald tip length and abortion rate of maize by 29 5 and 14 9 respectively 3 5 soil water storage and water use efficiency in general soil water storage and water use varied from cropping patterns the dynamics of soil water storage in each crop strip across the whole growth period showed that the intercropping with soybean significantly enhanced soil water storage of 0 100 cm soil layer in the maize and wheat strips fig 6 before august soil water storage decreased most in wheat strips especially in monocultures compared with maize and soybeans however during the co growth period soil water storage ub maize strips intercropped with wheat was significantly lower than that of maize monocultured and intercropped with soybean also the intercropping with soybean significantly improved the 0 100 cm sws of either wheat or maize strip by 10 6 and 11 0 respectively during co growth period fig 6 table 3 however both wheat maize and wheat soybean intercropping significantly lessened the sws in the maize and soybean strips while increasing the sws in the wheat strip in mid june and late july importantly in mid september we found no significant difference in soil water storage between maize strips intercropped with wheat and maize monoculture one in 2019 except that even significantly higher sws in the 0 40 cm soil layer was found relative to maize monoculture strip in 2020 totally there was no significant difference in sws in maize strips between maize wheat and maize soybean intercropping after maize was harvested fig 6 and table 3 finally compared with monoculture the intercropping with soybean significantly elevated maize and wheat biomass and yield also the shoot biomass of maize and wheat increased by 17 7 19 5 and 17 6 19 8 respectively while the yield improved by 15 3 18 6 and 18 3 20 92 respectively in both growing seasons particularly both biomass wue and yield wue of either maize or wheat when intercropped with soybean were also significantly enhanced it was noted that the maize wheat intercropping decreased maize yield by 15 8 21 9 table 3 as a result maize biomass and yield wue in the intercropping with wheat was lowered 4 discussion 4 1 competition and mutual benefit among three crops conventionally a key challenge for ecologists and plant scientists is to shorten the gap between ecological principles and applications in agroecosystems greater land use advantage is expected with greater temporal spatial niche differentiation because it may allow species to realize a greater relative yield due to complementary use of resources in time and space theoretically this phenomenon is defined as compensation effect li et al 1999 yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the post harvest crops can obtain high growth compensation after the harvest of neighboring crops thus increasing or stabilizing the yield it was found that different species combinations resulted in different rii values of each species which ultimately resulted in different ler in this study the maize soybean and wheat soybean intercropping significantly promoted the relative productivity per unit area ler 1 while the maize wheat intercropping did not affect ler evidently this trend was different from the results of previous studies yin et al 2017 previous studies have shown that intercropping with legumes generally increased the productivity of neighboring crops and the maize wheat intercropping system also had the potential to increase yield fan et al 2020 liang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 this was mainly because legumes can provide nitrogen for neighboring crops and show compensation effects raza et al 2021 found that the maize soybean intercropping was a productive strategy to maximize water use efficiency this trend was similar as our findings while maize and wheat were stronger water competitor than soybean soybean growth has not been inhibited in this study the crops were not subjected to nitrogen and phosphorus competition since sufficient fertilizer were supplied therefore the yield increase of maize and wheat in the soybean involved intercropping systems was mainly resulted from compensatory use of soil water rather than nitrogen fixation and sharing of soybean to most extent the maize wheat intercropping system can obtain high ler by improving water use efficiency this was mainly because the separation of growth periods between two crops was beneficial to the compensatory utilization of groundwater resources yang et al 2011 during the co growth period wheat can use water from the maize strip to gain yield advantage while maize can gain soil water from the wheat strip by expanding its root system thus gaining compensatory growth after wheat was harvested ma et al 2019 during the co growth period of wheat and maize soil water in the maize strips can be utilized by wheat to achieve high yield however in this study maize did not increase yield through the compensation growth there are three main reasons why wheat maize intercropping system does not improve land equivalent ratio firstly some studies on intercropping systems were conducted in the arid areas with irrigation farming 400 800 mm of irrigation and the areas with annual rainfall of 500 mm where sufficient water diluted the competitive effect ahmed et al 2020 hu et al 2015 secondly it was probably responsible for crop water use traits wheat is a crop of high water consumption and rapid biomass accumulation which frequently results in high water competition for neighboring crops thirdly the compensation effect probably failed to make up for the loss of biomass due to competition the co growth period of wheat and maize covered the most time of maize vegetative growth period when the high competition effect may inhibit the growth ability of maize in the semiarid loess plateau of china the changes in sws was not only affected by crop planting but also was highly dependent on natural precipitation in this region over 70 of annual precipitation was accumulated on summer season i e from july to september in present study wheat was early mature crop and harvested at the late july after wheat was harvested more rainwater can be collected and stored in soil profile it was noted that while soil moisture in maize strips can be to some extent restored after wheat harvesting its physiological activity and instantaneous growth rate were still lower than that of monoculture 4 2 dynamics of growth trajectory and moisture dependent mechanisms affecting land productivity generally intercropping with legumes can improve growth rate of neighboring crops intercropping with peas improved the growth rate of maize hu et al 2020 which is consistent with the current data wheat inhibits maize growth rate during the co growth period and could recovers through later compensatory growth zhang et al 2017 this was attributed that wheat roots occupied the underground ecological niche belonging to maize in the co growth period leading to extracting resources and inhibiting the growth of maize however maize expands root coverage and improved water acquisition ability after wheat harvest ma et al 2019 our results showed that the growth rate of maize was significantly inhibited by wheat at the early growth stage although the growth rate of maize was higher than wheat at later growth stage but it was still lower than that of monoculture indicating that the compensation effect did not improve the growth capacity of maize in present study the dynamics of soil moisture confirmed the sgh hypothesis that different species combinations influenced soil water content and water use efficiency in different crop strips in the soybean involved intercropping systems soil water content and productivity of adjacent plant bands tended to increase which contributed to improve water use efficiency raza et al 2021 this trend was also found in the results of the maize soybean and wheat soybean intercropping systems in our study in the co growth period with wheat soil water storage in the maize strip was significantly lowered fig 6 and table 3 on the other hand the root weight of maize in 0 30 cm soil layer also decreased significantly when intercropped with wheat while the root weight of wheat turned to increase the data confirmed that wheat can utilize more water in the maize strips during the co growth period and suppress the growth and development of maize root system while soil water storage in the maize strips recovered after wheat was harvested the physiological activity and instantaneous growth rate of maize were not affected evidently particularly they were found to be lower than those of monocropping without any improvement on water use efficiency fig 6 and table 3 this trend suggested that the compensation effect was not only dependent on the resource availability for the late harvesting crop after the early sowing crop was harvested but also on the gap of growth rhythm at the co growth period if the loss of growth during the co growth period cannot be compensated in the late follow up period the intercropping would not increase land equivalent ratio especially in semiarid agroecosystems when the superior species showed a pronounced advantage of water capture over inferior one high intensity interspecific competition frequently enabled the compensation effect difficult to occur at the late sole growth period 4 3 carbon assimilation and final yield formation existing knowledge shows that leaf photosynthetic and physiological characteristics are the critical indicators for yield formation the intercropping with legumes can improve leaf area index leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic rate in maize or wheat compared with the corresponding monoculture feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 although the photosynthetic capacity of maize in the co growth period was inhibited by wheat maize still can quickly recover after wheat was harvested this process help improve its photosynthetic capacity as a result of compensatory growth li et al 2020a 2020b ma et al 2020 however the photosynthetic capacity of intercropped maize did not recover after wheat was harvest and instead it remained significantly lower than that of monoculture table 1 during the co growth period with wheat more resources water and nutrients were consumed by wheat which significantly affected the physiological activity of maize leaves particularly at the later period to say the compensation effect was not observed to cover the loss at the late stages as presented in the above the growth and yield loss of maize was not compensated as expected and maize growth and reproduction were to some extent damaged specifically the intercropping with wheat significantly reduced maize ear length and increased bare tip length and kernel abortion rate during the reproductive period this trend significantly negatively affected final yield of maize resulting in a lower ler on the other hand wheat indeed benefited from competition as a superior species for high yield harvest yet this advantage was to some extent offset by the greater loss in maize yield consequently resulting in no advantage in land use efficiency interestingly the result of this study was different from that of previous other studies chai et al 2014 li et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 this was mainly because most of these studies were conducted in the irrigated regions rather than in the rainfed ones in semi arid rainfed regions annual rainfall was frequently less than 450 mm where the land use advantage of wheat maize intercropping was not evident or even negative to most extent soil water availability was the key factor affecting yield formation of maize as shown in fig 7 the intercropping with soybean significantly increased the photosynthetic capacity instantaneous growth rate and yield of both maize and wheat this trend was in turn beneficial to improve wue as a result of significant positive interaction it was noted that low soil water status stimulated the occurrence of interspecific competition in maize wheat intercropping as such the photosynthetic capacity biomass accumulation and yield of maize were evidently inhibited during the co growth period and eventually lowered wue while wheat was the beneficiary from this competition the increased harvest was offset by the yield loss of maize fig 7 critically the compensatory growth of maize was not observed after wheat was harvested in contrast the inhibitive effect on maize growth further affected the late reproduction growth during the co growth period in this case interspecific competition significantly increased the seed abortion rate and bald tip length thus resulting in final yield loss and lower land equivalent ratio 5 conclusion as presented in this study crop diversity is not always beneficial for promoting productivity at farmland landscape scale unreasonable crop diversification arrangement may not improve land equivalent ratio in this study the maize soybean and wheat soybean intercropping systems displayed positive interactions with one positive and one neutral 0 and its ler was significantly greater than 1 yet the maize wheat intercropping system showed a competitive relationship with one positive and one negative and its ler was non significantly difference with 1 during the co growth period wheat was the dominant species with high growth rates and water deprivation in the maize strip resulting in high yields in this study the loss of maize growth caused by competition was not compensated for higher total yield ler across two growing seasons as soil water was the main limiting factor in semi arid region the water competition during the co growth period not only significantly reduced the biomass accumulation rate and photosynthetic capacity of maize but also depressed the grain yield potential of maize by increasing the bare tip length and abortion rate this ultimately resulted in yield loss of intercropped maize and the further decrease of total ler in contrast the soybean involved intercropping systems turned to display the potentials of water compensation use in which either wheat or maize improved water use efficiency and productivity in this case the ler can be improved accordingly in conclusion it is needed to rationally optimize intercropping species composition and strategically reduce interspecific competition as a result of enhanced water compensation effect this can act as a critical ecological pathway to realize high yield output in semi arid agricultural

9472,plant plant interactions in the intercropping system can significantly affect crop productivity however it is poorly understood how the interactions affect the land equivalent ratios ler in the cereal legumes and cereal cereal intercropping systems in semi arid agroecosystems a two year 2019 2020 field experiment was conducted in the dryland agricultural experimental station of lanzhou university a semiarid rainfed site of northwest china to quantify the impact of crop diversification on land equivalent ratio and its moisture dependent mechanisms in three intercropping systems of maize wheat maize soybean and wheat soybean the soybean involved intercropping systems showed positive interactions which substantially promoted crop productivity of maize and wheat by 18 1 20 9 the soil water in soybean strips can be used by intercropped wheat or maize which in turn promoted soil water storage sws in maize or wheat strips by 0 6 and 11 0 respectively during the co growth period this further improved the photosynthetic rate pn instantaneous growth rate igr and water use efficiency wue for each species and thereafter elevated the land equivalence ratio ler 1 however in the wheat maize intercropping system interspecific competition was dominated with wheat as dominant species and maize as inferior one respectively the competition plundered available water of maize strips sws decreased by 10 5 and thus decreased its pn and wue by 12 7 and 20 0 p 0 05 respectively importantly maize yield and ler were not improved via the compensation effect during the post harvest period of wheat while soil water was to some extent restored the pn and igr of intercropped maize were still lower than those of monoculture maize this trend resulted in maize yield loss during the reproductive period and ultimately lower ler for the first time we found a rarely reported phenomenon i e negative relationships between crop diversity and land equivalent ratios in semiarid agroecosystem since the yield loss caused by competition was not compensated during the co growth period therefore a positive relationship between crop diversification and land equivalent ratio

intercropping system land equivalent ratio positive and negative interactions water use efficiency compensation effect semi arid regions 1 introduction intercropping system has been widely used in the semiarid regions due to high and stable productivity and efficient utilization of resources yin et al 2020 in this aspect the positive relationships between crop diversity and productivity have been reported brooker et al 2015 li et al 2020 the mixture of grass and legume can result in greater biomass and yield relative to monoculture duchene et al 2017 this phenomenon was closely associated with positive plant plant interactions in the cropping systems donald 1963 harper et al 1961 yet the limited resource pool and the overlap of niche would lead to the occurrence of plant competition resulting in poor growth of inferior species aschehoug et al 2016 under the field condition low resource availability frequently leads to positive interaction in the intercropping systems brooker et al 2015 intercrops usually produce more yields per unit area than sole crops as measured by land equivalent ratio ler i e the relative area of land under sole cropping to the intercropping required to produce equal amounts of yield cong et al 2015 li et al 2020a 2020b willey 1979 for a given intercropping system the mechanism of yield improvement is mainly focused on nutrient enrichment resource sharing and niche complementarity nutrient enrichment is generally found in promoting the nodulation of legume crops li et al 2016 improving the activation of insoluble nutrients li et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 sharing resource and enhancing the fixed nitrogen transport from legumes to neighboring plants jensen et al 2020 in this regard niche complementarity is the tendency for coexisting species that occupy a similar position along one niche dimension to differ from the other liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 yu et al 2015 in the intercropping system early sowing or early maturing crop can utilize greater amount of water resources for higher biomass while the late sowing or late maturing one turns to improve biomass via the compensation effect after early crop is harvested li et al 2001 recent meta analysis results indicated that global average ler for intercropping systems was 1 21 1 35 li et al 2020a 2020b martin guay et al 2018 similarly many empirical studies have shown yield advantages in cereal legume and cereal cereal intercropping systems such as maize faba bean maize soybean and wheat maize li et al 2011 yang et al 2011 yin et al 2017 till now many studies on intercropping systems have been reported in the irrigated areas and the areas with high rainfall however few studies are carried out in the semi arid regions although it is more necessary to apply ecological principles to increase yield and water use efficiency in the semiarid rainfed agricultural region of china regional climate is characterized by low rainfall 15 year average rainfall 346 mm high evaporation rate 1592 mm and no irrigation mo et al 2017 thus yield improvement in the intercropping system is strongly allied with water use efficiency yin et al 2020 in this study we hypothesized that intercropping practice would contribute to the improvement of water use efficiency through the compensation effect and land equivalent ratio in the semiarid region the objectives of this study are designed as 1 to evaluate the differentiate performance of crop productivity in monoculture and intercropping conditions maize soybean wheat soybean and maize wheat 2 to demonstrate the dynamic competitive trajectories of crop growth and development during the co growth period 3 to explore the interspecific relationships in different intercropping systems and its association with soil water availability and 4 to reveal how crop interactions affect the land equivalent ratio via the compensation effect 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site two year 2019 2020 field experiments were established in the dryland agricultural experimental station of lanzhou university lanzhou gansu p r china 35 51 n 104 07 e and altitude of 1620 m this region is mainly characterized as semi arid climate type with low rainfall and high evaporation rate the average rainfall evaporation rate and the average temperature were 346 mm 1592 mm and 7 81 ºc respectively during last 15 years and about 70 of annual precipitation occurred from july to september in this site annual precipitation was 418 6 mm in 2019 and 361 6 mm in 2020 respectively while the average temperature was 6 88ºc and 7 51ºc respectively fig 1 the soil type of the experimental site was yellow loam soil the soil bulk density organic carbon content ph 1 2 5 h2o total nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium in the 0 40 cm soil layer were 1 36 g cm 3 7 20 g kg 1 8 16 0 81 g kg 1 3 51 mg kg 1 and 121 54 mg kg 1 respectively 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized block design was made with three crop species maize wheat and soybean and two cropping patterns intercropping and monoculture there were 6 treatments to allocate monoculture and intercropping systems each plot was arranged with 7 m 7 m area and repeated with three times in this study hexaploid spring wheat triticum aestivum l longchun 29 diploid spring maize zea mays l shengdan no 16 and soybean variety glycine max linn merr zhonghuang 30 were used according to local crop phenology wheat was sown in late march while maize and soybean in late april during each year respectively wheat was harvested in late july soybean in the middle september and maize in the middle october respectively the distance between rows was 40 cm in maize and 20 cm in soybean and wheat for both sole crops and intercrops similarly the distance between adjacent maize and wheat rows maize and soybean rows and wheat and soybean rows was 30 cm 40 2 20 2 30 30 cm 40 2 20 2 30 and 20 cm 20 2 20 2 20 respectively fig 1 intercropping and single cropping planting density was kept same planting density was identified according to the local convention i e the planting density of soybean was 2 25 106 plants ha 1 wheat was 650 105 seeds ha 1 and maize was 6 5 105 seeds ha 1 respectively consistent field management measures were adopted for all treatments across two growing seasons before sowing a 225 kg ha 1 of urea and 150 kg ha 1 of superphosphate were applied uniformly to ensure nutrient sufficiency in the experimental field weeds were manually controlled and disease pest management was applied to maintain healthy crop growth across two growing seasons all the treatments were under normal field management and there was no irrigation across the whole growth period except natural rainfall 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 aboveground and belowground biomass at maturity 2 square meter of maize plants 1 square meter of wheat and 1 square meter of soybean was randomly selected from each plot these plants were carefully harvested and kept at 80ºc for 72 h for constant weight root biomass was determined for each treatment at the time of maximum root biomass late june for wheat milking stage middle august for soybean flowering stage and late august for maize milking stage respectively soil column 20 cm in depth 20 cm in length 20 cm in width for maize 20 50 20 cm for wheat and 20 20 20 cm for soybean was dug out around each plant root and roots were carefully collected and washed these samples were placed in an oven at 80ºc for 72 h and weighted 2 3 2 logistic model and competitive trajectory fitting in order to clarify the effects of different species composition on interspecific competition processes biomass accumulation and instantaneous growth rates of different crops were calculated by dynamic fitting logistic model the destructive sampling method was used in the present study trinder et al 2012 thirty days after seed germination the aboveground parts two plants from each plot i e 2 plants 3 replicates for a total 6 samples were sampled every 15 days with 10 times of sampling for maize after the sample collection quickly put it into the oven to be sterilized at 100 c for 2 h and then kept at 80 c until dried and weighed then a logistic model was fitted to the biomass data of each treatment according to the eq 1 as described by zhang et al 2017 1 m t k 1 exp r t 50 t where m t kg ha 1 is the biomass per unit area of the plant in a specific time k kg ha 1 refers to the maximum biomass that the crop can reach r d 1 represents the intrinsic growth rate d m t dt 1 m t and t 50 is the time in which a crop reaches the maximum growth rate respectively these factors can be obtained by fitting the logistic 1 model in origin 2018 on the other hand the instantaneous growth rate of plants was obtained by the following formula 2 d m t dt r m t 1 m t k as the instantaneous growth rate of plants reaches the maximum at m t k 2 the maximum growth rate is i max rk 4 following the data harvest of dry matter accumulation and instantaneous growth rate we fitted species 1 and 2 as x axis and y axis respectively to sketch the competitive trajectory this would help dynamically present how the species interacted with each other promoted or inhibited 2 3 3 interspecific plant competition intensity and land equivalent ratio in order to quantify the effects of interspecific plant competition we assessed the magnitude of potential competition among different plant species in the three mixed treatments as the rii armas et al 2004 3 rii b mix i b sin i b mix i b sin i where bmix i is the average biomass of the three species in the mixed treatments and bsin i is the average biomass of the three species in the single treatment the rii values ranged from 1 1 when the rii value is less than 0 this indicates negative interaction greater than 0 indicates positive interaction conceptually land equivalent ratio ler represents the relative land area that is required to achieve the same yield or biomass per unit area as sole crops in the intercrops it is expressed as follows mead and willey 1980 4 ler y 1 m 1 y 2 m 2 where y1 is yield of species 1 in intercrop m1 is the yield in sole crop and the same for species 2 when the ler is greater than 1 there is a land use advantage of intercropping the calculation of ler is mainly based on the yield per unit area under the condition of ensuring the same planting density 2 3 4 yield and yield components after maturity nine maize plants 1 square meter of wheat and 1 square meter of soybeans were randomly selected from each plot mazie plant ear length ear diameter kernel number 100 kernel weight kernel weight per plant and bare tip length of maize were assessed wheat plant ear length number of grains per ear grain weight 1000 grain weight and effective spike numbers per unit area were determined soybean biomass and yield was recorded accordingly 2 3 5 leaf physiological characteristics crop physiological traits can provide a good understanding of the mechanism of yield increase or loss caused by positive and negative interactions leaf photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content are important factors controlling plant photosynthesis and leaf nitrogen content is closely related to chlorophyll content in present study the data were collected and determined instantaneously according to the methods in the published studies franco et al 2018 the net photosynthetic rate was measured from of three plants for each treatment between 08 30 h and 10 30 h using a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor lincoln ne usa leaf were collected in liquid nitrogen and transferred them to the laboratory samples were dried at 85 and then crushed to determine nitrogen content fresh leaf sample was used to assess chlorophyll content the leaf nitrogen content was measured using an elementar analyzer vario macro cns elementar germany the leaf chlorophyll content was determined by extraction with 85 propanol he et al 2005 using propanol as the control solution the chlorophyll content was measured as the light absorption value of the chlorophyll pigment extract at 663 nm and 645 nm using spectrophotometer during the whole growth period leaf samples were made for twice to determine leaf physiological characteristics i e in the mid june competitive growth stage and the mid august stages compensation growth stage it was noted that in the mid june wheat was at flowering maize at jointing and soybean at branching respectively in the mid august wheat was harvested when maize was still at silking and soybeans still at podding respectively 2 3 6 soil moisture and water use efficiency in order to confirm the causes of the different interspecific effects soil moisture content of 0 100 cm was measured at different growing stage the specific sampling times were april 1 june 15 july 25 september 15 and october 15 in 2019 and april 2 june 13 july 26 september 18 and october 18 in 2020 a soil core sampler 5 cm internal diameter was used to collect soil samples from different depths 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 100 cm three soil cores were collected in each strip and then calculated the average soil water content for each soil depth soil water storage sws mm was calculated from soil water content swc that was determined gravimetrically at each measurement depth soil water content swc soil water storage sws and water use efficiency wue of 0 100 cm soil layer were calculated in each species strips according to the method of wang et al 2016 specifically the swc sws wue and et were calculated according to the following formula 5 swc water weight dry soil weight 100 6 sws mm swc ρ b g cm 3 sd mm 7 wue y et 8 et mm p sws where ρb is soil bulk density in each soil layer sd refers to as soil depth y is yield kg ha 1 et mm is evapotranspiration p mm is total rainfall amount during each growing season and sws mm is the change in soil water storage i e water storage at harvesting minus water storage at sowing in the 100 cm soil depth in each growing season 2 4 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova was performed to compare the differences among the treatment an independent sample t test was used to compare whether rii and ler values in three intercropping treatments were significantly different from 0 and 1 at 0 05 0 01 and 0 001 levels respectively the difference of soil water content among the treatments were compared using the least significant difference lsd all statistical analysis were performed with spss 22 spss inc chicago usa figures were plotted using the origin 2018 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 logistic function biomass accumulation of different species in general different crop combinations significantly affected biomass accumulation process of different crops fig 2 in monoculture system average aboveground biomass was 22 9 ton ha 1 in maize 8 1 ton ha 1 in soybean and 11 8 ton ha 1 for wheat respectively when intercropped with soybean maize and wheat biomass was increased by 14 5 and 17 9 and the maximum instantaneous growth rate of maize and wheat was increased by 29 4 and 34 0 respectively fig 2a however the maximum biomass of maize was decreased by 20 2 in maize wheat intercropping condition while wheat biomass increased by 10 2 fig 2a d intercropping did not affect soybean biomass accumulation and growth rate fig 2e f similar results were observed during both growing seasons 3 2 competition trajectories of different species in co growth period in general the competition trajectories showed that the biomass accumulation of soybean was smaller than that of either maize or wheat during the co growth period however no significant difference in biomass accumulation between intercropped soybean and monoculture soybean was observed fig 3 intercropping with soybean significantly increased maize and wheat biomass accumulation during the co growth period comparing with monocropping however in the co growth period of maize with wheat biomass accumulation was significantly lower in maize than that of wheat thus wheat showed an opposite trend relative to maize fig 3c d on the other hand the competition trajectories of instantaneous growth rate igr showed that the growth rate of intercropped wheat was significantly higher than that of maize at the early stage of co growth 97d indicating that wheat was more competitive than maize in particular intercropping delayed the time when maize igr exceeded wheat it was noted that the intercropping with soybean significantly promoted the instantaneous growth rate of either wheat or maize while the intercropping with wheat and maize did not affect the igr of soybean similar results were observed in both growing seasons moreover the intercropping with soybean significantly increased the root biomass of maize and wheat by 24 7 and 25 5 respectively while the intercropping with wheat significantly lowered the root biomass of maize by 24 9 fig 3i j interestingly no significant changes were observed in soybean root biomass among all treatments fig 4 3 3 relative interaction intensity and land equivalent ratio regardless of growing seasons the average rii was significantly greater than 0 and the ler was greater than 1 in soybean maize intercropping and soybean wheat intercropping systems fig 5 the data indicated that two intercropping systems could improve crop productivity per unit area however in the maize wheat intercropping system the rii of wheat was significantly greater than 0 but that of maize was significantly lower than 0 fig 5a this phenomenon resulted in an average rii of less than 0 and the ler showed non significant differences with 1 showing no significant effects on crop productivity per unit area fig 5 specifically the results of ler showed that the biomass of maize and soybean intercropping and wheat and soybean intercropping were 1 10 and 1 11 respectively and the yield equivalent ratio was 1 09 and 1 12 respectively that showed an obvious advantage in increasing crop productivity per unit area 3 4 leaf physiological activity and yield formation a general trend was that compared with its monoculture the intercropping with soybean significantly improved leaf nitrogen content chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of either maize or wheat by 22 02 16 37 and 14 61 in mid august 2019 and 30 82 15 7 and 13 5 in mid june 2019 respectively table 1 however the intercropping with soybeans did not affect the physiological activity of maize in mid june 2019 in the wheat maize intercropping system the co growth with wheat significantly decreased leaf nitrogen content chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of maize leaves by 19 04 19 46 and 13 96 in mid june 2019 respectively importantly during the compensatory growth stage mid august the physiological activity of maize intercropped with wheat was still significantly lower than that of maize monoculture totally the intercropping species did not affect the physiological activity of soybean and there was no significant difference between intercropping and monoculture table 1 similar results were obtained in both years compared with monoculture intercropping with soybean significantly increased ear length kernel number and kernel weight per ear while significantly decreased bare tip length and kernel abortion rate of maize specifically the kernel abortion rate was decreased by 25 4 and the grain number and grain weight were increased by 4 88 and 18 06 table 2 compared with mono cropped wheat intercropping with soybean significantly increased spike length kernel number kernel weight and effective spike number by 19 08 12 90 11 11 and 7 43 respectively at the same time the intercropping with maize also significantly improved wheat spike length kernel number kernel weight and effective spike number by 16 9 10 8 12 3 and 4 6 however the intercropping with wheat significantly lowered ear length kernel number and kernel weight by 9 2 11 5 and 21 9 respectively while significantly promoting bald tip length and abortion rate of maize by 29 5 and 14 9 respectively 3 5 soil water storage and water use efficiency in general soil water storage and water use varied from cropping patterns the dynamics of soil water storage in each crop strip across the whole growth period showed that the intercropping with soybean significantly enhanced soil water storage of 0 100 cm soil layer in the maize and wheat strips fig 6 before august soil water storage decreased most in wheat strips especially in monocultures compared with maize and soybeans however during the co growth period soil water storage ub maize strips intercropped with wheat was significantly lower than that of maize monocultured and intercropped with soybean also the intercropping with soybean significantly improved the 0 100 cm sws of either wheat or maize strip by 10 6 and 11 0 respectively during co growth period fig 6 table 3 however both wheat maize and wheat soybean intercropping significantly lessened the sws in the maize and soybean strips while increasing the sws in the wheat strip in mid june and late july importantly in mid september we found no significant difference in soil water storage between maize strips intercropped with wheat and maize monoculture one in 2019 except that even significantly higher sws in the 0 40 cm soil layer was found relative to maize monoculture strip in 2020 totally there was no significant difference in sws in maize strips between maize wheat and maize soybean intercropping after maize was harvested fig 6 and table 3 finally compared with monoculture the intercropping with soybean significantly elevated maize and wheat biomass and yield also the shoot biomass of maize and wheat increased by 17 7 19 5 and 17 6 19 8 respectively while the yield improved by 15 3 18 6 and 18 3 20 92 respectively in both growing seasons particularly both biomass wue and yield wue of either maize or wheat when intercropped with soybean were also significantly enhanced it was noted that the maize wheat intercropping decreased maize yield by 15 8 21 9 table 3 as a result maize biomass and yield wue in the intercropping with wheat was lowered 4 discussion 4 1 competition and mutual benefit among three crops conventionally a key challenge for ecologists and plant scientists is to shorten the gap between ecological principles and applications in agroecosystems greater land use advantage is expected with greater temporal spatial niche differentiation because it may allow species to realize a greater relative yield due to complementary use of resources in time and space theoretically this phenomenon is defined as compensation effect li et al 1999 yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the post harvest crops can obtain high growth compensation after the harvest of neighboring crops thus increasing or stabilizing the yield it was found that different species combinations resulted in different rii values of each species which ultimately resulted in different ler in this study the maize soybean and wheat soybean intercropping significantly promoted the relative productivity per unit area ler 1 while the maize wheat intercropping did not affect ler evidently this trend was different from the results of previous studies yin et al 2017 previous studies have shown that intercropping with legumes generally increased the productivity of neighboring crops and the maize wheat intercropping system also had the potential to increase yield fan et al 2020 liang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 this was mainly because legumes can provide nitrogen for neighboring crops and show compensation effects raza et al 2021 found that the maize soybean intercropping was a productive strategy to maximize water use efficiency this trend was similar as our findings while maize and wheat were stronger water competitor than soybean soybean growth has not been inhibited in this study the crops were not subjected to nitrogen and phosphorus competition since sufficient fertilizer were supplied therefore the yield increase of maize and wheat in the soybean involved intercropping systems was mainly resulted from compensatory use of soil water rather than nitrogen fixation and sharing of soybean to most extent the maize wheat intercropping system can obtain high ler by improving water use efficiency this was mainly because the separation of growth periods between two crops was beneficial to the compensatory utilization of groundwater resources yang et al 2011 during the co growth period wheat can use water from the maize strip to gain yield advantage while maize can gain soil water from the wheat strip by expanding its root system thus gaining compensatory growth after wheat was harvested ma et al 2019 during the co growth period of wheat and maize soil water in the maize strips can be utilized by wheat to achieve high yield however in this study maize did not increase yield through the compensation growth there are three main reasons why wheat maize intercropping system does not improve land equivalent ratio firstly some studies on intercropping systems were conducted in the arid areas with irrigation farming 400 800 mm of irrigation and the areas with annual rainfall of 500 mm where sufficient water diluted the competitive effect ahmed et al 2020 hu et al 2015 secondly it was probably responsible for crop water use traits wheat is a crop of high water consumption and rapid biomass accumulation which frequently results in high water competition for neighboring crops thirdly the compensation effect probably failed to make up for the loss of biomass due to competition the co growth period of wheat and maize covered the most time of maize vegetative growth period when the high competition effect may inhibit the growth ability of maize in the semiarid loess plateau of china the changes in sws was not only affected by crop planting but also was highly dependent on natural precipitation in this region over 70 of annual precipitation was accumulated on summer season i e from july to september in present study wheat was early mature crop and harvested at the late july after wheat was harvested more rainwater can be collected and stored in soil profile it was noted that while soil moisture in maize strips can be to some extent restored after wheat harvesting its physiological activity and instantaneous growth rate were still lower than that of monoculture 4 2 dynamics of growth trajectory and moisture dependent mechanisms affecting land productivity generally intercropping with legumes can improve growth rate of neighboring crops intercropping with peas improved the growth rate of maize hu et al 2020 which is consistent with the current data wheat inhibits maize growth rate during the co growth period and could recovers through later compensatory growth zhang et al 2017 this was attributed that wheat roots occupied the underground ecological niche belonging to maize in the co growth period leading to extracting resources and inhibiting the growth of maize however maize expands root coverage and improved water acquisition ability after wheat harvest ma et al 2019 our results showed that the growth rate of maize was significantly inhibited by wheat at the early growth stage although the growth rate of maize was higher than wheat at later growth stage but it was still lower than that of monoculture indicating that the compensation effect did not improve the growth capacity of maize in present study the dynamics of soil moisture confirmed the sgh hypothesis that different species combinations influenced soil water content and water use efficiency in different crop strips in the soybean involved intercropping systems soil water content and productivity of adjacent plant bands tended to increase which contributed to improve water use efficiency raza et al 2021 this trend was also found in the results of the maize soybean and wheat soybean intercropping systems in our study in the co growth period with wheat soil water storage in the maize strip was significantly lowered fig 6 and table 3 on the other hand the root weight of maize in 0 30 cm soil layer also decreased significantly when intercropped with wheat while the root weight of wheat turned to increase the data confirmed that wheat can utilize more water in the maize strips during the co growth period and suppress the growth and development of maize root system while soil water storage in the maize strips recovered after wheat was harvested the physiological activity and instantaneous growth rate of maize were not affected evidently particularly they were found to be lower than those of monocropping without any improvement on water use efficiency fig 6 and table 3 this trend suggested that the compensation effect was not only dependent on the resource availability for the late harvesting crop after the early sowing crop was harvested but also on the gap of growth rhythm at the co growth period if the loss of growth during the co growth period cannot be compensated in the late follow up period the intercropping would not increase land equivalent ratio especially in semiarid agroecosystems when the superior species showed a pronounced advantage of water capture over inferior one high intensity interspecific competition frequently enabled the compensation effect difficult to occur at the late sole growth period 4 3 carbon assimilation and final yield formation existing knowledge shows that leaf photosynthetic and physiological characteristics are the critical indicators for yield formation the intercropping with legumes can improve leaf area index leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic rate in maize or wheat compared with the corresponding monoculture feng et al 2020 zhang et al 2014 although the photosynthetic capacity of maize in the co growth period was inhibited by wheat maize still can quickly recover after wheat was harvested this process help improve its photosynthetic capacity as a result of compensatory growth li et al 2020a 2020b ma et al 2020 however the photosynthetic capacity of intercropped maize did not recover after wheat was harvest and instead it remained significantly lower than that of monoculture table 1 during the co growth period with wheat more resources water and nutrients were consumed by wheat which significantly affected the physiological activity of maize leaves particularly at the later period to say the compensation effect was not observed to cover the loss at the late stages as presented in the above the growth and yield loss of maize was not compensated as expected and maize growth and reproduction were to some extent damaged specifically the intercropping with wheat significantly reduced maize ear length and increased bare tip length and kernel abortion rate during the reproductive period this trend significantly negatively affected final yield of maize resulting in a lower ler on the other hand wheat indeed benefited from competition as a superior species for high yield harvest yet this advantage was to some extent offset by the greater loss in maize yield consequently resulting in no advantage in land use efficiency interestingly the result of this study was different from that of previous other studies chai et al 2014 li et al 2001 zhang et al 2017 this was mainly because most of these studies were conducted in the irrigated regions rather than in the rainfed ones in semi arid rainfed regions annual rainfall was frequently less than 450 mm where the land use advantage of wheat maize intercropping was not evident or even negative to most extent soil water availability was the key factor affecting yield formation of maize as shown in fig 7 the intercropping with soybean significantly increased the photosynthetic capacity instantaneous growth rate and yield of both maize and wheat this trend was in turn beneficial to improve wue as a result of significant positive interaction it was noted that low soil water status stimulated the occurrence of interspecific competition in maize wheat intercropping as such the photosynthetic capacity biomass accumulation and yield of maize were evidently inhibited during the co growth period and eventually lowered wue while wheat was the beneficiary from this competition the increased harvest was offset by the yield loss of maize fig 7 critically the compensatory growth of maize was not observed after wheat was harvested in contrast the inhibitive effect on maize growth further affected the late reproduction growth during the co growth period in this case interspecific competition significantly increased the seed abortion rate and bald tip length thus resulting in final yield loss and lower land equivalent ratio 5 conclusion as presented in this study crop diversity is not always beneficial for promoting productivity at farmland landscape scale unreasonable crop diversification arrangement may not improve land equivalent ratio in this study the maize soybean and wheat soybean intercropping systems displayed positive interactions with one positive and one neutral 0 and its ler was significantly greater than 1 yet the maize wheat intercropping system showed a competitive relationship with one positive and one negative and its ler was non significantly difference with 1 during the co growth period wheat was the dominant species with high growth rates and water deprivation in the maize strip resulting in high yields in this study the loss of maize growth caused by competition was not compensated for higher total yield ler across two growing seasons as soil water was the main limiting factor in semi arid region the water competition during the co growth period not only significantly reduced the biomass accumulation rate and photosynthetic capacity of maize but also depressed the grain yield potential of maize by increasing the bare tip length and abortion rate this ultimately resulted in yield loss of intercropped maize and the further decrease of total ler in contrast the soybean involved intercropping systems turned to display the potentials of water compensation use in which either wheat or maize improved water use efficiency and productivity in this case the ler can be improved accordingly in conclusion it is needed to rationally optimize intercropping species composition and strategically reduce interspecific competition as a result of enhanced water compensation effect this can act as a critical ecological pathway to realize high yield output in semi arid agricultural

challenge for humans in the 21st century wang et al 2018 the main grain crops produced in the north china plain ncp are winter wheat and summer maize due to the serious shortage of natural precipitation during the winter wheat cropping season supplementary irrigation is necessary to obtain high and stable gy fan et al 2019 the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall and the continuous reduction of irrigation water resources pose a strong challenge to stable grain production in the region and threaten national food security kang et al 2017 conservation tillage strategies

efficient water use and sustainable agricultural development the winter wheat summer maize planting system is the most widespread cropping system in the ncp region yang et al 2014 the area under conservation tillage in the ncp remained at around 2800 khm2 from 2012 to 2017 and increased significantly to 3278 khm2 in 2018 du et al 2020 the traditional tillage method is rotary tillage of the topsoil layer 0 15 cm kuang et al 2020 in this system different tillage methods are usually used before planting winter wheat however under long term cultivation the disadvantages of shallow soil gradually become apparent wang et al 2019 further long term single rotary tillage and agricultural machinery movement aggravated the deterioration of soil surface structure and the average surface depth decreased zhang and li 2010 indeed long term rotary tillage generally leads to the formation of a plow pan that hinders vertical elongation of roots moreira et al 2016 yu et al 2016 furthermore soil compaction prevents water infiltration into the soil and soil water and fertilizer retention ability are significantly reduced under these conditions resulting in adverse effects on plant growth and development and ultimately reducing gy sang et al 2016 researchers have compared tillage practices in the ncp such as no tillage reduced tillage and subsoiling and found that subsoiling effectively breaks plow pans thus improving topsoil structure by reducing bulk density lampurlanés et al 2016 sun et al 2018 increasing soil porosity ren et al 2018a and effectively enhancing water infiltration bogunovic et al 2018 kaur and arora 2019 alternatively subsoiling also improves the use of soil water by crops zhang et al 2018 studies have shown that subsoiling under stable soil conditions alleviated the effects of drought stress on crops improved soil productivity potential and increased gy by approximately 20 schneider et al 2017 further compared with traditional tillage subsoiling improved soil nutrient use efficiency and cwp and promoted crop growth and development zhang et al 2017 also showed that subsoiling increased the connectivity of soil macropores consistently zhai et al 2017 showed that subsoiling increased nutrient accumulation and soil water content which did not reduce drought stress but provided a more favorable soil environment for root growth and high gy studies by yu et al 2016 and xue et al 2019 showed that subsoiling promoted the growth of crop roots utilized deep soil nutrients and water and improved nutrient content and cwp increasing soil carbon sequestration potential is of great significance for reducing carbon emissions chen et al 2015 and contributing to global carbon balance gao et al 2018 the change in soil organic carbon depends not only on carbon input from crop residues and fertilizers but also on carbon loss through co2 emissions as well dong et al 2009 conservation tillage whereby crop residues remain on the soil surface is one of the most effective agricultural strategies for sequestering atmospheric carbon lugato et al 2014 subsoiling is important for sustainable agriculture in national

water consumption through the coupling effect of carbon uptake and et keenan et al 2013 there is a lack of information on the effects of combined factors to evaluate crop water and carbon emission

experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2021 in the fields of the experimental station of shandong agricultural university 36 10 9 n 117 9 3 e this region represents the main area of winter wheat cropping in the ncp seeds are generally sown in early october and harvest is performed in early june the previous crop before the experiment was summer maize the region has a warm monsoon influenced sub humid continental climate with an average annual temperature of 12 9 relative humidity of 50 and an average cumulative sunshine duration of 2461 h per year during the winter wheat growing seasons of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the total seasonal rainfall was 206 3 and 226 4 mm respectively rainfall and air temperature during the study period are shown in fig 1 we used the same wheat maize cropping system commonly used in cereal crop production in the ncp the soil in the experimental field is a loam without any irrigation during summer maize growing seasons soil organic matter content on a weight basis was 1 4 soil available phosphorus and potassium in the experimental field were 86 73 and 85 36 mg kg respectively in the 0 20 cm soil layer the most common farming method in this area is rotary tillage since 2004 the experimental field has been continuously sown under rotary tillage as a result a solid and impermeable plow pan was evident and the surface layer became shallower over the years therefore in the beginning of 2016 subsoiling was applied in half of the experimental field 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid in a split plot design with tillage method in the main plots 15 cm deep rotary tillage r and 35 cm deep subsoiling s applied before winter wheat sowing and irrigation amount in the subplots no irrigation i0 60 mm irrigation only at jointing stage i1 and 60 mm irrigation at jointing stage and 60 mm at heading stage i2 irrigation was applied as sprinkler irrigation water was supplied from a pump outlet near the experimental plots and piped to them water metering devices were used to strictly control water flow during irrigation the size of the experimental field was 60 m 18 m each treatment was applied to an area of 18 m 4 m with an additional guard row the winter wheat variety used in the experiment was jimai 22 a variety widely planted in the ncp for its high tillering capacity with a tiller formation rate of approximately 54 4 i e percentage of effective tillers relative to the total number of tillers winter wheat was planted in rows spaced 24 0 cm apart at a rate of 105 kg ha three repetitions for each treatment were included

conducted biennially on october 6 2016 october 8 2018 and september 25 2020 before winter wheat planting 5 24 g m2 of pure phosphorus 11 2 g m2 of pure nitrogen and 8 68 g m2 of pure potassium were applied to the soil an additional 11 2 g m2 of pure nitrogen was applied at jointing stage insects were intensively controlled using chemicals to avoid yield losses on account of pest incidence during the two year experimental period winter wheat was sown on october 8 2019 and october 8 2020 and harvested on june 4 2020 and on june 9 2021 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil water content soil volumetric

beijing china with an air measuring chamber containing a pvc tube 12 cm high and 25 cm in diameter at the time of co2 determination the measured surface of the soil must remain intact typical sunny

to conduct multiple comparisons to allow separation of treatment means 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and evapotranspiration fig 2 shows soil water storage of winter wheat in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 under different treatments at seeding jointing heading and grain filling stages in turn fig 3 shows et during both growing seasons in both the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons soil water content was significantly higher in the subsoiling treated plots than in those under rotary tillage treatment at the same irrigation level compared with r i0 s i0 increased sws by 6 32 and 4 99 in the first and second growing season respectively similarly compared with r i1 s i1 increased sws by 4 91 and 2 87 respectively and compared with r i2 s i2 increased sws by 3 11 and 4 63 respectively at the jointing stage sws under subsoiling was 2 78 and 10 28 higher than under rotary tillage in both the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons respectively furthermore at heading sws under subsoiling again was 5 74 and 2 46 higher than that under rotary tillage in the first and second growing seasons respectively compared with i0 sws under i1 and i2 treatments increased by 5 05 and 8 63 respectively in addition compared with that of subsoiling water consumption increased by 8 50 and 1 74 respectively under rotary tillage in general water consumption increased with increasing irrigation amount and it was 15 97 and 38 69 higher in i2 than in i1 and i0 respectively indeed water consumption in the r i2 treatment was significantly higher than that of any other treatment in both growing seasons followed by the s i2 treatment furthermore water consumption of r i2 significantly increased by 7 80 and 3 69 compared with s i2 treatment in the first and second growing seasons respectively years of continuous rotary tillage can result in shallow topsoil layers due to the development of plow pans that reduce soil aeration and permeability zhang and li 2010 however subsoiling can effectively break plow pans thereby reducing the bulk density of the topsoil layer significantly zhai et al 2021 effectively improving soil porosity increasing the number of soil aggregates enhancing sws and soil water infiltration capacity and consequently increasing deep soil water content and ultimately sws volume kuang et al 2021 soil water content varied with irrigation amount and rainfall precipitation during the summer maize growing season was 354 2 and 806 1 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively this significant difference in summer maize rainfall between the two years caused a large difference in sws during the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat cropping seasons with average soil water content during the 2020 2021 winter wheat growing season being higher than that during the corresponding 2019 2020 season 3 2 soil carbon storage and soil carbon accumulation rate table 1 shows cstock and cacc for the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons in both growing seasons the cstock in the 0 40 cm soil layer was significantly higher in subsoiling than in rotary tillage by 6 78 and 7 94 respectively meanwhile cacc was significantly increased by 32 98 under subsoiling compared with rotary tillage moderate irrigation achieved a greater carbon accumulation effect wang et al 2014a further cstock increased with increasing irrigation amount during both growth periods thus cstock was significantly higher by 6 78 and 8 58 respectively under i2 relative to i0 and there was no significant difference between i1 and i2 in addition compared with i0 cacc of i1 and i2 were significantly increased by 30 06 and 50 29 respectively therefore our two year experiment showed that s i2 was the best treatment for cstock enrichment followed by s i1 soil organic carbon fixation was mainly affected by crop management ghimire et al 2017 different tillage methods caused soil disturbance to different extents thus differentially affecting soil structure and aeration wu et al 2009 and consequently soil microbial effects on the regulation of the process of mineralization of soil organic carbon and ultimately on soil organic carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential li et al 2018 xue et al 2018 reported that soil aggregates protected soil organic carbon from rapid decomposition and increased soil organic carbon content rotary tillage can directly destroy the structure of soil aggregates thus promoting soil erosion by the external environment furthermore it can reduce the number and stability of large soil aggregates consequently the loss of physical protection of soil organic carbon aggregates accelerates the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic carbon chen et al 2009 in contrast to the grinding of surface soil by rotary tillage subsoiling only caused small disturbance to the soil which protected soil aggregates increased the stability of soil aggregates reduced the decomposition of organic matter in aggregates reduced the mineralization rate of soil organic carbon and increased topsoil organic carbon content li et al 2021b shen et al 2021 irrigation presumably increases soc dad and abdollahi 2021 reduces soil water deficit changes soil physical and chemical properties and impacts microbial activity overall these effects change the characteristics and spatial distribution of organic carbon in the soil kumar et al 2021 additionally irrigation improved aboveground productivity and root growth increased input sources of soil organic carbon and soil carbon components li et al 2020 the main causes of soil organic carbon accumulation were the continuous input of aboveground and underground biomass and the improvement of soil aggregates wei et al 2013 subsoiling increased carbon accumulation by increasing soil organic carbon content which improved soil fertility vilkiene et al 2016 the soil was tilled at greater depth under subsoiling conditions which promoted crop root growth xue et al 2019 in addition ansari and sadeghi 2021 indicated that crop roots contain more organic carbon than straw and roots had a significant carbon sequestration effect which was an important source of carbon in deep soil therefore subsoiling provided more carbon sources for deep soil tian et al 2016 found that long term no tillage rotation and rotary tillage conversion into subsoiling were beneficial to the improvement of soil carbon accumulation in north china ultimately increasing gy 3 3 soil carbon dioxide emission fig 4 shows the data for ce during the winter wheat growing seasons of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 while fig s1 shows the data on soil respiration rate in both growing seasons at seeding jointing heading and filling stages in both growing seasons ce was significantly higher in subsoiling treatments than in rotary tillage treatments by 18 93 and 16 95 in the two subsequent copping seasons respectively compared with i0 ce increased significantly by 8 89 and 9 52 under i1 in the two seasons respectively while it significantly increased under i2 by 10 30 and 11 55 respectively however there was no significant difference in ce between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments under rotary tillage in either year soil respiration is the main pathway for co2 release back to the atmosphere from terrestrial plants after photosynthetic fixation nielsen et al 2019 tillage and irrigation have significant effects on soil respiration tu et al 2017 further among environmental factors soil temperature and humidity affect soil respiration mostly zhang et al 2015 specifically tillage mode can directly affect the soil by changing its structure leading to changes in the three phase ratio of soil analyzed herein thereby causing changes in soil temperature and humidity in addition soil tillage can bring straw residues into the deep soil and increase soil organic matter content li et al 2021c compared with rotary tillage subsoiling increased the amount of straw in the deep soil while rotary tillage exposed the soil to the atmosphere and increased the mineralization of surface soc cong et al 2020 hu et al 2021 soil respiration rate provides a direct estimate of plant root and microbial activities wang et al 2014b zhao et al 2018 furthermore the total contribution of plant roots to soil respiration is 48 5 skopp et al 1990 the improvement of leaf area index under subsoiling promotes the capture of light by canopy and thus improved photosynthetic efficiency yu et al 2019a photosynthetic products of plants were transported to the root region to provide sufficient nutrition for root growth and promote root growth and development thus enhancing root respiration scandellari et al 2015 simpson et al 2020 studies by wang et al 2021 and yin et al 2021 showed that subsoiling significantly improved crop root density and activity and stronger root conditions improved soil respiration rate valenzuela balcazar et al 2022 and xu et al 2020 confirmed that irrigation had a significant impact on crop root respiration rate concomitantly organic matter from the plant body releases organic carbon into the soil through root exudates which increases the substrate for soil microbial respiration lopez sangil et al 2017 adamczyk et al 2021 irrigation affects the production and emission of soil co2 which is closely related to soil water content chen et al 2018 guo et al 2019b soc is the main source of energy and nutrients required by soil microbial activities irrigation increases soil moisture enhances soil microbial populations and microbial activities and accelerates the turnover of soil organic matter thus increasing the amount of co2 emitted to the atmosphere from the soil carbon pool through soil respiration schipper et al 2019 in this study ce was s i2 s i1 s i0 under subsoiling during both growing seasons indeed 120 mm irrigation i2 in the winter wheat season is still insufficient irrigation for winter wheat in the conditions of the ncp region fan et al 2019 in this case soil respiration rate is positively correlated with soil moisture and ce will increase with increasing irrigation amount yan et al 2014 yang et al 2018 additionally irrigation affected the distribution of soil water increased soil heat capacity and reduced the impact of air temperature on soil temperature thus delaying the impact of air temperature on soil temperature zhao et al 2022 irrigation at jointing stage of winter wheat reduced soil temperature difference between day and night promoted wheat root growth and maintained higher root activity and respiration rate positive relationships between temperature and soil respiration rate are widely observed thurgood et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 showed that increases in both soil temperature and soil moisture significantly promoted the soil respiration rate and cumulative co2 emissions which may be due to the acceleration of decomposition of soil organic matter with the increase of soil moisture and temperature conversely rotary tillage had little effect on annual mean soil temperature while subsoiling might increase the annual temperature variation in wheat fields which mainly shows that subsoiling may conveniently reduce soil temperature in winter inhibit ineffective consumption while it may conveniently increase soil temperature in summer thereby promoting root growth xie et al 2015 yin et al 2015 compared with rotary tillage the depth of subsoiling improved the physical properties of deep soil which in turn promoted root penetration and improved root system development which further improved root respiration effects and root carbon emissions under subsoiling muller et al 2020 our results showed that subsoiling significantly increased ce there are two possible reasons for the improvement of soil respiration under subsoiling firstly subsoiling improves soil permeability accelerates the migration and diffusion of gas through the soil he et al 2019 and promotes organic matter decomposition which reflects as an increase in soil respiration rate li et al 2019 secondly subsoiling breaks the plow pans promotes root growth xue et al 2019 zhai et al 2017 and thus enhances root respiration rate as the soil respiration mainly consists of root respiration and microbial respiration borden et al 2021 meanwhile exudates generated by root growth promote rhizosphere soil microbial respiration adamczyk et al 2021 any increase in soil microbial respiration further increases overall soil respiration rate 3 4 grain yield carbon emission efficiency and crop water productivity table 2 shows gy cee and cwp during the winter wheat growing seasons in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 irrigation and tillage methods had significant effects on gy in both growing seasons gy in subsoiled plots was significantly higher by 25 31 and 26 65 each year respectively than that of plots treated with rotary tillage meanwhile irrigation significantly increased winter wheat gy thus compared with i0 i1 and i2 significantly increased gy by 31 26 and 48 45 respectively additionally cee was significantly higher by 5 09 and 8 10 in the subsoiling treatment than in the rotary tillage treatment each year respectively consistently cwp was significantly higher by 37 07 and 28 95 under subsoiling than under rotary tillage each year respectively consistent with previous studies in our experiments gy of winter wheat grown under the subsoiling treatment remained at a high level sang et al 2016 liang et al 2019 during plant growth water directly affects the quality of root growth and root development as well as the ability of the aboveground parts of the plant to transport and to assimilate nutrients thus affecting the growth and development of the aboveground plant body in contrast to rotary tillage subsoiling helps improve soil permeability and saturated water conductivity which contributes to soil moisture conservation and improvement of drought resistance he et al 2019 thereby promoting crop growth and gy in addition subsoiling enhances root health and promotes vigorous root growth for penetration into deeper soil yu et al 2016 xue et al 2019 which is conducive to the absorption of more nutrients and water thereby providing the physiological basis for further promotion of plant growth and development and crop performance for greater gy in addition compared with rotary tillage subsoiling can delay the senescence of the wheat root system yu et al 2019a after flowering the activities of superoxide dismutase and nitrate reductase increased in the 0 40 cm soil layer under subsoiling while the content of malondialdehyde decreased in roots which was beneficial for root metabolism and antioxidant capacity and promoted the absorption and utilization of soil water and nutrients by roots haghighi 2012 guo et al 2018 karpets et al 2018 yu et al 2019b subsoiling provides an adequate environment for root development thus promoting plant aboveground growth and development to form proper plant community structure increase light interception prolong the life of functional leaves maintain higher leaf area index in late stages of crop growth yu et al 2019a increase stomata opening and improve leaf intercellular co2 concentration thereby increasing net photosynthetic rate and ultimately gy lamptey et al 2020 wu et al 2020 improving crop cwp is at the core of realizing potential efficient water use in water shortage areas cwp is the result of the quantitative coupling of carbon and water absorption therefore rather than ensuring stable or increased gy crop ce and water consumption involved in the production process should be the main focus to attain sustainable agricultural development improving carbon and cwp of crop plants is a top priority for future agricultural development in our experiment the r i2 treatment was the best in terms of cee followed by s i2 and s i1 with no significant difference between s i2 and s i1 however farmers cannot pursue low carbon emissions and water use at the expense of reduced yields as this runs counter to the goal of intensive and efficient agriculture on the other hand in terms of cwp s i1 was the best treatment and significantly higher than any other whereby it can be recommended for effectively and efficiently using water and reducing carbon emissions while promoting crop growth nonetheless the differences in soil temperature caused by different tillage and irrigation methods require further study to determine whether they affect root distribution and nutrient uptake which in turn would presumably affect crop aboveground growth and carbon emissions while the co2 equivalent n2o emissions should also be considered in addition it is necessary to further study the effects of subsoiling and irrigation on different winter wheat varieties to promote sustainable agricultural development 4 conclusion compared with rotary tillage subsoiling significantly increased carbon emissions while significantly reducing evapotranspiration furthermore it effectively increased soil carbon storage and carbon accumulation rate while improving winter wheat grain yield carbon emission efficiency and crop water productivity compared with i1 i2 significantly increased water consumption but there was no significant difference in soil carbon storage between the two treatments during our two year study s i1 effectively regulated water consumption by the system and improved grain yield with high carbon emission efficiency and significantly higher crop water productivity than any other treatment therefore s i1 treatment is more efficient in converting water consumption into winter wheat grain yield thus achieving true crop efficient water productivity therefore the combination of subsoiling and a single 60 mm irrigation at the jointing stage is an effective crop management strategy to stable and high winter wheat grain yield improve carbon emission efficiency and crop water productivity of the winter wheat in the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9473,higher water efficiency and higher carbon efficiency are important goals of sustainable agricultural development however long term rotary tillage has a negative impact on soil resulting in a reduction of soil water availability and an increasing severity of water shortage for crop production in addition to which china faces a sharp increase in global carbon emissions ce which are likely to rise even further as a result of current global warming trends subsoiling is an effective measure to improve soil surface structure further appropriate irrigation management can improve grain yield gy we conducted field trials in the north china plain ncp from 2019 to 2021 to investigate the combined effects of 35 cm subsoiling s and rotary tillage to a 15 cm depth r in combination with no

significantly higher than for any other treatment these results suggest that subsoiling to a depth of 35 cm in combination with 60 mm irrigation at jointing improved cee and cwp of winter wheat in the ncp keywords soil water storage soil respiration evapotranspiration carbon accumulation yield 1 introduction the increase in atmospheric co2 concentration as considered one of the main causes of global warming cao and yuan 2019 ying et al 2019 furthermore because of such increase the global average surface temperature on earth will presumably increase 0 3 4 8 over the next few decades ipcc 2013 and the combined effect of the increase of global co2 and temperature will significantly impact agriculture and crop production shimono et al 2010 negatively by increasing potential evapotranspiration pet thereby reducing soil water availability for plant growth consequently the demand for irrigation water will increase and most likely plant crop water productivity cwp will decrease chavas et al 2009 food shortages are already becoming an increasingly severe problem globally eitelberg et al 2015 in addition with climate change and rapid human population growth alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 making food production targets even more difficult to attain gamage et al 2018 therefore achieving low carbon emissions and high grain yield gy has become a major challenge for humans in the 21st century wang et al 2018 the main grain crops produced in the north china plain ncp are winter wheat and summer maize due to the serious shortage of natural precipitation during the winter wheat cropping season supplementary irrigation is necessary to obtain high and stable gy fan et al 2019 the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall and the continuous reduction of irrigation water resources pose a strong challenge to stable grain production in the region and threaten national food security kang et al 2017 conservation tillage strategies e g low tillage and subsoil tillage are better at regulating soil water transport and consumption than rotary tillage thus increasing gy bogunovic et al 2018 which is of great significance to realize efficient water use and sustainable agricultural development the winter wheat summer maize planting system is the most widespread cropping system in the ncp region yang et al 2014 the area under conservation tillage in the ncp remained at around 2800 khm2 from 2012 to 2017 and increased significantly to 3278 khm2 in 2018 du et al 2020 the traditional tillage method is rotary tillage of the topsoil layer 0 15 cm kuang et al 2020 in this system different tillage methods are usually used before planting winter wheat however under long term cultivation the disadvantages of shallow soil gradually become apparent wang et al 2019 further long term single rotary tillage and agricultural machinery movement aggravated the deterioration of soil surface structure and the average surface depth decreased zhang and li 2010 indeed long term rotary tillage generally leads to the formation of a plow pan that hinders vertical elongation of roots moreira et al 2016 yu et al 2016 furthermore soil compaction prevents water infiltration into the soil and soil water and fertilizer retention ability are significantly reduced under these conditions resulting in adverse effects on plant growth and development and ultimately reducing gy sang et al 2016 researchers have compared tillage practices in the ncp such as no tillage reduced tillage and subsoiling and found that subsoiling effectively breaks plow pans thus improving topsoil structure by reducing bulk density lampurlanés et al 2016 sun et al 2018 increasing soil porosity ren et al 2018a and effectively enhancing water infiltration bogunovic et al 2018 kaur and arora 2019 alternatively subsoiling also improves the use of soil water by crops zhang et al 2018 studies have shown that subsoiling under stable soil conditions alleviated the effects of drought stress on crops improved soil productivity potential and increased gy by approximately 20 schneider et al 2017 further compared with traditional tillage subsoiling improved soil nutrient use efficiency and cwp and promoted crop growth and development zhang et al 2017 also showed that subsoiling increased the connectivity of soil macropores consistently zhai et al 2017 showed that subsoiling increased nutrient accumulation and soil water content which did not reduce drought stress but provided a more favorable soil environment for root growth and high gy studies by yu et al 2016 and xue et al 2019 showed that subsoiling promoted the growth of crop roots utilized deep soil nutrients and water and improved nutrient content and cwp increasing soil carbon sequestration potential is of great significance for reducing carbon emissions chen et al 2015 and contributing to global carbon balance gao et al 2018 the change in soil organic carbon depends not only on carbon input from crop residues and fertilizers but also on carbon loss through co2 emissions as well dong et al 2009 conservation tillage whereby crop residues remain on the soil surface is one of the most effective agricultural strategies for sequestering atmospheric carbon lugato et al 2014 subsoiling is important for sustainable agriculture in national cleaner production programs but the relationship between crop water consumption and soil carbon emission ce is complex under field conditions cwp is an important factor affecting carbon uptake and water consumption through the coupling effect of carbon uptake and et keenan et al 2013 there is a lack of information on the effects of combined factors to evaluate crop water and carbon emission efficiency cee in winter wheat production we hypothesized that subsoiling combined with irrigation at winter wheat jointing or heading stages could increase soil moisture and maintain increased soil water storage sws and soil carbon storage cstock in the winter wheat growing season thereby increasing gy cwp and cee therefore in this study we combined four key factors related to water consumption and carbon emissions gy cwp cee and carbon accumulation rate cacc the objectives of our study were 1 to study the effects of subsoiling on ce and water consumption 2 to study the effects of different irrigation amounts on gy of winter wheat under subsoiling conditions and 3 to study the effects of tillage and irrigation on cwp cee and cacc we expect to establish a relatively optimal management strategy that allows for a substantial reduction of carbon emissions significant water savings and no negative impact on stable and high winter wheat gy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2021 in the fields of the experimental station of shandong agricultural university 36 10 9 n 117 9 3 e this region represents the main area of winter wheat cropping in the ncp seeds are generally sown in early october and harvest is performed in early june the previous crop before the experiment was summer maize the region has a warm monsoon influenced sub humid continental climate with an average annual temperature of 12 9 relative humidity of 50 and an average cumulative sunshine duration of 2461 h per year during the winter wheat growing seasons of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the total seasonal rainfall was 206 3 and 226 4 mm respectively rainfall and air temperature during the study period are shown in fig 1 we used the same wheat maize cropping system commonly used in cereal crop production in the ncp the soil in the experimental field is a loam without any irrigation during summer maize growing seasons soil organic matter content on a weight basis was 1 4 soil available phosphorus and potassium in the experimental field were 86 73 and 85 36 mg kg respectively in the 0 20 cm soil layer the most common farming method in this area is rotary tillage since 2004 the experimental field has been continuously sown under rotary tillage as a result a solid and impermeable plow pan was evident and the surface layer became shallower over the years therefore in the beginning of 2016 subsoiling was applied in half of the experimental field 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid in a split plot design with tillage method in the main plots 15 cm deep rotary tillage r and 35 cm deep subsoiling s applied before winter wheat sowing and irrigation amount in the subplots no irrigation i0 60 mm irrigation only at jointing stage i1 and 60 mm irrigation at jointing stage and 60 mm at heading stage i2 irrigation was applied as sprinkler irrigation water was supplied from a pump outlet near the experimental plots and piped to them water metering devices were used to strictly control water flow during irrigation the size of the experimental field was 60 m 18 m each treatment was applied to an area of 18 m 4 m with an additional guard row the winter wheat variety used in the experiment was jimai 22 a variety widely planted in the ncp for its high tillering capacity with a tiller formation rate of approximately 54 4 i e percentage of effective tillers relative to the total number of tillers winter wheat was planted in rows spaced 24 0 cm apart at a rate of 105 kg ha three repetitions for each treatment were included in the harvest period of summer maize the ears of summer maize were harvested artificially after that the summer maize straw is then pulverized using a straw returning machine 180 f maschio agricultural machinery manufacturing co ltd qingdao china which spreads the crushed straw evenly across the surface of the field subsoiling at 35 cm was performed in the corresponding plots using a vibrating subsoiler zs 180 yuncheng county labor co ltd heze china prior to winter wheat sowing all plots were tilled to a 15 cm depth using a rotavator c250 maschio agricultural machinery manufacturing co ltd qingdao china after the whole experimental area was tilled a wheat high precision planter 2bjk 6 yuncheng county labor co ltd heze china was used for sowing subsoiling was conducted biennially on october 6 2016 october 8 2018 and september 25 2020 before winter wheat planting 5 24 g m2 of pure phosphorus 11 2 g m2 of pure nitrogen and 8 68 g m2 of pure potassium were applied to the soil an additional 11 2 g m2 of pure nitrogen was applied at jointing stage insects were intensively controlled using chemicals to avoid yield losses on account of pest incidence during the two year experimental period winter wheat was sown on october 8 2019 and october 8 2020 and harvested on june 4 2020 and on june 9 2021 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil water content soil volumetric

is the change in sws capacity in 0 130 cm soil profiles between the beginning and the end of winter wheat season mm d is the downward flux below the crop root zone mm but underground water level was more than 5 m in our study therefore w and d were negligible moiwo et al 2015 zhao et al 2021 r is surface runoff mm however as there were beds around each plot no surface runoff was allowed to occur

beijing china with an air measuring chamber containing a pvc tube 12 cm high and 25 cm in diameter at the time of co2 determination the measured surface of the soil must remain intact typical sunny days were selected for measurements which were made between 9 00 and 11 00 h each measurement made at a fixed location took 2 min co2 c cumulative emissions were calculated as follows guo et al 2019a

determine treatment effects at a significance level of α 0 05 where significant differences were observed post hoc least significant difference lsd tests and duncan multiple range test dmrt were used to conduct multiple comparisons to allow separation of treatment means 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water content and evapotranspiration fig 2 shows soil water storage of winter wheat in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 under different treatments at seeding jointing heading and grain filling stages in turn fig 3 shows et during both growing seasons in both the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons soil water content was significantly higher in the subsoiling treated plots than in those under rotary tillage treatment at the same irrigation level compared with r i0 s i0 increased sws by 6 32 and 4 99 in the first and second growing season respectively similarly compared with r i1 s i1 increased sws by 4 91 and 2 87 respectively and compared with r i2 s i2 increased sws by 3 11 and 4 63 respectively at the jointing stage sws under subsoiling was 2 78 and 10 28 higher than under rotary tillage in both the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons respectively furthermore at heading sws under subsoiling again was 5 74 and 2 46 higher than that under rotary tillage in the first and second growing seasons respectively compared with i0 sws under i1 and i2 treatments increased by 5 05 and 8 63 respectively in addition compared with that of subsoiling water consumption increased by 8 50 and 1 74 respectively under rotary tillage in general water consumption increased with increasing irrigation amount and it was 15 97 and 38 69 higher in i2 than in i1 and i0 respectively indeed water consumption in the r i2 treatment was significantly higher than that of any other treatment in both growing seasons followed by the s i2 treatment furthermore water consumption of r i2 significantly increased by 7 80 and 3 69 compared with s i2 treatment in the first and second growing seasons respectively years of continuous rotary tillage can result in shallow topsoil layers due to the development of plow pans that reduce soil aeration and permeability zhang and li 2010 however subsoiling can effectively break plow pans thereby reducing the bulk density of the topsoil layer significantly zhai et al 2021 effectively improving soil porosity increasing the number of soil aggregates enhancing sws and soil water infiltration capacity and consequently increasing deep soil water content and ultimately sws volume kuang et al 2021 soil water content varied with irrigation amount and rainfall precipitation during the summer maize growing season was 354 2 and 806 1 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively this significant difference in summer maize rainfall between the two years caused a large difference in sws during the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat cropping seasons with average soil water content during the 2020 2021 winter wheat growing season being higher than that during the corresponding 2019 2020 season 3 2 soil carbon storage and soil carbon accumulation rate table 1 shows cstock and cacc for the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat growing seasons in both growing seasons the cstock in the 0 40 cm soil layer was significantly higher in subsoiling than in rotary tillage by 6 78 and 7 94 respectively meanwhile cacc was significantly increased by 32 98 under subsoiling compared with rotary tillage moderate irrigation achieved a greater carbon accumulation effect wang et al 2014a further cstock increased with increasing irrigation amount during both growth periods thus cstock was significantly higher by 6 78 and 8 58 respectively under i2 relative to i0 and there was no significant difference between i1 and i2 in addition compared with i0 cacc of i1 and i2 were significantly increased by 30 06 and 50 29 respectively therefore our two year experiment showed that s i2 was the best treatment for cstock enrichment followed by s i1 soil organic carbon fixation was mainly affected by crop management ghimire et al 2017 different tillage methods caused soil disturbance to different extents thus differentially affecting soil structure and aeration wu et al 2009 and consequently soil microbial effects on the regulation of the process of mineralization of soil organic carbon and ultimately on soil organic carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential li et al 2018 xue et al 2018 reported that soil aggregates protected soil organic carbon from rapid decomposition and increased soil organic carbon content rotary tillage can directly destroy the structure of soil aggregates thus promoting soil erosion by the external environment furthermore it can reduce the number and stability of large soil aggregates consequently the loss of physical protection of soil organic carbon aggregates accelerates the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic carbon chen et al 2009 in contrast to the grinding of surface soil by rotary tillage subsoiling only caused small disturbance to the soil which protected soil aggregates increased the stability of soil aggregates reduced the decomposition of organic matter in aggregates reduced the mineralization rate of soil organic carbon and increased topsoil organic carbon content li et al 2021b shen et al 2021 irrigation presumably increases soc dad and abdollahi 2021 reduces soil water deficit changes soil physical and chemical properties and impacts microbial activity overall these effects change the characteristics and spatial distribution of organic carbon in the soil kumar et al 2021 additionally irrigation improved aboveground productivity and root growth increased input sources of soil organic carbon and soil carbon components li et al 2020 the main causes of soil organic carbon accumulation were the continuous input of aboveground and underground biomass and the improvement of soil aggregates wei et al 2013 subsoiling increased carbon accumulation by increasing soil organic carbon content which improved soil fertility vilkiene et al 2016 the soil was tilled at greater depth under subsoiling conditions which promoted crop root growth xue et al 2019 in addition ansari and sadeghi 2021 indicated that crop roots contain more organic carbon than straw and roots had a significant carbon sequestration effect which was an important source of carbon in deep soil therefore subsoiling provided more carbon sources for deep soil tian et al 2016 found that long term no tillage rotation and rotary tillage conversion into subsoiling were beneficial to the improvement of soil carbon accumulation in north china ultimately increasing gy 3 3 soil carbon dioxide emission fig 4 shows the data for ce during the winter wheat growing seasons of 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 while fig s1 shows the data on soil respiration rate in both growing seasons at seeding jointing heading and filling stages in both growing seasons ce was significantly higher in subsoiling treatments than in rotary tillage treatments by 18 93 and 16 95 in the two subsequent copping seasons respectively compared with i0 ce increased significantly by 8 89 and 9 52 under i1 in the two seasons respectively while it significantly increased under i2 by 10 30 and 11 55 respectively however there was no significant difference in ce between i1 and i2 irrigation treatments under rotary tillage in either year soil respiration is the main pathway for co2 release back to the atmosphere from terrestrial plants after photosynthetic fixation nielsen et al 2019 tillage and irrigation have significant effects on soil respiration tu et al 2017 further among environmental factors soil temperature and humidity affect soil respiration mostly zhang et al 2015 specifically tillage mode can directly affect the soil by changing its structure leading to changes in the three phase ratio of soil analyzed herein thereby causing changes in soil temperature and humidity in addition soil tillage can bring straw residues into the deep soil and increase soil organic matter content li et al 2021c compared with rotary tillage subsoiling increased the amount of straw in the deep soil while rotary tillage exposed the soil to the atmosphere and increased the mineralization of surface soc cong et al 2020 hu et al 2021 soil respiration rate provides a direct estimate of plant root and microbial activities wang et al 2014b zhao et al 2018 furthermore the total contribution of plant roots to soil respiration is 48 5 skopp et al 1990 the improvement of leaf area index under subsoiling promotes the capture of light by canopy and thus improved photosynthetic efficiency yu et al 2019a photosynthetic products of plants were transported to the root region to provide sufficient nutrition for root growth and promote root growth and development thus enhancing root respiration scandellari et al 2015 simpson et al 2020 studies by wang et al 2021 and yin et al 2021 showed that subsoiling significantly improved crop root density and activity and stronger root conditions improved soil respiration rate valenzuela balcazar et al 2022 and xu et al 2020 confirmed that irrigation had a significant impact on crop root respiration rate concomitantly organic matter from the plant body releases organic carbon into the soil through root exudates which increases the substrate for soil microbial respiration lopez sangil et al 2017 adamczyk et al 2021 irrigation affects the production and emission of soil co2 which is closely related to soil water content chen et al 2018 guo et al 2019b soc is the main source of energy and nutrients required by soil microbial activities irrigation increases soil moisture enhances soil microbial populations and microbial activities and accelerates the turnover of soil organic matter thus increasing the amount of co2 emitted to the atmosphere from the soil carbon pool through soil respiration schipper et al 2019 in this study ce was s i2 s i1 s i0 under subsoiling during both growing seasons indeed 120 mm irrigation i2 in the winter wheat season is still insufficient irrigation for winter wheat in the conditions of the ncp region fan et al 2019 in this case soil respiration rate is positively correlated with soil moisture and ce will increase with increasing irrigation amount yan et al 2014 yang et al 2018 additionally irrigation affected the distribution of soil water increased soil heat capacity and reduced the impact of air temperature on soil temperature thus delaying the impact of air temperature on soil temperature zhao et al 2022 irrigation at jointing stage of winter wheat reduced soil temperature difference between day and night promoted wheat root growth and maintained higher root activity and respiration rate positive relationships between temperature and soil respiration rate are widely observed thurgood et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 showed that increases in both soil temperature and soil moisture significantly promoted the soil respiration rate and cumulative co2 emissions which may be due to the acceleration of decomposition of soil organic matter with the increase of soil moisture and temperature conversely rotary tillage had little effect on annual mean soil temperature while subsoiling might increase the annual temperature variation in wheat fields which mainly shows that subsoiling may conveniently reduce soil temperature in winter inhibit ineffective consumption while it may conveniently increase soil temperature in summer thereby promoting root growth xie et al 2015 yin et al 2015 compared with rotary tillage the depth of subsoiling improved the physical properties of deep soil which in turn promoted root penetration and improved root system development which further improved root respiration effects and root carbon emissions under subsoiling muller et al 2020 our results showed that subsoiling significantly increased ce there are two possible reasons for the improvement of soil respiration under subsoiling firstly subsoiling improves soil permeability accelerates the migration and diffusion of gas through the soil he et al 2019 and promotes organic matter decomposition which reflects as an increase in soil respiration rate li et al 2019 secondly subsoiling breaks the plow pans promotes root growth xue et al 2019 zhai et al 2017 and thus enhances root respiration rate as the soil respiration mainly consists of root respiration and microbial respiration borden et al 2021 meanwhile exudates generated by root growth promote rhizosphere soil microbial respiration adamczyk et al 2021 any increase in soil microbial respiration further increases overall soil respiration rate 3 4 grain yield carbon emission efficiency and crop water productivity table 2 shows gy cee and cwp during the winter wheat growing seasons in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 irrigation and tillage methods had significant effects on gy in both growing seasons gy in subsoiled plots was significantly higher by 25 31 and 26 65 each year respectively than that of plots treated with rotary tillage meanwhile irrigation significantly increased winter wheat gy thus compared with i0 i1 and i2 significantly increased gy by 31 26 and 48 45 respectively additionally cee was significantly higher by 5 09 and 8 10 in the subsoiling treatment than in the rotary tillage treatment each year respectively consistently cwp was significantly higher by 37 07 and 28 95 under subsoiling than under rotary tillage each year respectively consistent with previous studies in our experiments gy of winter wheat grown under the subsoiling treatment remained at a high level sang et al 2016 liang et al 2019 during plant growth water directly affects the quality of root growth and root development as well as the ability of the aboveground parts of the plant to transport and to assimilate nutrients thus affecting the growth and development of the aboveground plant body in contrast to rotary tillage subsoiling helps improve soil permeability and saturated water conductivity which contributes to soil moisture conservation and improvement of drought resistance he et al 2019 thereby promoting crop growth and gy in addition subsoiling enhances root health and promotes vigorous root growth for penetration into deeper soil yu et al 2016 xue et al 2019 which is conducive to the absorption of more nutrients and water thereby providing the physiological basis for further promotion of plant growth and development and crop performance for greater gy in addition compared with rotary tillage subsoiling can delay the senescence of the wheat root system yu et al 2019a after flowering the activities of superoxide dismutase and nitrate reductase increased in the 0 40 cm soil layer under subsoiling while the content of malondialdehyde decreased in roots which was beneficial for root metabolism and antioxidant capacity and promoted the absorption and utilization of soil water and nutrients by roots haghighi 2012 guo et al 2018 karpets et al 2018 yu et al 2019b subsoiling provides an adequate environment for root development thus promoting plant aboveground growth and development to form proper plant community structure increase light interception prolong the life of functional leaves maintain higher leaf area index in late stages of crop growth yu et al 2019a increase stomata opening and improve leaf intercellular co2 concentration thereby increasing net photosynthetic rate and ultimately gy lamptey et al 2020 wu et al 2020 improving crop cwp is at the core of realizing potential efficient water use in water shortage areas cwp is the result of the quantitative coupling of carbon and water absorption therefore rather than ensuring stable or increased gy crop ce and water consumption involved in the production process should be the main focus to attain sustainable agricultural development improving carbon and cwp of crop plants is a top priority for future agricultural development in our experiment the r i2 treatment was the best in terms of cee followed by s i2 and s i1 with no significant difference between s i2 and s i1 however farmers cannot pursue low carbon emissions and water use at the expense of reduced yields as this runs counter to the goal of intensive and efficient agriculture on the other hand in terms of cwp s i1 was the best treatment and significantly higher than any other whereby it can be recommended for effectively and efficiently using water and reducing carbon emissions while promoting crop growth nonetheless the differences in soil temperature caused by different tillage and irrigation methods require further study to determine whether they affect root distribution and nutrient uptake which in turn would presumably affect crop aboveground growth and carbon emissions while the co2 equivalent n2o emissions should also be considered in addition it is necessary to further study the effects of subsoiling and irrigation on different winter wheat varieties to promote sustainable agricultural development 4 conclusion compared with rotary tillage subsoiling significantly increased carbon emissions while significantly reducing evapotranspiration furthermore it effectively increased soil carbon storage and carbon accumulation rate while improving winter wheat grain yield carbon emission efficiency and crop water productivity compared with i1 i2 significantly increased water consumption but there was no significant difference in soil carbon storage between the two treatments during our two year study s i1 effectively regulated water consumption by the system and improved grain yield with high carbon emission efficiency and significantly higher crop water productivity than any other treatment therefore s i1 treatment is more efficient in converting water consumption into winter wheat grain yield thus achieving true crop efficient water productivity therefore the combination of subsoiling and a single 60 mm irrigation at the jointing stage is an effective crop management strategy to stable and high winter wheat grain yield improve carbon emission efficiency and crop water productivity of the winter wheat in the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9474,different types of the crop water stress index cwsi have been useful for water stress monitoring and irrigation management in semi arid regions however little research exists on its effective application in humid regions this study aims to assess the effectiveness of three cwsi models cwsie empirical cwsit theoretical cwsih hybrid for crop water stress monitoring in an experimental field for potato crops in northern germany irrigation experiments with three treatments optimum op reduced rd and no were conducted in the summer of 2018 and 2019 continuous canopy temperatures tc for op and rd irrigation treatments together with meteorological measurements were used to derive cwsi from the different models additionally visible near infrared vnir and thermal infrared tir drone images were collected on several days during the growing season to create cwsi maps the different cwsi models were correlated with volumetric soil water content θ measurements for comparison and relationships were established between cwsi and θ for prediction results showed that cwsi accurately estimates soil water content under atmospheric conditions similar to those in semi arid regions the predictive performance of different cwsi models were fairly good r2 0 57 0 63 situation in 2019 cwsie and cwsih performed better than cwsit cwsi θ relations calibrated in one year effectively predicted θ in another year with errors of 1 2 2 2 absolute soil water content cwsih could be a promising alternative to the traditional cwsi as it combines aspects of cwsie empirical upper limit and of cwsit theoretical lower limit which has advantages for operational use finally the drone based cwsi and θ maps derived from the developed cwsi θ relations captured well the applied irrigation patterns and could help to decide when to irrigate and how much water to apply keywords stress detection soil water content uav drone humid regions irrigation hybrid cwsi 1 introduction irrigation is the biggest user of freshwater on earth however a large proportion of irrigation water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation systems cohen et al 2017 water supply for irrigation is expected to decrease due to frequent droughts and increased competition from other industries around the world alvino and marino 2017 hence there is a need for improved irrigation management to optimize irrigation water use while maximizing crop yield rud et al 2014 cohen et al 2017 han et al 2018 crop water status is an important water stress indicator used in irrigation management cohen et al 2017 han et al 2018 although soil based methods for assessing crop water status are more widely used there is a growing interest in plant based methods jones and vaughan 2010 because they serve as a direct proxy of actual plant water status whereas soil water content measurements only provide an indirect linkage canopy temperature tc is a good indicator for water status due to its inverse relation to the rate of canopy water loss which in turn is closely linked to stomatal conductance jones and vaughan 2010 hence thermal infrared tir sensing of tc has been a useful tool for monitoring water stress alvino and marino 2017 han et al 2018 bian et al 2019 however the sensitivity of tc to changing weather conditions led to the development of crop water stress index cwsi which considers the effects of air temperature ta and other meteorological variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws and available energy the crop water stress index cwsi has been proven to be effective in water stress monitoring and in irrigation management dejonge et al 2015 alvino and marino 2017 its main advantage over pure tc measurements is that it accounts for meteorological variables mainly ta and vpd while tc alone is sensitive to highly fluctuating environmental factors inoue et al 1990 which makes cwsi a more suitable measure of water stress cwsi is based on a solid theoretical base idso et al 1981 and it normalises tc firstly by the actual difference between canopy and air temperature known as canopy to air temperature difference tc ta or catd and secondly by the tc ta of fully transpiring and non transpiring crops commonly referred to as the lower and upper limits respectively jackson et al 1981 different models to calculate cwsi have been developed based on differences in how the upper and lower limits are derived maes and steppe 2012 the empirical cwsi cwsie idso et al 1981 model establishes a relationship between tc ta and vpd from which the lower limit known as the non water stressed baseline nwsb idso et al 1981 is derived the main advantage of cwsie is that it requires the measurement of only three variables tc ta and vpd for its application however the nwsb is highly sensitive to changes of climate variables such as radiation and wind speed jackson et al 1988 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 yearly differences in nwsbs have also been reported for the same crop in the same field horst et al 1989 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 han et al 2018 hence the use of baselines derived from one year across multiple years has been questioned additionally a robust nwsb is usually derived at the end of the growing season from multiple cloud free days gardner et al 1992a 1992b which makes the near real time application of cwsi challenging for day to day stress measurements during the growing season the theoretical cwsi cwsit jackson et al 1981 model presents an alternative method for calculating the upper and lower limits from equations based on a combination of the penman monteith and the energy balance equation it offers an improvement to cwsie by including additional atmospheric parameters net radiation rn wind speed ws and canopy resistance rc which are not considered in the cwsie jackson et al 1981 1988 cwsit in principle is advantageous over cwsie for practical use in day to day water stress monitoring since its upper and lower limits are derived from equations applied for the same environmental conditions at the time of tc measurement jackson et al 1988 nevertheless cwsit has a number of disadvantages firstly problems attributed to the proper estimation of aerodynamic resistance ra from wind speed were noted by jackson et al 1988 and has been shown to significantly affect final cwsit values stockle and dugas 1992 agam et al 2013b secondly net radiation rn is another important input variable required however which is not directly measured in many weather stations and therefore needs to be estimated from meteorological variables berni et al 2009 accurate estimation of aerodynamic resistance ra poses challenges as estimates depend on the empirical parameterization of surface roughness and atmospheric stability corrections which further requires a number of site specific parameters paul et al 2014 mallick et al 2016 2018 and has led to errors in the final cwsi estimates berni et al 2009 given the limitations associated with deriving ra a method that eliminates the need for estimating ra could improve the accuracy of cwsi rud et al 2014 demonstrated that the use of empirical upper limits together with theoretical lower limits did not affect the accuracy of final cwsi values and agam et al 2013a recommended its use for practical purposes the use of empirical upper and theoretical lower limits to calculate cwsi is further investigated and is referred to as hybrid cwsi model cwsih henceforth the development and early application of cwsi was done on point based tc measurements but has been adapted and applied to high resolution thermal imagery for assessing the spatial variability of crop water status jones 1992 maes and steppe 2012 agam et al 2013b direct image based models involving different ways of deriving the upper and lower limits jones 1992 1999 fuentes et al 2012 padhi et al 2012 gerhards et al 2018 theoretical models with direct application of theoretical equations from jackson et al 1988 and hybrid models with a fixed upper limit depending on crop type and theoretical lower limit have widely been applied to tir images jones 1999 1992 möller et al 2006 rud et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2016 the applicability of cwsi for water stress monitoring depends on demonstrating that it can accurately and reliably replace soil and plant based water status indicators in agricultural fields and that it is appropriate for stress detection in a variety of crops in different climatic zones cohen et al 2017 suitable relationships between cwsi and other indicators are required in order to translate cwsi accurately into water stress estimates which can then serve in irrigation decision support möller et al 2006 cwsi has been shown to exhibit good relationships with direct in situ plant and soil based measures such as soil water content padhi et al 2012 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014 leaf water potential stomatal conductance and transpiration berni et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 cohen et al 2017 han et al 2018 bian et al 2019 in this study relationships between volumetric soil water content θ and thermal stress indices are explored and used to evaluate the performance of indices in monitoring water stress such relationships normally derived from point measurements are potentially transferable to images to represent stress at large spatial scales berni et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 rud et al 2014 here established relationships between cwsi and soil water content are transferred to drone images and their accuracy was evaluated to represent the spatial variability of soil water content cwsi was developed to provide a universal method of water stress monitoring for agricultural crops in different climatic zones jackson et al 1988 and so far has been proven to be robust in many arid and semi arid regions around the globe and for different agricultural crops meron et al 2013 dejonge et al 2015 cohen et al 2017 liu et al 2020 however little research has been carried out so far to test its applicability in humid and sub humid regions including possible linkages of cwsi with soil water content although vegetation in these regions is also susceptible to water stress in order to be considered a truly universal approach it s robustness must be tested across a broad range of climatic and aridity zones jones 1999 investigated the potential use of infrared thermometry in cooler humid climates and hoffmann et al 2016 in their studies in western denmark proved that cwsi could accurately represent the water status of barley in the present study we test the suitability of cwsi in potatoes as a tool for irrigation support in a temperate humid zone of northern germany the objectives of this study were to derive and assess the performance of three cwsi models cwsie cwsit cwsih as a proxy for crop water stress through relations with volumetric soil water content θ assess the transferability of derived cwsi θ relations from one year to another year and its applicability to drone based cwsi images for mapping soil water content at field scale discuss the suitability of crop water stress index as a water stress indicator in a humid region on potato a crop susceptible to water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental setup and design the experiment was carried out in hamerstorf in northern germany 52 54 36 n 10 27 36 e 65 m a s l a site with annual rain totals of 622 mm and mean annual air temperature of 8 8 c and with silty sand being the primary soil type the experimental site belongs to the agricultural chamber of lower saxony landwirtschaftskammer niedersachsen lwk which has been conducting irrigation experiments for more than 13 years with the main objective to assess the effect of irrigation intensities representing different levels of water stress on crop yield the experimental data has been collected within the project sensor based irrigation control in potatoes which ran from 2016 to 2019 with the main aim to use canopy temperature for irrigation decision support and how the techniques can be implemented into agricultural operating systems meinardi et al 2021 this study investigates the effect of different irrigation water treatments on potato crops carried out over two years 2018 and 2019 the variety in each year was amanda the root depth has not been measured but the assumption was that the maximum root depth of the potato plant is 60 cm former measurements of soil water content at different depths showed water extraction by the root at a maximal depth of 60 cm the potato crops were planted on a 270 m x 42 m field divided into 120 plots representing 2 different irrigation treatments 2 different potash fertilization regimes 4 repetitions of each treatment and 2 auxiliary plots for each of the 40 experimental plots of 9 m x 6 75 m with a planting density of 4 plants per square meter on 9 rows of ridges in each plot each plot had a total length of 27 m where only the 9 m in the middle are harvested net harvest plot three different types of irrigation treatments were implemented based on the desired percent of usable field capacity nfk table 1 developed based on experiences from long term irrigation experiments carried out by lwk optimum irrigation op hereafter with 50 nfk also referred to as cwsi 0 5 means a good water supply for the plants with no relevant drought stress aiming at highest possible yield reduced irrigation rd hereafter with 35 nfk also referred to as cwsi 0 65 means temporary drought stress with possible effects on yield aiming at a reduced water and energy consumption and no irrigation as control treatment the control treatment will not be regarded for cwsi measurement in this paper a nozzle cart with a boom made by beinlich ulmen germany 1 1 https www beinlich beregnung de was used for irrigation the adjustment of the retraction velocity of the cart was made based on water pressure water amount per hour and nozzle width the true amount of water was controlled with 4 customary plastic rain gauges along the irrigation width the deviation of the given amount was approx 2 mm the decision on when and amount to irrigate was based on weekly bi weekly gravimetric soil water content θg measurements in combination with transpiration amounts for the following days according to the weather forecast from dwd german weather service water balance method according to hartmann et al 2000 the root zone was considered as 60 cm depth from top of dam 45 cm below planting depth at development stadium bbch 55 first bud 5 mm final irrigation dates and amounts are presented in table 2 irrigation treatments started on 42 days after planting for op plots and 45 days for rd plots in 2018 and 52 days after planting for op plots and 69 days for rd plots in 2019 both set approximately at the beginning of inflorescence emergence and tuber formation in 2018 and 2019 respectively because these are the periods when water consumption by potato is highest dalla costa et al 1997 gerhards et al 2016 with the exception of op in 2019 when irrigation started at the beginning of tuber initiation for quality reasons 2 2 canopy temperature soil water content and meteorological measurements six thermal infrared thermometers irt thünen institute in house development and construction based on the sensor chip melexis mlx90614 with massive aluminium housing special electronics for modbus protocol usage and additional radiation shielding were set up at six plots to record continuous canopy temperatures tc of three rd cwsi 0 65 and three op cwsi 0 5 replications from june to september for each year tc was recorded every 3 seconds and averaged over 30 minutes only tc data in the timespan from 11 am to 3 pm central european summer time cest were used in this study unless indicated else this is 9 38 am to 1 38 pm local solar time the mean of the three op or rd replications were used for stress analysis the irts had a thermal resolution of 0 02 k their field of view angle was 35 to ensure that only pure tc was monitored even before full canopy closure irts were installed at an oblique angle of 60 to nadir so that their field of view captured only vegetation irts were mounted at 2 m above ground resulting in an elliptical measurement area of about 5 m2 per sensor at ground level irts were positioned at the northern border of each plot pointing towards south the emissivity was set to 1 despite the fact that real dense crop canopies have slightly lower emissivity and background sky radiation should be taken into account for precise irt measurements no canopy temperature was measured in the non irrigated plots from previous experiments it was known that non irrigated potato plants almost never arrive at full canopy cover on the sandy soil thus prohibiting any valid canopy temperature measurement by irts growing potatoes without irrigation does not occur on real production fields in the local irrigation region continuous volumetric soil water content θ measurements were made with two sentek enviroscan sensors sentek sensor technologies australia at positions ir1 and ir2 fig 1 to represent soil moisture conditions for rd and op respectively both enviroscan sensor tubes contained 6 sensors and were placed covering the top 60 cm soil profile in intervals of 10 cm θ measurements for 2018 and 2019 were carried out at two different locations in 2018 the soil moisture sensors were placed in the valley between two ridges and in 2019 soil moisture measurements were done at the top of the ridge where the potato plant grows additionally gravimetric water content θg measurements for the top 0 30 cm bottom 30 60 cm and full 0 60 cm soil profile were made following a standard protocol wessolek et al 2009 approximately every 1 2 weeks at 2 locations each representing an op or rd treatment 3 samples were taken per plot followed by mixing and scaling the samples before putting them into a drying oven for approximately 20 hrs at 105 c then scaling the samples again soil density field capacity 15 18 volume for 0 30 cm depth 11 14 for 30 60 cm depth and permanent wilting point approx 3 4 vol were estimated based on soil texture wessolek et al 2009 soil texture varied between the plots it was estimated for each sample separately by hand finger test the highest fc and pwp values occurred in the upper soil 0 30 cm due to the higher soil organic carbon content 1 5 meteorological measurements of air temperature ta solar radiation rg relative humidity rh and wind speed ws were measured every 2 minutes at position ir1 in the field fig 1 daily rainfall was recorded at a weather station located on the experimental site additional meteorological parameters such as vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn were calculated according to allen et al 1998 1994a 1994b and ground heat flux gn was estimated for wet soils according to santanello and friedl 2003 summary of meteorological conditions for the two years of the experiment are shown in table 3 2 3 unmanned aerial system uas image acquisition and processing visible near infrared vnir and thermal infrared tir images over the plot data were collected on four days in the growing season of 2019 19 june at 13 45 26 june at 15 15 24 july 14 10 and 24 august at

geotagging every single image collected a downwelling light sensor dls in the camera monitors varying illumination conditions during light overcast a reflectance calibration target with a set of 5 panels coated with differing grey intensities and whose reflectance spectra had been measured in a laboratory was installed next to the fields and was used for image calibration and correction downwelling radiation measured with the dls were used to correct for varying illumination conditions in every single frame the raw dn images then underwent photogrammetric processing in agisoft metashape resulting in georeferenced orthomosaic images a step and band wise empirical line correction was used to convert dn to surface reflectance values linear relationships fitted between image dn and surface reflectance values from the calibration panels were used to develop prediction equations with r2 values greater than 0 9 for surface reflectance calibration for each date and band thermal infrared tir images were captured using the thermalcapture fusion zoom camera https thermalcapture com thermalcapture fusion zoom 50mm the camera contains a thermal flir tau 2 core with a thermal resolution of 0 05 k and records gps positions image data with a spatial resolution of 640 512 pixels was collected with 9 hz frequency conversion of digital numbers dn to brightness temperature bt was carried out in teax thermoviewer using an assumed emissivity of 1 raw images were selected to have 80 front overlap and were subjected to a photogrammetric processing workflow using agisoft metashape canopy temperatures tc were retrieved from bt according to the two step process described in heinemann et al 2020 first land surface emissivity lse maps were derived from ndvi and then the derived lse used to calculate tc accuracy of the retrieved tc from the drone data was verified against ground thermometers at positions of irt sensors ir 1 6 fig 1 after extraction of pure image tc using ndvi masking zhang et al 2019 results gave an r2 value of 0 71 and rmse of 2 1 c 2 4 crop water stress index cwsi cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 was defined according to 1 cwsi tc ta tc ta ll tc ta ul tc ta ll where tc ta is the measured temperature difference between canopy and air in c tc ta ll is the lower boundary representing a non water stressed condition tc ta ul is the upper reference under non transpiring conditions for a well watered crop cwsi value is close to 0 whereas for the crop under severe water stress condition cwsi value is close to 1 several different models for cwsi estimation have been developed based on the different methods of calculating the tc ta ll and tc ta ul han et al 2018 2 4 1 empirical cwsi cwsie according to the empirical model in idso et al 1981 tc ta follows a linear relationship with vpd fig 2 when crops are sufficiently well irrigated a regression line the so called non water stressed baseline nwsb which is equivalent to tc ta ll can be derived according to eq 2 as 2 tc ta ll avpd b where coefficients a and b are determined by linear regression of the scatterplot between tc ta versus vpd and tc ta ll is the nwsb to achieve the linear relationship represented in fig 2 to be applied in eq 2 two methods have typically been established gardner et al 1992a 1992b and were used in this study a single day method where diurnal measurements from a well watered crop are taken throughout a day to capture a wide range of tc ta and vpd values a plot of tc ta vs vpd is done and a negative linear regression line can be fitted from the period sometime after sunrise and sunset as shown in fig 2 idso et al 1981 gardner et al 1992a 1992b to establish the tc ta ll using the empirical single day method in this study days with sufficient difference between op and rd treatments established through soil water content differences were selected the relationships between tc ta against vpd throughout the day was examined and days in which suitable negative linear relationships could be established after sunrise and before sunset as demonstrated in fig 2 were used to obtain parameters for the nwsb and eq 2 maximum tc ta from stressed crops were used for tc ta ul b multi day method in which measurements can be made for well watered crops on several days in a growing season usually at the exact same time 1 2 hours around solar noon when vpd is maximum when water stress is likely to be the highest gardner et al 1992a 1992b irmak et al 2000 to establish the tc ta ll with the multi day method tc and vpd measurements were selected on several cloud free days from op treatments 1 and 2 days after irrigation and significant rain event 11 mm between 11 and 15 h cest idso et al 1981 han et al 2018 parameters for the nwsb were generated from the negative linear relationship established between tc ta and vpd cloud free days were considered to be days where the ratio of incoming solar radiation to clear sky solar radiation rso was greater than 0 7 taghvaeian et al 2012 tc ta ul was calculated according to eq 3 the non transpiring baseline ntb fig 2 can be based on maximum tc measurements of an extremely stressed crop or equivalent to determination of the nwsb based on eq 3 han et al 2018 3 tc ta ul avpg b where a and b are the slope and intercepts derived from eq 2 and vpg is vapor pressure gradient defined as the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature ta and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus b ta b as shown in eq 4 allen et al 1998

empirical and theoretical cwsi models show clear drawbacks empirical approaches require suitable environmental conditions and theoretical models require estimates of resistance terms and accurate net radiation calculations the non transpiring baseline tc ta ul shows a weaker dependence on environmental conditions e g vpd compared to the non water stressed baseline tc ta ll it is also challenging to observe fully transpiring vegetation under high evaporative demand high rn and vpd as also well watered vegetation can show reduced transpiration under such conditions accordingly determination of the non transpiring baseline in the empirical method is more consistent between years and relies less on identifying suitable days see section 3 if at least some dry periods are observed during the growing season we propose using an empirical estimate of the non transpiring baseline to calculate the non water stressed baseline from a theorical model substituting eq 7 in eq 8 shows that with a known tc ta ul the tc ta ll can be derived without the need to estimate ra rn and g leading to a simplification 9 tc ta ll tc ta ul γ δ γ vpd δ γ for the hybrid method a fixed upper baseline developed from the empirical method was used 2 4 4 statistical analysis canopy temperature and meteorological variables can change quickly within a few seconds hence all measured values were averaged over 30 min to level out short term fluctuations for example values at solar noon 13 19 cest in this analysis is the average of measured data from 13 04 13 34 cest days on which irrigation was done or the total rain was 1 0 mm were not included since the wet surface of the leaves can falsify the temperature measurement for all analysis cwsi values for the three indices cwsie cwsit cwsih were calculated for each ir 1 6 sensor and averaged only after calculation plots and analysis are presented only for full cover periods 20 june 08 august 2018 and 19 june 06 august 2019 since it can be largely ensured during this period that little or no soil was visible in the measuring range of the sensor other researchers applied similar restrictions e g when canopy cover was larger than 70 dejonge et al 2015 or when crop coverage in the field of view of irts was larger than 80 han et al 2018 pearson correlation coefficients r between midday 11 00 15 00 h cest cwsi and measured soil water content θ at 10 cm depth was used to evaluate the suitability of the indices in monitoring water stress since θ measurements were taken only at positions ir1 and ir2 representing one rd and op treatments respectively only tc and the three cwsi models developed for these 2 treatments were used to establish relationships with θ to predict θ from cwsi exponential relationships were established for cwsi and θ for one year and used to predict θ for the other year and for tc images relationships buit in 2019 were used to generate θ maps 3 results 3 1 establishment of non water stressed baseline and non transpiring baseline diurnal patterns for op and rd treatments for the two representative stressed days 24th july 2018 and 29th june 2019 which were used to establish the lower tc ta ll and upper tc ta ul baselines for the empirical single day method are presented in fig 3 24th july 2018 was one day after rd irrigation on 23 july and five days after op on 19 july events hence rd was less stressed on this day and thus was used to establish the tc ta ll in 2019 on the other hand op with irrigations on 21 and 27 june and rd irrigation on 21 june representing stressed and unstressed conditions respectively on 29 june were used to establish appropriate tc ta ll and tc ta ul linear regression models were fitted for the negative tc ta vpd relationship for the unstressed crop between 9 and 17 h cest for both years only slight differences exist for the slope and intercept in both years table 5 while the r2 values were significantly different from each other 2018 0 83 and 2019 0 98 the tc ta ul were significantly different for each year but a suitable tc ta ul could not be established in 2018 since the maximum tc ta for op which was stressed on this day was only 1 2 c which is not a reasonable value for potatoes fig 3 the tc ta ll equations fitted for the tc ta vpd relationships considering the multi day method were significant for both years with r2 values 0 88 and 0 83 p 0 001 fig 4 table 5 for 2018 and 2019 respectively while the empirical tc ta ll and tc ta ul parameters derived from single day and multi day methods were significantly different from each other they were relatively invariant between years when each method is considered individually the tc ta ul and r2 from the multi day method were very similar to each other table 5 and could be more useful in establishing suitable baselines for application across multiple years given this advantage and the higher stability that is provided by multi day methods gardner et al 1992 the final cwsie was estimated from limits derived from the multi day method additionally the mean value of tc ta ul from 2018 and 2019 multi day method 5 7 c was used to calculate cwsih which is close to the value 5 c used by gerhards et al 2016 for potato crops in germany derived tc ta ul and tc ta ll from the three cwsi models cwsie cwsit and cwsih are presented in fig 5 as previously mentioned tc ta ul used for the hybrid method was the mean tc ta ul from the multi day empirical method for 2018 and 2019 hence they are only slightly different from the empirical upper limits in both years for the theoretical method only the mean tc ta ul is shown as it has a different value for each data point the tc ta ll values from the theoretical and hybrid models have similar curved patterns with higher scatter and lower values than those of the empirical method the effect of the different limits affects the final cwsi models values since the lower baseline tc ta ll for cwsie was derived as the average of real tc ta values on 17 days 2018 resp 11 days 2019 with well watered condition for the reason of numerical stability its values are higher than the virtual tc ta of an ideal optimally watered crop 3 2 relationships between soil water content and cwsi volumetric soil water content θ measurements were used as the basis to assess the suitability of the different cwsi models to represent stress conditions the temporal dynamics of θ at 10 cm and 20 cm depth showed good correspondence with both rain and irrigation events fig 6 with θ values increasing sharply after each irrigation or rain event and slowly decreasing with soil drying until the next event in 2018 θ at 10 and 20 cm depth showed similar variability while in 2019 θ at 10 cm depth was more variable than θ at 20 cm depth this is likely due to the measurement position of the sensors previous unpublished research work of lwk revealed that only little irrigation water percolates under the top of the ridge in 2018 maximum and minimum θ values for op and rd mostly had the same magnitude throughout the season in 2019 however absolute θ values of the op treatment remained above the θ values of the rd treatment the seasonal course of daily midday from 11h to 15h cest values of the three cwsi models together with θ irrigation and significant rain 5 mm events in 2018 are examined fig 7 all cwsi models showed expected variations with respect to soil water content irrigation and rain however the pattern is not observable throughout the season but can be seen only at certain periods only periods with relatively high rg and vpd rg 600 wm 2 and vpd 20hpa grey background fig 7 have this response implying that the crop must experience high radiative heating and atmospheric demand for the expected cwsi responses to occur considering only these periods mean cwsi values for rd were marginally higher than for op irrigation with values for cwsie cwsit and cwsih being 0 18 0 34 and 0 49 and 0 15 0 32 and 0 47 respectively table 6 the effect of higher tc ta ll for cwsie method section 3 1 fig 5 can be seen in its significantly smaller mean values compared to cwsit and cwsih most tc ta values fall below the tc ta ll causing most of cwsie values to be negative and lowering the mean values in fig 7 upper plot rd in the dry period between doy 190 and doy 204 an inverse relationship between soil moisture sm and cwsi can be observed at doy 190 sm is high 25 blue circle and corresponding cwsi values are low at values close to or below 0 red triangle black dot green dot then during this dry period sm declines from 25 to 7 at doy 204 while cwsi increase to values around 0 4 0 7 depending on cwsi type similar behaviour is present in the same plot for period doy 170 182 or in the fig 7 lower plot op during period doy 190 204 similar seasonal dynamics in θ and daily midday cwsi models are also observed in 2019 fig 8 with higher cwsi values table 6 for rd cwsie 0 5 cwsit 0 46 cwsih 0 61 than op cwsie 0 26 cwsit 0 32 cwsih 0 45 like in 2018 only periods with relatively high rg and vpd show good response however the length of these periods were shorter and limited in 2019 two periods where such patterns are clearly visible are the periods from 20 june 3rd july doy 171 184 grey background in fig 8 and 23 28 th july 2019 doy 204 209 grey background in fig 8 pearson correlation coefficients r between tc and the three different cwsi models at midday 11 00 15 00 h cest and θ at 10 cm depth are shown in table 7 to show the effects of the meteorological conditions on thermal measurements correlations are shown for all the observations and periods when rg 600 wm 2 and vpd 20hpa grey background fig 7 8 correlation coefficients are also shown for all irrigation treatments rd op combined and when they are considered separately for all considerations r was higher for periods with rg 600 wm 2 and vpd 20hpa than when all observations are considered also r was higher for rd than op treatments for both years although better correlations exist for rd op and rd in 2019 than 2018 3 3 estimating of θ from cwsi scatter plots of mean daily midday tc and cwsi vs 10 cm θ are presented in fig 9 from the scatter plots and summary statistics table 6 it can be observed that θ and index values for op and rd treatments were not significantly different from each other in 2018 while clear distinctions exist between rd and op θ in 2019 hence tc and all cwsi models were different from each other r2 values were poor in 2018 r2 0 4 and good in 2019 r2 0 6 even for tc a comparison between the predicted θ and measured θ is presented in fig 10 predicted θ for 2018 from relationships in 2019 were generally better r2 0 5 rmse 2 for all cwsi models while predictions of 2019 from 2018 were poor r2 0 4 rmse 2 for both cases considered in figs 9 and 10 cwsie had the best performance for both models 3 4 application to thermal images cwsih was computed on the drone images replacing irt based tc with drone based tc in eq 1 environmental conditions during the drone flights are given in table 8 cwsih maps for three experimental days 19 june 26 june and 24 july are shown in fig 11 data collected on 24 august was not analysed further since most of the leaves were dried up by this date and images mostly captured soil temperature on the 19th of june spatial variability of cwsi due to irrigation treatments is not reflected in the maps however on 26 june and 24 july spatial patterns are clearly visible and reflect the corresponding irrigation this confirms the previous results that spatial cwsi patterns can reflect the patterns of plant available soil water the visibility of spatial patterns on 26 june and 24 july but not on 19 june is due to absence of rain in the period before image acquisition and the high rg and vpd table 8 on these days which is necessary for stress detection with tir for accurate water stress detection crops must heat up significantly high rg and there must be high atmospheric demand high vpd 3 5 potato yield results yield results are beyond the focus of this paper but are given in table 9 for completeness of the presentation reduced irrigation resulted in a 15 yield reduction in 2018 and 10 yield reduction in 2019 compared to op without any irrigation control treatment yield dropped to 40 of the op treatment in the very dry year 2018 and to 57 in 2019 4 discussion 4 1 non water stressed baseline and non transpiring baseline the r2 values from empirical equations to derive the nwsb tc ta ll and ntb tc ta ul from the single day and multi day methods are within acceptable limits for both methods gardner 1992b reported that for single day methods r2 values should typically be greater than 0 95 while for multi day methods r2 values around 0 6 and 0 7 are acceptable recent studies such as taghvaeian et al 2012 and berni et al 2009 had r2 values of 0 98 and 0 67 for single and multi day methods respectively nevertheless r2 value for the tc ta ll in 2018 was 0 83 less than 0 98 obtained in 2019 differences in slope and intercept were also recorded between both years 2018 2019 differences between consecutive years for the same crop in the same place have also been reported in other studies gonzalez dugo et al 2014 reported different values for intercept slope and r2 for their three year experiment 2009 2010 2011 for mandarin and orange trees dejonge et al 2015 and taghvaeian et al 2012 made similar observations for maize such differences have been attributed to climatic conditions between different years crop growth stages differences in transpiration rate and water uptake potential between years and instrument parameters such as irt view angles gonzalez dugo et al 2014 han et al 2018 in this study the differences in climatic conditions 2018 was drier than 2019 and crop growth stage suitable day for single day empirical method in 2018 was 24 july which was at late stages of tuber development while 2019 was 29 june which was in the flowering stage table 2 likely caused the differences in slope and intercept the tc ta ul were significantly different for each year which could be attributed to the level of stress and the amount of radiation available on the selected days the stressed crop in 2019 had three additional days of stress compared to 2018 the low tc ta ul of 2018 1 2 c from the single day method does not represent the maximum stress conditions for potatoes because the op irrigation was not under severe stress hence cannot be used as a reliable tc ta ul in such cases where a reliable upper limit cannot be derived from irrigation treatments and no other data is available a constant tc ta ul value of 5 0 c is recommended for use taghvaeian et al 2014 typically tc ta ul is derived from severely stressed crops under ideal conditions idso et al 1981 irmak et al 2000 dejonge et al 2015 however al faraj et al 2001 observed that this may not be suitable for all cases even under controlled experiments hence the application of the baseline equation eq 3 comes in handy in such cases also the use of mean and maximum upper limit values for cwsit and cwsie as indicated in fig 5 has been widely applied the higher tc ta ll values from the empirical method presented in fig 5 can be attributed to the experimental setup where op and rd irrigation amounts are set at 50 and 35 field capacity respectively typically the tc ta ll is derived from irrigation treatments with 100 plant available water or field capacity resulting in much lower tc ta ll values the irrigation treatments in this experiment therefore cannot represent conditions for well watered crops and the derived parameters may be suboptimal as reported by al faraj et al 2001 in tall fescue although irmak et al 2000 had obtained suitable lower baselines for corn even at 50 available water holding capacity which was expected to be the case in this study since within the first two days after 20 30 mm irrigation table 2 the water availability was unrestricted for both of the treatments 4 2 soil water content cwsi relations the results from the conducted analysis demonstrate that cwsi models can be used to monitor crop and soil water status and dynamics cwsi was expected to be high during water stress low θ and decrease during recovery after rain irrigation additionally op treatments were also expected to be less stressed than rd irrigation treatments both expectations are generally met in this study for all three models however good cwsi dynamics and correlations are only observable obtained under certain meteorological conditions with high rg and vpd during high radiative heating and high atmospheric demand table 7 poor dynamics and correlations for the whole study period is due to the presence of cloudy conditions with low rg and vpd on certain days and the relationships greatly improve under dry conditions only high rg and vpd similar results have also been documented by agam et al 2013a important requirements in obtaining strong cwsi θ relationships are the accurate measurement of soil water content and variation from dry to wet conditions in this experiment soil water content measurements for 2018 and 2019 were carried out at two different locations in 2018 the soil moisture sensors were placed in the valley between two ridges and in 2019 soil moisture measurements were done at the top of the ridge where the potato plant grows the effect of this disparity can be seen in fig 6 where the difference in 10 and 20 cm soil water content for 2018 were mostly the same while for 2019 there is a huge difference in soil water content between both depths irrigation water and rain applied at the top of the ridge tends to infiltrate mainly into the valley the infiltration on the top of the ridge is much less and mostly restricted to the top centimetres of the ridge hence high variability of soil at the 10 cm depth while the 20 cm is more stable it would be desirable to provide a soil water content threshold for beginning water stress this is however difficult to estimate as the choice of cwsi model affects the results and due to limits in measurement accuracy cwsi is rarely exactly 0 even for unstressed vegetation the most reliable method in this case would be to treat a certain percentile of the lowest cwsi values observed in a season as unstressed from the data shown in fig 9 this seems to be around 12 15 volumetric soil water content which corresponds to a depletion fraction for no stress similar to fao56 of 0 2 0 4 assuming pwp 3 and fc 18 which is somewhat lower than the fao56 recommended value of 0 35 for potatoes allen et al 1998 4 3 comparison of cwsi models several studies have shown that cwsi is a better indicator of water stress than tc berni et al 2009 gerhards et al 2019 however while this was the case in 2018 the cwsi models did not provide significant improvement for 2019 an observation which was also made by dejonge et al 2015 with respect to the different cwsi models some studies comparing the different models have shown cwsie to perform better than cwsit agam et al 2013b liu et al 2020 and others have shown similar performance for cwsie and cwsit for olives ben gal et al 2009 and for potato in particular rud et al 2014 in this study cwsie performed slightly better than cwsit and cwsih in representing and predicting soil water content improvements in cwsit can be made by using a seasonal average ra which can reduce uncertainty for the different growth stages and instantaneous atmospheric effects jackson et al 1988 han et al 2018 although it is expected that cwsi should be a better indicator than direct tc dejonge et al 2015 found out that tc measurements alone without meteorological parameterization were equally capable as cwsi in representing soil moisture deficit under certain conditions and can be used for such instances however cwsi models are still advantageous as they consider meteorological variables and scale the value of stress to quantifiable limits of stress 0 1 unlike simple tc measurements where no absolute limits of stress can be established which is important in practical irrigation scheduling and water stress monitoring situations all meteorological measurements required for estimating cwsi might not be readily available berni et al 2009 and in addition to the limitations of both cwsie and cwsit outlined in section 1 the use of cwsih could be a suitable alternative given that it could easily be applied without further calculations of aerodynamic resistance ra and net radiation additionally cwsih combines the best aspects of cwsie and cwsit and has been recommended by agam et al 2013b as a more practical method for daily monitoring of stress and shown to work well for stress monitoring in potatoes rud et al 2014 nevertheless some level of caution should be observed when assigning fixed upper limit values as index values are sensitive to such values agam et al 2013b the good level of θ predictions from the cwsie and cwsih models mainly in 2019 demonstrate that these indices can be used to simulate and predict irrigation amounts from one year to another when similar meteorological and soil moisture conditions prevail also in other research the use of cwsi θ relations to simulate soil water content θ has been shown to provide reliable soil moisture estimates in the absence of in situ θ measurements taghvaeian et al 2012 liu et al 2020 4 4 application to thermal images in the present study cwsi maps accurately captured the different levels of water stress which reflected the different irrigation treatments in the field although errors in derived tc presumably led to errors in cwsi maps cwsi values from images were generally larger than in situ cwsi values which eventually led to lower estimated soil water content however the accuracy of the final soil moisture maps could not be ultimately verified due to lack of sufficient spatially distributed in situ field measurements tc values were generally higher in the images than in situ tc by about 2 1 c errors in tc from remote sensing images have been attributed to atmospheric effects differences in view angles and accuracy of drone tir sensors and field thermometers song and park 2020 heinemann et al 2020 stressed the importance of accurate estimation of specific emissivity consideration of environmental background temperature and atmospheric transmittance to obtain tc with errors less than 0 05 k additionally co registration inaccuracies between tir and vnir images used for extraction of pure tc may lead to pollution by background signals in the final tc image although various methods of separation of pure tc from background signals of soil and plant shadow exist wang et al 2010 meron et al 2013 and were applied to the images no method has been shown to be completely perfect for pure tc extraction zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 also suggested that tir images could be recalibrated using coefficients derived from linear relationships within situ tc measurements however this method has not been widely applied yet and was not used in the current study relationships derived from in situ measurements and applied to cwsi maps for spatial monitoring have been shown to work well in predicting spatial variations of stress for instance berni et al 2009 produced accurate cwsi maps from canopy conductance derived from high spatial resolution uav thermal imagery and relationships with cwsi have been used to map leaf water potential cohen et al 2005 2017 such maps may be used to estimate available soil water within the crop s root zone so that soil water deficit can be quantified within the field for irrigation scheduling padhi et al 2012 4 5 spatial variations within cwsi and sm soil moisture images on june 19 fig 11 top map there was no water stress despite hot midday temperatures due to 20 mm of rain four days before soil water content was about 50 70 field capacity fc equivalent to 10 5 13 5 volume fig 12 top map june 26 was five days after the last irrigation for both op and rd plots and the previous days were hot and dry with presumably high transpiration rates on the left western side of the field intensive drought stress fig 11 centre map and low soil water content fig 12 bottom map can be observed even in the 50 fc plots in contrast on the right eastern side of the field in the same treatment class 50 fc only mild drought stress and intermediate soil water content values can be observed a possible explanation are differences in soil properties for instance loamy lower soil layers with larger water holding capacity than the otherwise prevalent sandy layers from the loamy soil horizon plants can be supplied with water and show less drought stress despite the topsoil layer being very dry these soil properties tend to increase towards the eastern part right side in figs 11 and 12 of the field smaller areas of mild drought stress can also be seen in the western part of the field these interpretations are supported by analysing the yield of the individual parcels not shown where the yield for the assumed better soil with larger soil water holding capacity in the east end was larger by 10 20 compared with the west end in both treatment variants cwsi 0 5 and fc 50 similar differences in soil properties in the same agricultural field have also been observed by padhi et al 2012 and han et al 2018 which also accounted for the differences in soil water distribution crop growth and crop response to drought stress an alternative explanation could be that in the stressed red coloured areas unfavourable soil properties or poorly developed plants have decreased the rooting depth such that less water can be absorbed by the soil however those areas seem too large to make this a likely cause the blue stripe at the top margin of the 26 june image indicates wind drift of water from the neighbouring field during irrigation on 24 july bottom maps in figs 11 and 12 we can see that the rd treatment 35 fc plots have relatively low stress and large θ values indeed those plots had been irrigated just two days before table 2 and were during the time of image capture at about 60 70 fc one may notice a border effect from the neighbouring treatment caused by the used irrigation method nozzle cart the nozzles spray up to 9 m and can spray some of the water in the neighbouring parcel for that reason only the centre part of the parcel is harvested that receives the exact amount of irrigation water as planned one can also notice an uneven water distribution within the parcels likely due to wind drift by southerly winds during the irrigation on 24 july the other rd treatment cwsi 0 65 had not yet received irrigation and indicates severe drought stress and low soil water content less than 30 fc the op treatments show intermediate drought stress at somewhat higher sm values compared to the cwsi 0 65 treatment the 50 fc treatment was irrigated on the following day 4 6 suitability of thermal sensing in humid zones the sensitivity of crop water stress index is affected by cloudy conditions hence the use of cwsi is valid only under clear sky conditions gardner et al 1992a 1992b dejonge et al 2015 in humid regions however the number of clear sky high rg days are highly limited in wet years 2019 fig 8 compared to a dry year 2018 fig 7 this limits the use of cwsi in humid regions to periods with favourable atmospheric conditions even on days with high mean rg high hourly fluctuations in rg due to clouds may lead to low cwsi values and an underestimation of stress agam et al 2013a irmak et al 2000 given these limitations the use of an artificial wet lower limit and dry upper limit reference has been recommended by jones 1999 in computing cwsi in humid regions the approach is based on the concept that both reference surfaces change with corresponding change in canopy temperature under all atmospheric conditions however reference surfaces may not always be available and have been known to fail or disturbed by the meteorological factors jones 1999 gerhards et al 2018 bian et al 2019 alternatively an adaptive cwsi algorithm has been developed by osroosh et al 2015 and has been shown to be effective in irrigation scheduling on cool and humid days the algorithm estimates dynamic reference temperatures upper and lower limits which adjust for temporary weather conditions and avoid erroneous irrigation signals osroosh et al 2015 such a system can be tested and may prove useful in humid regions 5 conclusion irrigation experiments over two years were carried out to analyse the suitability of three crop water stress indices in monitoring water stress and assess their potential use in monitoring volumetric soil water content in humid sub humid environments results revealed that all cwsi models responded to variable irrigation treatments and showed good relationships with volumetric soil water content especially when irrigation experiments and measurements are properly done in general cwsie models performed better than cwsit and cwsih cwsi θ relations calibrated in one year could effectively predicted θ in another year with little errors of 1 2 for practical purposes cwsih could be a promising alternative to the traditional cwsi cwsie and cwsit models since it requires the least amount of input variables the research demonstrates the propensity to accurately monitor field soil moisture conditions under ideal i e high radiation dry air environmental conditions using tir observations the cwsi models could therefore be used for water stress monitoring and irrigation advice thereby complementing or replacing traditional plant and soil water content measurements in humid sub humid environments the possibility of application on a daily basis may however be limited by the limited number of cloud free days in a normal year although a few methods addressing this issue have been reported so far more studies need to be carried out on their usefulness and new models need to be developed before cwsi can be widely used for stress monitoring and irrigation management in energy limited humid zones with the future candidate tir missions to space the copernicus lstm land surface temperature monitoring and the nasa sbg surface biology and geology missions that will provide spatially continuous lst information at field scale water stress indices are expected to face a wider

9474,different types of the crop water stress index cwsi have been useful for water stress monitoring and irrigation management in semi arid regions however little research exists on its effective application in humid regions this study aims to assess the effectiveness of three cwsi models cwsie empirical cwsit theoretical cwsih hybrid for crop water stress monitoring in an experimental field for potato crops in northern germany irrigation experiments with three treatments optimum op reduced rd and no were conducted in the summer of 2018 and 2019 continuous canopy temperatures tc for op and rd irrigation treatments together with meteorological measurements were used to derive cwsi from the different models additionally visible near infrared vnir and thermal infrared tir drone images were collected on several days during the growing season to create cwsi maps the different cwsi models were correlated with volumetric soil water content θ measurements for comparison and relationships were established between cwsi and θ for prediction results showed that cwsi accurately estimates soil water content under atmospheric conditions similar to those in semi arid regions the predictive performance of different cwsi models were fairly good r2 0 57 0 63 situation in 2019 cwsie and cwsih performed better than cwsit cwsi θ relations calibrated in one year effectively predicted θ in another year with errors of 1 2 2 2 absolute soil water content cwsih could be a promising alternative to the traditional cwsi as it combines aspects of cwsie empirical upper limit and of cwsit theoretical lower limit which has advantages for operational use finally the drone based cwsi and θ maps derived from the developed cwsi θ relations captured well the applied irrigation patterns and could help to decide when to irrigate and how much water to apply keywords stress detection soil water content uav drone humid regions irrigation hybrid cwsi 1 introduction irrigation is the biggest user of freshwater on earth however a large proportion of irrigation water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation systems cohen et al 2017 water supply for irrigation is expected to decrease due to frequent droughts and increased competition from other industries around the world alvino and marino 2017 hence there is a need for improved irrigation management to optimize irrigation water use while maximizing crop yield rud et al 2014 cohen et al 2017 han et al 2018 crop water status is an important water stress indicator used in irrigation management cohen et al 2017 han et al 2018 although soil based methods for assessing crop water status are more widely used there is a growing interest in plant based methods jones and vaughan 2010 because they serve as a direct proxy of actual plant water status whereas soil water content measurements only provide an indirect linkage canopy temperature tc is a good indicator for water status due to its inverse relation to the rate of canopy water loss which in turn is closely linked to stomatal conductance jones and vaughan 2010 hence thermal infrared tir sensing of tc has been a useful tool for monitoring water stress alvino and marino 2017 han et al 2018 bian et al 2019 however the sensitivity of tc to changing weather conditions led to the development of crop water stress index cwsi which considers the effects of air temperature ta and other meteorological variables such as vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws and available energy the crop water stress index cwsi has been proven to be effective in water stress monitoring and in irrigation management dejonge et al 2015 alvino and marino 2017 its main advantage over pure tc measurements is that it accounts for meteorological variables mainly ta and vpd while tc alone is sensitive to highly fluctuating environmental factors inoue et al 1990 which makes cwsi a more suitable measure of water stress cwsi is based on a solid theoretical base idso et al 1981 and it normalises tc firstly by the actual difference between canopy and air temperature known as canopy to air temperature difference tc ta or catd and secondly by the tc ta of fully transpiring and non transpiring crops commonly referred to as the lower and upper limits respectively jackson et al 1981 different models to calculate cwsi have been developed based on differences in how the upper and lower limits are derived maes and steppe 2012 the empirical cwsi cwsie idso et al 1981 model establishes a relationship between tc ta and vpd from which the lower limit known as the non water stressed baseline nwsb idso et al 1981 is derived the main advantage of cwsie is that it requires the measurement of only three variables tc ta and vpd for its application however the nwsb is highly sensitive to changes of climate variables such as radiation and wind speed jackson et al 1988 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 yearly differences in nwsbs have also been reported for the same crop in the same field horst et al 1989 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 han et al 2018 hence the use of baselines derived from one year across multiple years has been questioned additionally a robust nwsb is usually derived at the end of the growing season from multiple cloud free days gardner et al 1992a 1992b which makes the near real time application of cwsi challenging for day to day stress measurements during the growing season the theoretical cwsi cwsit jackson et al 1981 model presents an alternative method for calculating the upper and lower limits from equations based on a combination of the penman monteith and the energy balance equation it offers an improvement to cwsie by including additional atmospheric parameters net radiation rn wind speed ws and canopy resistance rc which are not considered in the cwsie jackson et al 1981 1988 cwsit in principle is advantageous over cwsie for practical use in day to day water stress monitoring since its upper and lower limits are derived from equations applied for the same environmental conditions at the time of tc measurement jackson et al 1988 nevertheless cwsit has a number of disadvantages firstly problems attributed to the proper estimation of aerodynamic resistance ra from wind speed were noted by jackson et al 1988 and has been shown to significantly affect final cwsit values stockle and dugas 1992 agam et al 2013b secondly net radiation rn is another important input variable required however which is not directly measured in many weather stations and therefore needs to be estimated from meteorological variables berni et al 2009 accurate estimation of aerodynamic resistance ra poses challenges as estimates depend on the empirical parameterization of surface roughness and atmospheric stability corrections which further requires a number of site specific parameters paul et al 2014 mallick et al 2016 2018 and has led to errors in the final cwsi estimates berni et al 2009 given the limitations associated with deriving ra a method that eliminates the need for estimating ra could improve the accuracy of cwsi rud et al 2014 demonstrated that the use of empirical upper limits together with theoretical lower limits did not affect the accuracy of final cwsi values and agam et al 2013a recommended its use for practical purposes the use of empirical upper and theoretical lower limits to calculate cwsi is further investigated and is referred to as hybrid cwsi model cwsih henceforth the development and early application of cwsi was done on point based tc measurements but has been adapted and applied to high resolution thermal imagery for assessing the spatial variability of crop water status jones 1992 maes and steppe 2012 agam et al 2013b direct image based models involving different ways of deriving the upper and lower limits jones 1992 1999 fuentes et al 2012 padhi et al 2012 gerhards et al 2018 theoretical models with direct application of theoretical equations from jackson et al 1988 and hybrid models with a fixed upper limit depending on crop type and theoretical lower limit have widely been applied to tir images jones 1999 1992 möller et al 2006 rud et al 2014 hoffmann et al 2016 the applicability of cwsi for water stress monitoring depends on demonstrating that it can accurately and reliably replace soil and plant based water status indicators in agricultural fields and that it is appropriate for stress detection in a variety of crops in different climatic zones cohen et al 2017 suitable relationships between cwsi and other indicators are required in order to translate cwsi accurately into water stress estimates which can then serve in irrigation decision support möller et al 2006 cwsi has been shown to exhibit good relationships with direct in situ plant and soil based measures such as soil water content padhi et al 2012 dejonge et al 2015 taghvaeian et al 2014 leaf water potential stomatal conductance and transpiration berni et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2013 cohen et al 2017 han et al 2018 bian et al 2019 in this study relationships between volumetric soil water content θ and thermal stress indices are explored and used to evaluate the performance of indices in monitoring water stress such relationships normally derived from point measurements are potentially transferable to images to represent stress at large spatial scales berni et al 2009 gonzalez dugo et al 2014 rud et al 2014 here established relationships between cwsi and soil water content are transferred to drone images and their accuracy was evaluated to represent the spatial variability of soil water content cwsi was developed to provide a universal method of water stress monitoring for agricultural crops in different climatic zones jackson et al 1988 and so far has been proven to be robust in many arid and semi arid regions around the globe and for different agricultural crops meron et al 2013 dejonge et al 2015 cohen et al 2017 liu et al 2020 however little research has been carried out so far to test its applicability in humid and sub humid regions including possible linkages of cwsi with soil water content although vegetation in these regions is also susceptible to water stress in order to be considered a truly universal approach it s robustness must be tested across a broad range of climatic and aridity zones jones 1999 investigated the potential use of infrared thermometry in cooler humid climates and hoffmann et al 2016 in their studies in western denmark proved that cwsi could accurately represent the water status of barley in the present study we test the suitability of cwsi in potatoes as a tool for irrigation support in a temperate humid zone of northern germany the objectives of this study were to derive and assess the performance of three cwsi models cwsie cwsit cwsih as a proxy for crop water stress through relations with volumetric soil water content θ assess the transferability of derived cwsi θ relations from one year to another year and its applicability to drone based cwsi images for mapping soil water content at field scale discuss the suitability of crop water stress index as a water stress indicator in a humid region on potato a crop susceptible to water stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental setup and design the experiment was carried out in hamerstorf in northern germany 52 54 36 n 10 27 36 e 65 m a s l a site with annual rain totals of 622 mm and mean annual air temperature of 8 8 c and with silty sand being the primary soil type the experimental site belongs to the agricultural chamber of lower saxony landwirtschaftskammer niedersachsen lwk which has been conducting irrigation experiments for more than 13 years with the main objective to assess the effect of irrigation intensities representing different levels of water stress on crop yield the experimental data has been collected within the project sensor based irrigation control in potatoes which ran from 2016 to 2019 with the main aim to use canopy temperature for irrigation decision support and how the techniques can be implemented into agricultural operating systems meinardi et al 2021 this study investigates the effect of different irrigation water treatments on potato crops carried out over two years 2018 and 2019 the variety in each year was amanda the root depth has not been measured but the assumption was that the maximum root depth of the potato plant is 60 cm former measurements of soil water content at different depths showed water extraction by the root at a maximal depth of 60 cm the potato crops were planted on a 270 m x 42 m field divided into 120 plots representing 2 different irrigation treatments 2 different potash fertilization regimes 4 repetitions of each treatment and 2 auxiliary plots for each of the 40 experimental plots of 9 m x 6 75 m with a planting density of 4 plants per square meter on 9 rows of ridges in each plot each plot had a total length of 27 m where only the 9 m in the middle are harvested net harvest plot three different types of irrigation treatments were implemented based on the desired percent of usable field capacity nfk table 1 developed based on experiences from long term irrigation experiments carried out by lwk optimum irrigation op hereafter with 50 nfk also referred to as cwsi 0 5 means a good water supply for the plants with no relevant drought stress aiming at highest possible yield reduced irrigation rd hereafter with 35 nfk also referred to as cwsi 0 65 means temporary drought stress with possible effects on yield aiming at a reduced water and energy consumption and no irrigation as control treatment the control treatment will not be regarded for cwsi measurement in this paper a nozzle cart with a boom made by beinlich ulmen germany 1 1 https www beinlich beregnung de was used for irrigation the adjustment of the retraction velocity of the cart was made based on water pressure water amount per hour and nozzle width the true amount of water was controlled with 4 customary plastic rain gauges along the irrigation width the deviation of the given amount was approx 2 mm the decision on when and amount to irrigate was based on weekly bi weekly gravimetric soil water content θg measurements in combination with transpiration amounts for the following days according to the weather forecast from dwd german weather service water balance method according to hartmann et al 2000 the root zone was considered as 60 cm depth from top of dam 45 cm below planting depth at development stadium bbch 55 first bud 5 mm final irrigation dates and amounts are presented in table 2 irrigation treatments started on 42 days after planting for op plots and 45 days for rd plots in 2018 and 52 days after planting for op plots and 69 days for rd plots in 2019 both set approximately at the beginning of inflorescence emergence and tuber formation in 2018 and 2019 respectively because these are the periods when water consumption by potato is highest dalla costa et al 1997 gerhards et al 2016 with the exception of op in 2019 when irrigation started at the beginning of tuber initiation for quality reasons 2 2 canopy temperature soil water content and meteorological measurements six thermal infrared thermometers irt thünen institute in house development and construction based on the sensor chip melexis mlx90614 with massive aluminium housing special electronics for modbus protocol usage and additional radiation shielding were set up at six plots to record continuous canopy temperatures tc of three rd cwsi 0 65 and three op cwsi 0 5 replications from june to september for each year tc was recorded every 3 seconds and averaged over 30 minutes only tc data in the timespan from 11 am to 3 pm central european summer time cest were used in this study unless indicated else this is 9 38 am to 1 38 pm local solar time the mean of the three op or rd replications were used for stress analysis the irts had a thermal resolution of 0 02 k their field of view angle was 35 to ensure that only pure tc was monitored even before full canopy closure irts were installed at an oblique angle of 60 to nadir so that their field of view captured only vegetation irts were mounted at 2 m above ground resulting in an elliptical measurement area of about 5 m2 per sensor at ground level irts were positioned at the northern border of each plot pointing towards south the emissivity was set to 1 despite the fact that real dense crop canopies have slightly lower emissivity and background sky radiation should be taken into account for precise irt measurements no canopy temperature was measured in the non irrigated plots from previous experiments it was known that non irrigated potato plants almost never arrive at full canopy cover on the sandy soil thus prohibiting any valid canopy temperature measurement by irts growing potatoes without irrigation does not occur on real production fields in the local irrigation region continuous volumetric soil water content θ measurements were made with two sentek enviroscan sensors sentek sensor technologies australia at positions ir1 and ir2 fig 1 to represent soil moisture conditions for rd and op respectively both enviroscan sensor tubes contained 6 sensors and were placed covering the top 60 cm soil profile in intervals of 10 cm θ measurements for 2018 and 2019 were carried out at two different locations in 2018 the soil moisture sensors were placed in the valley between two ridges and in 2019 soil moisture measurements were done at the top of the ridge where the potato plant grows additionally gravimetric water content θg measurements for the top 0 30 cm bottom 30 60 cm and full 0 60 cm soil profile were made following a standard protocol wessolek et al 2009 approximately every 1 2 weeks at 2 locations each representing an op or rd treatment 3 samples were taken per plot followed by mixing and scaling the samples before putting them into a drying oven for approximately 20 hrs at 105 c then scaling the samples again soil density field capacity 15 18 volume for 0 30 cm depth 11 14 for 30 60 cm depth and permanent wilting point approx 3 4 vol were estimated based on soil texture wessolek et al 2009 soil texture varied between the plots it was estimated for each sample separately by hand finger test the highest fc and pwp values occurred in the upper soil 0 30 cm due to the higher soil organic carbon content 1 5 meteorological measurements of air temperature ta solar radiation rg relative humidity rh and wind speed ws were measured every 2 minutes at position ir1 in the field fig 1 daily rainfall was recorded at a weather station located on the experimental site additional meteorological parameters such as vapor pressure deficit vpd and net radiation rn were calculated according to allen et al 1998 1994a 1994b and ground heat flux gn was estimated for wet soils according to santanello and friedl 2003 summary of meteorological conditions for the two years of the experiment are shown in table 3 2 3 unmanned aerial system uas image acquisition and processing visible near infrared vnir and thermal infrared tir images over the plot data were collected on four days in the growing season of 2019 19 june at 13 45 26 june at 15 15 24 july 14 10 and 24 august at 10 30 12 00 13 50 and 15 20 each flight lasted for approximately 20 30 minutes along 8 flight lines per field the flight lines were programmed to have 70 side overlap and flight altitude was set to 60

five spectral bands i e blue green red red edge and near infrared nir details on different bands wavelengths and bandwidths are shown in table 4 the camera setup includes a gps module which allows geotagging every single image collected a downwelling light sensor dls in the camera monitors varying illumination conditions during light overcast a reflectance calibration target with a set of 5 panels coated with differing grey intensities and whose reflectance spectra had been measured in a laboratory was installed next to the fields and was used for image calibration and correction downwelling radiation measured with the dls were used to correct for varying illumination conditions in every single frame the raw dn images then underwent photogrammetric processing in agisoft metashape resulting in georeferenced orthomosaic images a step and band wise empirical line correction was used to convert dn to surface reflectance values linear relationships fitted between image dn and surface reflectance values from the calibration panels were used to develop prediction equations with r2 values greater than 0 9 for surface reflectance calibration for each date and band thermal infrared tir images were captured using the thermalcapture fusion zoom camera https thermalcapture com thermalcapture fusion zoom 50mm the camera contains a thermal flir tau 2 core with a thermal resolution of 0 05 k and records gps positions image data with a spatial resolution of 640 512 pixels was collected with 9 hz frequency conversion of digital numbers dn to brightness temperature bt was carried out in teax thermoviewer using an assumed emissivity of 1 raw images were selected to have 80 front overlap and were subjected to a photogrammetric processing workflow using agisoft metashape canopy temperatures tc were retrieved from bt according to the two step process described in heinemann et al 2020 first land surface emissivity lse maps were derived from ndvi and then the derived lse used to calculate tc accuracy of the retrieved tc from the drone data was verified against ground thermometers at positions of irt sensors ir 1 6 fig 1 after extraction of pure image tc using ndvi masking zhang et al 2019 results gave an r2 value of 0 71 and rmse of 2 1 c 2 4 crop water stress index cwsi cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 was defined according to 1 cwsi tc ta tc ta ll tc ta ul tc ta ll where tc ta is the measured temperature difference between canopy and air in c tc ta ll is the lower boundary representing a non water stressed condition tc ta ul is the upper reference under non transpiring conditions for a well watered crop cwsi value is close to 0 whereas for the crop under severe water stress condition cwsi value is close to 1 several different models for cwsi estimation have been developed based on the different methods of calculating the tc ta ll and tc ta ul han et al 2018 2 4 1 empirical cwsi cwsie according to the empirical model in idso et al 1981 tc ta follows a linear relationship with vpd fig 2 when crops are sufficiently well irrigated a regression line the so called non water stressed baseline nwsb which is equivalent to tc ta ll can be derived according to eq 2 as 2 tc ta ll avpd b where coefficients a and b are determined by linear regression of the scatterplot between tc ta versus vpd and tc ta ll is the nwsb to achieve the linear relationship represented in fig 2 to be applied in eq 2 two methods have typically been established gardner et al 1992a 1992b and were used in this study a single day method where diurnal measurements from a well watered crop are taken throughout a day to capture a wide range of tc ta and vpd values a plot of tc ta vs vpd is done and a negative linear regression line can be fitted from the period sometime after sunrise and sunset as shown in fig 2 idso et al 1981 gardner et al 1992a 1992b to establish the tc ta ll using the empirical single day method in this study days with sufficient difference between op and rd treatments established through soil water content differences were selected the relationships between tc ta against vpd throughout the day was examined and days in which suitable negative linear relationships could be established after sunrise and before sunset as demonstrated in fig 2 were used to obtain parameters for the nwsb and eq 2 maximum tc ta from stressed crops were used for tc ta ul b multi day method in which measurements can be made for well watered crops on several days in a growing season usually at the exact same time 1 2 hours around solar noon when vpd is maximum when water stress is likely to be the highest gardner et al 1992a 1992b irmak et al 2000 to establish the tc ta ll with the multi day method tc and vpd measurements were selected on several cloud free days from op treatments 1 and 2 days after irrigation and significant rain event 11 mm between 11 and 15 h cest idso et al 1981 han et al 2018 parameters for the nwsb were generated from the negative linear relationship established between tc ta and vpd cloud free days were considered to be days where the ratio of incoming solar radiation to clear sky solar radiation rso was greater than 0 7 taghvaeian et al 2012 tc ta ul was calculated according to eq 3 the non transpiring baseline ntb fig 2 can be based on maximum tc measurements of an extremely stressed crop or equivalent to determination of the nwsb based on eq 3 han et al 2018 3 tc ta ul avpg b where a and b are the slope and intercepts derived from eq 2 and vpg is vapor pressure gradient defined as the difference between the saturation vapor pressure evaluated at air temperature ta and at a higher air temperature equal to air temperature plus b ta b as shown in eq 4 allen et al 1998 han et al 2018 4 vpg 6 1 e 17 27 ta b ta b 237 3 6 1 e 17 27 ta ta 237 3 2 4 2 theoretical cwsi cwsit theoretical cwsi is based on equations derived from the combination of penman monteith equation and the energy balance equation jackson et al 1981 5 tc ta r a rn g ρ c p γ 1 r c r a δ γ 1 r c r a vpd δ γ 1 r c r a where cp is the heat capacity of air j kg 1 c vpd is the air vapour pressure pa γ

empirical and theoretical cwsi models show clear drawbacks empirical approaches require suitable environmental conditions and theoretical models require estimates of resistance terms and accurate net radiation calculations the non transpiring baseline tc ta ul shows a weaker dependence on environmental conditions e g vpd compared to the non water stressed baseline tc ta ll it is also challenging to observe fully transpiring vegetation under high evaporative demand high rn and vpd as also well watered vegetation can show reduced transpiration under such conditions accordingly determination of the non transpiring baseline in the empirical method is more consistent between years and relies less on identifying suitable days see section 3 if at least some dry periods are observed during the growing season we propose using an empirical estimate of the non transpiring baseline to calculate the non water stressed baseline from a theorical model substituting eq 7 in eq 8 shows that with a known tc ta ul the tc ta ll can be derived without the need to estimate ra rn and g leading to a simplification 9 tc ta ll tc ta ul γ δ γ vpd δ γ for the hybrid method a fixed upper baseline developed from the empirical method was used 2 4 4 statistical analysis canopy temperature and meteorological variables can change quickly within a few seconds hence all measured values were averaged over 30 min to level out short term fluctuations for example values at solar noon 13 19 cest in this analysis is the average of measured data from 13 04 13 34 cest days on which irrigation was done or the total rain was 1 0 mm were not included since the wet surface of the leaves can falsify the temperature measurement for all analysis cwsi values for the three indices cwsie cwsit cwsih were calculated for each ir 1 6 sensor and averaged only after calculation plots and analysis are presented only for full cover periods 20 june 08 august 2018 and 19 june 06 august 2019 since it can be largely ensured during this period that little or no soil was visible in the measuring range of the sensor other researchers applied similar restrictions e g when canopy cover was larger than 70 dejonge et al 2015 or when crop coverage in the field of view of irts was larger than 80 han et al 2018 pearson correlation coefficients r between midday 11 00 15 00 h cest cwsi and measured soil water content θ at 10 cm depth was used to evaluate the suitability of the indices in monitoring water stress since θ measurements were taken only at positions ir1 and ir2 representing one rd and op treatments respectively only tc and the three cwsi models developed for these 2 treatments were used to establish relationships with θ to predict θ from cwsi exponential relationships were established for cwsi and θ for one year and used to predict θ for the other year and for tc images relationships buit in 2019 were used to generate θ maps 3 results 3 1 establishment of non water stressed baseline and non transpiring baseline diurnal patterns for op and rd treatments for the two representative stressed days 24th july 2018 and 29th june 2019 which were used to establish the lower tc ta ll and upper tc ta ul baselines for the empirical single day method are presented in fig 3 24th july 2018 was one day after rd irrigation on 23 july and five days after op on 19 july events hence rd was less stressed on this day and thus was used to establish the tc ta ll in 2019 on the other hand op with irrigations on 21 and 27 june and rd irrigation on 21 june representing stressed and unstressed conditions respectively on 29 june were used to establish appropriate tc ta ll and tc ta ul linear regression models were fitted for the negative tc ta vpd relationship for the unstressed crop between 9 and 17 h cest for both years only slight differences exist for the slope and intercept in both years table 5 while the r2 values were significantly different from each other 2018 0 83 and 2019 0 98 the tc ta ul were significantly different for each year but a suitable tc ta ul could not be established in 2018 since the maximum tc ta for op which was stressed on this day was only 1 2 c which is not a reasonable value for potatoes fig 3 the tc ta ll equations fitted for the tc ta vpd relationships considering the multi day method were significant for both years with r2 values 0 88 and 0 83 p 0 001 fig 4 table 5 for 2018 and 2019 respectively while the empirical tc ta ll and tc ta ul parameters derived from single day and multi day methods were significantly different from each other they were relatively invariant between years when each method is considered individually the tc ta ul and r2 from the multi day method were very similar to each other table 5 and could be more useful in establishing suitable baselines for application across multiple years given this advantage and the higher stability that is provided by multi day methods gardner et al 1992 the final cwsie was estimated from limits derived from the multi day method additionally the mean value of tc ta ul from 2018 and 2019 multi day method 5 7 c was used to calculate cwsih which is close to the value 5 c used by gerhards et al 2016 for potato crops in germany derived tc ta ul and tc ta ll from the three cwsi models cwsie cwsit and cwsih are presented in fig 5 as previously mentioned tc ta ul used for the hybrid method was the mean tc ta ul from the multi day empirical method for 2018 and 2019 hence they are only slightly different from the empirical upper limits in both years for the theoretical method only the mean tc ta ul is shown as it has a different value for each data point the tc ta ll values from the theoretical and hybrid models have similar curved patterns with higher scatter and lower values than those of the empirical method the effect of the different limits affects the final cwsi models values since the lower baseline tc ta ll for cwsie was derived as the average of real tc ta values on 17 days 2018 resp 11 days 2019 with well watered condition for the reason of numerical stability its values are higher than the virtual tc ta of an ideal optimally watered crop 3 2 relationships between soil water content and cwsi volumetric soil water content θ measurements were used as the basis to assess the suitability of the different cwsi models to represent stress conditions the temporal dynamics of θ at 10 cm and 20 cm depth showed good correspondence with both rain and irrigation events fig 6 with θ values increasing sharply after each irrigation or rain event and slowly decreasing with soil drying until the next event in 2018 θ at 10 and 20 cm depth showed similar variability while in 2019 θ at 10 cm depth was more variable than θ at 20 cm depth this is likely due to the measurement position of the sensors previous unpublished research work of lwk revealed that only little irrigation water percolates under the top of the ridge in 2018 maximum and minimum θ values for op and rd mostly had the same magnitude throughout the season in 2019 however absolute θ values of the op treatment remained above the θ values of the rd treatment the seasonal course of daily midday from 11h to 15h cest values of the three cwsi models together with θ irrigation and significant rain 5 mm events in 2018 are examined fig 7 all cwsi models showed expected variations with respect to soil water content irrigation and rain however the pattern is not observable throughout the season but can be seen only at certain periods only periods with relatively high rg and vpd rg 600 wm 2 and vpd 20hpa grey background fig 7 have this response implying that the crop must experience high radiative heating and atmospheric demand for the expected cwsi responses to occur considering only these periods mean cwsi values for rd were marginally higher than for op irrigation with values for cwsie cwsit and cwsih being 0 18 0 34 and 0 49 and 0 15 0 32 and 0 47 respectively table 6 the effect of higher tc ta ll for cwsie method section 3 1 fig 5 can be seen in its significantly smaller mean values compared to cwsit and cwsih most tc ta values fall below the tc ta ll causing most of cwsie values to be negative and lowering the mean values in fig 7 upper plot rd in the dry period between doy 190 and doy 204 an inverse relationship between soil moisture sm and cwsi can be observed at doy 190 sm is high 25 blue circle and corresponding cwsi values are low at values close to or below 0 red triangle black dot green dot then during this dry period sm declines from 25 to 7 at doy 204 while cwsi increase to values around 0 4 0 7 depending on cwsi type similar behaviour is present in the same plot for period doy 170 182 or in the fig 7 lower plot op during period doy 190 204 similar seasonal dynamics in θ and daily midday cwsi models are also observed in 2019 fig 8 with higher cwsi values table 6 for rd cwsie 0 5 cwsit 0 46 cwsih 0 61 than op cwsie 0 26 cwsit 0 32 cwsih 0 45 like in 2018 only periods with relatively high rg and vpd show good response however the length of these periods were shorter and limited in 2019 two periods where such patterns are clearly visible are the periods from 20 june 3rd july doy 171 184 grey background in fig 8 and 23 28 th july 2019 doy 204 209 grey background in fig 8 pearson correlation coefficients r between tc and the three different cwsi models at midday 11 00 15 00 h cest and θ at 10 cm depth are shown in table 7 to show the effects of the meteorological conditions on thermal measurements correlations are shown for all the observations and periods when rg 600 wm 2 and vpd 20hpa grey background fig 7 8 correlation coefficients are also shown for all irrigation treatments rd op combined and when they are considered separately for all considerations r was higher for periods with rg 600 wm 2 and vpd 20hpa than when all observations are considered also r was higher for rd than op treatments for both years although better correlations exist for rd op and rd in 2019 than 2018 3 3 estimating of θ from cwsi scatter plots of mean daily midday tc and cwsi vs 10 cm θ are presented in fig 9 from the scatter plots and summary statistics table 6 it can be observed that θ and index values for op and rd treatments were not significantly different from each other in 2018 while clear distinctions exist between rd and op θ in 2019 hence tc and all cwsi models were different from each other r2 values were poor in 2018 r2 0 4 and good in 2019 r2 0 6 even for tc a comparison between the predicted θ and measured θ is presented in fig 10 predicted θ for 2018 from relationships in 2019 were generally better r2 0 5 rmse 2 for all cwsi models while predictions of 2019 from 2018 were poor r2 0 4 rmse 2 for both cases considered in figs 9 and 10 cwsie had the best performance for both models 3 4 application to thermal images cwsih was computed on the drone images replacing irt based tc with drone based tc in eq 1 environmental conditions during the drone flights are given in table 8 cwsih maps for three experimental days 19 june 26 june and 24 july are shown in fig 11 data collected on 24 august was not analysed further since most of the leaves were dried up by this date and images mostly captured soil temperature on the 19th of june spatial variability of cwsi due to irrigation treatments is not reflected in the maps however on 26 june and 24 july spatial patterns are clearly visible and reflect the corresponding irrigation this confirms the previous results that spatial cwsi patterns can reflect the patterns of plant available soil water the visibility of spatial patterns on 26 june and 24 july but not on 19 june is due to absence of rain in the period before image acquisition and the high rg and vpd table 8 on these days which is necessary for stress detection with tir for accurate water stress detection crops must heat up significantly high rg and there must be high atmospheric demand high vpd 3 5 potato yield results yield results are beyond the focus of this paper but are given in table 9 for completeness of the presentation reduced irrigation resulted in a 15 yield reduction in 2018 and 10 yield reduction in 2019 compared to op without any irrigation control treatment yield dropped to 40 of the op treatment in the very dry year 2018 and to 57 in 2019 4 discussion 4 1 non water stressed baseline and non transpiring baseline the r2 values from empirical equations to derive the nwsb tc ta ll and ntb tc ta ul from the single day and multi day methods are within acceptable limits for both methods gardner 1992b reported that for single day methods r2 values should typically be greater than 0 95 while for multi day methods r2 values around 0 6 and 0 7 are acceptable recent studies such as taghvaeian et al 2012 and berni et al 2009 had r2 values of 0 98 and 0 67 for single and multi day methods respectively nevertheless r2 value for the tc ta ll in 2018 was 0 83 less than 0 98 obtained in 2019 differences in slope and intercept were also recorded between both years 2018 2019 differences between consecutive years for the same crop in the same place have also been reported in other studies gonzalez dugo et al 2014 reported different values for intercept slope and r2 for their three year experiment 2009 2010 2011 for mandarin and orange trees dejonge et al 2015 and taghvaeian et al 2012 made similar observations for maize such differences have been attributed to climatic conditions between different years crop growth stages differences in transpiration rate and water uptake potential between years and instrument parameters such as irt view angles gonzalez dugo et al 2014 han et al 2018 in this study the differences in climatic conditions 2018 was drier than 2019 and crop growth stage suitable day for single day empirical method in 2018 was 24 july which was at late stages of tuber development while 2019 was 29 june which was in the flowering stage table 2 likely caused the differences in slope and intercept the tc ta ul were significantly different for each year which could be attributed to the level of stress and the amount of radiation available on the selected days the stressed crop in 2019 had three additional days of stress compared to 2018 the low tc ta ul of 2018 1 2 c from the single day method does not represent the maximum stress conditions for potatoes because the op irrigation was not under severe stress hence cannot be used as a reliable tc ta ul in such cases where a reliable upper limit cannot be derived from irrigation treatments and no other data is available a constant tc ta ul value of 5 0 c is recommended for use taghvaeian et al 2014 typically tc ta ul is derived from severely stressed crops under ideal conditions idso et al 1981 irmak et al 2000 dejonge et al 2015 however al faraj et al 2001 observed that this may not be suitable for all cases even under controlled experiments hence the application of the baseline equation eq 3 comes in handy in such cases also the use of mean and maximum upper limit values for cwsit and cwsie as indicated in fig 5 has been widely applied the higher tc ta ll values from the empirical method presented in fig 5 can be attributed to the experimental setup where op and rd irrigation amounts are set at 50 and 35 field capacity respectively typically the tc ta ll is derived from irrigation treatments with 100 plant available water or field capacity resulting in much lower tc ta ll values the irrigation treatments in this experiment therefore cannot represent conditions for well watered crops and the derived parameters may be suboptimal as reported by al faraj et al 2001 in tall fescue although irmak et al 2000 had obtained suitable lower baselines for corn even at 50 available water holding capacity which was expected to be the case in this study since within the first two days after 20 30 mm irrigation table 2 the water availability was unrestricted for both of the treatments 4 2 soil water content cwsi relations the results from the conducted analysis demonstrate that cwsi models can be used to monitor crop and soil water status and dynamics cwsi was expected to be high during water stress low θ and decrease during recovery after rain irrigation additionally op treatments were also expected to be less stressed than rd irrigation treatments both expectations are generally met in this study for all three models however good cwsi dynamics and correlations are only observable obtained under certain meteorological conditions with high rg and vpd during high radiative heating and high atmospheric demand table 7 poor dynamics and correlations for the whole study period is due to the presence of cloudy conditions with low rg and vpd on certain days and the relationships greatly improve under dry conditions only high rg and vpd similar results have also been documented by agam et al 2013a important requirements in obtaining strong cwsi θ relationships are the accurate measurement of soil water content and variation from dry to wet conditions in this experiment soil water content measurements for 2018 and 2019 were carried out at two different locations in 2018 the soil moisture sensors were placed in the valley between two ridges and in 2019 soil moisture measurements were done at the top of the ridge where the potato plant grows the effect of this disparity can be seen in fig 6 where the difference in 10 and 20 cm soil water content for 2018 were mostly the same while for 2019 there is a huge difference in soil water content between both depths irrigation water and rain applied at the top of the ridge tends to infiltrate mainly into the valley the infiltration on the top of the ridge is much less and mostly restricted to the top centimetres of the ridge hence high variability of soil at the 10 cm depth while the 20 cm is more stable it would be desirable to provide a soil water content threshold for beginning water stress this is however difficult to estimate as the choice of cwsi model affects the results and due to limits in measurement accuracy cwsi is rarely exactly 0 even for unstressed vegetation the most reliable method in this case would be to treat a certain percentile of the lowest cwsi values observed in a season as unstressed from the data shown in fig 9 this seems to be around 12 15 volumetric soil water content which corresponds to a depletion fraction for no stress similar to fao56 of 0 2 0 4 assuming pwp 3 and fc 18 which is somewhat lower than the fao56 recommended value of 0 35 for potatoes allen et al 1998 4 3 comparison of cwsi models several studies have shown that cwsi is a better indicator of water stress than tc berni et al 2009 gerhards et al 2019 however while this was the case in 2018 the cwsi models did not provide significant improvement for 2019 an observation which was also made by dejonge et al 2015 with respect to the different cwsi models some studies comparing the different models have shown cwsie to perform better than cwsit agam et al 2013b liu et al 2020 and others have shown similar performance for cwsie and cwsit for olives ben gal et al 2009 and for potato in particular rud et al 2014 in this study cwsie performed slightly better than cwsit and cwsih in representing and predicting soil water content improvements in cwsit can be made by using a seasonal average ra which can reduce uncertainty for the different growth stages and instantaneous atmospheric effects jackson et al 1988 han et al 2018 although it is expected that cwsi should be a better indicator than direct tc dejonge et al 2015 found out that tc measurements alone without meteorological parameterization were equally capable as cwsi in representing soil moisture deficit under certain conditions and can be used for such instances however cwsi models are still advantageous as they consider meteorological variables and scale the value of stress to quantifiable limits of stress 0 1 unlike simple tc measurements where no absolute limits of stress can be established which is important in practical irrigation scheduling and water stress monitoring situations all meteorological measurements required for estimating cwsi might not be readily available berni et al 2009 and in addition to the limitations of both cwsie and cwsit outlined in section 1 the use of cwsih could be a suitable alternative given that it could easily be applied without further calculations of aerodynamic resistance ra and net radiation additionally cwsih combines the best aspects of cwsie and cwsit and has been recommended by agam et al 2013b as a more practical method for daily monitoring of stress and shown to work well for stress monitoring in potatoes rud et al 2014 nevertheless some level of caution should be observed when assigning fixed upper limit values as index values are sensitive to such values agam et al 2013b the good level of θ predictions from the cwsie and cwsih models mainly in 2019 demonstrate that these indices can be used to simulate and predict irrigation amounts from one year to another when similar meteorological and soil moisture conditions prevail also in other research the use of cwsi θ relations to simulate soil water content θ has been shown to provide reliable soil moisture estimates in the absence of in situ θ measurements taghvaeian et al 2012 liu et al 2020 4 4 application to thermal images in the present study cwsi maps accurately captured the different levels of water stress which reflected the different irrigation treatments in the field although errors in derived tc presumably led to errors in cwsi maps cwsi values from images were generally larger than in situ cwsi values which eventually led to lower estimated soil water content however the accuracy of the final soil moisture maps could not be ultimately verified due to lack of sufficient spatially distributed in situ field measurements tc values were generally higher in the images than in situ tc by about 2 1 c errors in tc from remote sensing images have been attributed to atmospheric effects differences in view angles and accuracy of drone tir sensors and field thermometers song and park 2020 heinemann et al 2020 stressed the importance of accurate estimation of specific emissivity consideration of environmental background temperature and atmospheric transmittance to obtain tc with errors less than 0 05 k additionally co registration inaccuracies between tir and vnir images used for extraction of pure tc may lead to pollution by background signals in the final tc image although various methods of separation of pure tc from background signals of soil and plant shadow exist wang et al 2010 meron et al 2013 and were applied to the images no method has been shown to be completely perfect for pure tc extraction zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 also suggested that tir images could be recalibrated using coefficients derived from linear relationships within situ tc measurements however this method has not been widely applied yet and was not used in the current study relationships derived from in situ measurements and applied to cwsi maps for spatial monitoring have been shown to work well in predicting spatial variations of stress for instance berni et al 2009 produced accurate cwsi maps from canopy conductance derived from high spatial resolution uav thermal imagery and relationships with cwsi have been used to map leaf water potential cohen et al 2005 2017 such maps may be used to estimate available soil water within the crop s root zone so that soil water deficit can be quantified within the field for irrigation scheduling padhi et al 2012 4 5 spatial variations within cwsi and sm soil moisture images on june 19 fig 11 top map there was no water stress despite hot midday temperatures due to 20 mm of rain four days before soil water content was about 50 70 field capacity fc equivalent to 10 5 13 5 volume fig 12 top map june 26 was five days after the last irrigation for both op and rd plots and the previous days were hot and dry with presumably high transpiration rates on the left western side of the field intensive drought stress fig 11 centre map and low soil water content fig 12 bottom map can be observed even in the 50 fc plots in contrast on the right eastern side of the field in the same treatment class 50 fc only mild drought stress and intermediate soil water content values can be observed a possible explanation are differences in soil properties for instance loamy lower soil layers with larger water holding capacity than the otherwise prevalent sandy layers from the loamy soil horizon plants can be supplied with water and show less drought stress despite the topsoil layer being very dry these soil properties tend to increase towards the eastern part right side in figs 11 and 12 of the field smaller areas of mild drought stress can also be seen in the western part of the field these interpretations are supported by analysing the yield of the individual parcels not shown where the yield for the assumed better soil with larger soil water holding capacity in the east end was larger by 10 20 compared with the west end in both treatment variants cwsi 0 5 and fc 50 similar differences in soil properties in the same agricultural field have also been observed by padhi et al 2012 and han et al 2018 which also accounted for the differences in soil water distribution crop growth and crop response to drought stress an alternative explanation could be that in the stressed red coloured areas unfavourable soil properties or poorly developed plants have decreased the rooting depth such that less water can be absorbed by the soil however those areas seem too large to make this a likely cause the blue stripe at the top margin of the 26 june image indicates wind drift of water from the neighbouring field during irrigation on 24 july bottom maps in figs 11 and 12 we can see that the rd treatment 35 fc plots have relatively low stress and large θ values indeed those plots had been irrigated just two days before table 2 and were during the time of image capture at about 60 70 fc one may notice a border effect from the neighbouring treatment caused by the used irrigation method nozzle cart the nozzles spray up to 9 m and can spray some of the water in the neighbouring parcel for that reason only the centre part of the parcel is harvested that receives the exact amount of irrigation water as planned one can also notice an uneven water distribution within the parcels likely due to wind drift by southerly winds during the irrigation on 24 july the other rd treatment cwsi 0 65 had not yet received irrigation and indicates severe drought stress and low soil water content less than 30 fc the op treatments show intermediate drought stress at somewhat higher sm values compared to the cwsi 0 65 treatment the 50 fc treatment was irrigated on the following day 4 6 suitability of thermal sensing in humid zones the sensitivity of crop water stress index is affected by cloudy conditions hence the use of cwsi is valid only under clear sky conditions gardner et al 1992a 1992b dejonge et al 2015 in humid regions however the number of clear sky high rg days are highly limited in wet years 2019 fig 8 compared to a dry year 2018 fig 7 this limits the use of cwsi in humid regions to periods with favourable atmospheric conditions even on days with high mean rg high hourly fluctuations in rg due to clouds may lead to low cwsi values and an underestimation of stress agam et al 2013a irmak et al 2000 given these limitations the use of an artificial wet lower limit and dry upper limit reference has been recommended by jones 1999 in computing cwsi in humid regions the approach is based on the concept that both reference surfaces change with corresponding change in canopy temperature under all atmospheric conditions however reference surfaces may not always be available and have been known to fail or disturbed by the meteorological factors jones 1999 gerhards et al 2018 bian et al 2019 alternatively an adaptive cwsi algorithm has been developed by osroosh et al 2015 and has been shown to be effective in irrigation scheduling on cool and humid days the algorithm estimates dynamic reference temperatures upper and lower limits which adjust for temporary weather conditions and avoid erroneous irrigation signals osroosh et al 2015 such a system can be tested and may prove useful in humid regions 5 conclusion irrigation experiments over two years were carried out to analyse the suitability of three crop water stress indices in monitoring water stress and assess their potential use in monitoring volumetric soil water content in humid sub humid environments results revealed that all cwsi models responded to variable irrigation treatments and showed good relationships with volumetric soil water content especially when irrigation experiments and measurements are properly done in general cwsie models performed better than cwsit and cwsih cwsi θ relations calibrated in one year could effectively predicted θ in another year with little errors of 1 2 for practical purposes cwsih could be a promising alternative to the traditional cwsi cwsie and cwsit models since it requires the least amount of input variables the research demonstrates the propensity to accurately monitor field soil moisture conditions under ideal i e high radiation dry air environmental conditions using tir observations the cwsi models could therefore be used for water stress monitoring and irrigation advice thereby complementing or replacing traditional plant and soil water content measurements in humid sub humid environments the possibility of application on a daily basis may however be limited by the limited number of cloud free days in a normal year although a few methods addressing this issue have been reported so far more studies need to be carried out on their usefulness and new models need to be developed before cwsi can be widely used for stress monitoring and irrigation management in energy limited humid zones with the future candidate tir missions to space the copernicus lstm land surface temperature monitoring and the nasa sbg surface biology and geology missions that will provide spatially continuous lst information at field scale water stress indices are expected to face a wider
