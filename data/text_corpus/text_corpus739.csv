3695,urban surface runoff management via best management practices bmp and low impact development lid has earned significant recognition owing to positive environmental and ecological impacts however due to the complexity of the parameters involved the estimation of lid efficiency in attenuating the urban surface runoff at the watershed scale is challenging a planning analysis of employing green roofs and infiltration trenches as bmps lids practices for urban surface runoff control is presented in this study a multi objective optimization decision making framework is established by coupling swmm storm water management model with nsga ii models to check the performance of bmps lids concerning the cost benefit analysis of lid at the watershed scale two urbanized areas belonging to central delhi in india were used as case studies the results showed that the swmm model is useful in simulating optimization problems for managing urban surface runoff the optimum scenarios efficiently minimized the urban runoff volume while maintaining the bmps lids implementation costs and size with bmps lids implementation the reduction in runoff volume increases as expenses increase initially however there is no noticeable reduction in flood volume after a certain threshold contrasted with the haphazard arrangement of bmps lids the proposed approach demonstrates 22 24 runoff reductions for the same expenditures in watershed 1 and 23 26 in watershed 2 the result of the study provides insights into planning and management of the urban surface runoff control with lid practices the proposed framework assists the hydrologists in optimum selection and placements of bmps lids practices to acquire the most extreme ecological advantages with the least expenses abbreviations swmm storm water

decades controlling stormwater runoff has been a scientific issue but best management practices bmps and low impact developments lids are management and design strategies that help control the stormwater runoff with scientific knowledge ahiablame et al 2012 barbosa et al 2012 damodaram et al 2010 dietz 2007 du et al 2012 kok et al 2013 elliott trowsdale 2007 moglen et al 2003 newcomer et al 2014 pagotto et al 2000 vezzaro et al 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 the transformation of non urbanized rural or pristine land use to urbanized significantly impervious areas is a noteworthy reason for hydrological changes bronstert et al 2002 gunn et al 2012 roy et al 2014 the induced hydrological changes influence different hydrologic processes and components in water resource systems for instance due to the reduction in the pervious areas water cannot precolate to groundwater thus reduceing infiltration which in turn affects groundwater recharge and increases surface runoff brandes et al 2005 newcomer et al 2014 extensive augmentation of surface runoff may increase the probability of urban flooding and deteriorate water quality in the water bodies where it is diverted khan et al 2006 dietz 2007 nevertheless urbanization is still multiplying globally urbanization reduces pervious area and intensifies the quick runoff component leon et al 2014 rangari et al 2020 furthermore during heavy rainfall stormwater is transported by drainage networks from impervious areas to the wastewater treatment plant sewer overflows devices and or receiving water bodies thus causing higher flood events burian pomeroy 2010 rangari et al 2020 nowadays controlling stormwater runoff by connecting directly to drains is becoming less popular due to the evolution of alternate options like bmps lids bmps lids are a green approach to managing stormwater these approaches at least partially save the pre development hydrologic characteristics by employing decentralized small scale control measures hud u s department of housing and urban development 2003 generally the practice of bmps lids includes the local retention of stormwater using control measures like green roofs permeable pavement infiltration trenches and bio retention systems that mimic the existing hydrologic characteristics dietz 2007 ahiablame et al 2012 ahiablame et al 2016 raei et al 2019 these practices impact the hydrology of the watersheds to a great extent by managing the volume of runoff during peak rainfall and improving water quality pagotto et al 2000 damodaram et al 2010 vezzaro et al 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 kok et al 2013 newcomer et al 2014 they are applied in urban areas to control the surface runoff at the source point before it reaches the downstream areas usepa us environmental protection agency 2000 moglen et al 2003 bmps lids have various technical removal effectiveness and non technical cost features usepa u s environmental protection agency 2004 dietz 2007 berndtsson 2010 many studies have been dedicated to quantifying the impacts of bmps lids on different hydrologic components of the watershed bedan clausen 2009 implemented bmps lids practices in waterford connecticut and found a reduction in surface runoff by 42 compared with the pre development stage at the same peak discharge dietz 2007 and ahiablame et al 2012 explored pervious pavement at different geographic areas they demonstrated a decrease in the surface runoff volume and related contamination stacks by interference and filtration ahiablame et al 2013 assessed six series of rain barrel storage and permeable asphalt within two extremely urbanized catchments by applying the long term hydrologic impact assessment low impact development l thia lid model which demonstrated that the execution of various bmps lids strategies brought about 2 to 12 decrease in runoff and pollutant loads however it must be emphasized that the relative flood reduction potential of such local retention measures is a question of the magnitude of the design rainfall concerning the locally retained water volume more significant is the rainfall amount smaller is the proportion of the retained water volume compared to the non retained excess water niehoff bronstert 2001 salazar et al 2012 newcomer et al 2014 in san francisco ca exhibited the advantages of bmps lids on recharge of groundwater on the field based on hydrus 2d model based investigations comings et al 2000 in bellevue wa considered two wet ponds at a residential and commercial location and reported a 19 to 46 decrease in total phosphorus 61 to 81 decrease of total suspended solids and 37 to 76 decrease of metals jia et al 2013 studied the impact of bmps lids using the porous pavement they advised that though it has certain advantages uncertainties associated with it and designing appropriate bmps lids at a catchment scale becomes difficult effective implementation involves investigation efforts to examine and optimize bmps lids features ahiablame et al 2012 to attain maximum ecological advantage the minimizing cost and spatial optimization have turned into a well known multi objective technique that has tradeoff responses for selection and location of bmps lids practices at catchment scales maringanti et al 2009 2011 rodriguez et al 2011 lee et al 2012 mcgarity 2013a 2013b liu et al 2016 spatial optimization solves problems by combining the simulation model with an optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm produces test populaces of likely location situations while the hydrological model calculates the objective functions with the specimen populaces made to get optimal results the spatial optimization approach expects a noteworthy simulation time to finish the simulations of the model owing to the involved complexities in the optimization problems arabi et al 2006 the pseudo simulation model which includes a lookup table has been employed maringanti et al 2011 sudheer et al 2011 to lessen the computational weight this methodology typically lessens the precision of outputs and adds a dimension of uncertainty parallel computing has been extensively employed to decrease recreation time rouholahnejad et al 2012 yalew et al 2013 liu et al 2014 multi objective optimization and scenario investigation have been the two widely employed approaches in probing for an economic strategy however individual hindrances exist for these techniques the planning and implementation strategies of bmps lids practices at catchment scales include clashes between natural concerns and monetary contemplations the available types sites and rates at which to employ the bmps lids practices at a catchment scale are various due to the multifaceted nature of the catchment s soil properties land use and location features in general it is not possible to recognize the performances of every single pair of bmps lids practice at the catchment scale lai et al 2007 besides environmental contemplations and monetary concerns make it difficult to tackle the issue for instance realizing further practices in a given zone would probably have expanded natural advantages as it may the expense to develop and maintain bmps lids practices would increment in the meantime since in the watershed the implementation expenses for the most part have restricted spending plans or a clear ecological effect objective however liu et al 2015 estimated the overall cost in implementing the bmps lids practices at catchment scales using l thia lid 2 1 in the above study considering cost benefit aspects in designing the optimal locations and selecting practices is lacking a productive precise methodology is required for hydrologists to ideally choose and put bmps lids practices by looking at tradeoffs among natural effects and monetary contemplations to assess the cost effectiveness of the bmps lids only a few numbers of studies exist at the catchment scale further an optimization approach to execute bmps lids practices at the catchment level would be of great scientific interest in managing urban floods thus the objective of the present study is to explore a the effectiveness of the bmps lids infiltration trenches it and green roofs gr in different combinations and sizes for different scenarios on surface runoff volume at the catchment scale using the swmm model and b a framework for the cost benefit analysis for minimizing the volume of surface runoff by connecting the swmm with nsga ii optimization algorithm 2 study area and data preparation highly densely populated urban watershed 1 w1 and watershed 2 w2 that are prone to frequent flooding are selected to study the impact of bmp lids on reducing the storm runoff fig 1 both the watersheds are located under the aravalli hill ranges in the central region of delhi capital territory of the indian subcontinent for more details on the selected watersheds refer to supplementary table s1 extensive networks of stormwater characterize the drainage system in the watershed drains managed by different agencies like the irrigation and flood control department i fc municipal corporations of delhi mcd and public works department pwd the drains in these watersheds are qudesia nallah natural open drain draining directly into the river yamuna and jahangirpuri drain draining in najafgarh nallah belonging to w1 and w2 watersheds respectively the watershed w1 is prone to frequent flooding even for short duration rainfall the watershed w2 is in a low lying area and there is an issue of backflow in the jahangirpuri drain from the najafgarh drain this occurs during the monsoon season due to the low invert level of the jahangirpuri drain during high storm events the upstream area gets inundated due to the reverse direction flow of the drain resulting in infrastructural and property loss initially the data was procured from the above agencies see table 1 after the extensive survey was done and then converted into the acceptable format as per the requirement of the swmm model using arcgis 10 2 platform while analyzing the data it was observed that the drain network was not appropriately maintained because the drainage slope and cross section were improper and irregular respectively a total of ten automatic weather stations aws for recording rainfall were installed all over delhi city by indian meteorological department imd government of india the thiessen polygon technique identified that delhi university aws rainaguge contributes to the study area w1and w2 the average annual rainfall of the watersheds is 797 3 mm about 81 of the annual rainfall is received during the monsoon months of july august and september the rest of the rainfall is received as thunderstorm rain and winter rain in the pre and post monsoon months the variation of rainfall from year to year is large on average 2 5 mm or more rain falls on 27 days a year of which 19 days are during the monsoon months as per the central groundwater board government of india groundwater in delhi has decreased continuously over the past two decades cgwb 2016 many parts of the state are designated as over exploited or critically exploited groundwater depletion is often attributed to the widespread and mostly illegal extraction through tube wells the groundwater level in these watersheds ranges from 2 14 to 11 54 m below ground level mbgl in the pre monsoon period and 1 68 to 8 73 mbgl during the post monsoon period the groundwater quality is very poor and is contaminated with chemicals like iron 1 09 mg l and fluoride 3 2 mg l over the maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively cgwb 2016 it is also reported that there is a water level falling tendency of 0 04 to 3 69 m per year during the pre monsoon period and 0 04 to 1 50 m during the post monsoon period which is observed over the past decade due to urbanization 3 methodology 3 1 swmm model setup the swmm model is extensively used to simulate streamflow in the urban catchments and compute the urban drainage performance around the globe ovbiebo she 1995 rossman 2010 for brevity purpose general details on the swmm model is in supplementary text s1 however the model setup has been explained below to set up the swmm5 model the 1st step is catchment delineation at the junction s level i e each sub catchment runoff is draining into individual junctions catchment delineation has been done using dem and drains cross section data conduits and junctions for the w1 and w2 after delineation watersheds w1 w2 are divided into 177 and 1070 sub catchments respectively see fig 1 runoff parameters are provided in the 2nd step percent imperviousness and infiltration rate values have been extracted from the land cover and soil layers respectively when superimposed over the watersheds precipitation data measured at an hourly interval between 8 am of 24th july 2016 to 6 pm of 1st august 2016 daily is provided in the 3rd step the baseline model is calibrated for 4 days and validated for 5 days using a genetic algorithm the precipitation and discharge data from 24th july 2016 to 27th july 2016 is chosen for calibration validation of the swmm model has been executed from 28th july 2016 to 1st august 2016 the precipitation depth was approximately 186 mm in 4 days during calibration and 28 33 mm during 5 days of validation only one monsoon hourly rainfall data is used for the analysis in the present study there is a scope to use for longer time series short interval precipitation data with more flood events for better validation and reliability of the model indeed rainfall intensity may increase or decrease hence climate change should be accounted further the performance of the model to the observed data has been evaluated based on nse nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias percent bias and rsr rmse observations standard deviation ratio for more details refer to kumar et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 3 2 selection of bmps lids to execute the bmps lids at the catchment scale different bmps lids can be applied within a region of interest hou et al 2020 at the same time not all bmps lids can be appropriate for interlinking flooding hotspots locations areas where flooding frequently occurs even if there is a low storm consequently it has been essential that both the constraints i e selection of bmps lids as well as its optimal locations together with the feasibility have been determined at the beginning of the design process liu t al 2016 huang et al 2018 hou et al 2020 there have been constrictions in selecting relevant bmps lids due to land use attributes location properties features of the watershed and quantity performance desires in the swmm model the modules of bmps lids are designed to control the runoff at the source which can be reflected in the overall surface runoff i e in flooding infiltration and evaporation when evaluated for the sub catchment rossman 2010 huang et al 2015 hou yuan 2020 in this study it and gr have been employed for bmps lids first it was selected due to the great need to reduce the catchment runoff and extend the green space area in delhi it has an option of the underlying drain to pass the stored runoff out of the trenches because the infiltration of surface runoff into the soil layers takes a substantially longer time and during heavy storms it without underdrains may not be effective in the present study area also in it clogging is considered during evaluation which affects the hydraulic conductivity of the soil second the gr eco rooftops are useful in multiple ways and assist in lessening the impacts of urbanization two major applications include filtering of water improving its quality and engrossing or limiting precipitation and furnishing a share of non potable water they have been built of lightweight soil media inspired by the drainage layer and a superior quality impervious film that ensures the building structure with proper planning gr may fundamentally delay and decrease peak runoff flows from rooftops during high intensity storms this decreases the danger of flash floods and the occurrence of stormwater drain overflows using the above swmm model the bmps lids effects are evaluated in the stormwater drainage network the parameters suggested by cho et al 2013 was used in the study is given in table s2 3 3 bmps lids scenario planning as mentioned numerous arrays of bmps lids can be applied to a region of interest here three scenarios are planned to know the efficiency of each scenario in reducing the flow in each stage see fig 2 for further details on the selection of bmps lids refer to supplementary information text s2 1 firstly the modification has been done for the baseline model by changing the invert levels and cross sections after calibration and validation of the swmm model we represented the model as a baseline model then identified the flooding locations and the problems behind the flooding it was found that due to the improper drainage slope invert levels is the level of the bottom of the drain with respect to mean sea level and irregular drains cross section i e drain with higher cross section is outfalling into drains of lower cross section flooding is taking place so a drains invert levels are modified with respect to the drainage slope gradient and b downstream drains of lower cross sections are modified by increasing the cross section equal to the cross section of upstream drains 2 second the simulation includes water bodies in the modified model by shifting the surplus volume of runoff accumulated at the junctions in the present studies urban water bodies mean ponds or lakes these water bodies act as cushions during heavy storms and minimizes peak flows during high peak flows the excess surface runoff will be generated in the watershed which will cause flooding in the drains thus waterbodies are interlinked with drain junctions to reduce or minimize flooding when the downstream drains are flooded due to excess runoff volume flowing from upstream then in that case the surplus flood water will be diverted to waterbodies through circular pipes in doing so the flooding will be reduced downstream of the drains and excess water will be collected in the water bodies which will help in groundwater recharge through infiltration the average storage depth considered for water bodies is 2 m and it is incorporated as storage in the model irrigation and flood control government of nct of delhi india provided the information on water bodies 3 the third scenario further divides scenario 2 into three cases based on the sub catchments area i e when sub catchments pervious impervious area availability is considered 25 50 75 for implementation of bmps lids gr was applied only on the impervious built up area while doing the land use classification it was found that the government occupies 20 under the built up area category so gr was applied on 20 of the areas of the total built up area available in each sub catchments in contrast it was applied on the pervious area scrub area traffic island plantation area road edge garden parks openland parking area sidewalk this scenario works as wherever the junctions were flooded the landuse was analyzed and infiltration trenches were implemented near the drains to shift excess water the location was identified through the availability of the pervious area nearby to the drains the magnitude of infiltration trenches was decided depending on the volume of excess water to accommodate in infiltration trenches thus the different modeling steps considered in the present studies are i baseline model ii calibrated model iii scenario 1 model with changed il iv scenario 2 linking waterbodies to model v scenario 3 case 1 lid gr 25 lid it 25 case 2 lid gr 50 lid it 50 case 3 lid gr 75 lid it 75 3 4 nsga ii optimization algorithm nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithms ii optimization algorithm is used based on the simplicity performance efficiency and usage oraei zare et al 2012 karamouz and nazif 2013 tao et al 2014 xu et al 2017 nsga ii is considered best among various multi objective evolutionary algorithms and is employed effectively in different areas of engineering srinivas deb 1994 developed and suggested a preliminary version of nsga capable of delivering different optimal results in a single run for the multi objective optimization problems further deb et al 2000 launched an enhanced version of nsga ii upgraded version of nsga that can solve the complex problem computationally very fast and applied in green vehicle routing problem in the context of green logistics to estimate carbon dioxide emission jemai et al 2012 nsga ii was used to locate bmps that minimize nutrients pollution cost effectively in the lincoln lake watershed rodriguez et al 2011 also nsga ii algorithm was implemented in water distribution system for optimal sensor placement preis and ostfeld 2008 furthermore the nsga ii algorithm is an effective and efficient calibration algorithm for an open source model for various applications ercan and goodall 2016 nsga ii algorithm executes in five different operators i e initialization fast non dominated sorting crossover mutation and the crowded elitist comparison operator a noteworthy contrast among other evolutionary algorithms and the nsga ii is operator determination the non dominated sorting approach and the crowded comparison operator do not demand any user defined parameter for maintaining diversity deb et al 2000 for further details on the nsga ii optimization algorithm refer to supplementary information text s3 to implement the strategy of bmps lids scenarios to control the urban flooding and its related costs optimization of essential parameters of each bmps lids like its location and its size is necessary the optimization is done in such a way that the objective of achieving the best runoff controls benefits reduction in flooding at the least cost in the present study nsga ii is employed to optimize the sizes and locations of bmps lids for the effective functioning of the model the outcomes would help the hydrologists with alternative options for the most effective and potentially low cost bmps lids at the site 3 5 formulation of multi objective optimization model multi objective urban stormwater drainage aims to recognize the first amalgamation of both positioning and magnitude of bmps lids to achieve the intended performance of the structural arrangement i e to prevent inundation at a bare minimum expense a more noteworthy number of waterlogs in most parts produces uncontrolled floodwater to control the flood water in conjunction with high rainfall intensity at minimum expenses capability and the cost of flood control measures are the key exhibitors accordingly every facet should be investigated to establish the outlined plan so that the two exhibitors could be optimal and achieve the optimal balance and best arrangement following this the multi objective optimization objective

the functions of the peak flow and waterlog node at a specified location downstream in the course of swmm computations the swmm model illustrates that both the connection and the elevation have been controlled through an array of circumstances the bmps lids characteristics see supplementary information text s4 and their related datasets input the swmm model after that the swmm model is simulated and evaluated for different decision variables flood volume reduction to identify the flooded zone for every sub catchment the calibrated and validated swmm model is used to minimize waterlogging by linking with nearby water bodies if the waterlogging flooding continues in the watershed then bmps lids is implemented in the sub catchments through optimization techniques the swmm model is externally coupled with nsga ii in the matlab platform for optimizing the implementation cost and size of bmps lids are determined by using eq 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 development of baseline model the baseline model has been auto calibrated using an evolutionary based genetic algorithm ga optimization technique following kumar et al 2019 fig 3 shows the calibration and validation at an hourly basis for the study area at the outlet of the w1 fig 3a and w2 fig 3b the simulated flow follows the trends of the observed flow and in addition it captures the peak flows that trigger flooding table 3 shows the model s performance is good when verified for statistical criteria nse during the calibration for w1 is 0 74 and for w2 is 0 91 and during validation forw1 and w2 is 0 72 and 0 85 respectively where nse nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias percent bias and rsr rmse observations standard deviation ratio 4 2 scenario 1 simulation with changes made to cross sections and modified invert levels of the drains scenario 1 characterizes the modifications brought in the dimensions of the drains wherever improper slopes come across and the same has been altered by modifying the drain invert levels the drainage invert levels have been rectified while considering the slope of the previous segment of the drain and the levels obtained from the dem in addition the width of the cross section has also been altered wherever a constriction in width has been encountered and the junction is flooded the simulation was done after integrating the alterations instead of reducing the flooded nodes it increased to 43 from 39 in w1 and 205 from 155 in w2 prior to modifying the adverse slope cross section the excess flood volume gets stored in the channel due to space between the drain segments after the modification the space in the drain follows a normal slope causes flooding downstream of the drainage network fig 4 a illustrates the assessment of the surface profile of water in the drain segment after the simulation of the baseline model after simulating scenario i for instance the flooding at nodes have been significantly curtailed or even removed at certain junctions see fig 4b earlier which have been flooded to a considerable degree in a baseline model on the other hand under certain circumstances waterlogging has shifted towards the downstream or upstream of the flooded junctions the outcome has been made feasible by the hydraulic rejoinder of the section after the amendment in the gradients alterations in the amount of excess water at one of the junctions 28 40 56 n and 77 13 19 e have been exhibited in fig 4c the plot illustrates the degree of flooding at one of the nodes initially flooded with surplus water during a period of 1 h 27 min on 27 07 2016 for scenario 1 the flooding at the junction has been eliminated 4 3 scenario 2 simulation with interlinking water body to scenario 1 scenario 2 has been drafted by integrating the water bodies with scenario 1 to receive the excess flood volume from the watershed and rejuvenate water bodies thereby recharging the groundwater in w1 and w2 categorized as urbanized watersheds there have been an overall 2 and 5 water bodies that have been integrated as storages in the model at first the generated runoff has been routed towards the water bodies further the excess surplus runoff is carried forward to the next drain downstream coupling water bodies with the stormwater drainage network reduces the flooding transpiring at the nodes considering the information made available by the concerned agencies the depth of the water bodies has been considered to be equal to 2 m provisions have also been put on to link the surplus from the water bodies to the immediate natural drain the total number of overflowing nodes reduced significantly in both the watersheds 26 in w1 and 195 in w2 once the connection has been made to the nearest water bodies wherever feasible for a segment of the drain the evaluation of the water profiles for scenario 1 and scenario 2 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively there is a substantial diminution in the volume of surplus water in specific drains following the linking with the waterbody change in the floodwater volume is exhibited for one of the nodes 28 40 24 n and 77 12 54 e in fig 5c which illustrates the degree of the flooding together with the period of flooding the plot exhibits that one of the nodes has been flooded initially with an excess volume of water for 1 h however for scenario 2 after linking with the water body the flooding at the junction got removed 4 4 scenario 3 implementation of bmps lids to minimize the runoff to mitigate the pluvial floods gr and it have been applied in sub catchments under three different cases i e when the pervious impervious area is considered 25 50 and 75 the green roof has been applied only on the built up area gr has been applied on 20 of the areas of the total built up area available in each sub catchment in contrast it has been applied on the pervious area such as scrub area traffic island plantation area road edge garden parks openland parking area sidewalk the unit implementation cost considered for implementing gr and it in the watersheds is 1000 inr indian rupees rates and 1500 inr per square metre respectively basu chahar 2012 the simulation results in w1 at 25 show that 855 cubic metres of flood volume will be reduced by implementing 23 gr with the investment of 5 107 inr see fig 6 a we further performed a cost benefit analysis considering implementation cost against total flood volume reduction the cost benefit analysis explains that only 5 106 inr is needed to reduce the flood volume by 2500 cubic metres see fig 6b for the same scenario gr are replaced with it to see the variation in flow reduction the simulation tells that 1560 cubic metres of flood volume will be reduced if 60 gr are implemented with the investment of 10x107 inr see fig 6c the cost benefit analysis see fig 6d reveals that only 2 5x107 inr is needed to reduce around 3100 cubic metres flood volume the simulation results in w2 at 25 shows that a total of 160 gr are needed to reduce the flood volume by 8400 cubic metres with the investment of 32x107 inr see fig 6e the cost benefit analysis see fig 6f reveals that only 9x107 inr is needed to reduce the flood volume by 19 200 cubic metres flood volume in the case of it the simulation results show that 195 it are expected to reduce the flood volume by 17 200 cubic metres with the investment of 32 5x107 inr see fig 6g however when the cost benefit analysis has been done to optimize the investment cost for reducing the flood volume it is found that from fig 6h 10x107 inr is needed to reduce around 33 700 cubic metres flood volume in general the above cost benefit analysis involves all the relevant and intangible effects caused due to flooding fig 6 a d g h follow a linear line to reducing flood volume on implementing gr it in the watersheds however fig 6 e f showed that in jahangirpuri drain w2 there is a dramatic jump in flood reduction when it is implemented upstream of the flooding junctions in w2 at some junctions where a very high volume of floodwater accumulates and in some junctions minimal volume the flood volume reduction depends on land use patterns also in the present case the subcatchment contributing to excess flood runoff is an impervious area with a small drainage network so all the runoff flows to the junctions where huge floodwater accumulates thus on implementing bmps lids the excess volume was diverted in the it that explains the dramatic jump in flood volume the sizes of bmps lids vary and all depend on the magnitude of flood volume at the particular junctions because for every flooded junction only one bmps lids are implemented the results shown in table 4 shows that by using nsga ii optimization algorithm there are increasing trends in flood volume reduction when the percentage area considered for bmps lids implementation increases along with the cost in watershed w1 when 25 of the area is considered 23 green roofs were implemented but when the area increased to 50 25 numbers green roofs were implemented in the process it is observed that only two extra green roofs result in a reduction of 200 cubic meters this is because of two reasons a in the case of 25 the built up area considered for green roofs implementation is a small building so the number of green roofs is 23 but in the case of 50 the build up area was two significant buildings sufficient to collect maximum precipitation b the sizes of bmps lids are depended on the magnitude of flood volume due to this higher flood volume reduction bmps lids requirement increases so the associated cost for its implementation increases thus the optimization analysis suggests implementing gr in 25 and 50 of the sub catchments in w1 and w2 in it it is recommended to implement on 25 area of the sub catchments for w1 and w2 for a detailed explanation on cost benefit refer to supplementary information text s5 fig 7 a and b compare flood volume and flood node reduction refer to fig 7c and d from the baseline model to three scenarios for w1 and w2 for the baseline model the invert levels in the drainage network are further modified in the model compared with the baseline model of w1 and w2 there is a reduction in flood volume by 4 and 3 per cent respectively modifying the invert levels revealed that improper longitudinal slope conditions are prevalent in w1 than w2 on interlinking the modified model to the existing water bodies the reduction in flood volume increases to 8 and 5 percentage for w1 and w2 respectively a higher reduction in w1 may be attributed to the maximum capacity of water bodies since water bodies in w1 can hold a larger part of flood volume than w2 figs 8 and 9 display the optimal bmps lids it and gr locations in w1 and w2 respectively infiltration trench 0 25 means it implementation in 25 of the area and green roof 0 25 means gr implementation in 25 the optimal locations for utilization of bmps lids it and gr in the case of 50 and 75 area coverage please refer to supplementary information for w1 figs s1 s2 and w2 figs s3 s4 4 5 discussion in this study we attempted to investigate the effectiveness of it and gr practices in mitigating the urban flood in an urban watershed located in central delhi this study advances past investigation where single low impact development was employed zhen et al 2004 perez pedini et al 2005 a multi objective simulation optimization scheme was proposed linking it and gr to the existing stormwater drainage network the hydraulic and hydrologic aspects simulation was performed via swmm model a white box lumped model at different spatial scales and sizes in three scenarios i e 25 50 and 75 as described section 3 3 at a catchment scale on an hourly basis cost benefit analysis is coupled to the swmm with non dominated sorting genetic optimization algorithm ii nsga ii to know the effectiveness of it and gr in achieving a maximum reduction in surface runoff volume with minimum cost by implementing more bmps lids runoff volume can be reduced further for small total expenditures additional expenditures to implement bmps lids practices significantly increased environmental impacts until a certain threshold was reached and the increase in cost no longer resulted in a beneficial increase in volume reduction due to the treatment abilities of bmps lids practices implementing more practices in series at the watershed scale would not necessarily result in significant further reductions in runoff volume liu et al 2015 this resulted in less significant environmental impacts for additional spending beyond certain levels in conjunction with the swmm capability for continuous simulations the optimized framework considers long term functions optimizing bmps lids plans this increases the effectiveness of bmps lids in increasing the resilience of urban catchments to floods simultaneously the impact of retrofitting which is a function of its spatial location helps assess the effectiveness of bmps lids fry maxwell 2017 gilroy mccuen 2009 further on coupling the interlinked model to gr and it we noticed that the utilization of gr and it in the catchments has significantly lessened the total flooding volume moreover it outperformed gr in all three cases in the first case the reduction is 10 in both the watersheds in gr whereas 18 and 21 in it for w1 and w2 respectively it has a higher recharge rate than gr for example the reduction in flood volume from case 2 to 3 increases from 12 to 13 and 14 15 for gr and 22 24 and 23 26 for it in w1 and w2 this highlights a clear benefit for recharge and local groundwater resources using small spatially distributed stormwater retention bmps lids such as it our findings are congruent with other studies ahiablame and shakya 2016 stephens et al 2012 newcomer et al 2014 indicated by connecting the drainage network with the independent and distributed lid such as it benefits the recharge and local groundwater resources the research in this study shows that bmps lids mitigate the effects of urbanization which is supported by the findings of other authors mentens et al 2006 palla and gnecco 2015 infiltration trench 0 25 implies that it has been applied in 25 of the w1 and w2 areas green roof 0 25 and 0 5 implies that it has been applied in the 25 and 50 area in the w1 and w2 respectively indeed the present study has limitations like the constraint of data land availability due to longer time series data unavailability only short duration monsoon and discharge data were used only stormwater drains in the present study land use and land cover lulc data are available from geospatial delhi limited gsdl agency were of 2010 please refer to supplementary information for details limitations for gr implementation only government built up area is considered whereas for it areas like parks road divider land besides service road etc have been considered though this study offers preliminary results private land should also be considered to minimize the flood along with government land it is also essential to consider variable land availability the present study was fixed to 25 50 and 75 which may not be optimal to accommodate the excess floodwater land availability for it and infrastructure to adopt gr building tolerance needs to be further investigated in the future and is currently out of the scope of the present study the cost benefit analysis done here considers only the cost required to construct implement bmps lids however the cost of damage done by the flood in terms of lives property livestock and rehabilitation of flood inundated area should also be considered in future studies these aspects will be considered indeed bmps lids could be further reduced by using refined and longer timeseries data meeting the target of minimizing cost or maximizing benefits indeed this study attempt to control intense floods at the upper stream in the catchment justifying the implementation of bmps lids in the catchment as a retrofit measure to improve the basin resilience to flood and the implementation cost coupled with it the study provides valuable insight into decision making regarding the effectiveness of bmps lids practices in attenuating flood risk at the catchment scale however practical and economic considerations should be considered to select and determine reasonable bmps lids implementation levels strategically as a case study this study identified selected bmps lids options appropriate for central delhi the percentage of bmps lids utilizated is not an optimal solution it differs from watershed to watershed thus watershed specific bmps lids scenarios for flood control should be explored within suitable policy and economic contexts large scale adoption of bmps lids practices is undoubtedly doable if collective efforts e g business owners homeowners local governments public incentive programs are in place for gradual and strategic adoption moreover future studies can be taken forward by investigating the progress in water quality more bmps lids like a rain garden porous pavers rain barrels vegetation filter strips options will be explored in the future study for sustainable urban flood management 5 conclusions a high resolution model setup is a prerequisite for computing and assessing bmps lids tools and green infrastructure a detailed preliminary investigation of several planning schemes has been indispensable to discover the best urban runoff control by executing bmps lids planning the three scenarios implemented in the present study showcased the high ground applicability of flood reduction our approach highlights that a decision support tool can be put into practice in several domains to assist the decision makers in optimal selection and placements regarding bmps lids practices to achieve maximum environmental benefits and minimize costs the numbers of flooding nodes reduced from 22 numbers 25 bmps lids coverage to 11 numbers 75 bmps lids coverage in study area 1 and from 205 numbers 25 bmps lids coverage to 75 numbers 75 bmps lids coverage in study area 2 when the lid practices were implemented at 25 50 and 75 levels individually implementing 25 coverage area of gr and 25 coverage area of it with the initial cost of approximately 3 10 7 inr for w1 and implementing 50 coverage area of gr and 25 coverage area of it for w2 which involves the initial cost of approximately 19 10 7 inr will solve the problem of flooding substantially landscape management should be integrated and implemented with adequate planning the present study offers a valued understanding for taking an early decision concerning the effectiveness of bmps lids practices in flood reduction at a larger scale although practical and financial considerations must be kept into account it is crucial to strategically select the types of bmps lids and determine the reasonable location for implementation credit

3695,urban surface runoff management via best management practices bmp and low impact development lid has earned significant recognition owing to positive environmental and ecological impacts however due to the complexity of the parameters involved the estimation of lid efficiency in attenuating the urban surface runoff at the watershed scale is challenging a planning analysis of employing green roofs and infiltration trenches as bmps lids practices for urban surface runoff control is presented in this study a multi objective optimization decision making framework is established by coupling swmm storm water management model with nsga ii models to check the performance of bmps lids concerning the cost benefit analysis of lid at the watershed scale two urbanized areas belonging to central delhi in india were used as case studies the results showed that the swmm model is useful in simulating optimization problems for managing urban surface runoff the optimum scenarios efficiently minimized the urban runoff volume while maintaining the bmps lids implementation costs and size with bmps lids implementation the reduction in runoff volume increases as expenses increase initially however there is no noticeable reduction in flood volume after a certain threshold contrasted with the haphazard arrangement of bmps lids the proposed approach demonstrates 22 24 runoff reductions for the same expenditures in watershed 1 and 23 26 in watershed 2 the result of the study provides insights into planning and management of the urban surface runoff control with lid practices the proposed framework assists the hydrologists in optimum selection and placements of bmps lids practices to acquire the most extreme ecological advantages with the least expenses abbreviations swmm storm water

decades controlling stormwater runoff has been a scientific issue but best management practices bmps and low impact developments lids are management and design strategies that help control the stormwater runoff with scientific knowledge ahiablame et al 2012 barbosa et al 2012 damodaram et al 2010 dietz 2007 du et al 2012 kok et al 2013 elliott trowsdale 2007 moglen et al 2003 newcomer et al 2014 pagotto et al 2000 vezzaro et al 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 the transformation of non urbanized rural or pristine land use to urbanized significantly impervious areas is a noteworthy reason for hydrological changes bronstert et al 2002 gunn et al 2012 roy et al 2014 the induced hydrological changes influence different hydrologic processes and components in water resource systems for instance due to the reduction in the pervious areas water cannot precolate to groundwater thus reduceing infiltration which in turn affects groundwater recharge and increases surface runoff brandes et al 2005 newcomer et al 2014 extensive augmentation of surface runoff may increase the probability of urban flooding and deteriorate water quality in the water bodies where it is diverted khan et al 2006 dietz 2007 nevertheless urbanization is still multiplying globally urbanization reduces pervious area and intensifies the quick runoff component leon et al 2014 rangari et al 2020 furthermore during heavy rainfall stormwater is transported by drainage networks from impervious areas to the wastewater treatment plant sewer overflows devices and or receiving water bodies thus causing higher flood events burian pomeroy 2010 rangari et al 2020 nowadays controlling stormwater runoff by connecting directly to drains is becoming less popular due to the evolution of alternate options like bmps lids bmps lids are a green approach to managing stormwater these approaches at least partially save the pre development hydrologic characteristics by employing decentralized small scale control measures hud u s department of housing and urban development 2003 generally the practice of bmps lids includes the local retention of stormwater using control measures like green roofs permeable pavement infiltration trenches and bio retention systems that mimic the existing hydrologic characteristics dietz 2007 ahiablame et al 2012 ahiablame et al 2016 raei et al 2019 these practices impact the hydrology of the watersheds to a great extent by managing the volume of runoff during peak rainfall and improving water quality pagotto et al 2000 damodaram et al 2010 vezzaro et al 2011 vijayaraghavan et al 2012 kok et al 2013 newcomer et al 2014 they are applied in urban areas to control the surface runoff at the source point before it reaches the downstream areas usepa us environmental protection agency 2000 moglen et al 2003 bmps lids have various technical removal effectiveness and non technical cost features usepa u s environmental protection agency 2004 dietz 2007 berndtsson 2010 many studies have been dedicated to quantifying the impacts of bmps lids on different hydrologic components of the watershed bedan clausen 2009 implemented bmps lids practices in waterford connecticut and found a reduction in surface runoff by 42 compared with the pre development stage at the same peak discharge dietz 2007 and ahiablame et al 2012 explored pervious pavement at different geographic areas they demonstrated a decrease in the surface runoff volume and related contamination stacks by interference and filtration ahiablame et al 2013 assessed six series of rain barrel storage and permeable asphalt within two extremely urbanized catchments by applying the long term hydrologic impact assessment low impact development l thia lid model which demonstrated that the execution of various bmps lids strategies brought about 2 to 12 decrease in runoff and pollutant loads however it must be emphasized that the relative flood reduction potential of such local retention measures is a question of the magnitude of the design rainfall concerning the locally retained water volume more significant is the rainfall amount smaller is the proportion of the retained water volume compared to the non retained excess water niehoff bronstert 2001 salazar et al 2012 newcomer et al 2014 in san francisco ca exhibited the advantages of bmps lids on recharge of groundwater on the field based on hydrus 2d model based investigations comings et al 2000 in bellevue wa considered two wet ponds at a residential and commercial location and reported a 19 to 46 decrease in total phosphorus 61 to 81 decrease of total suspended solids and 37 to 76 decrease of metals jia et al 2013 studied the impact of bmps lids using the porous pavement they advised that though it has certain advantages uncertainties associated with it and designing appropriate bmps lids at a catchment scale becomes difficult effective implementation involves investigation efforts to examine and optimize bmps lids features ahiablame et al 2012 to attain maximum ecological advantage the minimizing cost and spatial optimization have turned into a well known multi objective technique that has tradeoff responses for selection and location of bmps lids practices at catchment scales maringanti et al 2009 2011 rodriguez et al 2011 lee et al 2012 mcgarity 2013a 2013b liu et al 2016 spatial optimization solves problems by combining the simulation model with an optimization algorithm the optimization algorithm produces test populaces of likely location situations while the hydrological model calculates the objective functions with the specimen populaces made to get optimal results the spatial optimization approach expects a noteworthy simulation time to finish the simulations of the model owing to the involved complexities in the optimization problems arabi et al 2006 the pseudo simulation model which includes a lookup table has been employed maringanti et al 2011 sudheer et al 2011 to lessen the computational weight this methodology typically lessens the precision of outputs and adds a dimension of uncertainty parallel computing has been extensively employed to decrease recreation time rouholahnejad et al 2012 yalew et al 2013 liu et al 2014 multi objective optimization and scenario investigation have been the two widely employed approaches in probing for an economic strategy however individual hindrances exist for these techniques the planning and implementation strategies of bmps lids practices at catchment scales include clashes between natural concerns and monetary contemplations the available types sites and rates at which to employ the bmps lids practices at a catchment scale are various due to the multifaceted nature of the catchment s soil properties land use and location features in general it is not possible to recognize the performances of every single pair of bmps lids practice at the catchment scale lai et al 2007 besides environmental contemplations and monetary concerns make it difficult to tackle the issue for instance realizing further practices in a given zone would probably have expanded natural advantages as it may the expense to develop and maintain bmps lids practices would increment in the meantime since in the watershed the implementation expenses for the most part have restricted spending plans or a clear ecological effect objective however liu et al 2015 estimated the overall cost in implementing the bmps lids practices at catchment scales using l thia lid 2 1 in the above study considering cost benefit aspects in designing the optimal locations and selecting practices is lacking a productive precise methodology is required for hydrologists to ideally choose and put bmps lids practices by looking at tradeoffs among natural effects and monetary contemplations to assess the cost effectiveness of the bmps lids only a few numbers of studies exist at the catchment scale further an optimization approach to execute bmps lids practices at the catchment level would be of great scientific interest in managing urban floods thus the objective of the present study is to explore a the effectiveness of the bmps lids infiltration trenches it and green roofs gr in different combinations and sizes for different scenarios on surface runoff volume at the catchment scale using the swmm model and b a framework for the cost benefit analysis for minimizing the volume of surface runoff by connecting the swmm with nsga ii optimization algorithm 2 study area and data preparation highly densely populated urban watershed 1 w1 and watershed 2 w2 that are prone to frequent flooding are selected to study the impact of bmp lids on reducing the storm runoff fig 1 both the watersheds are located under the aravalli hill ranges in the central region of delhi capital territory of the indian subcontinent for more details on the selected watersheds refer to supplementary table s1 extensive networks of stormwater characterize the drainage system in the watershed drains managed by different agencies like the irrigation and flood control department i fc municipal corporations of delhi mcd and public works department pwd the drains in these watersheds are qudesia nallah natural open drain draining directly into the river yamuna and jahangirpuri drain draining in najafgarh nallah belonging to w1 and w2 watersheds respectively the watershed w1 is prone to frequent flooding even for short duration rainfall the watershed w2 is in a low lying area and there is an issue of backflow in the jahangirpuri drain from the najafgarh drain this occurs during the monsoon season due to the low invert level of the jahangirpuri drain during high storm events the upstream area gets inundated due to the reverse direction flow of the drain resulting in infrastructural and property loss initially the data was procured from the above agencies see table 1 after the extensive survey was done and then converted into the acceptable format as per the requirement of the swmm model using arcgis 10 2 platform while analyzing the data it was observed that the drain network was not appropriately maintained because the drainage slope and cross section were improper and irregular respectively a total of ten automatic weather stations aws for recording rainfall were installed all over delhi city by indian meteorological department imd government of india the thiessen polygon technique identified that delhi university aws rainaguge contributes to the study area w1and w2 the average annual rainfall of the watersheds is 797 3 mm about 81 of the annual rainfall is received during the monsoon months of july august and september the rest of the rainfall is received as thunderstorm rain and winter rain in the pre and post monsoon months the variation of rainfall from year to year is large on average 2 5 mm or more rain falls on 27 days a year of which 19 days are during the monsoon months as per the central groundwater board government of india groundwater in delhi has decreased continuously over the past two decades cgwb 2016 many parts of the state are designated as over exploited or critically exploited groundwater depletion is often attributed to the widespread and mostly illegal extraction through tube wells the groundwater level in these watersheds ranges from 2 14 to 11 54 m below ground level mbgl in the pre monsoon period and 1 68 to 8 73 mbgl during the post monsoon period the groundwater quality is very poor and is contaminated with chemicals like iron 1 09 mg l and fluoride 3 2 mg l over the maximum permissible limit of 1 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively cgwb 2016 it is also reported that there is a water level falling tendency of 0 04 to 3 69 m per year during the pre monsoon period and 0 04 to 1 50 m during the post monsoon period which is observed over the past decade due to urbanization 3 methodology 3 1 swmm model setup the swmm model is extensively used to simulate streamflow in the urban catchments and compute the urban drainage performance around the globe ovbiebo she 1995 rossman 2010 for brevity purpose general details on the swmm model is in supplementary text s1 however the model setup has been explained below to set up the swmm5 model the 1st step is catchment delineation at the junction s level i e each sub catchment runoff is draining into individual junctions catchment delineation has been done using dem and drains cross section data conduits and junctions for the w1 and w2 after delineation watersheds w1 w2 are divided into 177 and 1070 sub catchments respectively see fig 1 runoff parameters are provided in the 2nd step percent imperviousness and infiltration rate values have been extracted from the land cover and soil layers respectively when superimposed over the watersheds precipitation data measured at an hourly interval between 8 am of 24th july 2016 to 6 pm of 1st august 2016 daily is provided in the 3rd step the baseline model is calibrated for 4 days and validated for 5 days using a genetic algorithm the precipitation and discharge data from 24th july 2016 to 27th july 2016 is chosen for calibration validation of the swmm model has been executed from 28th july 2016 to 1st august 2016 the precipitation depth was approximately 186 mm in 4 days during calibration and 28 33 mm during 5 days of validation only one monsoon hourly rainfall data is used for the analysis in the present study there is a scope to use for longer time series short interval precipitation data with more flood events for better validation and reliability of the model indeed rainfall intensity may increase or decrease hence climate change should be accounted further the performance of the model to the observed data has been evaluated based on nse nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias percent bias and rsr rmse observations standard deviation ratio for more details refer to kumar et al 2019 kumar et al 2021 3 2 selection of bmps lids to execute the bmps lids at the catchment scale different bmps lids can be applied within a region of interest hou et al 2020 at the same time not all bmps lids can be appropriate for interlinking flooding hotspots locations areas where flooding frequently occurs even if there is a low storm consequently it has been essential that both the constraints i e selection of bmps lids as well as its optimal locations together with the feasibility have been determined at the beginning of the design process liu t al 2016 huang et al 2018 hou et al 2020 there have been constrictions in selecting relevant bmps lids due to land use attributes location properties features of the watershed and quantity performance desires in the swmm model the modules of bmps lids are designed to control the runoff at the source which can be reflected in the overall surface runoff i e in flooding infiltration and evaporation when evaluated for the sub catchment rossman 2010 huang et al 2015 hou yuan 2020 in this study it and gr have been employed for bmps lids first it was selected due to the great need to reduce the catchment runoff and extend the green space area in delhi it has an option of the underlying drain to pass the stored runoff out of the trenches because the infiltration of surface runoff into the soil layers takes a substantially longer time and during heavy storms it without underdrains may not be effective in the present study area also in it clogging is considered during evaluation which affects the hydraulic conductivity of the soil second the gr eco rooftops are useful in multiple ways and assist in lessening the impacts of urbanization two major applications include filtering of water improving its quality and engrossing or limiting precipitation and furnishing a share of non potable water they have been built of lightweight soil media inspired by the drainage layer and a superior quality impervious film that ensures the building structure with proper planning gr may fundamentally delay and decrease peak runoff flows from rooftops during high intensity storms this decreases the danger of flash floods and the occurrence of stormwater drain overflows using the above swmm model the bmps lids effects are evaluated in the stormwater drainage network the parameters suggested by cho et al 2013 was used in the study is given in table s2 3 3 bmps lids scenario planning as mentioned numerous arrays of bmps lids can be applied to a region of interest here three scenarios are planned to know the efficiency of each scenario in reducing the flow in each stage see fig 2 for further details on the selection of bmps lids refer to supplementary information text s2 1 firstly the modification has been done for the baseline model by changing the invert levels and cross sections after calibration and validation of the swmm model we represented the model as a baseline model then identified the flooding locations and the problems behind the flooding it was found that due to the improper drainage slope invert levels is the level of the bottom of the drain with respect to mean sea level and irregular drains cross section i e drain with higher cross section is outfalling into drains of lower cross section flooding is taking place so a drains invert levels are modified with respect to the drainage slope gradient and b downstream drains of lower cross sections are modified by increasing the cross section equal to the cross section of upstream drains 2 second the simulation includes water bodies in the modified model by shifting the surplus volume of runoff accumulated at the junctions in the present studies urban water bodies mean ponds or lakes these water bodies act as cushions during heavy storms and minimizes peak flows during high peak flows the excess surface runoff will be generated in the watershed which will cause flooding in the drains thus waterbodies are interlinked with drain junctions to reduce or minimize flooding when the downstream drains are flooded due to excess runoff volume flowing from upstream then in that case the surplus flood water will be diverted to waterbodies through circular pipes in doing so the flooding will be reduced downstream of the drains and excess water will be collected in the water bodies which will help in groundwater recharge through infiltration the average storage depth considered for water bodies is 2 m and it is incorporated as storage in the model irrigation and flood control government of nct of delhi india provided the information on water bodies 3 the third scenario further divides scenario 2 into three cases based on the sub catchments area i e when sub catchments pervious impervious area availability is considered 25 50 75 for implementation of bmps lids gr was applied only on the impervious built up area while doing the land use classification it was found that the government occupies 20 under the built up area category so gr was applied on 20 of the areas of the total built up area available in each sub catchments in contrast it was applied on the pervious area scrub area traffic island plantation area road edge garden parks openland parking area sidewalk this scenario works as wherever the junctions were flooded the landuse was analyzed and infiltration trenches were implemented near the drains to shift excess water the location was identified through the availability of the pervious area nearby to the drains the magnitude of infiltration trenches was decided depending on the volume of excess water to accommodate in infiltration trenches thus the different modeling steps considered in the present studies are i baseline model ii calibrated model iii scenario 1 model with changed il iv scenario 2 linking waterbodies to model v scenario 3 case 1 lid gr 25 lid it 25 case 2 lid gr 50 lid it 50 case 3 lid gr 75 lid it 75 3 4 nsga ii optimization algorithm nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithms ii optimization algorithm is used based on the simplicity performance efficiency and usage oraei zare et al 2012 karamouz and nazif 2013 tao et al 2014 xu et al 2017 nsga ii is considered best among various multi objective evolutionary algorithms and is employed effectively in different areas of engineering srinivas deb 1994 developed and suggested a preliminary version of nsga capable of delivering different optimal results in a single run for the multi objective optimization problems further deb et al 2000 launched an enhanced version of nsga ii upgraded version of nsga that can solve the complex problem computationally very fast and applied in green vehicle routing problem in the context of green logistics to estimate carbon dioxide emission jemai et al 2012 nsga ii was used to locate bmps that minimize nutrients pollution cost effectively in the lincoln lake watershed rodriguez et al 2011 also nsga ii algorithm was implemented in water distribution system for optimal sensor placement preis and ostfeld 2008 furthermore the nsga ii algorithm is an effective and efficient calibration algorithm for an open source model for various applications ercan and goodall 2016 nsga ii algorithm executes in five different operators i e initialization fast non dominated sorting crossover mutation and the crowded elitist comparison operator a noteworthy contrast among other evolutionary algorithms and the nsga ii is operator determination the non dominated sorting approach and the crowded comparison operator do not demand any user defined parameter for maintaining diversity deb et al 2000 for further details on the nsga ii optimization algorithm refer to supplementary information text s3 to implement the strategy of bmps lids scenarios to control the urban flooding and its related costs optimization of essential parameters of each bmps lids like its location and its size is necessary the optimization is done in such a way that the objective of achieving the best runoff controls benefits reduction in flooding at the least cost in the present study nsga ii is employed to optimize the sizes and locations of bmps lids for the effective functioning of the model the outcomes would help the hydrologists with alternative options for the most effective and potentially low cost bmps lids at the site 3 5 formulation of multi objective optimization model multi objective urban stormwater drainage aims to recognize the first amalgamation of both positioning and magnitude of bmps lids to achieve the intended performance of the structural arrangement i e to prevent inundation at a bare minimum expense a more noteworthy number of waterlogs in most parts produces uncontrolled floodwater to control the flood water in conjunction with high rainfall intensity at minimum expenses capability and the cost of flood control measures are the key exhibitors accordingly every facet should be investigated to establish the outlined plan so that the two exhibitors could be optimal and achieve the optimal balance and best arrangement following this the multi objective optimization objective

the functions of the peak flow and waterlog node at a specified location downstream in the course of swmm computations the swmm model illustrates that both the connection and the elevation have been controlled through an array of circumstances the bmps lids characteristics see supplementary information text s4 and their related datasets input the swmm model after that the swmm model is simulated and evaluated for different decision variables flood volume reduction to identify the flooded zone for every sub catchment the calibrated and validated swmm model is used to minimize waterlogging by linking with nearby water bodies if the waterlogging flooding continues in the watershed then bmps lids is implemented in the sub catchments through optimization techniques the swmm model is externally coupled with nsga ii in the matlab platform for optimizing the implementation cost and size of bmps lids are determined by using eq 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 development of baseline model the baseline model has been auto calibrated using an evolutionary based genetic algorithm ga optimization technique following kumar et al 2019 fig 3 shows the calibration and validation at an hourly basis for the study area at the outlet of the w1 fig 3a and w2 fig 3b the simulated flow follows the trends of the observed flow and in addition it captures the peak flows that trigger flooding table 3 shows the model s performance is good when verified for statistical criteria nse during the calibration for w1 is 0 74 and for w2 is 0 91 and during validation forw1 and w2 is 0 72 and 0 85 respectively where nse nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias percent bias and rsr rmse observations standard deviation ratio 4 2 scenario 1 simulation with changes made to cross sections and modified invert levels of the drains scenario 1 characterizes the modifications brought in the dimensions of the drains wherever improper slopes come across and the same has been altered by modifying the drain invert levels the drainage invert levels have been rectified while considering the slope of the previous segment of the drain and the levels obtained from the dem in addition the width of the cross section has also been altered wherever a constriction in width has been encountered and the junction is flooded the simulation was done after integrating the alterations instead of reducing the flooded nodes it increased to 43 from 39 in w1 and 205 from 155 in w2 prior to modifying the adverse slope cross section the excess flood volume gets stored in the channel due to space between the drain segments after the modification the space in the drain follows a normal slope causes flooding downstream of the drainage network fig 4 a illustrates the assessment of the surface profile of water in the drain segment after the simulation of the baseline model after simulating scenario i for instance the flooding at nodes have been significantly curtailed or even removed at certain junctions see fig 4b earlier which have been flooded to a considerable degree in a baseline model on the other hand under certain circumstances waterlogging has shifted towards the downstream or upstream of the flooded junctions the outcome has been made feasible by the hydraulic rejoinder of the section after the amendment in the gradients alterations in the amount of excess water at one of the junctions 28 40 56 n and 77 13 19 e have been exhibited in fig 4c the plot illustrates the degree of flooding at one of the nodes initially flooded with surplus water during a period of 1 h 27 min on 27 07 2016 for scenario 1 the flooding at the junction has been eliminated 4 3 scenario 2 simulation with interlinking water body to scenario 1 scenario 2 has been drafted by integrating the water bodies with scenario 1 to receive the excess flood volume from the watershed and rejuvenate water bodies thereby recharging the groundwater in w1 and w2 categorized as urbanized watersheds there have been an overall 2 and 5 water bodies that have been integrated as storages in the model at first the generated runoff has been routed towards the water bodies further the excess surplus runoff is carried forward to the next drain downstream coupling water bodies with the stormwater drainage network reduces the flooding transpiring at the nodes considering the information made available by the concerned agencies the depth of the water bodies has been considered to be equal to 2 m provisions have also been put on to link the surplus from the water bodies to the immediate natural drain the total number of overflowing nodes reduced significantly in both the watersheds 26 in w1 and 195 in w2 once the connection has been made to the nearest water bodies wherever feasible for a segment of the drain the evaluation of the water profiles for scenario 1 and scenario 2 are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively there is a substantial diminution in the volume of surplus water in specific drains following the linking with the waterbody change in the floodwater volume is exhibited for one of the nodes 28 40 24 n and 77 12 54 e in fig 5c which illustrates the degree of the flooding together with the period of flooding the plot exhibits that one of the nodes has been flooded initially with an excess volume of water for 1 h however for scenario 2 after linking with the water body the flooding at the junction got removed 4 4 scenario 3 implementation of bmps lids to minimize the runoff to mitigate the pluvial floods gr and it have been applied in sub catchments under three different cases i e when the pervious impervious area is considered 25 50 and 75 the green roof has been applied only on the built up area gr has been applied on 20 of the areas of the total built up area available in each sub catchment in contrast it has been applied on the pervious area such as scrub area traffic island plantation area road edge garden parks openland parking area sidewalk the unit implementation cost considered for implementing gr and it in the watersheds is 1000 inr indian rupees rates and 1500 inr per square metre respectively basu chahar 2012 the simulation results in w1 at 25 show that 855 cubic metres of flood volume will be reduced by implementing 23 gr with the investment of 5 107 inr see fig 6 a we further performed a cost benefit analysis considering implementation cost against total flood volume reduction the cost benefit analysis explains that only 5 106 inr is needed to reduce the flood volume by 2500 cubic metres see fig 6b for the same scenario gr are replaced with it to see the variation in flow reduction the simulation tells that 1560 cubic metres of flood volume will be reduced if 60 gr are implemented with the investment of 10x107 inr see fig 6c the cost benefit analysis see fig 6d reveals that only 2 5x107 inr is needed to reduce around 3100 cubic metres flood volume the simulation results in w2 at 25 shows that a total of 160 gr are needed to reduce the flood volume by 8400 cubic metres with the investment of 32x107 inr see fig 6e the cost benefit analysis see fig 6f reveals that only 9x107 inr is needed to reduce the flood volume by 19 200 cubic metres flood volume in the case of it the simulation results show that 195 it are expected to reduce the flood volume by 17 200 cubic metres with the investment of 32 5x107 inr see fig 6g however when the cost benefit analysis has been done to optimize the investment cost for reducing the flood volume it is found that from fig 6h 10x107 inr is needed to reduce around 33 700 cubic metres flood volume in general the above cost benefit analysis involves all the relevant and intangible effects caused due to flooding fig 6 a d g h follow a linear line to reducing flood volume on implementing gr it in the watersheds however fig 6 e f showed that in jahangirpuri drain w2 there is a dramatic jump in flood reduction when it is implemented upstream of the flooding junctions in w2 at some junctions where a very high volume of floodwater accumulates and in some junctions minimal volume the flood volume reduction depends on land use patterns also in the present case the subcatchment contributing to excess flood runoff is an impervious area with a small drainage network so all the runoff flows to the junctions where huge floodwater accumulates thus on implementing bmps lids the excess volume was diverted in the it that explains the dramatic jump in flood volume the sizes of bmps lids vary and all depend on the magnitude of flood volume at the particular junctions because for every flooded junction only one bmps lids are implemented the results shown in table 4 shows that by using nsga ii optimization algorithm there are increasing trends in flood volume reduction when the percentage area considered for bmps lids implementation increases along with the cost in watershed w1 when 25 of the area is considered 23 green roofs were implemented but when the area increased to 50 25 numbers green roofs were implemented in the process it is observed that only two extra green roofs result in a reduction of 200 cubic meters this is because of two reasons a in the case of 25 the built up area considered for green roofs implementation is a small building so the number of green roofs is 23 but in the case of 50 the build up area was two significant buildings sufficient to collect maximum precipitation b the sizes of bmps lids are depended on the magnitude of flood volume due to this higher flood volume reduction bmps lids requirement increases so the associated cost for its implementation increases thus the optimization analysis suggests implementing gr in 25 and 50 of the sub catchments in w1 and w2 in it it is recommended to implement on 25 area of the sub catchments for w1 and w2 for a detailed explanation on cost benefit refer to supplementary information text s5 fig 7 a and b compare flood volume and flood node reduction refer to fig 7c and d from the baseline model to three scenarios for w1 and w2 for the baseline model the invert levels in the drainage network are further modified in the model compared with the baseline model of w1 and w2 there is a reduction in flood volume by 4 and 3 per cent respectively modifying the invert levels revealed that improper longitudinal slope conditions are prevalent in w1 than w2 on interlinking the modified model to the existing water bodies the reduction in flood volume increases to 8 and 5 percentage for w1 and w2 respectively a higher reduction in w1 may be attributed to the maximum capacity of water bodies since water bodies in w1 can hold a larger part of flood volume than w2 figs 8 and 9 display the optimal bmps lids it and gr locations in w1 and w2 respectively infiltration trench 0 25 means it implementation in 25 of the area and green roof 0 25 means gr implementation in 25 the optimal locations for utilization of bmps lids it and gr in the case of 50 and 75 area coverage please refer to supplementary information for w1 figs s1 s2 and w2 figs s3 s4 4 5 discussion in this study we attempted to investigate the effectiveness of it and gr practices in mitigating the urban flood in an urban watershed located in central delhi this study advances past investigation where single low impact development was employed zhen et al 2004 perez pedini et al 2005 a multi objective simulation optimization scheme was proposed linking it and gr to the existing stormwater drainage network the hydraulic and hydrologic aspects simulation was performed via swmm model a white box lumped model at different spatial scales and sizes in three scenarios i e 25 50 and 75 as described section 3 3 at a catchment scale on an hourly basis cost benefit analysis is coupled to the swmm with non dominated sorting genetic optimization algorithm ii nsga ii to know the effectiveness of it and gr in achieving a maximum reduction in surface runoff volume with minimum cost by implementing more bmps lids runoff volume can be reduced further for small total expenditures additional expenditures to implement bmps lids practices significantly increased environmental impacts until a certain threshold was reached and the increase in cost no longer resulted in a beneficial increase in volume reduction due to the treatment abilities of bmps lids practices implementing more practices in series at the watershed scale would not necessarily result in significant further reductions in runoff volume liu et al 2015 this resulted in less significant environmental impacts for additional spending beyond certain levels in conjunction with the swmm capability for continuous simulations the optimized framework considers long term functions optimizing bmps lids plans this increases the effectiveness of bmps lids in increasing the resilience of urban catchments to floods simultaneously the impact of retrofitting which is a function of its spatial location helps assess the effectiveness of bmps lids fry maxwell 2017 gilroy mccuen 2009 further on coupling the interlinked model to gr and it we noticed that the utilization of gr and it in the catchments has significantly lessened the total flooding volume moreover it outperformed gr in all three cases in the first case the reduction is 10 in both the watersheds in gr whereas 18 and 21 in it for w1 and w2 respectively it has a higher recharge rate than gr for example the reduction in flood volume from case 2 to 3 increases from 12 to 13 and 14 15 for gr and 22 24 and 23 26 for it in w1 and w2 this highlights a clear benefit for recharge and local groundwater resources using small spatially distributed stormwater retention bmps lids such as it our findings are congruent with other studies ahiablame and shakya 2016 stephens et al 2012 newcomer et al 2014 indicated by connecting the drainage network with the independent and distributed lid such as it benefits the recharge and local groundwater resources the research in this study shows that bmps lids mitigate the effects of urbanization which is supported by the findings of other authors mentens et al 2006 palla and gnecco 2015 infiltration trench 0 25 implies that it has been applied in 25 of the w1 and w2 areas green roof 0 25 and 0 5 implies that it has been applied in the 25 and 50 area in the w1 and w2 respectively indeed the present study has limitations like the constraint of data land availability due to longer time series data unavailability only short duration monsoon and discharge data were used only stormwater drains in the present study land use and land cover lulc data are available from geospatial delhi limited gsdl agency were of 2010 please refer to supplementary information for details limitations for gr implementation only government built up area is considered whereas for it areas like parks road divider land besides service road etc have been considered though this study offers preliminary results private land should also be considered to minimize the flood along with government land it is also essential to consider variable land availability the present study was fixed to 25 50 and 75 which may not be optimal to accommodate the excess floodwater land availability for it and infrastructure to adopt gr building tolerance needs to be further investigated in the future and is currently out of the scope of the present study the cost benefit analysis done here considers only the cost required to construct implement bmps lids however the cost of damage done by the flood in terms of lives property livestock and rehabilitation of flood inundated area should also be considered in future studies these aspects will be considered indeed bmps lids could be further reduced by using refined and longer timeseries data meeting the target of minimizing cost or maximizing benefits indeed this study attempt to control intense floods at the upper stream in the catchment justifying the implementation of bmps lids in the catchment as a retrofit measure to improve the basin resilience to flood and the implementation cost coupled with it the study provides valuable insight into decision making regarding the effectiveness of bmps lids practices in attenuating flood risk at the catchment scale however practical and economic considerations should be considered to select and determine reasonable bmps lids implementation levels strategically as a case study this study identified selected bmps lids options appropriate for central delhi the percentage of bmps lids utilizated is not an optimal solution it differs from watershed to watershed thus watershed specific bmps lids scenarios for flood control should be explored within suitable policy and economic contexts large scale adoption of bmps lids practices is undoubtedly doable if collective efforts e g business owners homeowners local governments public incentive programs are in place for gradual and strategic adoption moreover future studies can be taken forward by investigating the progress in water quality more bmps lids like a rain garden porous pavers rain barrels vegetation filter strips options will be explored in the future study for sustainable urban flood management 5 conclusions a high resolution model setup is a prerequisite for computing and assessing bmps lids tools and green infrastructure a detailed preliminary investigation of several planning schemes has been indispensable to discover the best urban runoff control by executing bmps lids planning the three scenarios implemented in the present study showcased the high ground applicability of flood reduction our approach highlights that a decision support tool can be put into practice in several domains to assist the decision makers in optimal selection and placements regarding bmps lids practices to achieve maximum environmental benefits and minimize costs the numbers of flooding nodes reduced from 22 numbers 25 bmps lids coverage to 11 numbers 75 bmps lids coverage in study area 1 and from 205 numbers 25 bmps lids coverage to 75 numbers 75 bmps lids coverage in study area 2 when the lid practices were implemented at 25 50 and 75 levels individually implementing 25 coverage area of gr and 25 coverage area of it with the initial cost of approximately 3 10 7 inr for w1 and implementing 50 coverage area of gr and 25 coverage area of it for w2 which involves the initial cost of approximately 19 10 7 inr will solve the problem of flooding substantially landscape management should be integrated and implemented with adequate planning the present study offers a valued understanding for taking an early decision concerning the effectiveness of bmps lids practices in flood reduction at a larger scale although practical and financial considerations must be kept into account it is crucial to strategically select the types of bmps lids and determine the reasonable location for implementation credit

3696,a novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for sediment transport and morphological changes is developed and implemented the depth averaged shallow water equations swe have been used to reach the flow pattern the advection diffusion equation ade was exploited to determine sediment concentration in the water bed load was determined by the active layer mass conservation equation almc while the morphological changes of the river bed were determined by the global active layer mass conservation equation galmc the exner equation the swe are solved by the multiple relaxation time lattice boltzmann method mrt lbm while the bhatnagar gross krook bgk lbm approach has been used for solving the ade almc and galmc new forms of the equilibrium function for solving the almc and galmc are presented using the d2q9 lattice dedicated sediment related equations are created for each sediment size class additional dedicated terms in the transport equations take care of particle exchange between the suspension and the river bed as well as of river bed deformation the model has been verified on a experimental section of the danube river the results have been compared to the measured ones and to the results obtained by the finite difference method fdm very good agreement between the results is achieved indicating that the lbm can be successfully used for simulation of flow and sediment related processes in natural watercourses characterized by complex geometry and morphology and lack of uniformity in sediment composition keywords lattice boltzmann method natural watercourses shallow water equations sediment transport morphological changes 1 introduction in most cases of natural watercourses due to the complex flow pattern and uneven sediment distribution and concentration part of the sediment moves by the water suspended sediment while the rest is moving just over the bed bed load connection between these two phases comes true through the processes of sedimentation and erosion leading to never ending changes in granulometry of the suspension as well as of the river bed solid particle exchange between the water and the river bed causes morphological changes of the bed itself which might cause changes in bed composition as well modelling the complex processes of sediment dynamics and transport and river bed changes requires independent analysis of all involved processes moving of suspended particles erosion deposition bed load movement river bed deformation and particle exchange between the layers of the river bed and their interaction besides to obtain the most realistic insight into the processes involved the natural sediment mixture in most of the cases characterized by very uneven particle distribution needs to be broken down to particular sediment size classes it makes possible to determine the concentration of a particular sediment size class both in the suspension and in the bed load significant number of models have been developed for the sediment however most of them have limitations for not taking care of or oversimplifying certain processes involved some of the models consider just river bed changes jia and wang 1999 kassem and chaudhry 2005 some of them treat river bed load only gao 2011 roushangar and koosheh 2015 while there are models duan and nanda 2006 ta et al 2015 calculating just the transport of suspended solids taking in account solid exchange between the bed and the suspension models by guan and liang 2017 li et al 2008 do not take account of the bed load while javernick et al 2018 warburton and davies 1994 neglected the suspended part of the sediments spasojevic and holly 2008 1990 have come up with a mathematical formulation taking in consideration the all processes involved interactions between them and treating sediment by particle classes which has been tested on natural watercourses the model has been further improved in terms of the numerical method and the particle exchange mechanisms between the river bed and the water phase exploiting the elements of 3d modeling applied to a non orthogonal curvilinear mesh budinski and spasojević 2014 all the mentioned models for solving the partial differential equations exploit classical numerical methods finite difference finite element or the finite volume method these methods even efficient involve solving of complex mathematical compositions which may cause problems in stability in addidion since sediment movement and river bed deformations are slow processes by nature the calculation time in case of classical numerical models is very long as an alternative to classical calculation methods in this paper a relative recent method the lattice boltzmann method is exploited it is characterized by very simple mathematical formulation high efficiency and opportunity for parallel coding which increases the speed of calculation significantly tubbs and tsai 2011 watanabe and aoki 2021 making the lattice boltzmann method very successful in solving complex partial differential equations the analysis of sediment processes requires the flow pattern for open channel flow very often a 2d model is used based on the depth averaged equations application of the lattice boltzmann method for shallow water equations can be found in budinski 2012 thömmes et al 2007 zhou 2011a 2004 complex geometry and bathymetry characteristic to natural watercourses in case of bgk lbm often cause stability problems wu and shao 2004 to produce a model stable as possible for the solution of the swe the multiple relaxation time lbm budinski 2014 budinski et al 2020 liu et al 2012a zhou 2012 has been adopted the first step in solving the dynamics of sediment transport is calculation of the suspended sediment the transport of suspended sediment is calculated by the advection and anisotropic dispersion equation aade zhou 2011b showed that the lattice boltzmann equation can correctly recover the aade using a bgk lbm aade is modeled by ginzburg 2005 servan camas and tsai 2008 and yoshida and nagaoka 2010 by applying two relaxation time trt and the mrt approaches respectively a coupled lattice boltzmann model clbm for the 2d advection and anisotropic dispersion equation aade and shallow water equations can be found in li and huang 2009 2008 peng et al 2011 a one dimensional 1d and a two dimensional 2d lbm coupling procedure for solute transport is presented in wang and liu 2020 to demonstrate that the clbm can be efficiently applied to real natural watercourses having complex geometry and morphology budinski 2019 have presented a model in a curvilinear coordinate system the following step in modelling sediment related processes is modelling the behaviour of the bed load and the changes in the river bed morphology the simulation of these processes by the already available lbm models is oversimplified and limited some authors chen et al 2020 try to model bed load movement based on the movement of individual sediment particles similarly dolanský et al 2017 analysed the movement of individual particles in a pipe while jebakumar et al 2018 have investigated the distribution of sediment concentration along the pipe and channel and its impact on the flow pattern in these papers the exchange of sediment particles between the water and the bed is neglected as well as the changes of the bed level to account for the influence of the sediment on the bed level morrison and leder 2018 have set up a model for the simulation of the movement of sand particles and formation of sand bed structures in the vicinity of structures on the ocean bed morphological changes are in most of the cases described by the exner equation using the lbm for solving the exner equation is available in peng et al 2015 zhou 2014 zhou 2014 has shown that the lbm is using the bgk lbm suitable for modelling morphological changes for the calculation of the bed load he used the grass formula while peng et al 2015 utilized the more sophisticated expression of meyer peter and muller the verification of the both mentioned models was carried out on a rectangle cross section channel having a simple bed structure the use of the lbm for modelling sediment transport and morphological changes of the river bed is based on the related literature limited to the mechanisms involved without considering interaction between them in addition no one of the existing lbm considers sediment as mixture of particles of different sizes consequently neither the concentration variation of particles of different sizes within the suspension and bed load is addressed sediment transport is modelled just in simple cases not considering natural watercourses in order of setting up a lbm for solving sediment related issues in real natural watercourses the d2q9 model cartesian coordinates is presented in this paper the flow pattern is obtained by solving the swe using the mrt lbm the model accounts for all sediment related processes as well as for their interaction morphological changes and river bed structure the concentration of sediment particles within the water is solved by applying the aade lbm the particle size distribution of the bed load is solved by applying the bgk lbm to the active layer mass conservation equation the exner equation with a new equilibrium function proposed has also been solved by the bgk lbm the processes of mass exchange have been accounted for by sources terms to provide the most realistic results for the sediment particle size distribution is rather uneven in rivers the model does not limit the number of sediment size classes the verification of the model was performed on a danube section having complex geometry morphology and uneven sediment size distribution the calculated results were compared to the results obtained by fdm and measurements 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 the shallow water equations the swe are partial differential equations describing the distribution of water depth and velocity components in space and time they are developed by averaging the navier stokes equations in the vertical direction the

layer the analysis of sediment processes in the vicinity of the river bed is based on the idea of active layer spasojevic and holly 1990 which denotes the layer of thickness e m just above the river bed in which the bed load moves fig 1 applying the principle of mass conservation on the k th sediment size class within the control volume of the active layer results in the following relation 11 ρ s 1 p β k e m t ϕ k i x i d k e k s p k where β k defines the presence of a particular sediment size class in the active layer ϕ k i is the flux of bed load s p k is the term of particle exchange between the active layer and the active sub layer active stratum for the calculation of the thickness of the active layer based on the intensity and the duration of the erosion process borah et al 1982 proposed the following expression 12 e m c e z b n 1 z b n 1 k m k β k d m 1 p where c e is the erosion parameter d m is the diameter of the lowest static particle and p is porosity the bed load

sediment size class in the mixture taking in account erosion sedimentation and particle exchange between the layers of the river bed caused by changes in river bed morphology 2 4 the global sediment

danube section shown in fig 3 stretches between rkm 1438 and 1432 between water gauging station mohács in hungary rkm 1446 9 and gauging station bezdanin serbia rkm 1425 5 the width of the water table of the almost straight river section varies from 300 m at the upstream end to 580 m at the middle section measurements of bathymetry water levels velocity components concentration of the suspended sediment and the grain size distribution of the river bed have been carried out in altogether 7 cross sections in the period of 23 27 may 2011 cross section 1 corresponds to the upstream end of the considered danube section while cross section 7 is located at the downstream end consequently data corresponding to cross sections 1 and 7 represent boundary conditions the bathymetry of cross sections was determined by surveying points with about 100 m between each other measurements of water levels and velocity components in each cross section were made along 7 upright lines approximately evenly distributed between the river banks measurements of velocities by adcp acoustic doppler current profiler and sediment samplings were carried out from a steady vessel measurements of suspended sediments and bed load were carried out by method of double sampling along 5 upright lines in each cross section samples of suspended sediments were collected from 5 different depths along each upright line and from the river bed the concentration and the grain size distribution of the sediment was determined from the samples during the four day measurements the discharge and the water levels have not changed significantly therefore constant discharge and the corresponding water levels have been adopted for the calculations in fig 3 the base plot of the danube section can be seen with river bed elevations indicated by color codes 4 2 the hydraulic calculations the first part of the analysis includes the setting up of the numerical model for the calculation of the flow pattern velocity components and water levels the model is based on a 10x10 m square calculation grid with 26 833 calculation points altogether see d1 in fig 3 grid density has been set to suite river geometry keeping the number of calculation points low as possible to ease the calculations and shorten calculation time the upstream boundary condition is given by discharge q 1676 m 3 s determined by measurements the velocity distribution in the upstream cross section is set to satisfy the discharge and the water level in a manner that higher velocity corresponds to a bigger depth and vice versa constant depth has been set as downstream boundary condition liu et al 2012b constant water level all along the considered river section equal to the water level in the downstream cross section z s 81 69 m determined by measurements and velocity components set to zero have been adopted as initial condition the elastic collision scheme zhou 2004 has been applied to the river bed as boundary condition the calculations with mrt lbm have been performed with parameter values as follow n 0 017 m 1 3 s ν 0 05 m 2 s δ t 0 7 s s 1 s 4 s 6 1 3 s 2 0 7 s 3 s 5 s 9 0 s 7 s 8 1 τ where τ was determined by eq 27 steady state has been reached with about 50 000 iterations the results are shown in fig 4 in form of distribution of horizontal velocity components u and v in the horizontal x y plane with the corresponding details d2 and d3 comparison of the calculated results in terms of velocity components with the results obtained by using fdm and measurements is given in fig 5 for cross sections r2 r3 r4 and r6 and in appendix a for r5 and r7 the biggest discrepancy between the results of the two numerical methods 17 farther from the solid boundaries and 27 on the boundaries is detected in cross section r2 the biggest discrepancy between the results of the mrt lbm and the measured values is also in r2 7 farther from the solid boundaries and 27 on the boundaries very good agreement of the results both with the measurements and the results of the fdm budinski and spasojević 2014 has been achieved in all other sections r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 therefore the differences are not significant in a practical sense the calculated results follow the measured trends very well in all profiles a bit higher discrepancy nearby the solid boundaries is caused by the rougher calculation grid adopted which might be therefore improved by applying a finer grid to demonstrate the capability of the model for simulation of turbulent flows flow trajectories on the location of a vortex is given in d3 fig 4 4 3 calculation of the sediment related processes and deformation of the river bed following model calibration for the flow pattern and reaching steady state conditions calculation of the sediment related processes and deformation of the river bed have been performed to get detailed insight into the distribution of the sediment sediment size distribution has been determined by sieving and the sediment has been broken up in 12 size classes table 1 the distribution demonstrates high level of unevenness the first four size classes belong to dust size classes 5 10 are sand and size classes 11 and 12 are gravel for the sake of the modelling the characteristic particle diameter of each size class is determined as the mean value between the lowest and highest particle diameter of the class required by the boundary conditions the mean values of measured concentrations have been calculated averaging of concentrations along each upright line has been done separately for each size class the so determined reference concentrations in cross section 1 have been set as upstream boundary condition characteristic concentration of each sediment size class set to each calculation point represent the initial condition the mean value of concentrations determined by averaging the measured values in the upright lines of all cross sections has been adopted as characteristic concentration and therefore set as initial condition fig 6 shows the characteristic concentrations of suspended sediments and bed load by sediment size classes for clear presentation the concentration values of the particle size classes of the suspended sediments are given in ppm while in case of the bed load the percentual composition values are given fig 6 shows that the suspended sediment is made up of the first 5 size classes the bed load is made up mostly of size classes 7 and 8 while the rest classes contribute 5 the calculations have been performed for the presented initial conditions and the following values of parameters lattice boltzmann parameters τ c 1 4 τ al 2 8 τ gal 2 5 sediment data ρ s 2650 k g m 3 p 0 4 κ 0 4 d 50 0 22 mm d 90 0 33 mm d xx d yy 0 6 parameters of the river section a 0 05 m δ a 0 03 m c e 1 the thickness of the active sub layer 0 3 m the final results are met following the state of equilibrium between the water and sediment has been reached the simulation period lasted 3 6 days which has been achieved by 625 000 iterations for sake of comparison fig 7 presents the distribution of concentration of the suspended sediment in cross sections r3 and r6 obtained by the lbm fdm and by measurements the graphs corresponding to cross sections r2 r4 r5 and r7 are given in appendix b fig 8 shows the distribution of concentrations in horizontal plane size classes 1 4 are present the analysis of distribution of concentration in plane reveals that finer size classes 1 3 keep approximately the same concentration value within the whole considered river section characteristic to these size classes is that they keep the initial concentration values in the middle of the river and the concentration decreases a bit towards the river banks the same applies to size classes 4 6 the reason for this is perhaps that the intensity of velocity is the highest at the middle of the river decreasing towards the banks the reduced velocities are not capable to maintain high concentration levels in the vicinity of the banks in addition particle exchange between the suspended sediment and bed load is also decreasing with reduced velocities very low concentrations lower than 3 ppm are detected with size classes 7 12 on the one hand higher settling velocities characteristic to these classes enforce deposition on the other hand low flow velocities are not capable to provide sufficient uplift to the particles to keep them in suspension comparison of graphs in fig 7 demonstrate very good agreement between the calculated results and the results obtained by the fdm and the measurement the most significant discrepancy between the results of the lbm and fdm including the all sampled cross sections is documented for size classes 4 and 6 in cross section 6 having value of 13 and 70 respectively since the concentration values are extremely low at these locations just couple of ppm in addition the mentioned significant discrepancies are limited to just some of the upright measurement lines it may be concluded that the lbm proved to be very successful in modeling sediment related processes comparison of results for the bed load provided by the lbm fdm and measurements in 5 upright measurement lines of cross sections r3 and r6 is presented in fig 9 the results for the other cross sections are in appendix c the distribution of size classes 7 and 8 of the bed load in the horizontal plane is shown in fig 10 the analysis of results revealed dominant percentage of size classes 7 and 8 in the bed load predicted by both numerical models which agrees very well with the measurements the predicted percentage of size classes 5 6 and 9 is not higher than 5 with both numerical models while the percentage of the remaining size classes is negligible the comparison of results for the bed load provided by the lbm fdm and the measurements proves that the lbm can be successfully used for modeling of bed load processes the change of river bed elevation δ z is shown in fig 11 the calculation results show that the magnitude of changes in river bed morphology just few centimeters as the initial conditions set are almost identical to the equilibrium state the maximum increase in bottom level due to deposition is 5 cm while the maximum decrease for erosion is 15 cm since the thickness of the active layer is bigger than the maximum erosion the active layer will not be wore through so there will not come to mass exchange between the active layer and the active sub layer joint analysis of velocities fig 5 and river bed deformations fig 11 it can be clearly seen that deposition occurs in the domain of low velocities while increase in velocities cause erosion low velocities encourage settling particles of finer size classes fig 9 while by increase of velocities small particles get washed out and erosion takes place for example in cross section r3 by the left bank where the velocity is of lower intensity sediment class sizes 5 8 are present in the direction of the right bank velocity increases particles of size classes 5 6 get washed out the concentration of particles of size class 7 decreases and concentration of size class 8 increases the described conditions are reflected in fig 11 5 conclusion with the purpose of setting up a 2d model suitable for simulation of flow and sediment transport in natural watercourses this paper presents a model based on the lattice boltzmann method the model enables simulation of sediment movement suspended sediment and bed load as well the particle exchange mechanisms between the water and river bed river bed deformations as well as the particle exchange between the layers of the river bed in addition since very often the natural sediment mixture has uneven particle size distribution the model provides opportunity for treating the sediment mixture by unlimited number of size classes this approach provides opportunity for getting insight into the interaction between the water and the natural sediment mixture as well as into the interaction of all sediment related processes the flow pattern is obtained using the swe solved by the mrt lbm approach modeling of suspended sediment is carried out by the ade while for the bed load the active layer approach is exploited the exner equation is used for the calculation of the river bed deformation satisfying the requirement that the total percentage of all sediment size classes needs to be 1 all three sediment related equations are solved by the bgk lbm for the verification of the model a real a natural watercourse section of the danube river has been adopted having complex geometry bathymetry and sediment mixture of uneven grain size distribution calibration and verification have been achieved by comparison of the results produced by the proposed lbm model with the results gained by the fdm model and by measurements very good agreement of the results is documented which confirms the capability of the proposed lbm to be used for simulation of flow patterns and sediment related processes as well as for using it as alternative to classical numerical methods further investigation will be oriented first of all to improve the mathematical code in fact the lbm is very suitable for parallel programming therefore for simultaneous solving of sediment

3696,a novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for sediment transport and morphological changes is developed and implemented the depth averaged shallow water equations swe have been used to reach the flow pattern the advection diffusion equation ade was exploited to determine sediment concentration in the water bed load was determined by the active layer mass conservation equation almc while the morphological changes of the river bed were determined by the global active layer mass conservation equation galmc the exner equation the swe are solved by the multiple relaxation time lattice boltzmann method mrt lbm while the bhatnagar gross krook bgk lbm approach has been used for solving the ade almc and galmc new forms of the equilibrium function for solving the almc and galmc are presented using the d2q9 lattice dedicated sediment related equations are created for each sediment size class additional dedicated terms in the transport equations take care of particle exchange between the suspension and the river bed as well as of river bed deformation the model has been verified on a experimental section of the danube river the results have been compared to the measured ones and to the results obtained by the finite difference method fdm very good agreement between the results is achieved indicating that the lbm can be successfully used for simulation of flow and sediment related processes in natural watercourses characterized by complex geometry and morphology and lack of uniformity in sediment composition keywords lattice boltzmann method natural watercourses shallow water equations sediment transport morphological changes 1 introduction in most cases of natural watercourses due to the complex flow pattern and uneven sediment distribution and concentration part of the sediment moves by the water suspended sediment while the rest is moving just over the bed bed load connection between these two phases comes true through the processes of sedimentation and erosion leading to never ending changes in granulometry of the suspension as well as of the river bed solid particle exchange between the water and the river bed causes morphological changes of the bed itself which might cause changes in bed composition as well modelling the complex processes of sediment dynamics and transport and river bed changes requires independent analysis of all involved processes moving of suspended particles erosion deposition bed load movement river bed deformation and particle exchange between the layers of the river bed and their interaction besides to obtain the most realistic insight into the processes involved the natural sediment mixture in most of the cases characterized by very uneven particle distribution needs to be broken down to particular sediment size classes it makes possible to determine the concentration of a particular sediment size class both in the suspension and in the bed load significant number of models have been developed for the sediment however most of them have limitations for not taking care of or oversimplifying certain processes involved some of the models consider just river bed changes jia and wang 1999 kassem and chaudhry 2005 some of them treat river bed load only gao 2011 roushangar and koosheh 2015 while there are models duan and nanda 2006 ta et al 2015 calculating just the transport of suspended solids taking in account solid exchange between the bed and the suspension models by guan and liang 2017 li et al 2008 do not take account of the bed load while javernick et al 2018 warburton and davies 1994 neglected the suspended part of the sediments spasojevic and holly 2008 1990 have come up with a mathematical formulation taking in consideration the all processes involved interactions between them and treating sediment by particle classes which has been tested on natural watercourses the model has been further improved in terms of the numerical method and the particle exchange mechanisms between the river bed and the water phase exploiting the elements of 3d modeling applied to a non orthogonal curvilinear mesh budinski and spasojević 2014 all the mentioned models for solving the partial differential equations exploit classical numerical methods finite difference finite element or the finite volume method these methods even efficient involve solving of complex mathematical compositions which may cause problems in stability in addidion since sediment movement and river bed deformations are slow processes by nature the calculation time in case of classical numerical models is very long as an alternative to classical calculation methods in this paper a relative recent method the lattice boltzmann method is exploited it is characterized by very simple mathematical formulation high efficiency and opportunity for parallel coding which increases the speed of calculation significantly tubbs and tsai 2011 watanabe and aoki 2021 making the lattice boltzmann method very successful in solving complex partial differential equations the analysis of sediment processes requires the flow pattern for open channel flow very often a 2d model is used based on the depth averaged equations application of the lattice boltzmann method for shallow water equations can be found in budinski 2012 thömmes et al 2007 zhou 2011a 2004 complex geometry and bathymetry characteristic to natural watercourses in case of bgk lbm often cause stability problems wu and shao 2004 to produce a model stable as possible for the solution of the swe the multiple relaxation time lbm budinski 2014 budinski et al 2020 liu et al 2012a zhou 2012 has been adopted the first step in solving the dynamics of sediment transport is calculation of the suspended sediment the transport of suspended sediment is calculated by the advection and anisotropic dispersion equation aade zhou 2011b showed that the lattice boltzmann equation can correctly recover the aade using a bgk lbm aade is modeled by ginzburg 2005 servan camas and tsai 2008 and yoshida and nagaoka 2010 by applying two relaxation time trt and the mrt approaches respectively a coupled lattice boltzmann model clbm for the 2d advection and anisotropic dispersion equation aade and shallow water equations can be found in li and huang 2009 2008 peng et al 2011 a one dimensional 1d and a two dimensional 2d lbm coupling procedure for solute transport is presented in wang and liu 2020 to demonstrate that the clbm can be efficiently applied to real natural watercourses having complex geometry and morphology budinski 2019 have presented a model in a curvilinear coordinate system the following step in modelling sediment related processes is modelling the behaviour of the bed load and the changes in the river bed morphology the simulation of these processes by the already available lbm models is oversimplified and limited some authors chen et al 2020 try to model bed load movement based on the movement of individual sediment particles similarly dolanský et al 2017 analysed the movement of individual particles in a pipe while jebakumar et al 2018 have investigated the distribution of sediment concentration along the pipe and channel and its impact on the flow pattern in these papers the exchange of sediment particles between the water and the bed is neglected as well as the changes of the bed level to account for the influence of the sediment on the bed level morrison and leder 2018 have set up a model for the simulation of the movement of sand particles and formation of sand bed structures in the vicinity of structures on the ocean bed morphological changes are in most of the cases described by the exner equation using the lbm for solving the exner equation is available in peng et al 2015 zhou 2014 zhou 2014 has shown that the lbm is using the bgk lbm suitable for modelling morphological changes for the calculation of the bed load he used the grass formula while peng et al 2015 utilized the more sophisticated expression of meyer peter and muller the verification of the both mentioned models was carried out on a rectangle cross section channel having a simple bed structure the use of the lbm for modelling sediment transport and morphological changes of the river bed is based on the related literature limited to the mechanisms involved without considering interaction between them in addition no one of the existing lbm considers sediment as mixture of particles of different sizes consequently neither the concentration variation of particles of different sizes within the suspension and bed load is addressed sediment transport is modelled just in simple cases not considering natural watercourses in order of setting up a lbm for solving sediment related issues in real natural watercourses the d2q9 model cartesian coordinates is presented in this paper the flow pattern is obtained by solving the swe using the mrt lbm the model accounts for all sediment related processes as well as for their interaction morphological changes and river bed structure the concentration of sediment particles within the water is solved by applying the aade lbm the particle size distribution of the bed load is solved by applying the bgk lbm to the active layer mass conservation equation the exner equation with a new equilibrium function proposed has also been solved by the bgk lbm the processes of mass exchange have been accounted for by sources terms to provide the most realistic results for the sediment particle size distribution is rather uneven in rivers the model does not limit the number of sediment size classes the verification of the model was performed on a danube section having complex geometry morphology and uneven sediment size distribution the calculated results were compared to the results obtained by fdm and measurements 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 the shallow water equations the swe are partial

danube section shown in fig 3 stretches between rkm 1438 and 1432 between water gauging station mohács in hungary rkm 1446 9 and gauging station bezdanin serbia rkm 1425 5 the width of the water table of the almost straight river section varies from 300 m at the upstream end to 580 m at the middle section measurements of bathymetry water levels velocity components concentration of the suspended sediment and the grain size distribution of the river bed have been carried out in altogether 7 cross sections in the period of 23 27 may 2011 cross section 1 corresponds to the upstream end of the considered danube section while cross section 7 is located at the downstream end consequently data corresponding to cross sections 1 and 7 represent boundary conditions the bathymetry of cross sections was determined by surveying points with about 100 m between each other measurements of water levels and velocity components in each cross section were made along 7 upright lines approximately evenly distributed between the river banks measurements of velocities by adcp acoustic doppler current profiler and sediment samplings were carried out from a steady vessel measurements of suspended sediments and bed load were carried out by method of double sampling along 5 upright lines in each cross section samples of suspended sediments were collected from 5 different depths along each upright line and from the river bed the concentration and the grain size distribution of the sediment was determined from the samples during the four day measurements the discharge and the water levels have not changed significantly therefore constant discharge and the corresponding water levels have been adopted for the calculations in fig 3 the base plot of the danube section can be seen with river bed elevations indicated by color codes 4 2 the hydraulic calculations the first part of the analysis includes the setting up of the numerical model for the calculation of the flow pattern velocity components and water levels the model is based on a 10x10 m square calculation grid with 26 833 calculation points altogether see d1 in fig 3 grid density has been set to suite river geometry keeping the number of calculation points low as possible to ease the calculations and shorten calculation time the upstream boundary condition is given by discharge q 1676 m 3 s determined by measurements the velocity distribution in the upstream cross section is set to satisfy the discharge and the water level in a manner that higher velocity corresponds to a bigger depth and vice versa constant depth has been set as downstream boundary condition liu et al 2012b constant water level all along the considered river section equal to the water level in the downstream cross section z s 81 69 m determined by measurements and velocity components set to zero have been adopted as initial condition the elastic collision scheme zhou 2004 has been applied to the river bed as boundary condition the calculations with mrt lbm have been performed with parameter values as follow n 0 017 m 1 3 s ν 0 05 m 2 s δ t 0 7 s s 1 s 4 s 6 1 3 s 2 0 7 s 3 s 5 s 9 0 s 7 s 8 1 τ where τ was determined by eq 27 steady state has been reached with about 50 000 iterations the results are shown in fig 4 in form of distribution of horizontal velocity components u and v in the horizontal x y plane with the corresponding details d2 and d3 comparison of the calculated results in terms of velocity components with the results obtained by using fdm and measurements is given in fig 5 for cross sections r2 r3 r4 and r6 and in appendix a for r5 and r7 the biggest discrepancy between the results of the two numerical methods 17 farther from the solid boundaries and 27 on the boundaries is detected in cross section r2 the biggest discrepancy between the results of the mrt lbm and the measured values is also in r2 7 farther from the solid boundaries and 27 on the boundaries very good agreement of the results both with the measurements and the results of the fdm budinski and spasojević 2014 has been achieved in all other sections r3 r4 r5 r6 and r7 therefore the differences are not significant in a practical sense the calculated results follow the measured trends very well in all profiles a bit higher discrepancy nearby the solid boundaries is caused by the rougher calculation grid adopted which might be therefore improved by applying a finer grid to demonstrate the capability of the model for simulation of turbulent flows flow trajectories on the location of a vortex is given in d3 fig 4 4 3 calculation of the sediment related processes and deformation of the river bed following model calibration for the flow pattern and reaching steady state conditions calculation of the sediment related processes and deformation of the river bed have been performed to get detailed insight into the distribution of the sediment sediment size distribution has been determined by sieving and the sediment has been broken up in 12 size classes table 1 the distribution demonstrates high level of unevenness the first four size classes belong to dust size classes 5 10 are sand and size classes 11 and 12 are gravel for the sake of the modelling the characteristic particle diameter of each size class is determined as the mean value between the lowest and highest particle diameter of the class required by the boundary conditions the mean values of measured concentrations have been calculated averaging of concentrations along each upright line has been done separately for each size class the so determined reference concentrations in cross section 1 have been set as upstream boundary condition characteristic concentration of each sediment size class set to each calculation point represent the initial condition the mean value of concentrations determined by averaging the measured values in the upright lines of all cross sections has been adopted as characteristic concentration and therefore set as initial condition fig 6 shows the characteristic concentrations of suspended sediments and bed load by sediment size classes for clear presentation the concentration values of the particle size classes of the suspended sediments are given in ppm while in case of the bed load the percentual composition values are given fig 6 shows that the suspended sediment is made up of the first 5 size classes the bed load is made up mostly of size classes 7 and 8 while the rest classes contribute 5 the calculations have been performed for the presented initial conditions and the following values of parameters lattice boltzmann parameters τ c 1 4 τ al 2 8 τ gal 2 5 sediment data ρ s 2650 k g m 3 p 0 4 κ 0 4 d 50 0 22 mm d 90 0 33 mm d xx d yy 0 6 parameters of the river section a 0 05 m δ a 0 03 m c e 1 the thickness of the active sub layer 0 3 m the final results are met following the state of equilibrium between the water and sediment has been reached the simulation period lasted 3 6 days which has been achieved by 625 000 iterations for sake of comparison fig 7 presents the distribution of concentration of the suspended sediment in cross sections r3 and r6 obtained by the lbm fdm and by measurements the graphs corresponding to cross sections r2 r4 r5 and r7 are given in appendix b fig 8 shows the distribution of concentrations in horizontal plane size classes 1 4 are present the analysis of distribution of concentration in plane reveals that finer size classes 1 3 keep approximately the same concentration value within the whole considered river section characteristic to these size classes is that they keep the initial concentration values in the middle of the river and the concentration decreases a bit towards the river banks the same applies to size classes 4 6 the reason for this is perhaps that the intensity of velocity is the highest at the middle of the river decreasing towards the banks the reduced velocities are not capable to maintain high concentration levels in the vicinity of the banks in addition particle exchange between the suspended sediment and bed load is also decreasing with reduced velocities very low concentrations lower than 3 ppm are detected with size classes 7 12 on the one hand higher settling velocities characteristic to these classes enforce deposition on the other hand low flow velocities are not capable to provide sufficient uplift to the particles to keep them in suspension comparison of graphs in fig 7 demonstrate very good agreement between the calculated results and the results obtained by the fdm and the measurement the most significant discrepancy between the results of the lbm and fdm including the all sampled cross sections is documented for size classes 4 and 6 in cross section 6 having value of 13 and 70 respectively since the concentration values are extremely low at these locations just couple of ppm in addition the mentioned significant discrepancies are limited to just some of the upright measurement lines it may be concluded that the lbm proved to be very successful in modeling sediment related processes comparison of results for the bed load provided by the lbm fdm and measurements in 5 upright measurement lines of cross sections r3 and r6 is presented in fig 9 the results for the other cross sections are in appendix c the distribution of size classes 7 and 8 of the bed load in the horizontal plane is shown in fig 10 the analysis of results revealed dominant percentage of size classes 7 and 8 in the bed load predicted by both numerical models which agrees very well with the measurements the predicted percentage of size classes 5 6 and 9 is not higher than 5 with both numerical models while the percentage of the remaining size classes is negligible the comparison of results for the bed load provided by the lbm fdm and the measurements proves that the lbm can be successfully used for modeling of bed load processes the change of river bed elevation δ z is shown in fig 11 the calculation results show that the magnitude of changes in river bed morphology just few centimeters as the initial conditions set are almost identical to the equilibrium state the maximum increase in bottom level due to deposition is 5 cm while the maximum decrease for erosion is 15 cm since the thickness of the active layer is bigger than the maximum erosion the active layer will not be wore through so there will not come to mass exchange between the active layer and the active sub layer joint analysis of velocities fig 5 and river bed deformations fig 11 it can be clearly seen that deposition occurs in the domain of low velocities while increase in velocities cause erosion low velocities encourage settling particles of finer size classes fig 9 while by increase of velocities small particles get washed out and erosion takes place for example in cross section r3 by the left bank where the velocity is of lower intensity sediment class sizes 5 8 are present in the direction of the right bank velocity increases particles of size classes 5 6 get washed out the concentration of particles of size class 7 decreases and concentration of size class 8 increases the described conditions are reflected in fig 11 5 conclusion with the purpose of setting up a 2d model suitable for simulation of flow and sediment transport in natural watercourses this paper presents a model based on the lattice boltzmann method the model enables simulation of sediment movement suspended sediment and bed load as well the particle exchange mechanisms between the water and river bed river bed deformations as well as the particle exchange between the layers of the river bed in addition since very often the natural sediment mixture has uneven particle size distribution the model provides opportunity for treating the sediment mixture by unlimited number of size classes this approach provides opportunity for getting insight into the interaction between the water and the natural sediment mixture as well as into the interaction of all sediment related processes the flow pattern is obtained using the swe solved by the mrt lbm approach modeling of suspended sediment is carried out by the ade while for the bed load the active layer approach is exploited the exner equation is used for the calculation of the river bed deformation satisfying the requirement that the total percentage of all sediment size classes needs to be 1 all three sediment related equations are solved by the bgk lbm for the verification of the model a real a natural watercourse section of the danube river has been adopted having complex geometry bathymetry and sediment mixture of uneven grain size distribution calibration and verification have been achieved by comparison of the results produced by the proposed lbm model with the results gained by the fdm model and by measurements very good agreement of the results is documented which confirms the capability of the proposed lbm to be used for simulation of flow patterns and sediment related processes as well as for using it as alternative to classical numerical methods further investigation will be oriented first of all to improve the mathematical code in fact the lbm is very suitable for parallel programming therefore for simultaneous solving of sediment transport equation for all sediment size classes which makes the lbm concurrent to all currently existing methods credit authorship contribution statement danilo stipić conceptualization methodology

3697,high arsenic as groundwater in reduced shallow holocene and pleistocene aquifers has been intensively investigated but the occurrence and the genesis mechanisms of high as groundwater in deep pliocene aquifers affected by geothermal activity still remain unclear to address these issues geochemical characteristics of groundwater and aquifer sediments in both middle pliocene aquifers and quaternary aquifers of the guide basin were investigated to clarify groundwater sediments interaction and the causes of as enrichment in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer higher as and na concentrations were observed in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer gpa than those in groundwater from quaternary aquifer gqa while gpa had lower ca2 concentrations than gqa results showed that middle pliocene aquifer sediments had low contents of carbonate minerals and water soluble ca bearing minerals relative to quaternary aquifer sediments which explain higher concentration of ca2 in gqa than in gpa na from weathering of silicates i e na being calculated based on mass balance accounted for high proportion of dissolved na up to 68 in gpa weathering of silicates was related to as accumulation in gpa which was proved by a positive correlation between as and na in gpa and high proportion of as bound to unweathered silicates up to 65 7 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments the weathering of silicate minerals directly released as bound to silicates into gpa and indirectly led to as desorption from solid surfaces by increasing ph hco3 and co3 2 both na and as in groundwater increased with the increasing groundwater temperature showing that high temperature was conducive to weathering of silicates and as enrichment this paper establishes a bridge between high groundwater temperature and high as concentration with weathering of silicates in aquifers keywords silicates arsenic desorption temperature pliocene aquifers 1 introduction naturally high as concentration 10 μg l who guidelines for drinking water in groundwater is a world wide problem podgorski and berg 2020 guo et al 2017 rahman et al 2021 guo et al 2014b it has been widely accepted that reductive dissolution of ferric oxyhydroxides is the main process for as release into groundwater in reducing aquifers postma et al 2012 guo et al 2013 while desorption induced by high ph knappett et al 2020 rango et al 2013 hco3 armengol et al 2020 jeelani et al 2020 and co3 2 appelo et al 2002 can promote as enrichment in both reducing and oxidizing aquifers boonkaewwan et al 2021 mueller and hug 2018 postma et al 2017 weathering of silicates was reported as the source of dissolved as in groundwater alam et al 2014 verma et al 2016 desbarats et al 2017 in addition geothermal waters can be an important source of as villalba et al 2020 gao et al 2020a hamidian et al 2019 and high groundwater temperature improves as mobility arnórsson 2003 via desorption simmler et al 2017 van breukelen and bonte 2016 dixit and hering 2003 dissolution of as containing minerals riedel 2019 knappett et al 2020 sracek et al 2019 silicate minerals were reported as the main source of shallow groundwater as in peninsula area alam et al 2014 delta plain seddique et al 2008 itai et al 2008 and inland basin verma et al 2016 the release of as from weathering of silicate minerals was frequently observed in shallow aquifers desbarats et al 2017 biswas et al 2014 in addition to direct release of as during silicate weathering weathering of silicate minerals also promotes as enrichment by raising ph and hco3 concentration in groundwater rango et al 2013 knappett et al 2020 halim et al 2010 ali et al 2019 furthermore increasing temperature is conducive to the silicate weathering gruber et al 2016 and as releasing into groundwater in a volcanic aquifer morales arredondo et al 2018 this has also been proved by column experiments bonte et al 2013 craig et al 2021 and incubation experiments joubert et al 2007 weber et al 2009 however it is still unknown how the weathering of silicates contributes to as enrichment in geothermal affected groundwater in deep pliocene sand aquifers over the past several decades many studies have used a variety of geochemical indicators to assess groundwater sediment interaction and as behavior in groundwater systems arakel et al 1990 elango and kannan 2007 verma et al 2016 sø et al 2018 sheibani et al 2020 inorganic carbon isotopes godfrey et al 2021 in groundwater are generally used to identify hydrochemical processes relatively high δ13cdic in groundwater with high na and hco3 is attributed to weathering of silicates driven by endogenic co2 to raise as concentration in groundwater sracek et al 2019 the δ13c values of endogenous co2 from magma are normally from 7 to 4 minissale 2004 and the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater generally become higher with the higher dic input by endogenous co2 from deep granites dupalová et al 2012 however lower δ13cdic 13 5 to 5 6 in higher as groundwater of the hetao basin resulted from degradation of dissolved organic matter zhou et al 2018 which was conductive to as release by promoting reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxide minerals both intrusion of endogenous co2 and degradation of dissolved organic matter would contribute to dic in geothermal affected deep groundwater however it remains unclear about the source of dissolved inorganic carbon and its contribution to high as groundwater in deep pliocene aquifer the guide basin is a typical semi arid basin in the northwest of china song et al 2008 where high as groundwater is mainly hosted in geothermal affected middle pliocene aquifers of guide group in cenozoic strata at the depths more than 100 m below land surface bls wang et al 2018 temperature is higher in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer in relative to groundwater from quaternary aquifer high as groundwater occurs in middle pliocene aquifers which is different from high as groundwater in holocene aquifers sø et al 2018 glodowska et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and in late pleistocene aquifers guo et al 2016 guo et al 2014b although previous studies showed that high as groundwater in the middle pliocene aquifer was related to as desorption under high ph and high co3 2 concentrations liao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the roles of silicate weathering in as enrichment and the cause of high ph and high hco3 and co3 2 have not been explained thoroughly which would constrain our understanding of as enrichment mechanisms in the basin therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 characterize geochemical properties of aquifer sediments in both middle pliocene aquifers and quaternary aquifers 2 delineate the sources of inorganic carbon ca2 and na in groundwaters from the middle pliocene aquifers gpa and the quaternary aquifers gqa and 3 evaluate the roles of silicate weathering and groundwater temperature in as enrichment in gpa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the guide basin is located to the southwest of xining city covering an area of nearly 1000 km2 it is surrounded by mountains with an altitude of 3500 4500 m the basin has an altitude of 2400 3000 m with relative elevation difference of 300 400 m the yellow river is the largest river across the study area which flows through the whole area from west to east the tributaries flow from north to south into the yellow river forming a feather like water system with the yellow river as the main stream fig 1 a the study area is located in the northeast margin of the qinghai tibet plateau and has a semi arid continental climate the annual average temperature precipitation and evaporation are 7 2 252 mm and 2000 mm respectively liao et al 2013 precipitation mainly concentrates in june to september accounting for more than 72 of annual precipitation xu et al 1976 the quaternary strata are divided into lower pleistocene alluvial deposits middle pleistocene glacial deposits upper pleistocene alluvial deposit and holocene alluvial diluvial sediments as shown in fig 1a the quaternary strata are composed of well rounded and well sorted gravel and sand with a thickness of around 23 to 52 m xu et al 1976 the pliocene strata are widely distributed in low mountains and intermountain basins of the study area being composed of red clastic argillaceous rock formation of fluvial and lacustrine facies fig 1a the pliocene strata have been divided into the early pliocene n 2 1 the middle pliocene n 2 2 and the late pliocene n 2 3 wang et al 2018 the late pliocene n 2 3 being composed of mudstone with thick sand or conglomeratic sand lenses only occurs to the north of the yellow river due to the reverse fault in the east west direction along the yellow river fig 1b and 1c whose bottom is at the depth around 200 m bls xu et al 1976 the middle pliocene n 2 2 being composed of mudstone sand and pebbly sand has a thickness of around 260 m with the bottom confining layer at depths around 460 bls to the north of the yellow river and around 310 m bls to the south of the yellow river fig 1a the groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer hosts high as concentrations the middle pliocene n 2 2 is believed as the main aquifer in the basin the spatial distributions of the middle pliocene aquifers are very unstable with thickness from 0 20 m to 5 21 m fig 1c the early pliocene n 2 1 consisting of shale and lenticular sand is generally believed to be an aquitard underlying the middle pliocene n 2 2 xu et al 1976 the heat energy of the guide basin is mainly derived from the residual heat of mesozoic indosinian granite magma the thick mesozoic and cenozoic sediments provide perfect conditions for the formation and storage of the geothermal groundwater liao et al 2013 the middle pliocene aquifers in the basin are supplied by the deep heat source through the concealed faults in the basement via heat conduction and convection liao et al 2013 the middle pliocene aquifers have temperature gradient from 6 7 to 9 7 100 m as twice as empirical geothermal gradient of 3 3 c 100 m shi et al 2010 the wide distribution of quaternary gravel cobble layer in the basin provides good conditions for recharge of precipitation and surface water from surrounding mountains and riverbed of the tributary of the yellow river into groundwater in quaternary aquifer the middle pliocene aquifers are mainly recharged by surrounding mountains and overlying quaternary aquifers the yellow river is the final discharge of surface water and groundwater in the basin xu et al 1976 the flow directions of groundwater in the middle pliocene aquifers to the south and the north of the yellow river are approximately perpendicular to the yellow river fig 1b to the south of the yellow river the groundwater levels and the hydraulic gradients decline from southeast to northwest as shown in the hydrogeological profile section i ii fig 1c the zhacang hot spring located in the southeast of the study area fig 1a is controlled by structural faults and belongs to fracture hot spring water which is discharged at the junction of compressive and tensile faults in the granite lang et al 2016a there are many new faults and some resurrected old faults in the geothermal field and its surrounding areas which also provide potential pathways for recharge of groundwater into the middle pliocene aquifers lang et al 2016b 2 2 groundwater and sediment sampling 2 2 1 water sampling seventy one water samples were collected from the study area including 21 groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer gpa samples 33 groundwater from quaternary aquifer gqa samples 4 spring water sw samples 1 hot spring water hsw sample 9 river water river samples and 3 rain water rain samples locations of sampling sites are shown in fig 1a sample of hsw was collected in the zhacang hot spring fig 1a with the exception of artesian water groundwaters were sampled after pumping for more than 20 min until groundwater ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp and temperature were stable in order to ensure that the collected groundwater represented water from the aquifers rather than the boreholes all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters sampling vessels were acid washed and deionized water rinsed thoroughly in the laboratory prior to the field sampling samples for analyzing major cations and trace elements were put into 50 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and acidified to ph 2 by using 6 mol l purified hno3 samples for major anion analysis were collected without acidification samples for arsenic as species were put into 2 ml amber glass bottles which were added with 0 25 mol l ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta as a protective agent samples for dissolved organic carbon doc and doc isotope δ13cdoc were collected in amber glass bottles and acidified to ph 2 by using h3po4 samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic and inorganic carbon isotope δ13cdic were collected in amber glass bottles with the addition of saturated hgcl2 to inhibit microbial conversion of organic carbon to inorganic carbon samples for oxygen and hydrogen isotope analysis were collected in 2 ml glass bottles which were fully filled without headspace all samples were transported to the laboratory at 4 c and kept in a refrigerator the analysis was accomplished within two weeks 2 2 2 sediment sampling one borehole located in the north of the yellow river fig 1a was drilled to take sediment samples from the different aquifers up to 500 m bls in 2018 sixty two sediments were collected among these sediment samples there were 7 sediment samples from the quaternary 7 sand samples 25 sediment samples from the late pliocene 12 sand samples and 13 clay or mudstone samples and 30 sediment samples from the middle pliocene 15 sand samples and 15 clay or mudstone samples the sampling interval was dependent on lithological settings and additional samples were collected near lithological boundaries prior to sediment sampling the use of drilling fluids

except of sample gpa 17 12 5 which are significantly higher than those in gqa from 10 0 to 14 7 sd 1 21 p 0 01 fig 2d thus gpa can be called as low temperature geothermal groundwater liao et al 2013

measured temperature was around 93 and na was the dominant cation and cl and so4 2 were the major anions the ca2 and na were the main cation and hco3 was the primary anion in river and rain water samples which was similar to gqa 3 2 arsenic and as species in groundwater significant differences in both dissolved as concentrations and as species were observed between gpa and gqa p 0 01 arsenic

dominated by as v species accounting for nearly 100 of total as which is consistent with positive orp values from 70 6 to 176 mv sd 27 2 mv however as iii was the predominant as species in gpa arsenite concentrations in gpa ranged from 9 22 to 353 μg l sd 106 μg l which generally accounted for more than 80 of total as with the exception of gpa 1 with the proportion of 38 9 the high

located above the lmwl hsw sample was below the lmwl showing a signal of 18o shift due to exchanges of oxygen isotopes of geothermal groundwaters with oxygen bearing minerals e g silicates sracek et al 2019 qin et al 2005 pang et al 2017 gpa with high as concentrations were generally enriched in 13cdic relative to gqa δ13cdic in gpa ranging from 7 94 to 5 39 sd 0 72 were significantly higher than

δ13cdoc in samples of gpa gqa sw rain and river had a small variation with the standard deviation values around 0 66 3 4 geochemical characteristics of sediments according to the geological logging sediments in the hej borehole were divided into quaternary sediments from 0 to 53 5 m bls corresponding to quaternary aquifers late pliocene sediments from 53 5 to 169 m bls and middle pliocene sediments from 169 to 500 m bls corresponding to middle pliocene aquifers fig 3 a the quaternary sediments were characterized by gravel layer mud bearing gravel layer and sand layer the late pliocene sediments by thick clay or mudstone interlaid by sands and the middle pliocene sediments by pebbly sand and sand interlaid with clay or mudstone fig 3a the clay and mudstone layer in the middle pliocene is an aquitard overlying the aquifer sands 3 4 1 mineral compositions fig 3b showed xrd results of quaternary sediments late pliocene sediments and middle pliocene sediments at different depths of hej albite and quartz were observed as the main minerals more than 80 and kaolinite and gypsum were observed as the minor minerals 10 in both quaternary aquifer sediments and middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b results of optical microscope and sem eds were in line with these observations figs s4a s4d carbonate minerals such as calcite were only observed in quaternary aquifer sediments details on mineral compositions are shown in supporting information 3 4 2 contents of total elements total as contents in sediments ranged from 3 1 to 63 7 mg kg sd 10 5 mg kg fig s5a in all sediments total as contents in middle pliocene aquifer sediments were more than 4 times lower than in quaternary aquifer sediments and slightly lower than in late pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4 a bulk fe and mn contents in all sediments varied from 7 9 to 53 9 g kg sd 11 6 g kg and from 0 15 to 1 13 g kg sd 0 27 g kg respectively fig s5b positive correlations between as and fe and between as and mn were observed r 0 69 and p 0 01 r 0 55 and p 0 01 respectively figs s5e and s5f total ca contents varied from 5 4 to 137 g kg sd 40 4 g kg fig s5c in all sediments total ca content in aquifer sediments had a decreasing trend from quaternary aquifer sediments 41 5 to 73 0 g kg sd 11 0 g kg to middle pliocene aquifer sediments 5 36 to 36 2 g kg sd 11 0 g kg fig 4b this is consistent with higher contents of total ca in younger sediments in the bank of the red river in the hanoi and lower in older sediments with the extensive weathering van geen et al 2013 sic contents in middle pliocene aquifer sediments ranged from 0 025 to 0 9 mg g sd 0 31 mg g which were around one tenth of quaternary aquifer sediments from 7 6 to 13 mg g sd 1 75 mg g fig 4c soc contents in middle pliocene aquifer sediments ranged from 0 40 to 1 00 mg g sd 0 19 mg g which is lower than that of high as aquifer sediments in the hetao basin zhang et al 2020 c n ratios in aquifer sediments varied from 1 31 to 5 78 sd 0 87 and slight differences in c n ratios were observed among quaternary aquifer sediments from 1 74 to 3 24 sd 0 48 late pliocene aquifer sediments from 1 78 to 3 96 sd 0 78 and middle pliocene aquifer sediments from 1 31 to 5 78 sd 1 10 fig s5d p 0 05 details on contents of total elements are shown in supporting information 3 4 3 soluble components in solids water extract solution had ec ranged from 0 16 to 4 11 ms cm sd 0 98 ms cm in all sediments fig s6a ph in water extract solution ranged from 7 7 to 10 3 sd 0 58 which increased from quaternary sediments 7 7 to 9 2 sd 0 56 to middle pliocene sediments 8 5 to 10 0 sd 0 37 fig s6a such alkaline ph values are characteristic for aquifer sediments in arid and semi arid regions which were observed in aquifer sediments in the hetao basin wang et al 2019 water soluble as contents were between 8 84 and 398 μg kg sd 93 6 μg kg fig s6b in all sediments contents of water soluble as in middle pliocene aquifer sediments n

aquifer sediments n 7 p 0 01 fig 4a noticeably water soluble as of the middle pliocene aquifer sediments had a positive correlation with ph in water extract solution r 0 78 p 0 01 fig 5 a water soluble na and ca2 contents ranged from 0 13 to 3 56 g kg sd 0 86 g kg and from 0 005 to 0 96 g kg sd 0 18 g kg respectively in all sediments fig s6c the high contents of water soluble na and ca2 mostly occurred in quaternary sediments fig s6c low contents of water soluble ca2 were observed in middle pliocene aquifer sediments which were more than 90 folds lower than those of quaternary aquifer sediments fig 4e details on soluble components in solids are shown in supporting information 3 4 4 carbonate bound ca in sediments sequential extraction showed that carbonate bound ca ranged from 0 01 to 27 2 mg g sd 8 26 mg g and exchangeable ca varied from 1 05 to 9 92 mg g sd 2 85 mg g fig s7 in all sediments both exchangeable and carbonate bound ca contents decreased along the depth exchangeable ca contents were lower than carbonate bound ca in quaternary sediments but higher than carbonate bound ca in middle pliocene sediments fig s7 middle pliocene aquifer sediments had the lowest contents of carbonate bound ca from 0 01 to 1 89 mg g sd 0 50 mg g in comparison with late pliocene aquifer sediments from 4 99 to 9 97 mg g sd 1 91 mg kg and quaternary aquifer sediments between 10 7 and 27 2 mg g sd 0 50 mg g fig 4f p 0 01 which was consistent with sic contents fig 4c 3 4 5 arsenic forms in sediments arsenic mainly occurred in unweathered silicate bound form s6 crystalline fe oxide bound form s5 or strongly adsorbed form s2 the proportion of s6 to total as varied from 14 0 to 65 7 sd 14 3 s5 proportion from 25 6 to 68 8 sd 9 64 and s2 proportion from 0 22 to 45 7 sd 12 0 fig 6 which is in line with aquifer sediments from other areas alam et al 2014 seddique et al 2008 desbarats et al 2017 relatively less as was associated with amorphous fe oxide minerals the sum of different as forms showed a slight difference from bulk contents measured by xrf with an average deviation of 22 6 and a good positive correlation was observed between them r 0 96 p 0 01 details on fe and mn forms in sediments are shown in supporting information 4 discussion 4 1 sources of groundwater inorganic carbon ca2 and na 4 1 1 origin of inorganic carbon in groundwater dic of gpa was input by endogenic co2 originating from deep granites relatively high δ13cdic of gpa from 7 94 to 5 39 sd 0 72 table s1 indicate the input of endogenic co2 into the middle pliocene aquifer noseck et al 2009 minissale et al 2002 sracek et al 2015 sracek et al 2019 limited carbonate minerals fig 3b limited carbonate bound ca fig 4f and limited sic contents fig 4c in middle pliocene aquifer sediments suggest the limited contribution of carbonate mineral dissolution to dic in gpa fig 7 a shows that dic was positively correlated with δ13cdic in gpa r 0 64 p 0 01 also supporting this observation dupalová et al 2012 reported that δ13c of endogenous co2 from deep granites via channel like faults into geothermal aquifers was about 3 in addition sracek et al 2015 reported that dic in groundwater sourced from endogenous co2 had δ13cdic values from 6 8 to 4 7 the δ13cdic in geothermal groundwater generally became higher with elevated inorganic carbon concentrations input by endogenous co2 from deep granites dupalová et al 2012 dic in gqa was from organic matter degradation and dissolution of carbonate minerals a negative correlation was observed between δ13cdic and dic r 0 82 p 0 01 fig 7a and lower δ13cdic δ13cdoc values were in accordance with the lower δ13cdic values in gqa r 0 98 p 0 01 fig 7b lower δ13cdic δ13cdoc values reflect more contribution of organic matter to dic due to the lower δ13c values in organic matter zhou et al 2018 farquhar et al 2007 those data implied that dic in gqa was likely associated with microbial degradation of organic matter farid et al 2015 porowska 2015 li et al 2019 farquhar et al 2007 since δ13cdic values become lighter with more organic matter degrading into dic zhou et al 2018 since a large amount of carbonate minerals fig 3b and 4f and sic fig 4c were found in quaternary aquifer sediments carbonate dissolution was also an important source of inorganic carbon in gqa with sicalcite and sidolomite ranging from 0 19 to 0 84 sd 0 21 and 0 93 to 1 85 sd 0 50 respectively 4 1 2 origin of ca2 in groundwater the presence of ca2 increases the surface positive charge of adsorption sites and promotes as adsorption in high ca groundwaters and therefore the high as groundwater was generally characterized with low ca2 concentrations while low as groundwater was characterized with high ca2 concentrations vinson et al 2011 on the other hand groundwater ca2 is critical for the calculation of the additional na released from silicate weathering na na cl so4 2 ca2 2 in molar concentration which is discussed in the section of 4 1 3 calcium originated from carbonate minerals and gypsum in gqa and mainly from gypsum instead of carbonate minerals in gpa more calcium carbonate minerals were present in quaternary aquifer than middle pliocene aquifers which provide the sources of groundwater ca2 in gqa carbonate minerals such as calcite was found in quaternary aquifer sediments and rarely occurred in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b in addition both carbonate bound ca from 10 7 to 27 2 mg g and sic from 7 6 to 13 mg g in quaternary aquifer sediments were much higher than carbonate bound ca from 0 01 to 1 89 mg g p 0 01 and sic from 0 025 to 0 9 mg g p 0 01 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4c 4f respectively furthermore a positive correlation between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in gqa except for gqa 3 and gqa 4 r 0 94 p 0 01 fig 8 a indicates that ca2 originated from dissolution of carbonate minerals in quaternary aquifers which is in line with the observation by appelo and postma 2004 and yuan et al 2017a gypsum would be the source of groundwater ca2 in both gqa and gpa there were positive correlations between ca2 so4 2 and sigypsum in both gpa r 0 73 p 0 01 and gqa r 0 83 p 0 01 fig 8b proving gypsum dissolution in both gqa and gpa this is consistent with farid et al 2015 and xiao et al 2015 the presence of gypsum in quaternary and middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b and undersaturation of gypsum si gypsum 0 in gqa fig 8b also support the potential dissolution of gypsum although the saturation index of gypsum fig s1d and concentration of ca2 fig s1b decreased along the groundwater flow path section i ii fig 1c concentration of so4 2 increased fig s1a which was due to the occurrence of gypsum dissolution in addition the reported δ34sso42 10 5 to 20 0 lang 2016 in groundwater from the studied middle pliocene aquifers also support the dissolution of gypsum which fell into the range of δ34s in gypsum 10 0 to 20 0 gu et al 2011 the significant difference p 0 05 in ca2 concentrations between gqa and gpa greatly depended on total ca contents ca containing minerals and ca mobility in aquifer sediments total ca contents in quaternary aquifer sediments were more than 3 times higher than those in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4b in addition contents of water soluble ca2 in quaternary aquifer sediments were more than 90 times higher than those in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4e indicating that ca in middle pliocene aquifer sediments was more immobilized relative to quaternary aquifer sediments negligible contents of carbonate bound ca fig 4f and lower contents of exchangeable ca fig s7 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments compared with quaternary aquifer sediments may also contribute to lower ca2 concentrations in gpa in relative to gqa 4 1 3 origin of na in groundwater relatively higher concentrations of na in gpa mainly resulted from na silicates weathering although high concentrations of na may be sourced from weathering of silicates with the presence of endogenic co2 toran and saunders 1999 sracek and hirata 2002 dupalová et al 2012 sracek et al 2019 halite dissolution and cation exchange high contents of na silicate minerals e g albite in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b and s4d and undersaturation of all albites in gpa with an average si of 5 9 support that albite had the potential to weather in middle pliocene aquifers since both ca2 and so4 2 in gpa were mostly from dissolution of gypsum as discussed in the section 4 1 2 fig 8b table 1 the depleted ca2 relative to so4 2 was the result of cation exchange between ca2 and na therefore the exchanged na is believed to be the depleted ca2 nkotagu 1996 which was calculated by subtracting ca2 from so4 2 based on mass balance a large amount of na in gpa up to 68 table 1 cannot be accounted by na from dissolution of halite being equal to cl concentration and the exchanged na which was presumably supplied by na silicate weathering therefore net na in gpa subtracting na from dissolution of halite and the exchanged na from total na is assigned by na as a proxy of na silicate weathering na na cl so4 2 ca2 2 in molar concentration this can be further proved by the positive correlation between water soluble hco3 and na referring to na k cl so4 2 ca2 2 in water soluble extractions in middle pliocene aquifer sediments r 0 99 p 0 01 fig 5b weathering of silicates in the middle pliocene aquifer produced kaolinite thermodynamic stability relationship between the collected groundwater samples and the silicates viz feldspar muscovite and the clay minerals like kaolinite smectite gibbsite etc is represented by stability diagrams proposed by tardy 1971 the stability diagrams of na silicates and k silicates fig s9 show that groundwater from the middle pliocene aquifer was in equilibrium with kaolinite this observation confirmed the incongruent dissolution of silicates to kaolinite xrd results showing that kaolinite existed in the middle pliocene aquifers also supported this observation fig 3b with na silicate weathering na and hco3 have been released in the molar ratio of 1 1 appelo and postma 2004 which is described by the reaction eq 1 1 2 n a als i 3 o 8 a l b i t e 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 k a o l i n i t e 2 n a 2 h c o 3 4 s i o 2 plot of na vs hco3 in gpa was along the line of hco3 na 1 1 r 0 94 p 0 01 fig 8c also indicating that na silicate weathering was the major source of na in gpa in addition water soluble hco3 and na in middle pliocene aquifer sediments were distributed around the line of hco3 na 1 1 fig 5b which also evidenced that weathering of na silicates especially albite contributed to dissolved na in gpa the significant difference between na values in gpa from 0 67 to 5 95 mmol l sd 1 69 mmol l and na values in gqa from 0 00 to 0 54 mmol l sd 0 13 mmol l p 0 01 was attributed to warmer temperature discussed in section 4 2 1 and long residence time of gpa the gpa with significantly lower δ18o 13 3 to 11 9 and δd 89 4 to 79 1 isotope values relative to gqa δ18o 9 97 to 8 78 δd 68 9 to 58 7 p 0 01 fig s3 was recharged by precipitation from the mountain areas of higher altitudes pang et al 2017 and had longer travel time ali et al 2019 which provides the basic condition for weathering of silicate minerals armengol et al 2020 in addition gqa had 3h concentrations from 10 8 tu to 27 5 tu but gpa had 3h concentrations below detection limit 1 tu wang et al 2018 implying the longer residence time of gpa visser et al 2016 4 2 genesis and enrichment of as in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer 4 2 1 silicate weathering silicate weathering greatly contributed to as enrichment in gpa which was evidenced by a good positive correlation between as and na r 0 76 p 0 01 fig 9 high as concentration in gpa may be directly released from as containing silicate minerals arsenic had good positive correlations with fe and mn in silicate minerals s6 r 0 72 p 0 01 and r 0 74 p 0 01 respectively fig 6 figs s8a and s8b sequential extraction showed that as was mainly bound to unweathered silicate with the proportions to total as between 14 0 and 65 7 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 6 microscopic images and sem eds showed that silicate minerals in middle pliocene aquifer sediments were weathered figs s4c and s4d the weathering of the silicates would release the bound as into groundwater silicates which were found in middle pliocene aquifer sediments by xrd fig 3b and sem eds fig s4d were considered as a possible as source in gpa arsenic released by weathering of silicates was also reported in other areas alam et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2009 drüppel et al 2020 the weathering of silicate minerals was also indirectly responsible for elevated as concentration in gpa the weathering of silicate minerals contributed to the elevated hco3 and the increase in ph in groundwater both of which promote as enrichment in gpa by means of desorption from fe mn oxide and oxyhydroxides since they were the major host of sediment as fig 6 figs s5e and s5f this is also supported by the fact that gpa had higher ph from 7 9 to 9 0 sd 0 27 than gqa from 6 9 and 8 6 sd 0 33 p 0 01 and middle pliocene aquifer sediments had higher ph fig s6a at high ph the surface sites of solid phase such as fe mn oxides and oxyhydroxides clay minerals are converted from positive charge into negative charge which promotes as releasing from mineral surface knappett et al 2020 piqué et al 2010 moreover the ph dependent as release has already been evidenced in arid semiarid inland basins guo et al 2014b guo et al 2003 podgorski et al 2017 in addition co3 2 in gpa transformed from hco3 in high ph conditions appelo and postma 2004 was positively correlated with as r 0 76 p 0 01 fig s10a since co3 2 reduced the sorption capacity of as on aquifer sediments appelo et al 2002 high concentration of hco3 in gpa with an average of 177 mg l and a positive correlation between as and hco3 r 0 62 p 0 01 fig s10b indicate that hco3 played an important role in as mobility in gpa hco3 is conducive to as enrichment in groundwater via competitive adsorption gao et al 2020b and or inhibiting the formation of ternary goethite as iii fe ii complex stolze et al 2019 arsenic desorption triggered by elevated hco3 concentration has also been reported in the hetao basin guo et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the yinchuan basin guo et al 2014a upper jhelum basin jeelani et al 2020 ganges delta charlet et al 2007 and geothermal area piqué et al 2010 in addition although a positive correlation between as and dissolved silica in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer was not observed the presence of dissolved silica from the weathering of silicates may promote as enrichment since dissolved silica inhibits as adsorption cho et al 2019 luxton et al 2008 and enhances as desorption especially at ph 8 möller and sylvester 2008 4 2 2 organic matter degradation doc degradation in gpa may play limited effect on as enrichment although microbial degradation of doc in groundwater is believed to trigger as enrichment gao et al 2021 guo et al 2014c 2019 postma et al 2012 wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 low doc concentrations in gpa from 0 53 to 2 36 mg l sd 0 50 mg l table s1 and low soc in middle pliocene aquifer sediments with an average of 0 59 mg g may make limited contribution to reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides and oxyhydroxides for as enrichment qiao et al 2021 which is consistent with the observation by bandara et al 2018 this is also evidenced by very low concentrations of dissolved fe and mn in gpa in addition sedimentary organic matter had limited capacity of driving as release into gpa in middle pliocene aquifers arsenic mobilization from fe oxyhydroxides into groundwater was strongly regulated by c n ratio of sedimentary organic matter solaiman et al 2009 since organic matter with lower c n ratio generally had higher electron accepting capacity the lower c n ratio would result in the release of more as kulkarni et al 2018 in this study c n ratios in middle pliocene aquifer sediments with an average of 2 66 was slightly higher than those in quaternary aquifer sediments with an average of 2 39 fig s5d illustrating that sedimentary organic matter had limited effect on driving as release into gpa similar observations were also reported by solaiman et al 2009 and al sid cheikh et al 2015 4 2 3 high temperature driving the increasing temperature promoted the as release into gpa the as enrichment mainly occurred in gpa with groundwater temperature ranging from 15 0 to 24 8 a positive correlation between as and groundwater temperature r 0 51 p 0 01 fig 10 a indicates that higher temperature was conducive to as release since protonation reactions of metal oxides are exothermic positive surface charge of fe oxyhydroxides and their electrostatic affinity for oxyanions decrease with the increase in temperature machesky 1990 simmler et al 2017 bonte et al 2014 martin et al 2009 therefore high temperature is conducive to as desorption from sediments simmler et al 2017 javed and siddique 2016 in addition the increasing temperature may accelerate the aging process and decrease sorption capacity of fe oxyhydroxides dixit and hering 2003 van breukelen and bonte 2016 craig et al 2021 evidenced that increased concentrations of dissolved as are attributed to the thermal desorption from fe oxides at elevated temperatures dissolution of as containing fe oxyhydroxides is an endothermic process majzlan 2011 and thus high temperature enhances dissolution of fe oxide minerals and leads to as release riedel 2019 rouwane et al 2016 mansfeldt and overesch 2013 the positive correlation between temperature and as mobility is also proved by incubation experiments joubert et al 2007 weber et al 2009 and column experiments lüders et al 2020 furthermore high temperature is beneficial for weathering of silicate minerals which promotes as enrichment in gpa a positive correlation between groundwater temperature and na in groundwater r 0 67 p 0 01 fig 10b illustrates that weathering of silicate minerals was enhanced at high temperature this may be due to the higher solubility of silicate minerals at the elevated temperature craig et al 2021 5 conclusions higher as and na concentrations but lower ca2 concentrations were observed in gpa than those in gqa contents of total ca carbonate bound ca water soluble ca and sic were high in quaternary aquifer sediments and low in middle pliocene aquifer sediments which well explains higher concentration of dissolved ca2 in gqa than in gpa dissolved inorganic carbon was positively correlated with δ13cdic 7 94 to 5 39 in gpa indicating that dic was mainly from endogenic co2 lower δ13cdic δ13cdoc values were in accordance with the lower δ13cdic values in gqa suggesting that dic was mainly sourced from organic matter degradation calcium ions in gqa were mainly from carbonate dissolution while in gpa mainly from gypsum dissolution based on mass balance calculation na in gpa primarily originated from weathering of silicates i e na up to 68 arsenic in the middle pliocene aquifer sediments was mainly bound to unweathered silicates up to 65 6 and concentrations of as were positively correlated with na values in gpa both of which indicated the primary contribution of silicate weathering to as enrichment the weathering of silicate minerals directly released the bound as into gpa and indirectly enhanced as mobility by elevating ph hco3 and co3 2 to promote as desorption from aquifer sediments the positive correlations between as and groundwater temperature and between na and groundwater temperature suggested that the elevated groundwater temperature was conductive to both weathering of silicates and as mobilization however doc degradation had limited effects on as enrichment in gpa this study emphasizes the importance of abiotic geochemical processes including weathering of silicates and as desorption in genesis of high as groundwater in deep pliocene aquifers credit authorship

3697,high arsenic as groundwater in reduced shallow holocene and pleistocene aquifers has been intensively investigated but the occurrence and the genesis mechanisms of high as groundwater in deep pliocene aquifers affected by geothermal activity still remain unclear to address these issues geochemical characteristics of groundwater and aquifer sediments in both middle pliocene aquifers and quaternary aquifers of the guide basin were investigated to clarify groundwater sediments interaction and the causes of as enrichment in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer higher as and na concentrations were observed in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer gpa than those in groundwater from quaternary aquifer gqa while gpa had lower ca2 concentrations than gqa results showed that middle pliocene aquifer sediments had low contents of carbonate minerals and water soluble ca bearing minerals relative to quaternary aquifer sediments which explain higher concentration of ca2 in gqa than in gpa na from weathering of silicates i e na being calculated based on mass balance accounted for high proportion of dissolved na up to 68 in gpa weathering of silicates was related to as accumulation in gpa which was proved by a positive correlation between as and na in gpa and high proportion of as bound to unweathered silicates up to 65 7 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments the weathering of silicate minerals directly released as bound to silicates into gpa and indirectly led to as desorption from solid surfaces by increasing ph hco3 and co3 2 both na and as in groundwater increased with the increasing groundwater temperature showing that high temperature was conducive to weathering of silicates and as enrichment this paper establishes a bridge between high groundwater temperature and high as concentration with weathering of silicates in aquifers keywords silicates arsenic desorption temperature pliocene aquifers 1 introduction naturally high as concentration 10 μg l who guidelines for drinking water in groundwater is a world wide problem podgorski and berg 2020 guo et al 2017 rahman et al 2021 guo et al 2014b it has been widely accepted that reductive dissolution of ferric oxyhydroxides is the main process for as release into groundwater in reducing aquifers postma et al 2012 guo et al 2013 while desorption induced by high ph knappett et al 2020 rango et al 2013 hco3 armengol et al 2020 jeelani et al 2020 and co3 2 appelo et al 2002 can promote as enrichment in both reducing and oxidizing aquifers boonkaewwan et al 2021 mueller and hug 2018 postma et al 2017 weathering of silicates was reported as the source of dissolved as in groundwater alam et al 2014 verma et al 2016 desbarats et al 2017 in addition geothermal waters can be an important source of as villalba et al 2020 gao et al 2020a hamidian et al 2019 and high groundwater temperature improves as mobility arnórsson 2003 via desorption simmler et al 2017 van breukelen and bonte 2016 dixit and hering 2003 dissolution of as containing minerals riedel 2019 knappett et al 2020 sracek et al 2019 silicate minerals were reported as the main source of shallow groundwater as in peninsula area alam et al 2014 delta plain seddique et al 2008 itai et al 2008 and inland basin verma et al 2016 the release of as from weathering of silicate minerals was frequently observed in shallow aquifers desbarats et al 2017 biswas et al 2014 in addition to direct release of as during silicate weathering weathering of silicate minerals also promotes as enrichment by raising ph and hco3 concentration in groundwater rango et al 2013 knappett et al 2020 halim et al 2010 ali et al 2019 furthermore increasing temperature is conducive to the silicate weathering gruber et al 2016 and as releasing into groundwater in a volcanic aquifer morales arredondo et al 2018 this has also been proved by column experiments bonte et al 2013 craig et al 2021 and incubation experiments joubert et al 2007 weber et al 2009 however it is still unknown how the weathering of silicates contributes to as enrichment in geothermal affected groundwater in deep pliocene sand aquifers over the past several decades many studies have used a variety of geochemical indicators to assess groundwater sediment interaction and as behavior in groundwater systems arakel et al 1990 elango and kannan 2007 verma et al 2016 sø et al 2018 sheibani et al 2020 inorganic carbon isotopes godfrey et al 2021 in groundwater are generally used to identify hydrochemical processes relatively high δ13cdic in groundwater with high na and hco3 is attributed to weathering of silicates driven by endogenic co2 to raise as concentration in groundwater sracek et al 2019 the δ13c values of endogenous co2 from magma are normally from 7 to 4 minissale 2004 and the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater generally become higher with the higher dic input by endogenous co2 from deep granites dupalová et al 2012 however lower δ13cdic 13 5 to 5 6 in higher as groundwater of the hetao basin resulted from degradation of dissolved organic matter zhou et al 2018 which was conductive to as release by promoting reductive dissolution of iron hydr oxide minerals both intrusion of endogenous co2 and degradation of dissolved organic matter would contribute to dic in geothermal affected deep groundwater however it remains unclear about the source of dissolved inorganic carbon and its contribution to high as groundwater in deep pliocene aquifer the guide basin is a typical semi arid basin in the northwest of china song et al 2008 where high as groundwater is mainly hosted in geothermal affected middle pliocene aquifers of guide group in cenozoic strata at the depths more than 100 m below land surface bls wang et al 2018 temperature is higher in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer in relative to groundwater from quaternary aquifer high as groundwater occurs in middle pliocene aquifers which is different from high as groundwater in holocene aquifers sø et al 2018 glodowska et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and in late pleistocene aquifers guo et al 2016 guo et al 2014b although previous studies showed that high as groundwater in the middle pliocene aquifer was related to as desorption under high ph and high co3 2 concentrations liao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the roles of silicate weathering in as enrichment and the cause of high ph and high hco3 and co3 2 have not been explained thoroughly which would constrain our understanding of as enrichment mechanisms in the basin therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 characterize geochemical properties of aquifer sediments in both middle pliocene aquifers and quaternary aquifers 2 delineate the sources of inorganic carbon ca2 and na in groundwaters from the middle pliocene aquifers gpa and the quaternary aquifers gqa and 3 evaluate the roles of silicate weathering and groundwater temperature in as enrichment in gpa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the guide basin is located to the southwest of xining city covering an area of nearly 1000 km2 it is surrounded by mountains with an altitude of 3500 4500 m the basin has an altitude of 2400 3000 m with relative elevation difference of 300 400 m the yellow river is the largest river across the study area which flows through the whole area from west to east the tributaries flow from north to south into the yellow river forming a feather like water system with the yellow river as the main stream fig 1 a the study area is located in the northeast margin of the qinghai tibet plateau and has a semi arid continental climate the annual average temperature precipitation and evaporation are 7 2 252 mm and 2000 mm respectively liao et al 2013 precipitation mainly concentrates in june to september accounting for more than 72 of annual precipitation xu et al 1976 the quaternary strata are divided into lower pleistocene alluvial deposits middle pleistocene glacial deposits upper pleistocene alluvial deposit and holocene alluvial diluvial sediments as shown in fig 1a the quaternary strata are composed of well rounded and well sorted gravel and sand with a thickness of around 23 to 52 m xu et al 1976 the pliocene strata are widely distributed in low mountains and intermountain basins of the study area being composed of red clastic argillaceous rock formation of fluvial and lacustrine facies fig 1a the pliocene strata have been divided into the early pliocene n 2 1 the middle pliocene n 2 2 and the late pliocene n 2 3 wang et al 2018 the late pliocene n 2 3 being composed of mudstone with thick sand or conglomeratic sand lenses only occurs to the north of the yellow river due to the reverse fault in the east west direction along the yellow river fig 1b and 1c whose bottom is at the depth around 200 m bls xu et al 1976 the middle pliocene n 2 2 being composed of mudstone sand and pebbly sand has a thickness of around 260 m with the bottom confining layer at depths around 460 bls to the north of the yellow river and around 310 m bls to the south of the yellow river fig 1a the groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer hosts high as concentrations the middle pliocene n 2 2 is believed as the main aquifer in the basin the spatial distributions of the middle pliocene aquifers are very unstable with thickness from 0 20 m to 5 21 m fig 1c the early pliocene n 2 1 consisting of shale and lenticular sand is generally believed to be an aquitard underlying the middle pliocene n 2 2 xu et al 1976 the heat energy of the guide basin is mainly derived from the residual heat of mesozoic indosinian granite magma the thick mesozoic and cenozoic sediments provide perfect conditions for the formation and storage of the geothermal groundwater liao et al 2013 the middle pliocene aquifers in the basin are supplied by the deep heat source through the concealed faults in the basement via heat conduction and convection liao et al 2013 the middle pliocene aquifers have temperature gradient from 6 7 to 9 7 100 m as twice as empirical geothermal gradient of 3 3 c 100 m shi et al 2010 the wide distribution of quaternary gravel cobble layer in the basin provides good conditions for recharge of precipitation and surface water from surrounding mountains and riverbed of the tributary of the yellow river into groundwater in quaternary aquifer the middle pliocene aquifers are mainly recharged by surrounding mountains and overlying quaternary aquifers the yellow river is the final discharge of surface water and groundwater in the basin xu et al 1976 the flow directions of groundwater in the middle pliocene aquifers to the south and the north of the yellow river are approximately perpendicular to the yellow river fig 1b to the south of the yellow river the groundwater levels and the hydraulic gradients decline from southeast to northwest as shown in the hydrogeological profile section i ii fig 1c the zhacang hot spring located in the southeast of the study area fig 1a is controlled by structural faults and belongs to fracture hot spring water which is discharged at the junction of compressive and tensile faults in the granite lang et al 2016a there are many new faults and some resurrected old faults in the geothermal field and its surrounding areas which also provide potential pathways for recharge of groundwater into the middle pliocene aquifers lang et al 2016b 2 2 groundwater and sediment sampling 2 2 1 water sampling seventy one water

exception of artesian water groundwaters were sampled after pumping for more than 20 min until groundwater ph electrical conductivity ec oxidation reduction potential orp and temperature were stable in order to ensure that the collected groundwater represented water from the aquifers rather than the boreholes all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters sampling vessels were acid washed and deionized water rinsed thoroughly in the laboratory prior to the field sampling samples for analyzing major cations and trace elements were put into 50 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and acidified to ph 2 by using 6 mol l purified hno3 samples for major anion analysis were collected without acidification samples for arsenic as species were put into 2 ml amber glass

and along the north bank of the yellow river fig s2b arsenic concentrations gradually increased along the groundwater flow path in the middle pliocene aquifer section i ii fig 1c arsenic in gqa was dominated by as v species accounting for nearly 100 of total as which is consistent with positive orp values from 70 6 to 176 mv sd 27 2 mv however as iii was the predominant as species in gpa arsenite concentrations in gpa ranged from 9 22 to 353 μg l sd 106 μg l which generally accounted for more than 80 of total as with the exception of gpa 1 with the proportion of 38 9 the high proportion of as iii species was closely related to negative orp values from 226 to 40 5 mv sd 53 4 mv in gpa hsw had lower as concentration 28 1 μg l than gpa although hsw had higher as concentration

located above the lmwl hsw sample was below the lmwl showing a signal of 18o shift due to exchanges of oxygen isotopes of geothermal groundwaters with oxygen bearing minerals e g silicates sracek et al 2019 qin et al 2005 pang et al 2017 gpa with high as concentrations were generally enriched in 13cdic relative to gqa δ13cdic in gpa ranging from 7 94 to 5 39 sd 0 72 were significantly higher than that those in gqa from 14 0 to 6 51 sd 1 76 p 0 01 table s1 enrichment in 13cdic in high as groundwater was also found at antsirabe central highlands of madagascar where high as groundwater samples had δ13cdic from 0 70 to 0 45 sracek et al 2019 the δ13cdic in sw and hsw were similar to δ13cdic values in gpa table s1 δ13cdoc in water samples were from 17 3 to 13 5 sd 0 66 table s1 the values of δ13cdoc in samples of gpa gqa sw rain and river had a small variation with the standard deviation values around 0 66 3 4 geochemical characteristics of sediments according to the geological logging sediments in the hej borehole were divided into quaternary sediments from 0 to 53 5 m bls corresponding to quaternary aquifers late pliocene sediments from 53 5 to 169 m bls and middle pliocene sediments from 169 to 500 m bls corresponding to middle pliocene aquifers fig 3 a the quaternary sediments were characterized by gravel layer mud bearing gravel layer and sand layer the late pliocene sediments by thick clay or mudstone interlaid by sands and the middle pliocene sediments by pebbly sand and sand interlaid with clay or mudstone fig 3a the clay and mudstone layer in the middle pliocene is an aquitard overlying the aquifer sands 3 4 1 mineral compositions fig 3b showed xrd results of quaternary sediments late pliocene sediments and middle pliocene sediments at different depths of hej albite and quartz were observed as the main minerals more than 80 and kaolinite and gypsum were observed as the minor minerals 10 in both quaternary aquifer sediments and middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b results of optical microscope and sem eds were in line with these observations figs s4a s4d carbonate minerals such as calcite were only observed in quaternary aquifer sediments details on mineral compositions are shown in supporting information 3 4 2 contents of total elements total as contents in sediments ranged from 3 1 to 63 7 mg kg sd 10 5 mg kg fig s5a in all sediments total as contents in middle pliocene aquifer sediments were more than 4 times lower than in quaternary aquifer sediments and slightly lower than in late pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4 a bulk fe and mn contents in all sediments varied from 7 9 to 53 9 g kg sd 11 6 g kg and from 0 15 to 1 13 g kg sd 0 27 g kg respectively fig s5b positive correlations between as and fe and between as and mn were observed r 0 69 and p 0 01 r 0 55 and p 0 01 respectively figs s5e and s5f total ca contents varied from 5 4 to 137 g kg sd 40 4 g kg fig s5c in all sediments total ca content in aquifer sediments had a decreasing trend from quaternary aquifer sediments 41 5 to 73 0 g kg sd 11 0 g kg to middle pliocene aquifer sediments 5 36 to 36 2 g kg sd 11 0 g kg fig 4b this is consistent with higher contents of total ca in younger sediments in the bank of the red river in the hanoi and lower in older sediments with the extensive weathering van geen et al 2013 sic contents in middle pliocene aquifer sediments ranged from 0 025 to 0 9 mg g sd 0 31 mg g which were around one tenth of quaternary aquifer sediments from 7 6 to 13 mg g sd 1 75 mg g fig 4c soc contents in middle pliocene aquifer sediments ranged from 0 40 to 1 00 mg g sd 0 19 mg g which is lower than that of high as aquifer sediments in the hetao basin zhang et al 2020 c n ratios in aquifer sediments varied from 1 31 to 5 78 sd 0 87 and slight differences in c n ratios were observed among quaternary aquifer sediments from 1 74 to 3 24 sd 0 48 late pliocene aquifer sediments from 1 78 to 3 96 sd 0 78 and middle pliocene aquifer sediments from 1 31 to 5 78 sd 1 10 fig s5d p 0 05 details on contents of total elements are shown in supporting information 3 4 3 soluble components in solids water extract solution had ec ranged from 0 16 to 4 11 ms cm sd 0 98 ms cm in all sediments fig s6a ph in water extract solution ranged from 7 7 to 10 3 sd 0 58 which increased from quaternary sediments 7 7 to 9 2 sd 0 56 to middle pliocene sediments 8 5 to 10 0 sd 0 37 fig s6a such alkaline ph values are characteristic for aquifer sediments in arid and semi arid regions which were observed in aquifer sediments in the hetao basin wang et al 2019 water soluble as contents were between 8 84 and 398 μg kg sd 93 6 μg kg fig s6b in all sediments contents of water soluble as in middle pliocene aquifer sediments n 15 were significantly higher than in quaternary aquifer sediments n 7 p 0 01 fig 4d though contents of total as in middle pliocene aquifer sediments n 15 were significantly lower than in quaternary aquifer sediments n 7 p 0 01 fig 4a noticeably water soluble as of the middle pliocene aquifer sediments had a positive correlation with ph in water extract solution r 0 78 p 0 01 fig 5 a water soluble na and ca2 contents ranged from 0 13 to 3 56 g kg sd 0 86 g kg and from 0 005 to 0 96 g kg sd 0 18 g kg respectively in all sediments fig s6c the high contents of water soluble na and ca2 mostly occurred in quaternary sediments fig s6c low contents of water soluble ca2 were observed in middle pliocene aquifer sediments which were more than 90 folds lower than those of quaternary aquifer sediments fig 4e details on soluble components in solids are shown in supporting information 3 4 4 carbonate bound ca in sediments sequential extraction showed that carbonate bound ca ranged from 0 01 to 27 2 mg g sd 8 26 mg g and exchangeable ca varied from 1 05 to 9 92 mg g sd 2 85 mg g fig s7 in all sediments both exchangeable and carbonate bound ca contents decreased along the depth exchangeable ca contents were lower than carbonate bound ca in quaternary sediments but higher than carbonate bound ca in middle pliocene sediments fig s7 middle pliocene aquifer sediments had the lowest contents of carbonate bound ca from 0 01 to 1 89 mg g sd 0 50 mg g in comparison with late pliocene aquifer sediments from 4 99 to 9 97 mg g sd 1 91 mg kg and quaternary aquifer sediments between 10 7 and 27 2 mg g sd 0 50 mg g fig 4f p 0 01 which was consistent with sic contents fig 4c 3 4 5 arsenic forms in sediments arsenic mainly occurred in unweathered silicate bound form s6 crystalline fe oxide bound form s5 or strongly adsorbed form s2 the proportion of s6 to total as varied from 14 0 to 65 7 sd 14 3 s5 proportion from 25 6 to 68 8 sd 9 64 and s2 proportion from 0 22 to 45 7 sd 12 0 fig 6 which is in line with aquifer sediments from other areas alam et al 2014 seddique et al 2008 desbarats et al 2017 relatively less as was associated with amorphous fe oxide minerals the sum of different as forms showed a slight difference from bulk contents measured by xrf with an average deviation of 22 6 and a good positive correlation was observed between them r 0 96 p 0 01 details on fe and mn forms in sediments are shown in supporting information 4 discussion 4 1 sources of groundwater inorganic carbon ca2 and na 4 1 1 origin of inorganic carbon in groundwater dic of gpa was input by endogenic co2 originating from deep granites relatively high δ13cdic of gpa from 7 94 to 5 39 sd 0 72 table s1 indicate the input of endogenic co2 into the middle pliocene aquifer noseck et al 2009 minissale et al 2002 sracek et al 2015 sracek et al 2019 limited carbonate minerals fig 3b limited carbonate bound ca fig 4f and limited sic contents fig 4c in middle pliocene aquifer sediments suggest the limited contribution of carbonate mineral dissolution to dic in gpa fig 7 a shows that dic was positively correlated with δ13cdic in gpa r 0 64 p 0 01 also supporting this observation dupalová et al 2012 reported that δ13c of endogenous co2 from deep granites via channel like faults into geothermal aquifers was about 3 in addition sracek et al 2015 reported that dic in groundwater sourced from endogenous co2 had δ13cdic values from 6 8 to 4 7 the δ13cdic in geothermal groundwater generally became higher with elevated inorganic carbon concentrations input by endogenous co2 from deep granites dupalová et al 2012 dic in gqa was from organic matter degradation and dissolution of carbonate minerals a negative correlation was observed between δ13cdic and dic r 0 82 p 0 01 fig 7a and lower δ13cdic δ13cdoc values were in accordance with the lower δ13cdic values in gqa r 0 98 p 0 01 fig 7b lower δ13cdic δ13cdoc values reflect more contribution of organic matter to dic due to the lower δ13c values in organic matter zhou et al 2018 farquhar et al 2007 those data implied that dic in gqa was likely associated with microbial degradation of organic matter farid et al 2015 porowska 2015 li et al 2019 farquhar et al 2007 since δ13cdic values become lighter with more organic matter degrading into dic zhou et al 2018 since a large amount of carbonate minerals fig 3b and 4f and sic fig 4c were found in quaternary aquifer sediments carbonate dissolution was also an important source of inorganic carbon in gqa with sicalcite and sidolomite ranging from 0 19 to 0 84 sd 0 21 and 0 93 to 1 85 sd 0 50 respectively 4 1 2 origin of ca2 in groundwater the presence of ca2 increases the surface positive charge of adsorption sites and promotes as adsorption in high ca groundwaters and therefore the high as groundwater was generally characterized with low ca2 concentrations while low as groundwater was characterized with high ca2 concentrations vinson et al 2011 on the other hand groundwater ca2 is critical for the calculation of the additional na released from silicate weathering na na cl so4 2 ca2 2 in molar concentration which is discussed in the section of 4 1 3 calcium originated from carbonate minerals and gypsum in gqa and mainly from gypsum instead of carbonate minerals in gpa more calcium carbonate minerals were present in quaternary aquifer than middle pliocene aquifers which provide the sources of groundwater ca2 in gqa carbonate minerals such as calcite was found in quaternary aquifer sediments and rarely occurred in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b in addition both carbonate bound ca from 10 7 to 27 2 mg g and sic from 7 6 to 13 mg g in quaternary aquifer sediments were much higher than carbonate bound ca from 0 01 to 1 89 mg g p 0 01 and sic from 0 025 to 0 9 mg g p 0 01 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4c 4f respectively furthermore a positive correlation between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in gqa except for gqa 3 and gqa 4 r 0 94 p 0 01 fig 8 a indicates that ca2 originated from dissolution of carbonate minerals in quaternary aquifers which is in line with the observation by appelo and postma 2004 and yuan et al 2017a gypsum would be the source of groundwater ca2 in both gqa and gpa there were positive correlations between ca2 so4 2 and sigypsum in both gpa r 0 73 p 0 01 and gqa r 0 83 p 0 01 fig 8b proving gypsum dissolution in both gqa and gpa this is consistent with farid et al 2015 and xiao et al 2015 the presence of gypsum in quaternary and middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b and undersaturation of gypsum si gypsum 0 in gqa fig 8b also support the potential dissolution of gypsum although the saturation index of gypsum fig s1d and concentration of ca2 fig s1b decreased along the groundwater flow path section i ii fig 1c concentration of so4 2 increased fig s1a which was due to the occurrence of gypsum dissolution in addition the reported δ34sso42 10 5 to 20 0 lang 2016 in groundwater from the studied middle pliocene aquifers also support the dissolution of gypsum which fell into the range of δ34s in gypsum 10 0 to 20 0 gu et al 2011 the significant difference p 0 05 in ca2 concentrations between gqa and gpa greatly depended on total ca contents ca containing minerals and ca mobility in aquifer sediments total ca contents in quaternary aquifer sediments were more than 3 times higher than those in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4b in addition contents of water soluble ca2 in quaternary aquifer sediments were more than 90 times higher than those in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 4e indicating that ca in middle pliocene aquifer sediments was more immobilized relative to quaternary aquifer sediments negligible contents of carbonate bound ca fig 4f and lower contents of exchangeable ca fig s7 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments compared with quaternary aquifer sediments may also contribute to lower ca2 concentrations in gpa in relative to gqa 4 1 3 origin of na in groundwater relatively higher concentrations of na in gpa mainly resulted from na silicates weathering although high concentrations of na may be sourced from weathering of silicates with the presence of endogenic co2 toran and saunders 1999 sracek and hirata 2002 dupalová et al 2012 sracek et al 2019 halite dissolution and cation exchange high contents of na silicate minerals e g albite in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 3b and s4d and undersaturation of all albites in gpa with an average si of 5 9 support that albite had the potential to weather in middle pliocene aquifers since both ca2 and so4 2 in gpa were mostly from dissolution of gypsum as discussed in the section 4 1 2 fig 8b table 1 the depleted ca2 relative to so4 2 was the result of cation exchange between ca2 and na therefore the exchanged na is believed to be the depleted ca2 nkotagu 1996 which was calculated by subtracting ca2 from so4 2 based on mass balance a large amount of na in gpa up to 68 table 1 cannot be accounted by na from dissolution of halite being equal to cl concentration and the exchanged na which was presumably supplied by na silicate weathering therefore net na in gpa subtracting na from dissolution of halite and the exchanged na from total na is assigned by na as a proxy of na silicate weathering na na cl so4 2 ca2 2 in molar concentration this can be further proved by the positive correlation between water soluble hco3 and na referring to na k cl so4 2 ca2 2 in water soluble extractions in middle pliocene aquifer sediments r 0 99 p 0 01 fig 5b weathering of silicates in the middle pliocene aquifer produced kaolinite thermodynamic stability relationship between the collected groundwater samples and the silicates viz feldspar muscovite and the clay minerals like kaolinite smectite gibbsite etc is represented by stability diagrams proposed by tardy 1971 the stability diagrams of na silicates and k silicates fig s9 show that groundwater from the middle pliocene aquifer was in equilibrium with kaolinite this observation confirmed the incongruent dissolution of silicates to kaolinite xrd results showing that kaolinite existed in the middle pliocene aquifers also supported this observation fig 3b with na silicate weathering na and hco3 have been released in the molar ratio of 1 1 appelo and postma 2004 which is described by the reaction eq 1 1 2 n a als i 3 o 8 a l b i t e 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 oh 4 k a o l i n i t e 2 n a 2 h c o 3 4 s i o 2 plot of na vs hco3 in gpa was along the line of hco3 na 1 1 r 0 94 p 0 01 fig 8c also indicating that na silicate weathering was the major source of na in gpa in addition water soluble hco3 and na in middle pliocene aquifer sediments were distributed around the line of hco3 na 1 1 fig 5b which also evidenced that weathering of na silicates especially albite contributed to dissolved na in gpa the significant difference between na values in gpa from 0 67 to 5 95 mmol l sd 1 69 mmol l and na values in gqa from 0 00 to 0 54 mmol l sd 0 13 mmol l p 0 01 was attributed to warmer temperature discussed in section 4 2 1 and long residence time of gpa the gpa with significantly lower δ18o 13 3 to 11 9 and δd 89 4 to 79 1 isotope values relative to gqa δ18o 9 97 to 8 78 δd 68 9 to 58 7 p 0 01 fig s3 was recharged by precipitation from the mountain areas of higher altitudes pang et al 2017 and had longer travel time ali et al 2019 which provides the basic condition for weathering of silicate minerals armengol et al 2020 in addition gqa had 3h concentrations from 10 8 tu to 27 5 tu but gpa had 3h concentrations below detection limit 1 tu wang et al 2018 implying the longer residence time of gpa visser et al 2016 4 2 genesis and enrichment of as in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer 4 2 1 silicate weathering silicate weathering greatly contributed to as enrichment in gpa which was evidenced by a good positive correlation between as and na r 0 76 p 0 01 fig 9 high as concentration in gpa may be directly released from as containing silicate minerals arsenic had good positive correlations with fe and mn in silicate minerals s6 r 0 72 p 0 01 and r 0 74 p 0 01 respectively fig 6 figs s8a and s8b sequential extraction showed that as was mainly bound to unweathered silicate with the proportions to total as between 14 0 and 65 7 in middle pliocene aquifer sediments fig 6 microscopic images and sem eds showed that silicate minerals in middle pliocene aquifer sediments were weathered figs s4c and s4d the weathering of the silicates would release the bound as into groundwater silicates which were found in middle pliocene aquifer sediments by xrd fig 3b and sem eds fig s4d were considered as a possible as source in gpa arsenic released by weathering of silicates was also reported in other areas alam et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2009 drüppel et al 2020 the weathering of silicate minerals was also indirectly responsible for elevated as concentration in gpa the weathering of silicate minerals contributed to the elevated hco3 and the increase in ph in groundwater both of which promote as enrichment in gpa by means of desorption from fe mn oxide and oxyhydroxides since they were the major host of sediment as fig 6 figs s5e and s5f this is also supported by the fact that gpa had higher ph from 7 9 to 9 0 sd 0 27 than gqa from 6 9 and 8 6 sd 0 33 p 0 01 and middle pliocene aquifer sediments had higher ph fig s6a at high ph the surface sites of solid phase such as fe mn oxides and oxyhydroxides clay minerals are converted from positive charge into negative charge which promotes as releasing from mineral surface knappett et al 2020 piqué et al 2010 moreover the ph dependent as release has already been evidenced in arid semiarid inland basins guo et al 2014b guo et al 2003 podgorski et al 2017 in addition co3 2 in gpa transformed from hco3 in high ph conditions appelo and postma 2004 was positively correlated with as r 0 76 p 0 01 fig s10a since co3 2 reduced the sorption capacity of as on aquifer sediments appelo et al 2002 high concentration of hco3 in gpa with an average of 177 mg l and a positive correlation between as and hco3 r 0 62 p 0 01 fig s10b indicate that hco3 played an important role in as mobility in gpa hco3 is conducive to as enrichment in groundwater via competitive adsorption gao et al 2020b and or inhibiting the formation of ternary goethite as iii fe ii complex stolze et al 2019 arsenic desorption triggered by elevated hco3 concentration has also been reported in the hetao basin guo et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 the yinchuan basin guo et al 2014a upper jhelum basin jeelani et al 2020 ganges delta charlet et al 2007 and geothermal area piqué et al 2010 in addition although a positive correlation between as and dissolved silica in groundwater from middle pliocene aquifer was not observed the presence of dissolved silica from the weathering of silicates may promote as enrichment since dissolved silica inhibits as adsorption cho et al 2019 luxton et al 2008 and enhances as desorption especially at ph 8 möller and sylvester 2008 4 2 2 organic matter degradation doc degradation in gpa may play limited effect on as enrichment although microbial degradation of doc in groundwater is believed to trigger as enrichment gao et al 2021 guo et al 2014c 2019 postma et al 2012 wang et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 low doc concentrations in gpa from 0 53 to 2 36 mg l sd 0 50 mg l table s1 and low soc in middle pliocene aquifer sediments with an average of 0 59 mg g may make limited contribution to reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides and oxyhydroxides for as enrichment qiao et al 2021 which is consistent with the observation by bandara et al 2018 this is also evidenced by very low concentrations of dissolved fe and mn in gpa in addition sedimentary organic matter had limited capacity of driving as release into gpa in middle pliocene aquifers arsenic mobilization from fe oxyhydroxides into groundwater was strongly regulated by c n ratio of sedimentary organic matter solaiman et al 2009 since organic matter with lower c n ratio generally had higher electron accepting capacity the lower c n ratio would result in the release of more as kulkarni et al 2018 in this study c n ratios in middle pliocene aquifer sediments with an average of 2 66 was slightly higher than those in quaternary aquifer sediments with an average of 2 39 fig s5d illustrating that sedimentary organic matter had limited effect on driving as release into gpa similar observations were also reported by solaiman et al 2009 and al sid cheikh et al 2015 4 2 3 high temperature driving the increasing temperature promoted the as release into gpa the as enrichment mainly occurred in gpa with groundwater temperature ranging from 15 0 to 24 8 a positive correlation between as and groundwater temperature r 0 51 p 0 01 fig 10 a indicates that higher temperature was conducive to as release since protonation reactions of metal oxides are exothermic positive surface charge of fe oxyhydroxides and their electrostatic affinity for oxyanions decrease with the increase in temperature machesky 1990 simmler et al 2017 bonte et al 2014 martin et al 2009 therefore high temperature is conducive to as desorption from sediments simmler et al 2017 javed and siddique 2016 in addition the increasing temperature may accelerate the aging process and decrease sorption capacity of fe oxyhydroxides dixit and hering 2003 van breukelen and bonte 2016 craig et al 2021 evidenced that increased concentrations of dissolved as are attributed to the thermal desorption from fe oxides at elevated temperatures dissolution of as containing fe oxyhydroxides is an endothermic process majzlan 2011 and thus high temperature enhances dissolution of fe oxide minerals and leads to as release riedel 2019 rouwane et al 2016 mansfeldt and overesch 2013 the positive correlation between temperature and as mobility is also proved by incubation experiments joubert et al 2007 weber et al 2009 and column experiments lüders et al 2020 furthermore high temperature is beneficial for weathering of silicate minerals which promotes as enrichment in gpa a positive correlation between groundwater temperature and na in groundwater r 0 67 p 0 01 fig 10b illustrates that weathering of silicate minerals was enhanced at high temperature this may be due to the higher solubility of silicate minerals at the elevated temperature craig et al 2021 5 conclusions higher as and na concentrations but lower ca2 concentrations were observed in gpa than those in gqa contents of total ca carbonate bound ca water soluble ca and sic were high in quaternary aquifer sediments and low in middle pliocene aquifer sediments which well explains higher concentration of dissolved ca2 in gqa than in gpa dissolved inorganic carbon was positively correlated with δ13cdic 7 94 to 5 39 in gpa indicating that dic was mainly from endogenic co2 lower δ13cdic δ13cdoc values were in accordance with the lower δ13cdic values in gqa suggesting that dic was mainly sourced from organic matter degradation calcium ions in gqa were mainly from carbonate dissolution while in gpa mainly from gypsum dissolution based on mass balance calculation na in gpa primarily originated from weathering of silicates i e na up to 68 arsenic in the middle pliocene aquifer sediments was mainly bound to unweathered silicates up to 65 6 and concentrations of as were positively correlated with na values in gpa both of which indicated the primary contribution of silicate weathering to as enrichment the weathering of silicate minerals directly released the bound as into gpa and indirectly enhanced as mobility by elevating ph hco3 and co3 2 to promote as desorption from aquifer sediments the positive correlations between as and groundwater temperature and between na and groundwater temperature suggested that the elevated groundwater temperature was conductive to both weathering of silicates and as mobilization however doc degradation had limited effects on as enrichment in gpa this study emphasizes the importance of abiotic geochemical processes including weathering of silicates and as desorption in genesis of high as groundwater in deep pliocene aquifers credit authorship

3698,land subsidence is a geological process mainly caused by groundwater overdraft numerical modeling of land subsidence is the main method used for its simulation and prediction the elastic skeletal storage coefficient s ke inelastic skeletal storage coefficient s kv and the related specific values s ske and s skv are fundamental parameters to quantify land subsidence in this paper a novel approach integrating fast independent component analysis fast ica with variable preconsolidation head decomposition method is proposed to disentangle s ske and s skv at various depth and over time from piezometric and extensometer records the proposed method is applied to areas affected by severe land subsidence in the north china plain tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations the elastic and inelastic parameters of the aquifer systems are quantified at different depths it is found that s ske and s skv decrease with depth the finer the sediment grain size is the smaller of the ratio s ske s skv moreover s ke remains almost unchanged over time while s kv decreases as compaction and land subsidence increase keywords land subsidence elastic skeletal specific storage independent component analysis variable preconsolidation head 1 introduction china has become the country with the largest area affected by land subsidence due to groundwater overdraft with an extent of approximately 80 000 km2 guzy and malinowska 2020 a significant part of this area is the north china plain where the largest groundwater depression cone in the country is also located herrera garcía et al 2021 land subsidence causes serious damage to surface and underground infrastructure in this region the repair cost of these damages is generally very high although in most cases the majority of economic property losses cannot be accurately estimated guzy and malinowska 2020 dinar et al 2021 several methods have been developed to simulate and predict land subsidence gambolati and teatini 2015 there are aquifer drainage models based on terzaghi theory poroelasticity models based on biot theory creep models minderhoud et al 2017 empirical and artificial intelligence methods guzy and malinowska 2020 the most widely used method is the aquifer drainage model developed by riley 1969 and based on terzaghi s 1923 principle many of the tools commonly used for the numerical simulation of land subsidence were developed using this approach such as interbed storage package ibs 1 ibs 2 and subsidence and aquifer system compaction package sub in modflow leake and galloway 2007 these models require as input parameters the elastic skeletal storage coefficient s ke and inelastic skeletal storage coefficient s kv or their value per unit soil thickness the so called elastic s ske and inelastic s skv skeletal specific storage elastic deformations i e ruled by s ke are fully recoverable when aquifer pressure returned to pre development values conversely inelastic deformations proportional to s kv are almost completely irrecoverable irrespective of the pressure conditions the conventional methods used to determine the storage parameters involve laboratory experiments or pumping tests however it is difficult to obtain undisturbed soil samples from deep layers for laboratory experiments and pumping tests which last relatively short time periods can generally be used to obtain s ke only consequently the values of these parameters used in modelling applications are frequently based on empirical relationships taken from the literature with the simulation outputs characterized by low reliability and high uncertainty notice that obtaining accurate values of the elastic and inelastic parameters is important to develop reliable land subsidence predictions for different scenarios in addition these are also key parameters in relation to different scenarios of groundwater resources management indeed the groundwater storage capacity of an aquifer and the permanent loss of groundwater storage volume of an over exploited aquifer system due to compaction can be estimated from these parameters more recently the abovementioned parameters have been determined by processing long term deformation or subsidence and hydraulic head records jiang et al 2018 chaussard and farr 2019 the most used method for the separation of the elastic and inelastic components is linear fitting or trigonometric function fitting of these datasets rezaei et al 2020 burbey 2020 rezaei and mousavi 2019 zhuang et al 2017 in addition the principal component analysis pca continuous wavelet transform cwt and multichannel singular spectrum analysis m ssa have been successfully employed to separate elastic and inelastic deformation chaussard et al 2014 miller and shirzaei 2015 jiang et al 2018 ojha et al 2019 rezaei and mousavi 2019 in these studies the deformation decomposition is based on the assumption of a yearly and a seasonal behavior for the elastic and inelastic deformation components respectively however elastic deformation may not be completely seasonal especially in groundwater systems under human influence chaussard and farr 2019 chaussard and farr 2019 used an elastic deformation separating method based on time independent component analysis t ica a kind of ica to overcome this problem ica has the advantage of separating unobserved source signal components from mixed signals without prior conditions it has been widely used in biomedicine speech signal processing image feature extraction and radio communication for example it has been used in heart rate detection yu et al 2018 and facial image feature extraction zhang et al 2014 previous hydrogeological studies were mainly focused to characterize average s ke and s kv values for complex aquifer systems no attempt was carried out to evaluate the variability of s ske and s skv with depth i e for each of the hydrogeological unit composing an heterogenous aquifer system as to the hydraulic head h mathematical methods such as linear fitting trigonometric function fitting and m ssa were used however these approaches have poor interpretability in the context of the physical mechanism causing land subsidence sometimes the δ h signal calculated by these methods is nonphysical with respect to the deformation i e a rising hydraulic head is associated with an inelastic deformation the preconsolidation head h pc has been largely used to decompose hydraulic head data rezaei and mousavi 2019 zhuang et al 2017 miller et al 2017 h pc is the minimum hydraulic head experienced by a certain portion of an aquifer system elastic and inelastic deformations occur when the actual hydraulic head is higher or lower than h pc respectively h pc is usually not concerned by researchers and is set to a fixed value hoffmann et al 2003 however h pc changes with the continuous decline of the hydraulic head in normally consolidated basins riley 1969 in this paper a novel methodology is proposed to calculate elastic and inelastic storage coefficients of a confined aquifer system s ke s kv s ske and s skv by integrating fast ica a kind of ica and a variable h pc to properly decompose the deformation and hydraulic head measurements the proposed method is used to unravel the elastic and inelastic storage parameters in a region of the north china plain severely affected by land subsidence using the records collected at three multi depth extensometer stations associated with different geological settings the relationships between the calculated parameters and the depth lithology and development of land subsidence are explored the percentage δ v ir and absolute δ v ir permanent losses of storage volume are estimated 2 study area and datasets 2 1 description

deformation and hydraulic head together with a detailed description of the lithostratigraphic sedimentological profile fig 2 at tianzhu station the extensometer and hydraulic head monitoring points

independent component analysis fast ica and variable h pc decomposition is developed to calculate s ke s kv s ske and s skv from the available deformation and hydraulic head records 3 1 fast independent component analysis fast ica ica independent component analysis is a signal processing method that expresses random variables as a linear combination of statistically independent variables following a non gaussian probability distribution function hyvärinen and oja 1997 this assumption is based on the central limit theorem maubant et al 2020 the ica algorithm can effectively solve the problem of blind source separation it can separate unobservable components from a mixed signal hyvärinen and oja 1997 compared with the classical ica algorithm fast ica mainly modifies g â and iterative method the modified g â can measure the non gaussian degree of the observed signal more reliably the new iterative method is fixed point iteration which can converge quickly when estimating independent components fast ica has the advantages of a fast convergence speed few calculations good separation effect and high robustness giannakopoulos et al 1999 the essence of fast ica is to assume that multiple groups of source signals over times are statistically independent when both the source signal and the mixing matrix are unknown the process is as follows 1 x t a s t where x t x 1 t x 2 t x m t t is an observed signal matrix composed of m observation signals s t s 1 t s 2 t s n t t is a source signal matrix composed of n independent source signals t is time and a is a matrix of m n dimensions the goal of fast ica is to find the inverse matrix w of matrix a acting on the mixed signal x t to get the signal with the largest non gaussianity to approach the original signal s t the process is as follows 2 y t w x t w a s t s t where y t is the desired output signal which is also approximately equal to the source signal s t fast ica consists of two parts signal preprocessing and independent component extraction the preprocessing includes two parts de averaging and whitening the purpose is to simplify the data processing and extract the correlation of x t the formulas are as follows 3 x i t x i t 1 t max t 1 t max x i t i 1 2 m 4 z t v x t where x i t is the signal after de averaging t max is the maximum of t z t is the whitening signal and v is the whitening matrix v needs to be obtained by finding the characteristic vector of the covariance matrix of x t the equations are the following 5 c 1 m x x t 6 cv v λ 7 v v 1 v 2 v n 8 λ d i a g λ 1 λ 2 λ n where c is the covariance matrix v i are the characteristic vectors and λ is the diagonal matrix composed by the characteristic values λ i negative entropy can be used as a standard to measure the size of non gaussianity the larger the negative entropy is the stronger the non gaussian property is it can be expressed as 9 j b e g b e g c 2 10 g 1 a 1 l o g c o s h a 1 where b and c are gaussian random variables with a null mean value and variance equal to 1 g is a nonlinear function and e is the mean operator a 1 is constant usually set equal to 1 let b w t z then the expression of negative entropy of b is as follows 11 j b e g w t z e g c 2 then fixed point iteration is used to find the matrix w achieving the maximum of the objective function j b 12 w k 1 e z g w t k z e g w t k z w k where g and g is the first and second derivative of g and k the iteration step finally w is normalized 13 w k 1 w k 1 w k 1 where is the norm so far the matrix w is obtained therefore matrix a and y t can be obtained by eq 2 3 2 variable hpc decomposition method the direct use of the total hydraulic head change recorded during a certain time step to estimate s ke and s kv could be inappropriate in fact according to terzaghi s principle hydraulic head dropdown leads to elastic and or inelastic deformation of the soil skeleton depending on the actual values of the effective stress relative to the preconsolidation effective stress to accurately calculate the elastic and inelastic parameters of an aquifer system the hydraulic head change should be decomposed into two parts accounting for the elastic and inelastic deformation respectively the conventional method employed to distinguish elastic from inelastic deformation is through h pc elastic deformation occurs when the hydraulic head is greater than h pc i e the effective stress smaller than the effective preconsolidation stress and inelastic settlement occurs when the hydraulic head is lower than h pc h pc is determined based on the minimum historical head i e maximum effective stress never experience by the various portion of an aquifer system clearly h pc usually changes with the development of land subsidence as the hydraulic head decreases following the ongoing groundwater withdrawals a variable h pc is used in this paper the actual value of h pc is updated as the hydraulic head exceeds the historical minimum hydraulic head the method here implemented is an extension of the traditional approach hoffmann et al 2003 for overconsolidated soil i e a soil that experienced an effective stress larger than the actual value h pc is kept fixed over time as done in the traditional method for normally consolidated soil i e soil which is experiencing the maximum stress h pc value will change following the decrease of hydraulic head 3 3 estimation of elastic and inelastic parameters the heterogeneous distribution of alluvial deposits in the north china plain makes the geological setting highly complex therefore in this paper we use the concept of aquifer system as the research target i e we evaluate the average soil property specifically the elastic and inelastic storage for the lithotype mixture within each extensometer monitoring interval considering that water is incompressible relative to the aquifer system compressibility the storage coefficient s k can be calculated from the relationship between the compression of the aquifer system and the change in the hydraulic head the equation reads 14 s k δ b δ h s s b 0 where b 0 is the thickness of the aquifer system δ b its deformation δ h is the change of hydraulic head and s s is the specific storage s k can be divided into s ke and s kv s ke is calculated considering elastic deformations δ b e and the change of the hydraulic head corresponding to elastic deformation δ h e whereas s kv is calculated using the relationship between the inelastic deformation δ b v and the hydraulic head change acting on the inelastic deformation δ h v riley 1969 sedaghat et al 2020 the equations are as follows 15 s ke δ b e δ h e 16 s kv δ b v δ h v s ske and s skv describe the elastic and inelastic groundwater storage capacity of an aquifer system respectively riley 1969 galloway et al 1998 sedaghat et al 2020 rezaei et al 2020 they are an intrinsic attribute of the geologic unit and can represent the suitability of a soil to deform in response to hydraulic head change the specific storage parameters are defined from s ke and s kv as follows 17 s ske s ke b 0 18 s skv s kv b 0 when the hydraulic head h is higher than h pc the aquifer system undergoes elastic deformation and the value of s s is equal to s ske when h is less than h pc inelastic i e irrecoverable deformation occurs and the value of s s is equal to s skv hoffmann et al 2003 summarizing 19 s s s ske h pc h s skv h pc h 3 4 the proposed procedure a flowchart of the developed approach is presented in fig 3 the first step consists of investigating the stress strain curves at different layer depths to identify the main deformation features elastic or inelastic deformation behaviors are considered clean signals not requiring decomposition deformation data showing elastic inelastic feature is a kind of mixed signal which needs to be decomposed fig 4 second the elastic and inelastic components of deformation and the hydraulic head are separated using fast ica and variable h pc method then s ke s kv s ske and s skv are estimated by computing the separated components based on the correlation coefficient between hydraulic head and elastic deformation signal the linear fitting method is compared with the method in this study then the parameter variability with depth lithology and time is explored the δ v ir and δ v ir due to inelastic compaction are quantified 4 results multiple monitoring intervals with different depths are available at each extensometer station the notation introduced to refer clearly to each of them is as follows tz 117 148 49 represents the layer spanning the depth range from 117 to 148 49 m at tianzhu extensometer station the acronyms pgz and cz refer to pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations respectively based on hydraulic head versus deformation data land subsidence can be characterized by three behaviors elastic elastic inelastic and inelastic the stress strain curves of pgz 31 9 63 1 tz 82 3 102 and pgz 119 64 208 8 shown in fig 4 are exemplificative of these characteristics the stress strain curve of pgz 31 9 63 1 in fig 4 is characterized by a single main slope from the lower left to the upper right under repeated loading and unloading phases the residual deformation is low revealing an almost elastic behavior a number of hysteresis loops and large residual deformation can be recognized in the tz 82 3 102 stress strain curve which indicate the occurrence of elastic inelastic deformation for pgz 119 64 208 8 the residual deformation is large but there is no hysteresis loop indicating that mainly inelastic deformation occurs the elastic and inelastic deformation datasets are considered clean signals and do not require to be decomposed the elastic inelastic deformation is a mixed signal and is decomposed through the fast ica method tianzhu station is used as an exemplificative case the deformation is decomposed into a fluctuation curve y 1 t blue line in fig 5 a and a downward trend curve y 2 t red line in fig 5 a corresponding to elastic and inelastic deformation component respectively the elastic and inelastic deformations time series at different depth layers can be obtained by multiplying the deformation time series of the decomposed independent component y t in equation 2 by the correspondent matrix a in equation 1 the outcomes are provided in fig 5 a and table 1 the hydraulic head is decomposed into a periodic fluctuation curve red line in fig 5 b and a stepped decline curve blue line in fig 5 b corresponding to the elastic and inelastic hydraulic head respectively based on a variable h pc fig 6 shows the correlations between elastic deformation and the hydraulic head acting on elastic deformation and between inelastic deformation and the hydraulic head acting on inelastic deformation the correlation coefficient between the elastic deformation time series and the corresponding hydraulic head is 0 78 for the elastic parameter the time series is segmented according to the wave crests and troughs of the original signal for the inelastic parameter the time series is segmented when hydraulic head drops then the average values of s ke s kv s ske s skv and s ske s skv of the aquifer system at tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations are calculated by using equations 14 19 these parameters change over time and the average values are provided in table 2 s ske s skv reflects the ratio of elastic and inelastic deformation to the change of hydraulic head the deformation type of an aquifer system can be judged according to the stress strain curve in the aquifer system with elastic inelastic deformation s skv is obviously higher than s ske in the study area s ske s skv ranges between 0 05 and 0 40 table 2 consistently with other observations showing that inelastic compressibility is usually 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than elastic compressibility teatini et al 2011 in an aquifer system with a single deformation feature the records are not decomposed for example only inelastic deformation occurs in pgz 119 64 208 8 and only elastic deformation in tz 48 5 64 5 and pgz 31 9 63 1 as shown in table 2 s ske ranges from 2 5 10 6 to 2 9 10 5 m 1 and s skv between 1 1 10 5 and 1 5 10 4 m 1 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the storage values our contribution demonstrates that fast ica integrated with a variable preconsolidation head decomposition method allows to effectively disentangle elastic and inelastic storage values the two quantities differing up to an order of magnitude table 2 the outcomes obtained for the north china plain are comparable with those provided by other studies jiang et al 2018 calculated s ke at cangzhou which is located within the study area fig 1 by using m ssa obtaining a value of 2 10 3 in this paper the sum of s ke of the cz 195 5 252 8 and cz 68 3 195 5 aquifer system at cangzhou station is estimated equal to 2 6 10 3 based on a large amount of collected data and references kuang et al 2020 summarized the average s s of confined aquifers made of loose sediments in the range from 1 10 6 to 3 10 4 m 1 in this paper according with equation 19 s s varies between 2 5 10 6 and 1 5 10 4 m 1 which matches the range provided by kuang et al 2020 linear regression is a common approach to invert land subsidence parameters rezaei et al 2020 burbey 2020 rezaei and mousavi 2019 zhuang et al 2017 however the linear regression method cannot effectively separate elastic and inelastic deformation information we select layer tz 148 49 218 89 as an example to compare the soundness of the parameters estimated with the methodology here presented and the traditional linear procedure fig 7 shows that the deformation curve based on data decomposed by the approach we propose in this paper is evidently better than that obtained by the traditional linear fitting method by using the variable h pc method to decompose the hydraulic head and integrating the fast ica method a large number of small signal fluctuations can be captured while are neglected by the linear fitting method the correlation coefficient between the elastic deformation and the hydraulic head acting on the elastic deformation obtained by the linear fitting method is 0 35 whereas that obtained by our proposed method is 0 78 fig 7 5 2 storage parameters change with depth due to an increasing overburden load soil consolidation grows with depth and generally s ske and s skv reduce this trend is observed at the three extensometer stations investigated in this study table 2 for example at tianzhu station the s ske and s skv values decrease from 2 9 10 5 m 1 and 1 5 10 4 m 1 for the tz 48 5 64 5 layer to 3 5 10 6 m 1 and 2 2 10 5 m 1 at tz 148 49 218 89 an exception characterizes s ske values at tz 117 148 49 and tz 82 3 102 as explained in section 5 3 5 3 relations between storage parameters and lithology soil layer composed of fine particles such as silt and clay readily form honeycomb or flocculent structures when the effective stress increases beyond the upper limit the soil skeleton has experienced i e the preconsolidation stress the soil skeleton rearranges structurally producing relatively large irrecoverable deformation with a permanent loss of groundwater storage volume in the aquifer system sedaghat et al 2020 the ratio s ske s skv is adopted to analyze the relations between lithology and storage the outcomes provided in table 2 show that the finer the sediment grains are the smaller s ske s skv is for example the sediments of tz 82 3 102 layer are mainly composed of silty clay and fine sand with s ske s skv 0 05 this value is about three times smaller than those computed for tz 148 49 218 89 and tz 117 148 49 layers where fine and coarse sand is present this also explain why at tianzhu station the s ske values do not strictly follow a decreasing trend with depth a peculiar case is pgz 31 9 63 1 it is a shallow layer with fine grains silty clay which shows an elastic deformation the possible reason of this stress strain behavior is that the depth range was overconsolidated when the extensometer station was put in operation with h pc smaller than the actual head h concluding s ske and s skv depend on the burial depth and lithology of the soil layers simultaneously it is generally challenging to disentangle their contributions from compaction and pressure change records and the proposed methodology i e fast ica with variable preconsolidation head decomposition method can be successfully used to achieve this aim 5 4 storage variation over time the available dataset properly processed through the proposed procedure allows quantifying how s ke and s kv varied over time for s ke the time series is segmented according to the wave crest and wave trough of the original signal for s kv the time series is segmented when the inelastic hydraulic head drops and s kv is computed only when h h pc the s ke values at tianzhu and cangzhou stations remain almost constant or fluctuate with time respectively fig 8 conversely s kv is characterized by a clear decrease versus time fig 9 i e with the ongoing compaction obviously the nonlinear behavior of s kv is related to the decrease of pore space that reduce the possibility of further inelastic compaction this behavior has been previously observed for other aquifer systems e g in the suzhou wuxi changzhou area china shi et al 2007 and in the northern adriatic coastland italy teatini et al 2006 the time series at pinggezhuang station is too short to be analyzed 5 5 loss of permanent storage volume the change in skeleton compressibility is the main factor influencing the capability of an aquifer system to store water the decrease of groundwater volume stored into aquifer systems that experienced significant compaction is a main topic in several sedimentary basins worldwide e g béjar pizarro et al 2017 smith et al 2017 the total storage loss can be divided into a recoverable elastic deformation part and an irrecoverable inelastic deformation part the percentage of permanent loss of storage volume δ v ir can be estimated using s kv δ h v b 0 and n porosity as follows 15 δ v ir s kv δ h v b 0 n in this equation the numerator represents the loss of pore volume per unit area due to inelastic deformation and the denominator represents the portion of the layer thickness b 0 occupied by the pore volume when inelastic deformation occurs the space originally used for water storage is irreversibly reduces and it cannot be restored by groundwater recharge the loss results in a reduced capacity of the natural underground reservoir with paramount consequences in the management of groundwater resources δ v ir at tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations are 0 027 0 068 0 009 0 033 and 0 043 0 130 respectively table 3 the larger the δ v ir value the greater the irreversible effect of compaction caused by groundwater overexploitation the cumulative δ v ir permanent loss of storage volume of an aquifer portion is obtained by multiplying equation 15 by the area of the region the areas near the three extensometer stations where similar inelastic storage hydraulic head changes and aquifer systems geometry can be assumed are 42 6 km2 43 0 km2 and 88 5 km2 for tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou respectively therefore δ v ir for the three areas are 3 6 106 m3 1 3 106 m3 and 1 9 107 m3 respectively 6 conclusions separating recoverable elastic from permanent inelastic deformation of aquifer systems is one of the main research topics in aquifer geomechanics with important consequences in terms of developing sustainable pumping practices in this paper a novel methodology integrating fast ica and a variable h pc is proposed to unravel elastic and inelastic specific storage in confined aquifer systems this method can effectively separate the elastic and inelastic components of deformation at the level of each hydrogeologic unit composing an aquifer system an outcome that is achieved in this work for the first time the proposed methodology is applied in a region of the north china plain severely affected by land subsidence using records collected at three multi depth extensometer stations the relations between the storage parameters and depth lithology and time are explored based on the determined storage values the permanent loss of storage volume is estimated lithology and depth control the values of s ske and s skv s ske and s skv of different aquifer systems generally decrease with depth at tianzhu station s ske decreased from 2 9 10 5 m 1 to 3 5 10 6 m 1 with the depth increasing from 48 5 to 64 5 m to 148 49 218 89 m as to the inelastic component s skv decreased from 1 5 10 4 m 1 to 2 2 10 5 m 1 with the depth increasing from 82 3 to 102 m to 148 49 218 89 m the finer the lithology the smaller the ratio s ske s skv is at tianzhu station s ske s skv 0 05 for fine sediment layers which is two to three time smaller than the values computed for the layers made of relatively coarse grains in addition s ke is characterized by an almost constant long time value while s kv exhibits a decreasing trend with time i e with the ongoing compaction that irreversibly reduces the soil pore volume the percentage of permanent loss of storage volume at three stations ranges from 0 009 to 0 13 the methodological approach here presented has been applied in this paper on a significant dataset made of multi depth deformation and hydraulic head records at three extensometer stations in engineering field the physical signal is generally mixed one which is difficult to decompose the fast ica can be the effective tool to decompose the blind source information in the future the procedure will be used on insar interferometric synthetic aperture radar products and outcomes of groundwater flow modelling to achieve a better coverage quantification of the storage parameters in the north china plain credit authorship

3698,land subsidence is a geological process mainly caused by groundwater overdraft numerical modeling of land subsidence is the main method used for its simulation and prediction the elastic skeletal storage coefficient s ke inelastic skeletal storage coefficient s kv and the related specific values s ske and s skv are fundamental parameters to quantify land subsidence in this paper a novel approach integrating fast independent component analysis fast ica with variable preconsolidation head decomposition method is proposed to disentangle s ske and s skv at various depth and over time from piezometric and extensometer records the proposed method is applied to areas affected by severe land subsidence in the north china plain tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations the elastic and inelastic parameters of the aquifer systems are quantified at different depths it is found that s ske and s skv decrease with depth the finer the sediment grain size is the smaller of the ratio s ske s skv moreover s ke remains almost unchanged over time while s kv decreases as compaction and land subsidence increase keywords land subsidence elastic skeletal specific storage independent component analysis variable preconsolidation head 1 introduction china has become the country with the largest area affected by land subsidence due to groundwater overdraft with an extent of approximately 80 000 km2 guzy and malinowska 2020 a significant part of this area is the north china plain where the largest groundwater depression cone in the country is also located herrera garcía et al 2021 land subsidence causes serious damage to surface and underground infrastructure in this region the repair cost of these damages is generally very high although in most cases the majority of economic property losses cannot be accurately estimated guzy and malinowska 2020 dinar et al 2021 several methods have been developed to simulate and predict land subsidence gambolati and teatini 2015 there are aquifer drainage models based on terzaghi theory poroelasticity models based on biot theory creep models minderhoud et al 2017 empirical and artificial intelligence methods guzy and malinowska 2020 the most widely used method is the aquifer drainage model developed by riley 1969 and based on terzaghi s 1923 principle many of the tools commonly used for the numerical simulation of land subsidence were developed using this approach such as interbed storage package ibs 1 ibs 2 and subsidence and aquifer system compaction package sub in modflow leake and galloway 2007 these models require as input parameters the elastic skeletal storage coefficient s ke and inelastic skeletal storage coefficient s kv or their value per unit soil thickness the so called elastic s ske and inelastic s skv skeletal specific storage elastic deformations i e ruled by s ke are fully recoverable when aquifer pressure returned to pre development values conversely inelastic deformations proportional to s kv are almost completely irrecoverable irrespective of the pressure conditions the conventional methods used to determine the storage parameters involve laboratory experiments or pumping tests however it is difficult to obtain undisturbed soil samples from deep layers for laboratory experiments and pumping tests which last relatively short time periods can generally be used to obtain s ke only consequently the values of these parameters used in modelling applications are frequently based on empirical relationships taken from the literature with the simulation outputs characterized by low reliability and high uncertainty notice that obtaining accurate values of the elastic and inelastic parameters is important to develop reliable land subsidence predictions for different scenarios in addition these are also key parameters in relation to different scenarios of groundwater resources management indeed the groundwater storage capacity of an aquifer and the permanent loss of groundwater storage volume of an over exploited aquifer system due to compaction can be estimated from these parameters more recently the abovementioned parameters have been determined by processing long term deformation or subsidence and hydraulic head records jiang et al 2018 chaussard and farr 2019 the most used method for the separation of the elastic and inelastic components is linear fitting or trigonometric function fitting of these datasets rezaei et al 2020 burbey 2020 rezaei and mousavi 2019 zhuang et al 2017 in addition the principal component analysis pca continuous wavelet transform cwt and multichannel singular spectrum analysis m ssa have been successfully employed to separate elastic and inelastic deformation chaussard et al 2014 miller and shirzaei 2015 jiang et al 2018 ojha et al 2019 rezaei and mousavi 2019 in these studies the deformation decomposition is based on the assumption of a yearly and a seasonal behavior for the elastic and inelastic deformation components respectively however elastic deformation may not be completely seasonal especially in groundwater systems under human influence chaussard and farr 2019 chaussard and farr 2019 used an elastic deformation separating method based on time independent component analysis t ica a kind of ica to overcome this problem ica has the advantage of separating unobserved source signal components from mixed signals without prior conditions it has been widely used in biomedicine speech signal processing image feature extraction and radio communication for example it has been used in heart rate detection yu et al 2018 and facial image feature extraction zhang et al 2014 previous hydrogeological studies were mainly focused to characterize average s ke and s kv values for complex aquifer systems no attempt was carried out to evaluate the variability of s ske and s skv with depth i e for each of the hydrogeological unit composing an heterogenous aquifer system as to the hydraulic head h mathematical methods such as linear fitting trigonometric function fitting and m ssa were used however these approaches have poor interpretability in the context of the physical mechanism causing land subsidence sometimes the δ h signal calculated by these methods is nonphysical with respect to the deformation i e a rising hydraulic head is associated with an inelastic deformation the preconsolidation head h pc has been largely used to decompose hydraulic head data rezaei and mousavi 2019 zhuang et al 2017 miller et al 2017 h pc is the minimum hydraulic head experienced by a certain portion of an aquifer system elastic and inelastic deformations occur when the actual hydraulic head is higher or lower than h pc respectively h pc is usually not concerned by researchers and is set to a fixed value hoffmann et al 2003 however h pc changes with the continuous decline of the hydraulic head in normally consolidated basins riley 1969 in this paper a novel methodology is proposed to calculate elastic and inelastic storage coefficients of a confined aquifer system s ke s kv s ske and s skv by integrating fast ica a kind of ica and a variable h pc to properly decompose the deformation and hydraulic head measurements the proposed method is used to unravel the elastic and inelastic storage parameters in a region of the north china plain severely affected by land subsidence using the records collected at three multi depth extensometer stations associated with different geological settings the relationships between the calculated parameters and the depth lithology and development of land subsidence are explored the percentage δ v ir and absolute δ v ir permanent losses of storage volume are estimated 2 study area and datasets 2 1 description

deformation and hydraulic head together with a detailed description of the lithostratigraphic sedimentological profile fig 2 at tianzhu station the extensometer and hydraulic head monitoring points

independent component analysis fast ica and variable h pc decomposition is developed to calculate s ke s kv s ske and s skv from the available deformation and hydraulic head records 3 1 fast independent component analysis fast ica ica independent component analysis is a signal processing method that expresses random variables as a linear combination of statistically independent variables following a non gaussian probability distribution function hyvärinen and oja 1997 this assumption is based on the central limit theorem maubant et al 2020 the ica algorithm can effectively solve the problem of blind source separation it can separate unobservable components from a mixed signal hyvärinen and oja 1997 compared with the classical ica algorithm fast ica mainly modifies g â and iterative method the modified g â can measure the non gaussian degree of the observed signal more reliably the new iterative method is fixed point iteration which can converge quickly when estimating independent components fast ica has the advantages of a fast convergence speed few calculations good separation effect and high robustness giannakopoulos et al 1999 the essence of fast ica is to assume that multiple groups of source signals over times are statistically independent when both the source signal and the mixing matrix are unknown the process is as follows 1 x t a s t where x t x 1 t x 2 t x m t t is an observed signal matrix composed of m observation signals s t s 1 t s 2 t s n t t is a source signal matrix composed of n independent source signals t is time and a is a matrix of m n dimensions the goal of fast ica is to find the inverse matrix w of matrix a acting on the mixed signal x t to get the signal with the largest non gaussianity to approach the original signal s t the process is as follows 2 y t w x t w a s t s t where y t is the desired output signal which is also approximately equal to the source signal s t fast ica consists of two parts signal preprocessing and independent component extraction the preprocessing includes two parts de averaging and whitening the purpose is to simplify the data processing and extract the correlation of x t the formulas are as follows 3 x i t x i t 1 t max t 1 t max x i t i 1 2 m 4 z t v x t where x i t is the signal after de averaging t max is the maximum of t z t is the whitening signal and v is the whitening matrix v needs to be obtained by finding the characteristic vector of the covariance matrix of x t the equations are the following 5 c 1 m x x t 6 cv v λ 7 v v 1 v 2 v n 8 λ d i a g λ 1 λ 2 λ n where c is the covariance matrix v i are the characteristic vectors and λ is the diagonal matrix composed by the characteristic values λ i negative entropy can be used as a standard to measure the size of non gaussianity the larger the negative entropy is the stronger the non gaussian property is it can be expressed as 9 j b e g b e g c 2 10 g 1 a 1 l o g c o s h a 1 where b and c are gaussian random variables with a null mean value and variance equal to 1 g is a nonlinear function and e is the mean operator a 1 is constant usually set equal to 1 let b w t z then the expression of negative entropy of b is as follows 11 j b e g w t z e g c 2 then fixed point iteration is used to find the matrix w achieving the maximum of the objective function j b 12 w k 1 e z g w t k z e g w t k z w k where g and g is the first and second derivative of g and k the iteration step finally w is normalized 13 w k 1 w k 1 w k 1 where is the norm so far the matrix w is obtained therefore matrix a and y t can be obtained by eq 2 3 2 variable hpc decomposition method the direct use of the total hydraulic head change recorded during a certain time step to estimate s ke and s kv could be inappropriate in fact according to terzaghi s principle hydraulic head dropdown leads to elastic and or inelastic deformation of the soil skeleton depending on the actual values of the effective stress relative to the preconsolidation effective stress to accurately calculate the elastic and inelastic parameters of an aquifer system the hydraulic head change should be decomposed into two parts accounting for the elastic and inelastic deformation respectively the conventional method employed to distinguish elastic from inelastic deformation is through h pc elastic deformation occurs when the hydraulic head is greater than h pc i e the effective stress smaller than the effective preconsolidation stress and inelastic settlement occurs when the hydraulic head is lower than h pc h pc is determined based on the minimum historical head i e maximum effective stress never experience by the various portion of an aquifer system clearly h pc usually changes with the development of land subsidence as the hydraulic head decreases following the ongoing groundwater withdrawals a variable h pc is used in this paper the actual value of h pc is updated as the hydraulic head exceeds the historical minimum hydraulic head the method here implemented is an extension of the traditional approach hoffmann et al 2003 for overconsolidated soil i e a soil that experienced an effective stress larger than the actual value h pc is kept fixed over time as done in the traditional method for normally consolidated soil i e soil which is experiencing the maximum stress h pc value will change following the decrease of hydraulic head 3 3 estimation of elastic and inelastic parameters the heterogeneous distribution of alluvial deposits in the north china plain makes the geological setting highly complex therefore in this paper we use the concept of aquifer system as the research target i e we evaluate the average soil property specifically the elastic and inelastic storage for the lithotype mixture within each extensometer monitoring interval considering that water is incompressible relative to the aquifer system compressibility the storage coefficient s k can be calculated from the relationship between the compression of the aquifer system and the change in the hydraulic head the equation reads 14 s k δ b δ h s s b 0 where b 0 is the thickness of the aquifer system δ b its deformation δ h is the change of hydraulic head and s s is the specific storage s k can be divided into s ke and s kv s ke is calculated considering elastic deformations δ b e and the change of the hydraulic head corresponding to elastic deformation δ h e whereas s kv is calculated using the relationship between the inelastic deformation δ b v and the hydraulic head change acting on the inelastic deformation δ h v riley 1969 sedaghat et al 2020 the equations are as follows 15 s ke δ b e δ h e 16 s kv δ b v δ h v s ske and s skv describe the elastic and inelastic groundwater storage capacity of an aquifer system respectively riley 1969 galloway et al 1998 sedaghat et al 2020 rezaei et al 2020 they are an intrinsic attribute of the geologic unit and can represent the suitability of a soil to deform in response to hydraulic head change the specific storage parameters are defined from s ke and s kv as follows 17 s ske s ke b 0 18 s skv s kv b 0 when the hydraulic head h is higher than h pc the aquifer system undergoes elastic deformation and the value of s s is equal to s ske when h is less than h pc inelastic i e irrecoverable deformation occurs and the value of s s is equal to s skv hoffmann et al 2003 summarizing 19 s s s ske h pc h s skv h pc h 3 4 the proposed procedure a flowchart of the developed approach is presented in fig 3 the first step consists of investigating the stress strain curves at different layer depths to identify the main deformation features elastic or inelastic deformation behaviors are considered clean signals not requiring decomposition deformation data showing elastic inelastic feature is a kind of mixed signal which needs to be decomposed fig 4 second the elastic and inelastic components of deformation and the hydraulic head are separated using fast ica and variable h pc method then s ke s kv s ske and s skv are estimated by computing the separated components based on the correlation coefficient between hydraulic head and elastic deformation signal the linear fitting method is compared with the method in this study then the parameter variability with depth lithology and time is explored the δ v ir and δ v ir due to inelastic compaction are quantified 4 results multiple monitoring intervals with different depths are available at each extensometer station the notation introduced to refer clearly to each of them is as follows tz 117 148 49 represents the layer spanning the depth range from 117 to 148 49 m at tianzhu extensometer station the acronyms pgz and cz refer to pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations respectively based on hydraulic head versus deformation data land subsidence can be characterized by three behaviors elastic elastic inelastic and inelastic the stress strain curves of pgz 31 9 63 1 tz 82 3 102 and pgz 119 64 208 8 shown in fig 4 are exemplificative of these characteristics the stress strain curve of pgz 31 9 63 1 in fig 4 is characterized by a single main slope from the lower left to the upper right under repeated loading and unloading phases the residual deformation is low revealing an almost elastic behavior a number of hysteresis loops and large residual deformation can be recognized in the tz 82 3 102 stress strain curve which indicate the occurrence of elastic inelastic deformation for pgz 119 64 208 8 the residual deformation is large but there is no hysteresis loop indicating that mainly inelastic deformation occurs the elastic and inelastic deformation datasets are considered clean signals and do not require to be decomposed the elastic inelastic deformation is a mixed signal and is decomposed through the fast ica method tianzhu station is used as an exemplificative case the deformation is decomposed into a fluctuation curve y 1 t blue line in fig 5 a and a downward trend curve y 2 t red line in fig 5 a corresponding to elastic and inelastic deformation component respectively the elastic and inelastic deformations time series at different depth layers can be obtained by multiplying the deformation time series of the decomposed independent component y t in equation 2 by the correspondent matrix a in equation 1 the outcomes are provided in fig 5 a and table 1 the hydraulic head is decomposed into a periodic fluctuation curve red line in fig 5 b and a stepped decline curve blue line in fig 5 b corresponding to the elastic and inelastic hydraulic head respectively based on a variable h pc fig 6 shows the correlations between elastic deformation and the hydraulic head acting on elastic deformation and between inelastic deformation and the hydraulic head acting on inelastic deformation the correlation coefficient between the elastic deformation time series and the corresponding hydraulic head is 0 78 for the elastic parameter the time series is segmented according to the wave crests and troughs of the original signal for the inelastic parameter the time series is segmented when hydraulic head drops then the average values of s ke s kv s ske s skv and s ske s skv of the aquifer system at tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations are calculated by using equations 14 19 these parameters change over time and the average values are provided in table 2 s ske s skv reflects the ratio of elastic and inelastic deformation to the change of hydraulic head the deformation type of an aquifer system can be judged according to the stress strain curve in the aquifer system with elastic inelastic deformation s skv is obviously higher than s ske in the study area s ske s skv ranges between 0 05 and 0 40 table 2 consistently with other observations showing that inelastic compressibility is usually 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than elastic compressibility teatini et al 2011 in an aquifer system with a single deformation feature the records are not decomposed for example only inelastic deformation occurs in pgz 119 64 208 8 and only elastic deformation in tz 48 5 64 5 and pgz 31 9 63 1 as shown in table 2 s ske ranges from 2 5 10 6 to 2 9 10 5 m 1 and s skv between 1 1 10 5 and 1 5 10 4 m 1 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the storage values our contribution demonstrates that fast ica integrated with a variable preconsolidation head decomposition method allows to effectively disentangle elastic and inelastic storage values the two quantities differing up to an order of magnitude table 2 the outcomes obtained for the north china plain are comparable with those provided by other studies jiang et al 2018 calculated s ke at cangzhou which is located within the study area fig 1 by using m ssa obtaining a value of 2 10 3 in this paper the sum of s ke of the cz 195 5 252 8 and cz 68 3 195 5 aquifer system at cangzhou station is estimated equal to 2 6 10 3 based on a large amount of collected data and references kuang et al 2020 summarized the average s s of confined aquifers made of loose sediments in the range from 1 10 6 to 3 10 4 m 1 in this paper according with equation 19 s s varies between 2 5 10 6 and 1 5 10 4 m 1 which matches the range provided by kuang et al 2020 linear regression is a common approach to invert land subsidence parameters rezaei et al 2020 burbey 2020 rezaei and mousavi 2019 zhuang et al 2017 however the linear regression method cannot effectively separate elastic and inelastic deformation information we select layer tz 148 49 218 89 as an example to compare the soundness of the parameters estimated with the methodology here presented and the traditional linear procedure fig 7 shows that the deformation curve based on data decomposed by the approach we propose in this paper is evidently better than that obtained by the traditional linear fitting method by using the variable h pc method to decompose the hydraulic head and integrating the fast ica method a large number of small signal fluctuations can be captured while are neglected by the linear fitting method the correlation coefficient between the elastic deformation and the hydraulic head acting on the elastic deformation obtained by the linear fitting method is 0 35 whereas that obtained by our proposed method is 0 78 fig 7 5 2 storage parameters change with depth due to an increasing overburden load soil consolidation grows with depth and generally s ske and s skv reduce this trend is observed at the three extensometer stations investigated in this study table 2 for example at tianzhu station the s ske and s skv values decrease from 2 9 10 5 m 1 and 1 5 10 4 m 1 for the tz 48 5 64 5 layer to 3 5 10 6 m 1 and 2 2 10 5 m 1 at tz 148 49 218 89 an exception characterizes s ske values at tz 117 148 49 and tz 82 3 102 as explained in section 5 3 5 3 relations between storage parameters and lithology soil layer composed of fine particles such as silt and clay readily form honeycomb or flocculent structures when the effective stress increases beyond the upper limit the soil skeleton has experienced i e the preconsolidation stress the soil skeleton rearranges structurally producing relatively large irrecoverable deformation with a permanent loss of groundwater storage volume in the aquifer system sedaghat et al 2020 the ratio s ske s skv is adopted to analyze the relations between lithology and storage the outcomes provided in table 2 show that the finer the sediment grains are the smaller s ske s skv is for example the sediments of tz 82 3 102 layer are mainly composed of silty clay and fine sand with s ske s skv 0 05 this value is about three times smaller than those computed for tz 148 49 218 89 and tz 117 148 49 layers where fine and coarse sand is present this also explain why at tianzhu station the s ske values do not strictly follow a decreasing trend with depth a peculiar case is pgz 31 9 63 1 it is a shallow layer with fine grains silty clay which shows an elastic deformation the possible reason of this stress strain behavior is that the depth range was overconsolidated when the extensometer station was put in operation with h pc smaller than the actual head h concluding s ske and s skv depend on the burial depth and lithology of the soil layers simultaneously it is generally challenging to disentangle their contributions from compaction and pressure change records and the proposed methodology i e fast ica with variable preconsolidation head decomposition method can be successfully used to achieve this aim 5 4 storage variation over time the available dataset properly processed through the proposed procedure allows quantifying how s ke and s kv varied over time for s ke the time series is segmented according to the wave crest and wave trough of the original signal for s kv the time series is segmented when the inelastic hydraulic head drops and s kv is computed only when h h pc the s ke values at tianzhu and cangzhou stations remain almost constant or fluctuate with time respectively fig 8 conversely s kv is characterized by a clear decrease versus time fig 9 i e with the ongoing compaction obviously the nonlinear behavior of s kv is related to the decrease of pore space that reduce the possibility of further inelastic compaction this behavior has been previously observed for other aquifer systems e g in the suzhou wuxi changzhou area china shi et al 2007 and in the northern adriatic coastland italy teatini et al 2006 the time series at pinggezhuang station is too short to be analyzed 5 5 loss of permanent storage volume the change in skeleton compressibility is the main factor influencing the capability of an aquifer system to store water the decrease of groundwater volume stored into aquifer systems that experienced significant compaction is a main topic in several sedimentary basins worldwide e g béjar pizarro et al 2017 smith et al 2017 the total storage loss can be divided into a recoverable elastic deformation part and an irrecoverable inelastic deformation part the percentage of permanent loss of storage volume δ v ir can be estimated using s kv δ h v b 0 and n porosity as follows 15 δ v ir s kv δ h v b 0 n in this equation the numerator represents the loss of pore volume per unit area due to inelastic deformation and the denominator represents the portion of the layer thickness b 0 occupied by the pore volume when inelastic deformation occurs the space originally used for water storage is irreversibly reduces and it cannot be restored by groundwater recharge the loss results in a reduced capacity of the natural underground reservoir with paramount consequences in the management of groundwater resources δ v ir at tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou stations are 0 027 0 068 0 009 0 033 and 0 043 0 130 respectively table 3 the larger the δ v ir value the greater the irreversible effect of compaction caused by groundwater overexploitation the cumulative δ v ir permanent loss of storage volume of an aquifer portion is obtained by multiplying equation 15 by the area of the region the areas near the three extensometer stations where similar inelastic storage hydraulic head changes and aquifer systems geometry can be assumed are 42 6 km2 43 0 km2 and 88 5 km2 for tianzhu pinggezhuang and cangzhou respectively therefore δ v ir for the three areas are 3 6 106 m3 1 3 106 m3 and 1 9 107 m3 respectively 6 conclusions separating recoverable elastic from permanent inelastic deformation of aquifer systems is one of the main research topics in aquifer geomechanics with important consequences in terms of developing sustainable pumping practices in this paper a novel methodology integrating fast ica and a variable h pc is proposed to unravel elastic and inelastic specific storage in confined aquifer systems this method can effectively separate the elastic and inelastic components of deformation at the level of each hydrogeologic unit composing an aquifer system an outcome that is achieved in this work for the first time the proposed methodology is applied in a region of the north china plain severely affected by land subsidence using records collected at three multi depth extensometer stations the relations between the storage parameters and depth lithology and time are explored based on the determined storage values the permanent loss of storage volume is estimated lithology and depth control the values of s ske and s skv s ske and s skv of different aquifer systems generally decrease with depth at tianzhu station s ske decreased from 2 9 10 5 m 1 to 3 5 10 6 m 1 with the depth increasing from 48 5 to 64 5 m to 148 49 218 89 m as to the inelastic component s skv decreased from 1 5 10 4 m 1 to 2 2 10 5 m 1 with the depth increasing from 82 3 to 102 m to 148 49 218 89 m the finer the lithology the smaller the ratio s ske s skv is at tianzhu station s ske s skv 0 05 for fine sediment layers which is two to three time smaller than the values computed for the layers made of relatively coarse grains in addition s ke is characterized by an almost constant long time value while s kv exhibits a decreasing trend with time i e with the ongoing compaction that irreversibly reduces the soil pore volume the percentage of permanent loss of storage volume at three stations ranges from 0 009 to 0 13 the methodological approach here presented has been applied in this paper on a significant dataset made of multi depth deformation and hydraulic head records at three extensometer stations in engineering field the physical signal is generally mixed one which is difficult to decompose the fast ica can be the effective tool to decompose the blind source information in the future the procedure will be used on insar interferometric synthetic aperture radar products and outcomes of groundwater flow modelling to achieve a better coverage quantification of the storage parameters in the north china plain credit authorship

3699,the performance criteria have been often used in the hydrological model evaluation or calibration since the performance criteria have their own advantages and disadvantages it is necessary to understand the impact of each performance criterion on the model evaluation or calibration to be used for the purposes of model applications the liu mean efficiency lme was proposed for the design flow estimates from hydrological modeling data by reformulating the three metric components correlation variability and bias measures in the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse or the kling and gupta efficiency kge to improve the flow variability in the runoff simulations optimized with the nse or kge this article has discussed that the lme criterion has weaknesses of an underdetermined system that can potentially induce the vagueness in comparative assessments for alternative model performance as well as an overestimation system that can substantially reduce the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological modeling a complement approach to the limitations of the lme is necessary for the lme to be made fit for a rational performance criterion keywords liu mean efficiency

evaluation or calibration based on the goodness of fit between the simulated results and the observed data and each of model performance criteria has its own advantages and disadvantages as reviewed in jackson et al 2019 it is important to use the appropriate performance criterion that can quantitatively evaluate the comparative model performance or successfully identify the optimum model

the value of r is typically smaller than unity in hydrological modeling the value of α gets greater than unity for k 1 r α to get closer to unity when optimizing with the lme thus the optimal values of r 1 and α 1 for the desirable slope k 1 r α 1 of the regression line x s to maximize the lme will result in a milder slope κ 1 r α 1 and a positive y intercept κ 0 μ o κ 1 μ s 0 of the other regression line x o unless β is much greater than unity this means that the calibration results with the lme for the design flow estimates will have a strong tendency to overestimate high flows and underestimate low flows in the lme optimal simulations as also expected by the optimal variability measure of α 1 such peculiar nature of the lme optimization was clearly found in scatter plots of the simulated versus observed runoff when optimizing on the nse kge and lme as shown in fig 5 by liu 2020 where the lme optimal result has larger peak flows located farther above the 1 1 line i e overestimation and smaller low flows located farther below the 1 1 line i e underestimation than the nse and kge optimal results as liu 2020 also compared the frequency analysis results of high flows and low flows obtained optimized by the nse kge and lme in fig 11 by liu 2020 the frequency analysis of the lme optimal runoff will generate significantly larger amounts of designed floods and smaller amounts of designed low flows compared with the frequency analysis of the observed data which is also less reliable let alone vice versa for the water related hazard and risk management ideally it would be desirable to conduct the decision making and risk analysis based on accurate model simulations as much as possible rather than intentionally extreme events from simulations with larger variability than observations designing for worse case scenarios would make sense when it can be another conscious choice based on the accurate simulation results among the three performance criteria nse kge and lme the lme will yield the highest variation in the simulated runoff because the optimal condition k 1 r α 1 for maximizing the lme will tend to unduly increase the variability α measure α 1 such a peculiar feature of the lme criterion will become more severe in the daily runoff time series that tend to show much smaller r measures than the monthly runoff time series used in the case study for the xunhe river basin by liu 2020 3 underdetermined issue from an algebraic perspective on the lme criterion the lme is an underdetermined underconstrained system where the number of constraints r α 1 and β 1 is fewer than the number of decision variables α β and r this underdetermined equation has an infinite number of solutions that can potentially maximize the lme even when neither r nor α is the ideal value of unity as shown in fig 1 modified from fig 2 by liu 2020 the lme can have numerous optimal and also ideal values satisfying r α 1 along the maximum potential lme 1 0 line when β 1 in contrast to the lme there exists an optimal solution which is an extreme point or a vertex of each feasible pareto front convex curve at a given r when α r for maximizing the nse and when α 1 for maximizing the kge and the only one ideal case occurs when both r and α are unity for the nse and kge the nse and kge scores consistently decrease when errors in r and α increase whereas the lme scores can remain constant as long as large errors in both can compensate each other for r α 1 resulting in the curious and undesirable cases where the potentially maximum lme score lme 1 does not at all guarantee the perfect or best model simulation see fig 1 and also the following example liu 2020 addressed that however the slope k 1 in lme is the combination of α and r where the errors in α and r can compensate each other the lme metric does not guarantee that higher metric values correspond to smaller errors in the hydrological simulation even the ideal value of k 1 is unity it is contradictory to say that higher scores of the lme based on error metrics α β and r cannot reflects smaller simulation errors besides any complementary approach was not presented to overcome such critical issue that can potentially cause significant ambiguity in the comparative evaluation for alternative model hypotheses liu 2020 also referred to the probability or cumulative distribution function of the lme as another separate measure of the goodness of fit through the distribution function s parameters since such probability statistics of the lme can contradict the regression component measures in the lme this confidence level aspect of the lme should have been incorporated into the lme optimization process or taken into consideration as the third constraint in the lme formulation to ensure that the lme to be made fit for a rational performance criterion for model performance evaluation and identification with the performance criteria the optimal model parameters should be consistently determined by the optimal skill score of the performance criteria designed towards the minimum or none error achieved in the only one ideal case during a model calibration or evaluation process therefore the lme criterion is not suitable for the design of diagnostic assessment methodologies to support hydrological model identification or calibration again assuming β equals unity for the sake of simplicity numerous optimal combinations of r and α values for r α 1 e g r 0 5 α 2 0 or r 0 8 α 1 25 etc to achieve the maximum potential skill score of the lme can even be treated as superior to the cases where both r and α are very close to unity e g r 0 99 α 0 99 in the model calibration results with the lme as such the quantitative skill scores obtained by the lme criterion are not sufficient for the comparative evaluation of model performance in hydrological modeling and thus the lme optimization results will require a complementary approach to confirm model performance evaluation and identification see also the following example 4 exemplary review and discussion in such contexts it is concluded that although liu 2020 proposed the lme criterion for the design flow from hydrological frequency analysis the lme optimization is likely to generate multiple optimal solutions towards excessive flow variation in the process of reformulating the three metric components r α and β of the nse and kge as a result the lme criterion can potentially reduce the consistency in comparative assessments for alternative model performance as well as the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological modeling to demonstrate the behavior of skill scores for the simulated runoff by the choice of performance criteria table 1 and fig 2 illustrate a comparative example of the three sample simulation cases sim1 sim2 and sim3 against the observed monthly runoff time series obs for two years table 1 also compares the model performance evaluation results with the nse kge and lme for the three sample simulation cases and fig 3 depicts the absolute errors between observations and simulations in the three sample simulation cases sim1 sim2 and sim3 for each observed monthly runoff value as denoted in table 1 the three simulation cases show different correlation measures r values are 0 789 0 870 and 0 995 respectively for sim1 sim2 and sim3 and variability measures α values are 1 253 1 149 and 1 006 respectively for sim1 sim2 and sim3 without bias β 1 and β n 0 for all sim1 sim2 and sim3 in the model performance evaluation with the lme criterion both sim1 and sim2 with the ideal values of k 1 1 can achieve the maximum potential score lme 1 000 and they are regarded as superior to the overall model performance of sim3 lme 0 999 whose individual metric performance r 0 995 and α 1 006 is much better as clearly distinguished in figs 2 and 3 than sim1 r 0 798 and α 1 253 and sim2 r 0 870 and α 1 149 which is also not consistent with the nse and kge results with the best skill score for sim3 as denoted in table 1 of course sim3 will be the best in terms of the confidence level of the lme such opposite results between the lme score and the confidence level of the lme can lead to the confusion in the model performance evaluation a rational and robust performance criterion should be capable of comprehensively evaluating the overall model performance by itself or its optimization scheme moreover as also shown in table 1 and fig 4 the lme can be maximized by the optimal condition of k 1 1 000 for both sim1 and sim2 regardless of the value of κ 1 that will be much smaller than unity 0 637 for sim1 and 0 758 for sim2 which represents a systematic tendency to overestimate peak flows and underestimate low flows in sim1 and sim2 of the lme optimal and ideal results as such the interpretation of model performance may differ in each of the two regression lines of x s and x o as shown in fig 4 and thus the optimal condition for the desirable regression line x s alone could not guarantee the agreement between simulations and observations note that the optimal condition for the lme criterion based on a desirable regression model x s k 1 x o k 0 can only ensure the agreement between the mean values of simulations and observations rather than between individual values of them hence the model skill scores of the lme criterion should be reviewed by a general visual or statistical agreement between simulations and observations see figs 2 and 3 the example cases used here albeit somewhat simple or extreme demonstrate that the problematic interplay between r and α in the lme is more likely to overestimate high flows and or underestimate low flows in the optimal runoff simulation faced with the potential of not being superior to other simulation cases when optimizing with the lme which requires complementary measures to be made fit for the purpose of the lme criterion a complement approach to the limitations of the lme is expected to be possible through incorporating another important statistical information such as the confidence level or relevant components into the current lme formulation based on the least squares regression statistics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

3699,the performance criteria have been often used in the hydrological model evaluation or calibration since the performance criteria have their own advantages and disadvantages it is necessary to understand the impact of each performance criterion on the model evaluation or calibration to be used for the purposes of model applications the liu mean efficiency lme was proposed for the design flow estimates from hydrological modeling data by reformulating the three metric components correlation variability and bias measures in the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse or the kling and gupta efficiency kge to improve the flow variability in the runoff simulations optimized with the nse or kge this article has discussed that the lme criterion has weaknesses of an underdetermined system that can potentially induce the vagueness in comparative assessments for alternative model performance as well as an overestimation system that can substantially reduce the reliability in design flow estimates through hydrological modeling a complement approach to the limitations of the lme is necessary for the lme to be made fit for a rational performance criterion keywords liu mean efficiency performance criterion model calibration model performance evaluation hydrological model 1 introduction to lme criterion a number of performance criteria have been used in the hydrological model evaluation or calibration based on the goodness of fit between the simulated results and the observed data and each of model performance criteria has its own advantages and disadvantages as reviewed in jackson et al 2019 it is important to use the appropriate performance criterion that can quantitatively evaluate the comparative model performance or successfully identify the optimum model parameters on the purposes of model applications lee and choi 2021 for the help in design flow estimates liu 2020 proposed a performance criterion the liu mean efficiency lme by reformulating the three metric components correlation r variability α and bias β of the kling and gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 in order to improve model performance associated with the variability in the runoff simulation results obtained optimized by the kge the kge criterion was formulated as kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 consisting of the three distinctive performance metrics from a decomposition form of the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 such as nse 2 α r α 2 β n 2 by gupta et al 2009 r is the linear correlation coefficient between simulations x s and observations x o α σ s σ o is the relative variability measured by the standard deviation values σ s of x s and σ o of x o β μ s μ o is the ratio of the means values μ s of x s to μ o of x o and β n μ s μ o σ o is the bias normalized by σ o the lme formulation is based on the standard regression statistics for measuring the linear relationship between the simulated results and the observed data one of the most common and simple techniques for the model performance evaluation in hydrological modeling moriasi et al 2007 as addressed in liu 2020 the expected simulation values x s can be expressed as a regression model x s k 1 x o k 0 where regression coefficients the slope k 1 and the y intercept k 0 of the regression line x s can be determined by the least squares approach such as k 1 r α and k 0 μ s k 1 μ o when the slope k 1 equals 1 for the consistency and the y intercept k 0 equals 0 for the unbiased forecast i e β equals 1 the model can perfectly reproduce the magnitude or the mean of observed data willmott 1981 by taking into account the conditions for the desirable regression line and the relative accuracy measure to the mean observed data as a result the lme was formulated by the euclidian distance from the ideal point of the constituent metric components k 1 and β for the regression line when regressing simulations x s against observations x o as 1 lme 1 k 1 1 2 β 1 2 1 r α 1 2 β 1 2 2 overestimation issue in addition to the regression model x s k 1 x o k 0 for regressing simulations x s against observations x o employed in the lme criterion there exists the other regression line x o in the flipped axes for regressing observations x o against simulations x s this regression model can be also written as x o κ 1 x s κ 0 with the slope κ 1 r α and the y intercept κ 0 μ o κ 1 μ s by the least squares estimation unless both α and β are equal to unity there can be significantly different results between the slopes k 1 κ 1 and between the y intercepts k 0 κ 0 in the two regression line equations of x s and x o accordingly the interpretation of each of the both regression lines x s and x o may change the conclusions of the model performance evaluation piñeiro et al 2008 since the value of r is typically smaller than unity in hydrological modeling the value of α gets greater than unity for k 1 r α to get closer to unity when optimizing with the lme thus the optimal values of r 1 and α 1 for the desirable slope k 1 r α 1 of the regression line x s to maximize the lme will result in a milder slope κ 1 r α 1 and a positive y intercept κ 0 μ o κ 1 μ s 0 of the other
