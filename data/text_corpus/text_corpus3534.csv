17670,viruses are linked to a multitude of human illnesses and can disseminate widely in urbanized environments causing global adverse impacts on communities and healthcare infrastructures wastewater based epidemiology was employed using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays to identify enteric and non enteric viruses collected from a large urban area for potential public health monitoring and outbreak analysis untreated wastewater samples were collected from november 2017 to february 2018 n 54 to evaluate the diversity of human viral pathogens in collected samples viruses were classified into virus types based on primary transmission routes and reviewed against viral associated diseases reported in the catchment area metagenomics detected the presence of viral pathogens that cause clinically significant diseases reported within the study area during the sampling year detected viruses belong to the adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae coronaviridae flaviviridae hepeviridae herpesviridae matonaviridae papillomaviridae parvoviridae picornaviridae poxviridae retroviridae and togaviridae families furthermore concentrations of adenovirus norovirus gii sapovirus hepatitis a virus human herpesvirus 6 and human herpesvirus 8 were measured in wastewater samples and compared to metagenomic findings to confirm detected viral genus hepatitis a virus obtained the greatest average viral load 1 86 107 genome copies l in wastewater samples compared to other viruses quantified using qpcr with a 100 detection rate in metagenomic samples average concentration of sapovirus 1 36 106 genome copies l was significantly greater than norovirus gii 2 94 104 genome copies l indicating a higher burden within the study area findings obtained from this study aid in evaluating the utility of wastewater based epidemiology for identification and routine monitoring of various viruses in large communities this methodology has the potential to improve public health responses to large scale outbreaks and viral pandemics graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater based epidemiology public health viral diseases metagenomics virus diversity qpcr 1 introduction viruses are linked to a host of illness related to respiratory infections diarrheal illness autoimmune diseases meningitis hepatitis cancer viral hemorrhagic fevers and others infections often disseminate quickly in urbanized regions due to densely populated areas and could reach thousands of inhabitants before health care facilities are notified since viruses do not replicate outside of a host and can remain stable in the environment for significant periods of time wastewater based epidemiology wbe can be used to capture a near real time picture of the viral disease burden within a community viruses can enter waste streams through multiple routes including stool urine skin saliva and blood thus wastewater has the potential to assess the burden of a variety of viruses it is well known that confirmed enteric viruses such as rotaviruses adenoviruses enteroviruses hepatitis a and e viruses caliciviruses and others can be detected in wastewater while it is logical to investigate the applicability of enteric viruses to wbe it is also important to demonstrate the potential for other viruses to fit into this methodology indeed it has been shown that multiple non enteric viruses such as coronaviruses herpesviruses influenza zika west nile yellow fever dengue and others have been detected in stool and urine samples or wastewater barzon et al 2013 gourinat et al 2015 gundy et al 2009 heijnen and medema 2011 hirayama et al 2012 hirose et al 2016 o brien and xagoraraki 2019 poloni et al 2010 tonry et al 2005 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 these observations confirm that the concept of wastewater based epidemiology can be applied to a wide range of viruses beyond the confirmed enteric viruses enteric viruses are commonly discovered in untreated wastewater farkas et al 2018a ng et al 2012 victoria et al 2014 and recent studies have confirmed corresponding disease prevalence in the surrounding community bisseux et al 2018 particularly picornaviruses constitute an important group of enteric viruses that cause a host of illnesses including diseases of the central nervous systems respiratory tract liver and gastrointestinal tract moreover caliciviruses are common causes of diarrheal illnesses which were among the top causes of death worldwide in 2017 gbd 2017 causes of death collaborators 2018 with that noroviruses are among the leading causes of gastroenteritis and a significant agent in global viral outbreak of acute gastroenteritis glass et al 2009 hall et al 2013 routine monitoring of picornaviruses and caliciviruses in wastewater can provide insight into the transmission of clinically important diseases prevent widespread outbreaks and reduce deaths linked to such viruses molecular and sequencing approaches provide qualitative and quantitative insights into wastewater environments mccall and xagoraraki 2019 metagenomics allows for the screening of a large panel of viruses in environmental systems that would otherwise prove time consuming using traditional laboratory techniques metagenomics has identified co infecting organisms during outbreak conditions li et al 2019 novel pathogens cantalupo et al 2011 and viral compositions in complex matrices fancello et al 2013 miranda et al 2016 o brien et al 2017 despite its breakthroughs the sensitivity of metagenomics to identify vial pathogens is confounded by the presence of bacteria sequencing limitations and errors imposed by sequence analysis and alignment tools for these reasons sensitive pcr techniques are commonly used to corroborate results obtained from metagenomic analysis here metagenomic analysis was utilized to assess the diversity of human viral pathogens in untreated wastewater collected from a large urban center over the course of four months detected viral pathogens were further classified according to virus type and compared with health data with an emphasis on picornaviruses from the associated community to evaluate the application of wastewater based epidemiology for identification of endemic disease and potential upcoming viral outbreaks quantitative pcr and rt qpcr assays were performed on select viruses commonly present in sewage to corroborate results obtained through metagenomic approaches finally norovirus and sapovirus were compared in wastewater to assess the burden of caliciviruses on gastrointestinal illness cases reported in the community 2 methods 2 1 study area and wastewater sample collection wastewater surveillance was conducted at the water resource recovery facility wrrf located in detroit michigan the detroit wrrf is the largest single site wastewater treatment plant in the u s and treats wastewater from an estimated 3 million inhabitants with an average daily flow of 650 mgd glwa 2018 it services the three largest counties by population in michigan these are wayne oakland and macomb counties jones et al 2015 the wrrf receives wastewater from its service municipalities via three main interceptors north interceptor east arm ni ea detroit river interceptor dri and oakwood northwest wayne county interceptor o nwi these interceptors are large sewers that collect and transports wastewater from smaller sewers to the wrrf untreated wastewater samples were collected at the wrrf from sampling points located at each of the three interceptors approximately bi weekly between november 2017 and february 2018 n 54 viruses were isolated from untreated wastewater using electropositive nanoceram column filters following the epa s virus adsorption elution protocol u s epa 2001 samples were collected in triplicates for each interceptor per sampling date where wastewater was passed through a column filter until fouling occurred average filtered sample volumes range between 24 and 44 l per interceptor each interceptor was sampled with its own filter house tubing and vacuum pump to minimize cross contamination virus filters were immediately stored on ice and transported to the environmental virology laboratory at michigan state university msu and stored in 20 c until further processing 2 2 sample processing and virus isolation following wastewater sampling nanoceram cartridge filters were eluted within 24 h with 1 5 w v beef extract 0 05 m glycine ph 9 5 according to the epa s protocol u s epa 2001 in short filters were eluted with 1 l of beef extract for a total of 2 min the ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 0 1 and flocculated for 30 min before centrifugation at 2500g for 15 min at 4 c supernatant was discarded and pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of 0 15 m sodium phosphate ph 9 0 9 5 followed by a second round of centrifugation carried out at 7000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was neutralized ph 7 25 and subjected to filtration using to 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm syringe filters to eliminate bacterial contamination extraction of nucleic acid was performed on 140 μl of purified virus concentrate using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen following the manufacturer s protocol and eluted in 80 μl of elution buffer nucleic acid was stored at 80 c until further processing 2 3 metagenomic analysis 2 3 1 sampling processing and random amplification to explore human virus diversity between sampling locations and dates purified nucleic acid from each biological replicate was pooled together for a total of 18 samples these samples represent genetic material from all three interceptors during each of the six sampling dates nucleic acid from each sample was reverse transcribed and subjected to random amplification as previously described wang et al 2003 to evaluate both rna and dna viruses 2 3 2 next generation sequence processing eighteen samples of viral cdna were sent to the research technology support facility genomics core at michigan state university for whole genome shotgun sequencing wgs the illumina truseq nano dna library preparation kit was used for all cdna samples library preparation was performed on a perkinelmer sciclone g3 robot according to the manufacturer s recommendations this was followed by sequencing on an illumina hiseq4000 platform generating 150 bp paired end reads 2 3 3 sequence analysis and taxonomic annotation sequencing reads generated from wgs were processed on a unix system through the msu high performance computing center hpcc raw sequences were analyzed for quality using fastqc a quality control tool for sequencing data andrews 2010 sequencing adapters and reads with an average quality score below 20 were removed using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 trimmed reads were assembled with idba ud a short read de novo sequence aligner for metagenomic data reads were assembled into contigs using an iterative k mer approach with k mer sizes ranging between 40 and 120 in increments of 10 the remaining parameters were run at default conditions human virus genomes are relatively small and less abundant in wastewater and therefore may be masked by more dominant bacteria or plant virus genomes it can also be a challenge for reference databases to maintain updated sequence information for viruses possessing high mutation rates particularly rna viruses leaving room for false negatives and a large percentage of unaffiliated contigs mccall and xagoraraki 2019 to compensate for some of these limitations an optimized multi alignment approach was used to improve alignment and annotation of human viral contigs first contigs were aligned against the viral refseq database using tblastx with an e value of 10 3 this approach has been known to increase human viral discovery in metagenomic datasets bibby et al 2011 aligned contigs were assigned to the lowest common ancestor lca according to the ncbi s taxonomy with megan v 6 15 0 the top 10 percent of blast alignments with a minimum bit score of 50 and contig coverage of at least 80 were considered in taxonomic analysis the remaining parameters were run at default conditions reads assigned to virus families containing known human pathogens were extracted and aligned with blastx with an e value of 10 5 against a custom human virus database containing 5979 human viral proteins in swiss prot database boeckmann et al 2003 these sequences represented all human viral proteins in the swiss prot database at the time of retrieval september 2019 target specific databases can reduce ambiguity and improve pathogens discovery furthermore protein searches are more effective at capturing remote homology as compared to nucleotide searches breitwieser et al 2018 these optimized detection approaches are important for human viral pathogens which are often difficult to detect in environmental samples due to their low abundance small genomes and high mutation rates to further increase the potential for pathogen discovery and minimize false negatives contigs assigned to the virus root were also aligned against the swiss prot database this method was more effective at capturing select viruses confirmed through qpcr and rt qpcr compared to contigs solely extracted from human viral families data not shown fig 1 displays the metagenomics workflow for human virus identification in wastewater samples 2 4 quantification of select viruses quantitative pcr or rt qpcr was performed on six viruses namely sapovirus sav norovirus nov gii human adenovirus hadv 40 and 41 hepatitis a virus hav and human herpesvirus 6 hhv 6 and 8 hhv 8 2 4 1 preparation of standard curves hav and hadv were obtained from atcc for preparation of standard controls nucleic acid was extracted from each virus isolate as detailed in the previous section and transformed into one shot top10 chemically competent escherichia coli cells using the topo cloning kit invitrogen following the manufacturer s protocol plasmid dna containing cloned hav and hadv was extracted and quantified according to a previous method munir et al 2011 the protocol detailed in step two of the subsequent section was utilized to prepare a standard curve with 10 fold serial dilutions of positive hav and hadv controls quantitative synthetic nov gii rna sav rna hhv 6 dna and hhv 8 dna was obtained from atcc rna or dna was diluted 10 fold and analyzed as described in the following section standard curves for hav hadv nov gii sav hhv 6 and hhv 8 obtained r squared values of 99 and slopes of 3 61 3 66 3 82 3 35 3 88 and 3 59 respectively the limit of detection lod for each virus was determined by the lowest point on the standard curve or by the lowest dilution with a 95 positive detection rate in at least 10 replicates burns and valdivia 2008 hav hadv nov sav and hhvs obtained a lod of 101 genome copies ul 2 4 2 qpcr and rt qpcr quantitative pcr or rt qpcr assays were used to establish the concentration of hav hadv nov gii sav hhv 6 and hhv 8 in wastewater samples all assays were performed in triplicates on a mastercycler ep realplex2 eppendorf in 96 well optical plates amplification of cdna was mediated using lightcycler 480 probes master roche at a concentration of 1 in all reactions sterile nuclease free water was used to meet volume requirements in all reactions primers and probes used are shown in table a1 hav and sav was quantified using a two step rt qpcr based on a previously described methods jothikumar et al 2005 oka et al 2006 briefly viral rna was reverse transcribed using iscript rt qpcr supermix bio rad according to the manufacturer s protocol for hav 5 μl of cdna negative control or positive control was transferred to a 15 μl reaction mix containing hav primers and taqman probe reactions were performed with the following conditions 95 c for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s 55 c for 20 s and 72 c for 15 s sav quantification was carried out in a 25 μl reaction containing each primer and probe reactions were performed with the following conditions 95 c for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 c for 15 s 62 c for 1 min and 72 c for 15 s norovirus gii was quantified using a one step rt qpcr as previously described le guyader et al 2009 in short the rt qpcr was carried out in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing primers and probe 2 μl of iscript rt qpcr supermix and 5 μl of viral rna negative control or positive control reactions were performed with the following conditions reverse transcription at 25 c for 5 min 46 c for 20 min and 95 c for 1 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 1 min 65 c for 1 min dna viruses hadv hhv 6 and hhv 8 were quantified according to previously established methods gautheret dejean et al 2002 lallemand et al 2000 xagoraraki et al 2007 hadv and hhvs were qualified in 20 μl reactions containing 5 μl of dna or standard control denaturation was carried out at 95 c for 15 min for all dna viruses followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 30 s and 72 c for 10 s for hadv 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min for hhv 6 and 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 65 c for 1 min for hhv 8 2 5 health data collection disease data for all reportable viral diseases for each service county was obtained from the michigan department of health and human services mdhhs probable and confirmed case counts were extracted from the michigan disease and surveillance system mdss weekly surveillance reports wsr the mdss is a communicable disease reporting system used to facilitate coordination and sharing of disease surveillance data among multiple shareholders including healthcare providers and medical laboratories mdhhs 2020a each weekly surveillance report accounts for disease cases reported from sunday saturday of the corresponding week it is important to note that the wsr uses gastrointestinal illness gi and influenza like illness ili to represent any disease displaying symptoms of this nature the etiological agent of the disease is unspecified but could be of viral bacterial or parasitic origin ili was defined according to the u s influenza surveillance system cdc 2019a gi is defined as symptoms related to diarrhea and or vomiting mdhhs 2018a diseases reported in wsrs were considered if is the primary disease of viruses detected in metagenomic samples and if there was at least one case of that disease reported within macomb oakland or wayne counties during the sampling year 2017 2018 2 6 statistical and cluster analysis cluster analysis was performed using the bray curtis dissimilarity index in megan on metagenomic samples at the family level within the swiss prot taxonomic analysis to determine similarity between samples a one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd post hoc tests were used to investigate significance between mean concentrations of select viruses in wastewater samples finally spearman s correlation analysis was used to determine significant associations between select caliciviruses and the number of norovirus and gi reported cases within the service community all statistical analyses were performed in r r core team 2019 3 results illumina sequencing was performed on 18 untreated wastewater samples collected from detroit s wrrf from november 2017 to february 2018 a total of 624 4 million reads were subject to quality trimming resulting in 595 2 million reads reads were assembled and aligned using tblastx against the viral refseq database the proportion of contigs assigned to viral taxonomic groups range between 72 and 83 table a2 as expected viruses infecting prokaryotes constituted the greatest proportion of viral reads table 1 3 1 classification of human viral pathogens in wastewater putative human viral contigs were extracted via megan taxonomic bins and aligned against all human viral proteins in the swiss prot database using blastx an average of approximately 0 18 0 05 0 78 of viral affiliated contigs were aligned to human viral proteins fourteen different human viral families were identified with the greatest number of contigs largely assigned to poxviridae herpesviridae and picornaviridae fig 2 of the fourteen families nine were classified at ssrna viruses and the remaining five as dna viruses fig 3 shows the proportion of ssrna and dna viral families in each sample comparable relative abundances of ssrna and dna viruses were observed during the 14 dec 19 jan and 2 feb sampling dates with dna viruses dominating sequenced samples during the remaining three sampling dates bray curtis dissimilarity analysis was used to determine the similarity between samples at the family taxonomic level after alignment against human viral protein sequences according to the bray curtis analysis there were more similarities within sampling dates rather than sampling locations with samples collected during three consecutive sampling dates 14 dec 19 jan and 2 feb clustering together fig 3 poxviridae parvoviridae and herpesviridae families were the most influential viral families when discriminating between samples data not shown of the 14 human viral families identified contigs were assigned to 26 human virus genera with dna viruses orthopoxivirus simplex viruses and lymphocrytovirus obtaining the greatest number of hits alphavirus a ssrna virus containing vector borne viruses was the fourth most abundant genus fig 4 a the most frequently detected virus type was enteric and respiratory followed by other bloodborne and vector borne fig 4b table 2 four of ten enteric viruses detected belong to the picornaviridae family namely hepatovirus enterovirus parechovirus and cardiovirus fig 5 illustrates the temporal and spatial relative abundance of picornaviruses during the study period proteins associated with hepatovirus mamastrovius and enterovirus obtained the greatest number of assigned contigs within the enteric virus group fig 4a within the mamastrovirus genus classic human astroviruses hastv were detected with 90 homology to the reference sequence in all positive samples 15 18 enteroviruses containing respiratory and enteric pathogens revealed human coxsackievirus and poliovirus species detected in positive samples with 80 identity to the reference gene orthopoxivirus constituted the greatest number of hits within the respiratory group with vaccinia virus being the most frequently identified species additionally metagenomic analysis detected the presence of respiratory pathogen betacoronavirus in 8 of the 18 collected samples with human coronavirus hku1 being the primary species detected with 60 percent identity fig 4a other enteric and respiratory viruses detected include mastadenovirus sapovirus norovirus orthohepevirus varicellovirus rubivirus bocaparvovirus roseolovirus and erythroparvovirus table 2 viruses solely grouped in the other category consists of viruses transmitted via skin saliva or other bodily fluids such as simplex virus parapoxvirus and alphapapillomavirus furthermore alphavirus was the only vector borne virus discovered in metagenomic samples with a detection rate of 89 important bloodborne viruses hepacivirus lentivirus deltaretrovirus and lymphocryptovirus were also discovered in metagenomic samples fig 4 table 2 3 2 comparison of human viruses and clinical data weekly surveillance reports from the mdhhs mdss were utilized to evaluate the potential association between the 26 human viruses detected in metagenomic samples and the presence of primary associated diseases within the surrounding community during the study period mastadenovirus mamastrovirus sapovirus bocaparvovirus cardiovirus enterovirus and parechovirus were linked to solely non specific diseases including flu like gastrointestinal illnesses aseptic meningitis and acute flaccid myelitis norovirus betacoronavirus and rubivirus were related to at least one non specific illnesses along with virus specific diseases norovirus novel coronavirus and rubella respectively virus specific diseases for hepacivirus orthohepevirus varicellovirus hepatovirus lentivirus and alphavirus were present in wsrs during the sampling year during the time of data collection mandatory reporting was not required for diseases related to several viruses including parapoxvirus deltaretrovirus gammaretrovirus and alphapapillomavirus table 2 3 3 quantitative screening for select human viral pathogens to confirm results obtained from metagenomic analysis select viruses were quantified in wastewater samples namely sav nov gii hadv 40 41 hav hhv 6 and hhv 8 hav nov hadv and hhv 8 were quantified in all samples and obtained positive detection rate of 100 50 22 and 0 in metagenomic samples respectively sav and hhv 6 were quantified in 94 and 39 of the 18 samples considered with a 28 and 83 detection in sequenced samples all select viruses except hhv 6 were detected during each sampling date using qpcr or rt qpcr fig 6 there were significant differences in average concentrations for some viruses where hav hadv nov p 0 0001 mean sav concentrations were significantly less than hav p 0 0001 and greater than nov p 0 0001 there was no significant difference between sav and hadv p 0 05 concentrations of hhv 6 and hhv 8 were significantly lower than hav hadv sav and nov p 0 0001 there was no significant difference between mean concentrations of hhv 6 and hhv 8 p 0 05 in collected samples 3 4 calicivirus detection in wastewater a temporal investigation of nov gii and sav concentrations in wastewater samples was carried out to assess the potential burden of these viruses and their contribution to gastrointestinal illnesses within the service community average concentrations of sav and nov gii were 1 36 106 and 2 94 104 genome copies l respectively the highest average concentration for both viruses occurred during the 14 dec sampling date fig 7 however according to spearman s correlation analysis there was no significant association between the number of reported gi cases and concentrations of nov gii and sav per sampling week table 3 4 discussion a wbe study for viral diseases was carried out on wastewater samples collected from a large urban municipal wastewater treatment facility samples were subjected to metagenomic analysis and qpcr rt qpcr assays to identify human viral pathogens circulating within the community more than half of all aligned contigs were assigned to viral taxonomic groups the use of virus enrichment techniques has been known to decrease the presence of non targeted organisms such as bacteria and improve virus detection within metagenomes mccall and xagoraraki 2019 of the virus affiliated contigs less than 1 were identified as putative human viral pathogens due to their relatively small genomes and low abundance in water reservoirs human viral reads are known to constitute a small portion of metagenomic datasets mccall and xagoraraki 2019 to compensate for this a second stage of alignment was carried out on contigs identified as potential human viruses against a custom dataset of human viral proteins protein based alignments are effective at detecting remote homology and therefore allows for the discovery of rapidly evolving viral pathogens breitwieser et al 2018 blastx alignment facilitated the taxonomic classification of several different virus types including enteric respiratory bloodborne and vector borne viruses 4 1 classification of human viral pathogens in wastewater and clinical data comparison enteric and respiratory pathogens were the most frequently detected viruses in sewage samples enteric viruses are viruses that mainly infect the intestinal tract and can be transmitted via the fecal to oral route respiratory viruses generally replicate in the respiratory tract and spread via respiratory secretions picornaviridae obtained 4 of the 10 enteric viruses detected picornaviruses including hepatovirus enterovirus and cardiovirus are an important group of viruses that display a diverse range of human infections and clinical symptoms hepatovirus was detected in all samples with the highest relative abundance among enteric viruses hepatitis a virus hav is the type species of the hepatovirus genus and is the causative agent of hepatitis a lemon et al 2018 over 700 probable and confirmed cases of hepatitis a were reported in the service community during the 2017 2018 sampling years as a result of the 2016 multi state hepatitis a outbreak cdc 2020a mdhhs 2020b the prevalence of hav in sequenced samples suggest the use of wbe for routine surveillance of hepatitis a outbreaks in communities enteroviruses include enteric poliovirus coxsackievirus echovirus and respiratory rhinovirus enterovirus d68 pathogens wells and coyne 2019 enteroviruses cause a host of illnesses including common cold hand foot mouth disease poliomyelitis acute flaccid myelitis afm and aseptic meningitis wells and coyne 2019 in 2018 there was a spike in afm cases in the u s with michigan obtaining 5 cases in that same year cdc 2020b although enteroviruses are not the only viruses that cause afm there have been well established links dyda et al 2018 metagenomic analysis suggest the presence of polioviruses and other enterovirus species in wastewater samples during the 2017 2018 sampling period this indicates the potential circulation of clinically important enteroviruses in the environment and potential connection to interruptions in community health cardioviruses were believed to mainly infect rodents until 2007 when saffold virus safv a novel cardiovirus was identified in human stool since then safv has been identified in stool and nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients suffering from gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses since safv is commonly present in patients with coinfections further investigations are needed to determine virus pathology moreover safv has also been detected in cerebrospinal fluid csf of children but these findings were not consistent across studies even those focusing on patients with neurological disruptions tan et al 2017 nonetheless safv associations with neuropathogenesis is of importance given its close relation to theiler s murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev which causes neuropathogenesis in mice tan et al 2017 cardioviruses have been previously isolated from wastewater blinkova et al 2009 bonanno ferraro et al 2020 and were identified in 17 of 18 samples apart from picornaviruses mamastrovirus was the most prominent enteric virus genus detected in wastewater samples that primarily causes gastrointestinal illness bosch et al 2014 astroviruses are commonly detected in the environment during winter months bosch et al 2014 and suggest the prevalence of astrovirus infections within the community during the sampling period although there were a significant number of cases linked to gastrointestinal illness during the sampling year table a3 it is difficult to assess the burden of astroviruses within the community given the presence of other viruses promoting similar clinical manifestations like norovirus and sapovirus similar to enteric viruses respiratory viruses were abundant in metagenomic samples with orthopoxivirus obtaining the greatest number of hits among the 26 human viral pathogens identified orthopoxiviruses contain respiratory pathogens like variola virus and pathogens transmitted through vaccination zoonoses or close contact such as vaccinia virus buller and palumbo 1991 haller et al 2014 vaccinia virus vacv was the most prevalent species detected within the orthopoxivirus genus vacv has been used widely in human immunization against smallpox haller et al 2014 although routine vaccination against smallpox is no longer performed in the u s recommended vaccination is suggested for individuals who are at risk of exposure for example laboratory workers cdc 2017 the presence of vacv could be a result of viral shedding from recently vaccinated individuals silent community spread or environmental prevalence further investigation is needed to determine potential sources of vacv prevalence in the environment moreover betacoronavirus bcov was detected 8 of 18 wastewater samples bcovs are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans ranging from common cold to more severe diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 frequent mixing of human and animal reservoirs in densely populated areas facilitated outbreaks of viruses from this group in previous years including sars cov in 2003 kuiken et al 2003 mers cov in 2012 chan et al 2015 and sars cov 2 in 2019 lai et al 2020 along with respiratory ailments gastrointestinal illnesses have also been reported in patients with bcov infections lai et al 2020 albeit viral and clinical data investigations for this study were conducted prior to the covid 19 pandemic two possible novel coronavirus cases were reported in the service community during the 2018 sampling year additionally bcov are known to cause flu like symptoms and have therefore been linked to ili reported in the service community like gi the reporting of non specific diseases poses limitations when determining the burden of such viral pathogens within communities routine testing for bcovs in individuals displaying ili infections is necessary to prevent large scale outbreaks of known and novel coronaviruses several clinically important bloodborne pathogens were also detected in sequenced samples bloodborne pathogens are often transmitted through contact with infected blood bodily fluids or indirect contact with contaminated fomites despite the introduction of vaccines and effective medical interventions bloodborne pathogen hepatitis c virus hcv is the leading cause of liver disease worldwide chen and morgan 2006 hcv is the only species in the hepacivirus genus known to infect humans more than 9000 probable cases of hepatitis c were reported in the service community during the 2017 2018 sampling year table a3 despite the high number of disease cases hcv obtained a low detection rate 2 18 the primary route of transmission location of viral shedding duration of infection and presence of environmental inhibitors can affect the presence of hcv in wastewater nonetheless to our knowledge this is the first study to detect hepacivirus in untreated wastewater from an urban community along with hepacivirus human associated lentivirus contigs were detected in 5 of 18 untreated wastewater samples lentiviruses are a group of retroviruses that cause chronic and often deadly diseases in vertebrates and are known to have long incubation periods human immunodeficiency virus hiv 1 and 2 are the only viruses contained in this group that cause infections in humans hiv is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids hiv has accounted for more than 30 million deaths since 1981 with the highest burden in southern africa del rio 2017 the virus is said to have originated from non human primates through zoonosis and has since evolved to spread through human to human contact fox et al 2002 hiv infections are more persistent within the study area as compared other counties mdhhs 2018b other bloodborne pathogens include lymphocryptovirus erythroparvovirus and deltaretrovirus belonging to the herpesviridae parvoviridae and retroviridae families respectively lymphocryptovirus containing the epstein barrvirus ebv was the third most abundant genus in metagenomic samples ebv is most known for causing mononucleosis mono commonly called the kissing disease the virus is prevalent in 90 of the world s population and is commonly transmitted through saliva but can also be spread via blood tsao et al 2015 ebv infections are also known to cause epithelial cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma npc and ebv associated gastric cancers tsao et al 2015 erythroparvovirus b19v is associated with fifth disease which causes a rash primarily in children it is transmitted mainly by the respiratory route often causing outbreaks in schools and day care centers the virus can also be transmitted via blood and blood contaminated fomites qiu et al 2017 viruses within the deltaretrovirus genus are recognized for causing adult t cell leukemia lymphoma atl and can be transmitted mother to child sexual intercourse and blood transfusions ishitsuka and tamura 2014 no mandatory reporting was required for primary infections associated with the above mentioned viruses during the study period most samples contained contigs associated with vector borne genus alphavirus alphaviruses consists of mainly viruses transmitted through insect bites arthropod borne nearly all arthropod borne viruses are zoonotic weaver et al 2018 zoonotic viruses viruses that spread from animals to humans constitutes an important reservoir of viruses many clinically relevant vector borne viruses are transmitted via mosquitoes including zika west nile yellow fever eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev dengue and chikungunya alphavirus consists of several vector borne viruses including chikungunya virus chikv eeev and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev contigs assigned to human viral associated proteins in the alphavirus genus were detected in 16 of 18 samples eeev and veev were the primary species in 3 and 12 samples respectively eeev and veev cause encephalitis and neurological impairment mainly in equine species and humans and were first identified in the united states in 1933 and in venezuela in 1938 respectively armstrong and andreadis 2013 weaver et al 2004 although eeev infections in humans are rare compared to other clinically relevant vector borne infections it is the deadliest with a fatality rate of 35 75 armstrong and andreadis 2013 this contrasts with veev infections where fatalities rates of less than 1 have been reported weaver et al 2004 one case of eee was reported in the service area during the 2018 sampling year similarly the cdc reported a spiked in the number of eee cases in 2019 with 38 confirmed cases and 15 deaths as of december 2019 among the states affected were michigan with 10 of the 38 cases cdc 2019b re emerging infections of this nature are expected to rise in the future due to urbanization and climate change mcmichael 2004 this study highlights the potential utility of wastewater to be used as a surveillance tool for vector borne viruses to our knowledge no previous study has reported alphaviruses in raw wastewater samples potential exposure routes of alphaviruses into wastewater reservoirs could be facilitated through stormwater collection during rainfall events or viral shedding from infected individuals further studies are warranted to examine the fate of vector borne viruses in wastewater systems 4 2 screening of select human viral pathogens quantitative analysis of select viruses was performed to strengthen metagenomic findings and assess viral concentrations in collected samples hav was detected in all samples during metagenomic analysis with significantly high viral loads in wastewater as compared to other viruses tested the high occurrence of hav concentration in wastewater could signify outbreak conditions and critical locations with increased spatial sampling along with hav hadv sav nov gii and hhv 6 were quantified in wastewater samples with positive detection rates in metagenomic samples hhvs obtained the lowest concentrations among select viruses hhv 6 and 8 also referred to as roseolovirus and kaposi sarcoma ks associated herpesvirus respectively are non enteric viruses which could explain their low concentrations in sewage samples as compared to the other viruses screened hhv 8 was quantified in untreated wastewater using qpcr but went undetected in metagenomic analysis hhv 8 is commonly transmitted through saliva and is said to be more pervasive among men who have sex with men msm engels et al 2007 those with hiv are at greater risk for developing ks engels et al 2007 results here illustrate the utility of wbe to be used for enteric and non enteric viruses furthermore the integration of ngs with qpcr techniques provides a more sensitive application for low abundant viruses in wastewater systems 4 3 calicivirus detection in wastewater lastly a quantitative temporal comparison of nov gii and sav was carried out on wastewater samples to determine presence and burden of these viruses within the community nov and sav are genetically similar producing near identical clinical manifestations proving difficult to distinguish without testing nov is the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis among adults and children in the u s with gii being the responsible genotype in most outbreaks and pandemics glass et al 2009 nonetheless results here highlight the burden of sapovirus infections within the surrounding community sapovirus cases are not routinely reported in public health databases and therefore are linked to gastrointestinal illnesses in this study to assess the burden of nov and sav within the community one should considered the severity of illness incubation period duration of viral shedding and viral shedding load sapovirus disease symptoms tend to be milder than those produced by norovirus with a similar incubation period of 12 48 h lee et al 2013 oka et al 2015 milder symptoms cause by sav infection likely impacts the clinical presence of the virus as compared to norovirus infections like norovirus sapovirus infections result in post symptomatic viral shredding which can persist for several weeks prolonged shedding has been observed in those with compromised immune systems and the elderly in sav and nov infections glass et al 2009 oka et al 2015 such information can distort the immediate burden of nov and sav infections but can provide insight into other community health indicators these include prevalence of hiv other autoimmune infections and help to identify the outbreak population additionally viral shedding concentrations play a key role in loads captured in wastewater previous studies have observed viral shedding loads in feces up to 1011 genome copies g stool for sav oka et al 2015 and 1010 genome copies g stool for nov lee et al 2007 likewise previously reported detection of viral loads in raw wastewater reveal similar concentrations between sav and nov haramoto et al 2018 a recent study observed high concentrations of nov gii in wastewater following several nov gii outbreaks within the surrounding community iwai et al 2009 and higher concentration as compared to sav farkas et al 2018b although frequent wastewater sampling is required to confirm the burden of nov and sav infections within the community results here indicate a higher burden of sav infections during the time of sampling the lack of correlation between nov and sav concentrations and disease cases for norovirus and gastrointestinal illness may indicate interference from wastewater inhibitors rapid changes in viral concentrations due to the short incubation period or the presence of other viruses such as astrovirus adenovirus or rotavirus that may contribute more significantly to symptomatic illnesses that result in clinical cases 5 conclusion metagenomics detected the presence of enteric and non enteric viruses that cause clinically important diseases that were reported within the study area during the sampling year findings reveal evidence of re emerging vector borne viruses frequent and rigorous wastewater sampling along with integrative sample processing strategies can be employed to identify the etiological agent of non specific diseases and viruses that poses a significant burden among inhabitants results presented in this study suggests that wbe has the potential to advance the area of disease outbreak mitigation

17670,viruses are linked to a multitude of human illnesses and can disseminate widely in urbanized environments causing global adverse impacts on communities and healthcare infrastructures wastewater based epidemiology was employed using metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays to identify enteric and non enteric viruses collected from a large urban area for potential public health monitoring and outbreak analysis untreated wastewater samples were collected from november 2017 to february 2018 n 54 to evaluate the diversity of human viral pathogens in collected samples viruses were classified into virus types based on primary transmission routes and reviewed against viral associated diseases reported in the catchment area metagenomics detected the presence of viral pathogens that cause clinically significant diseases reported within the study area during the sampling year detected viruses belong to the adenoviridae astroviridae caliciviridae coronaviridae flaviviridae hepeviridae herpesviridae matonaviridae papillomaviridae parvoviridae picornaviridae poxviridae retroviridae and togaviridae families furthermore concentrations of adenovirus norovirus gii sapovirus hepatitis a virus human herpesvirus 6 and human herpesvirus 8 were measured in wastewater samples and compared to metagenomic findings to confirm detected viral genus hepatitis a virus obtained the greatest average viral load 1 86 107 genome copies l in wastewater samples compared to other viruses quantified using qpcr with a 100 detection rate in metagenomic samples average concentration of sapovirus 1 36 106 genome copies l was significantly greater than norovirus gii 2 94 104 genome copies l indicating a higher burden within the study area findings obtained from this study aid in evaluating the utility of wastewater based epidemiology for identification and routine monitoring of various viruses in large communities this methodology has the potential to improve public health responses to large scale outbreaks and viral pandemics graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater based epidemiology public health viral diseases metagenomics virus diversity qpcr 1 introduction viruses are linked to a host of illness related to respiratory infections diarrheal illness autoimmune diseases meningitis hepatitis cancer viral hemorrhagic fevers and others infections often disseminate quickly in urbanized regions due to densely populated areas and could reach thousands of inhabitants before health care facilities are notified since viruses do not replicate outside of a host and can remain stable in the environment for significant periods of time wastewater based epidemiology wbe can be used to capture a near real time picture of the viral disease burden within a community viruses can enter waste streams through multiple routes including stool urine skin saliva and blood thus wastewater has the potential to assess the burden of a variety of viruses it is well known that confirmed enteric viruses such as rotaviruses adenoviruses enteroviruses hepatitis a and e viruses caliciviruses and others can be detected in wastewater while it is logical to investigate the applicability of enteric viruses to wbe it is also important to demonstrate the potential for other viruses to fit into this methodology indeed it has been shown that multiple non enteric viruses such as coronaviruses herpesviruses influenza zika west nile yellow fever dengue and others have been detected in stool and urine samples or wastewater barzon et al 2013 gourinat et al 2015 gundy et al 2009 heijnen and medema 2011 hirayama et al 2012 hirose et al 2016 o brien and xagoraraki 2019 poloni et al 2010 tonry et al 2005 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 these observations confirm that the concept of wastewater based epidemiology can be applied to a wide range of viruses beyond the confirmed enteric viruses enteric viruses are commonly discovered in untreated wastewater farkas et al 2018a ng et al 2012 victoria et al 2014 and recent studies have confirmed corresponding disease prevalence in the surrounding community bisseux et al 2018 particularly picornaviruses constitute an important group of enteric viruses that cause a host of illnesses including diseases of the central nervous systems respiratory tract liver and gastrointestinal tract moreover caliciviruses are common causes of diarrheal illnesses which were among the top causes of death worldwide in 2017 gbd 2017 causes of death collaborators 2018 with that noroviruses are among the leading causes of gastroenteritis and a significant agent in global viral outbreak of acute gastroenteritis glass et al 2009 hall et al 2013 routine monitoring of picornaviruses and caliciviruses in wastewater can provide insight into the transmission of clinically important diseases prevent widespread outbreaks and reduce deaths linked to such viruses molecular and sequencing approaches provide qualitative and quantitative insights into wastewater environments mccall and xagoraraki 2019 metagenomics allows for the screening of a large panel of viruses in environmental systems that would otherwise prove time consuming using traditional laboratory techniques metagenomics has identified co infecting organisms during outbreak conditions li et al 2019 novel pathogens cantalupo et al 2011 and viral compositions in complex matrices fancello et al 2013 miranda et al 2016 o brien et al 2017 despite its breakthroughs the sensitivity of metagenomics to identify vial pathogens is confounded by the presence of bacteria sequencing limitations and errors imposed by sequence analysis and alignment tools for these reasons sensitive pcr techniques are commonly used to corroborate results obtained from metagenomic analysis here metagenomic analysis was utilized to assess the diversity of human viral pathogens in untreated wastewater collected from a large urban center over the course of four months detected viral pathogens were further classified according to virus type and compared with health data with an emphasis on picornaviruses from the associated community to evaluate the application of wastewater based epidemiology for identification of endemic disease and potential upcoming viral outbreaks quantitative pcr and rt qpcr assays were performed on select viruses commonly present in sewage to corroborate results obtained through metagenomic approaches finally norovirus and sapovirus were compared in wastewater to assess the burden of caliciviruses on gastrointestinal illness cases reported in the community 2 methods 2 1 study area and wastewater sample collection wastewater surveillance was conducted at the water resource recovery facility wrrf located in detroit michigan the detroit wrrf is the largest single site wastewater treatment plant in the u s and treats wastewater from an estimated 3 million inhabitants with an average daily flow of 650 mgd glwa 2018 it services the three largest counties by population in michigan these are wayne oakland and macomb counties jones et al 2015 the wrrf receives wastewater from its service municipalities via three main interceptors north interceptor east arm ni ea detroit river interceptor dri and oakwood northwest wayne county interceptor o nwi these interceptors are large sewers that collect and transports wastewater from smaller sewers to the wrrf untreated wastewater samples were collected at the wrrf from sampling points located at each of the three interceptors approximately bi weekly between november 2017 and february 2018 n 54 viruses were isolated from untreated wastewater using electropositive nanoceram column filters following the epa s virus adsorption elution protocol u s epa 2001 samples were collected in triplicates for each interceptor per sampling date where wastewater was passed through a column filter until fouling occurred average filtered sample volumes range between 24 and 44 l per interceptor each interceptor was sampled with its own filter house tubing and vacuum pump to minimize cross contamination virus filters were immediately stored on ice and transported to the environmental virology laboratory at michigan state university msu and stored in 20 c until further processing 2 2 sample processing and virus isolation following wastewater sampling nanoceram cartridge filters were eluted within 24 h with 1 5 w v beef extract 0 05 m glycine ph 9 5 according to the epa s protocol u s epa 2001 in short filters were eluted with 1 l of beef extract for a total of 2 min the ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 0 1 and flocculated for 30 min before centrifugation at 2500g for 15 min at 4 c supernatant was discarded and pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of 0 15 m sodium phosphate ph 9 0 9 5 followed by a second round of centrifugation carried out at 7000 g for 10 min at 4 c the supernatant was neutralized ph 7 25 and subjected to filtration using to 0 45 μm and 0 22 μm syringe filters to eliminate bacterial contamination extraction of nucleic acid was performed on 140 μl of purified virus concentrate using the qiaamp viral rna mini kit qiagen following the manufacturer s protocol and eluted in 80 μl of elution buffer nucleic acid was stored at 80 c until further processing 2 3 metagenomic analysis 2 3 1 sampling processing and random amplification to explore human virus diversity between sampling locations and dates purified nucleic acid from each biological replicate was pooled together for a total of 18 samples these samples represent genetic material from all three interceptors during each of the six sampling dates nucleic acid from each sample was reverse transcribed and subjected to random amplification as previously described wang et al 2003 to evaluate both rna and dna viruses 2 3 2 next generation sequence processing eighteen samples of viral cdna were sent to the research technology support facility genomics core at michigan state university for whole genome shotgun sequencing wgs the illumina truseq nano dna library preparation kit was used for all cdna samples library preparation was performed on a perkinelmer sciclone g3 robot according to the manufacturer s recommendations this was followed by sequencing on an illumina hiseq4000 platform generating 150 bp paired end reads 2 3 3 sequence analysis and taxonomic annotation sequencing reads generated from wgs were processed on a unix system through the msu high performance computing center hpcc raw sequences were analyzed for quality using fastqc a quality control tool for sequencing data andrews 2010 sequencing adapters and reads with an average quality score below 20 were removed using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 trimmed reads were assembled with idba ud a short read de novo sequence aligner for metagenomic data reads were assembled into contigs using an iterative k mer approach with k mer sizes ranging between 40 and 120 in increments of 10 the remaining parameters were run at default conditions human virus genomes are relatively small and less abundant in wastewater and therefore may be masked by more dominant bacteria or plant virus genomes it can also be a challenge for reference databases to maintain updated sequence information for viruses possessing high mutation rates particularly rna viruses leaving room for false negatives and a large percentage of unaffiliated contigs mccall and xagoraraki 2019 to compensate for some of these limitations an optimized multi alignment approach was used to improve alignment and annotation of human viral contigs first contigs were aligned against the viral refseq database using tblastx with an e value of 10 3 this approach has been known to increase human viral discovery in metagenomic datasets bibby et al 2011 aligned contigs were assigned to the lowest common ancestor lca according to the ncbi s taxonomy with megan v 6 15 0 the top 10 percent of blast alignments with a minimum bit score of 50 and contig coverage of at least 80 were considered in taxonomic analysis the remaining parameters were run at default conditions reads assigned to virus families containing known human pathogens were extracted and aligned with blastx with an e value of 10 5 against a custom human virus database containing 5979 human viral proteins in swiss prot database boeckmann et al 2003 these sequences represented all human viral proteins in the swiss prot database at the time of retrieval september 2019 target specific databases can reduce ambiguity and improve pathogens discovery furthermore protein searches are more effective at capturing remote homology as compared to nucleotide searches breitwieser et al 2018 these optimized detection approaches are important for human viral pathogens which are often difficult to detect in environmental samples due to their low abundance small genomes and high mutation rates to further increase the potential for pathogen discovery and minimize false negatives contigs assigned to the virus root were also aligned against the swiss prot database this method was more effective at capturing select viruses confirmed through qpcr and rt qpcr compared to contigs solely extracted from human viral families data not shown fig 1 displays the metagenomics workflow for human virus identification in wastewater samples 2 4 quantification of select viruses quantitative pcr or rt qpcr was performed on six viruses namely sapovirus sav norovirus nov gii human adenovirus hadv 40 and 41 hepatitis a virus hav and human herpesvirus 6 hhv 6 and 8 hhv 8 2 4 1 preparation of standard curves hav and hadv were obtained from atcc for preparation of standard controls nucleic acid was extracted from each virus isolate as detailed in the previous section and transformed into one shot top10 chemically competent escherichia coli cells using the topo cloning kit invitrogen following the manufacturer s protocol plasmid dna containing cloned hav and hadv was extracted and quantified according to a previous method munir et al 2011 the protocol detailed in step two of the subsequent section was utilized to prepare a standard curve with 10 fold serial dilutions of positive hav and hadv controls quantitative synthetic nov gii rna sav rna hhv 6 dna and hhv 8 dna was obtained from atcc rna or dna was diluted 10 fold and analyzed as described in the following section standard curves for hav hadv nov gii sav hhv 6 and hhv 8 obtained r squared values of 99 and slopes of 3 61 3 66 3 82 3 35 3 88 and 3 59 respectively the limit of detection lod for each virus was determined by the lowest point on the standard curve or by the lowest dilution with a 95 positive detection rate in at least 10 replicates burns and valdivia 2008 hav hadv nov sav and hhvs obtained a lod of 101 genome copies ul 2 4 2 qpcr and rt qpcr quantitative pcr or rt qpcr assays were used to establish the concentration of hav hadv nov gii sav hhv 6 and hhv 8 in wastewater samples all assays were performed in triplicates on a mastercycler ep realplex2 eppendorf in 96 well optical plates amplification of cdna was mediated using lightcycler 480 probes master roche at a concentration of 1 in all reactions sterile nuclease free water was used to meet volume requirements in all reactions primers and probes used are shown in table a1 hav and sav was quantified using a two step rt qpcr based on a previously described methods jothikumar et al 2005 oka et al 2006 briefly viral rna was reverse transcribed using iscript rt qpcr supermix bio rad according to the manufacturer s protocol for hav 5 μl of cdna negative control or positive control was transferred to a 15 μl reaction mix containing hav primers and taqman probe reactions were performed with the following conditions 95 c for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s 55 c for 20 s and 72 c for 15 s sav quantification was carried out in a 25 μl reaction containing each primer and probe reactions were performed with the following conditions 95 c for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 94 c for 15 s 62 c for 1 min and 72 c for 15 s norovirus gii was quantified using a one step rt qpcr as previously described le guyader et al 2009 in short the rt qpcr was carried out in a 25 μl reaction mixture containing primers and probe 2 μl of iscript rt qpcr supermix and 5 μl of viral rna negative control or positive control reactions were performed with the following conditions reverse transcription at 25 c for 5 min 46 c for 20 min and 95 c for 1 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 1 min 65 c for 1 min dna viruses hadv hhv 6 and hhv 8 were quantified according to previously established methods gautheret dejean et al 2002 lallemand et al 2000 xagoraraki et al 2007 hadv and hhvs were qualified in 20 μl reactions containing 5 μl of dna or standard control denaturation was carried out at 95 c for 15 min for all dna viruses followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 15 s 60 c for 30 s and 72 c for 10 s for hadv 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 1 min for hhv 6 and 45 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 65 c for 1 min for hhv 8 2 5 health data collection disease data for all reportable viral diseases for each service county was obtained from the michigan department of health and human services mdhhs probable and confirmed case counts were extracted from the michigan disease and surveillance system mdss weekly surveillance reports wsr the mdss is a communicable disease reporting system used to facilitate coordination and sharing of disease surveillance data among multiple shareholders including healthcare providers and medical laboratories mdhhs 2020a each weekly surveillance report accounts for disease cases reported from sunday saturday of the corresponding week it is important to note that the wsr uses gastrointestinal illness gi and influenza like illness ili to represent any disease displaying symptoms of this nature the etiological agent of the disease is unspecified but could be of viral bacterial or parasitic origin ili was defined according to the u s influenza surveillance system cdc 2019a gi is defined as symptoms related to diarrhea and or vomiting mdhhs 2018a diseases reported in wsrs were considered if is the primary disease of viruses detected in metagenomic samples and if there was at least one case of that disease reported within macomb oakland or wayne counties during the sampling year 2017 2018 2 6 statistical and cluster analysis cluster analysis was performed using the bray curtis dissimilarity index in megan on metagenomic samples at the family level within the swiss prot taxonomic analysis to determine similarity between samples a one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd post hoc tests were used to investigate significance between mean concentrations of select viruses in wastewater samples finally spearman s correlation analysis was used to determine significant associations between select caliciviruses and the number of norovirus and gi reported cases within the service community all statistical analyses were performed in r r core team 2019 3 results illumina sequencing was performed on 18 untreated wastewater samples collected from detroit s wrrf from november 2017 to february 2018 a total of 624 4 million reads were subject to quality trimming resulting in 595 2 million reads reads were assembled and aligned using tblastx against the viral refseq database the proportion of contigs assigned to viral taxonomic groups range between 72 and 83 table a2 as expected viruses infecting prokaryotes constituted the greatest proportion of viral reads table 1 3 1 classification of human viral pathogens in wastewater putative human viral contigs were extracted via megan taxonomic bins and aligned against all human viral proteins in the swiss prot database using blastx an average of approximately 0 18 0 05 0 78 of viral affiliated contigs were aligned to human viral proteins fourteen different human viral families were identified with the greatest number of contigs largely assigned to poxviridae herpesviridae and picornaviridae fig 2 of the fourteen families nine were classified at ssrna viruses and the remaining five as dna viruses fig 3 shows the proportion of ssrna and dna viral families in each sample comparable relative abundances of ssrna and dna viruses were observed during the 14 dec 19 jan and 2 feb sampling dates with dna viruses dominating sequenced samples during the remaining three sampling dates bray curtis dissimilarity analysis was used to determine the similarity between samples at the family taxonomic level after alignment against human viral protein sequences according to the bray curtis analysis there were more similarities within sampling dates rather than sampling locations with samples collected during three consecutive sampling dates 14 dec 19 jan and 2 feb clustering together fig 3 poxviridae parvoviridae and herpesviridae families were the most influential viral families when discriminating between samples data not shown of the 14 human viral families identified contigs were assigned to 26 human virus genera with dna viruses orthopoxivirus simplex viruses and lymphocrytovirus obtaining the greatest number of hits alphavirus a ssrna virus containing vector borne viruses was the fourth most abundant genus fig 4 a the most frequently detected virus type was enteric and respiratory followed by other bloodborne and vector borne fig 4b table 2 four of ten enteric viruses detected belong to the picornaviridae family namely hepatovirus enterovirus parechovirus and cardiovirus fig 5 illustrates the temporal and spatial relative abundance of picornaviruses during the study period proteins associated with hepatovirus mamastrovius and enterovirus obtained the greatest number of assigned contigs within the enteric virus group fig 4a within the mamastrovirus genus classic human astroviruses hastv were detected with 90 homology to the reference sequence in all positive samples 15 18 enteroviruses containing respiratory and enteric pathogens revealed human coxsackievirus and poliovirus species detected in positive samples with 80 identity to the reference gene orthopoxivirus constituted the greatest number of hits within the respiratory group with vaccinia virus being the most frequently identified species additionally metagenomic analysis detected the presence of respiratory pathogen betacoronavirus in 8 of the 18 collected samples with human coronavirus hku1 being the primary species detected with 60 percent identity fig 4a other enteric and respiratory viruses detected include mastadenovirus sapovirus norovirus orthohepevirus varicellovirus rubivirus bocaparvovirus roseolovirus and erythroparvovirus table 2 viruses solely grouped in the other category consists of viruses transmitted via skin saliva or other bodily fluids such as simplex virus parapoxvirus and alphapapillomavirus furthermore alphavirus was the only vector borne virus discovered in metagenomic samples with a detection rate of 89 important bloodborne viruses hepacivirus lentivirus deltaretrovirus and lymphocryptovirus were also discovered in metagenomic samples fig 4 table 2 3 2 comparison of human viruses and clinical data weekly surveillance reports from the mdhhs mdss were utilized to evaluate the potential association between the 26 human viruses detected in metagenomic samples and the presence of primary associated diseases within the surrounding community during the study period mastadenovirus mamastrovirus sapovirus bocaparvovirus cardiovirus enterovirus and parechovirus were linked to solely non specific diseases including flu like gastrointestinal illnesses aseptic meningitis and acute flaccid myelitis norovirus betacoronavirus and rubivirus were related to at least one non specific illnesses along with virus specific diseases norovirus novel coronavirus and rubella respectively virus specific diseases for hepacivirus orthohepevirus varicellovirus hepatovirus lentivirus and alphavirus were present in wsrs during the sampling year during the time of data collection mandatory reporting was not required for diseases related to several viruses including parapoxvirus deltaretrovirus gammaretrovirus and alphapapillomavirus table 2 3 3 quantitative screening for select human viral pathogens to confirm results obtained from metagenomic analysis select viruses were quantified in wastewater samples namely sav nov gii hadv 40 41 hav hhv 6 and hhv 8 hav nov hadv and hhv 8 were quantified in all samples and obtained positive detection rate of 100 50 22 and 0 in metagenomic samples respectively sav and hhv 6 were quantified in 94 and 39 of the 18 samples considered with a 28 and 83 detection in sequenced samples all select viruses except hhv 6 were detected during each sampling date using qpcr or rt qpcr fig 6 there were significant differences in average concentrations for some viruses where hav hadv nov p 0 0001 mean sav concentrations were significantly less than hav p 0 0001 and greater than nov p 0 0001 there was no significant difference between sav and hadv p 0 05 concentrations of hhv 6 and hhv 8 were significantly lower than hav hadv sav and nov p 0 0001 there was no significant difference between mean concentrations of hhv 6 and hhv 8 p 0 05 in collected samples 3 4 calicivirus detection in wastewater a temporal investigation of nov gii and sav concentrations in wastewater samples was carried out to assess the potential burden of these viruses and their contribution to gastrointestinal illnesses within the service community average concentrations of sav and nov gii were 1 36 106 and 2 94 104 genome copies l respectively the highest average concentration for both viruses occurred during the 14 dec sampling date fig 7 however according to spearman s correlation analysis there was no significant association between the number of reported gi cases and concentrations of nov gii and sav per sampling week table 3 4 discussion a wbe study for viral diseases was carried out on wastewater samples collected from a large urban municipal wastewater treatment facility samples were subjected to metagenomic analysis and qpcr rt qpcr assays to identify human viral pathogens circulating within the community more than half of all aligned contigs were assigned to viral taxonomic groups the use of virus enrichment techniques has been known to decrease the presence of non targeted organisms such as bacteria and improve virus detection within metagenomes mccall and xagoraraki 2019 of the virus affiliated contigs less than 1 were identified as putative human viral pathogens due to their relatively small genomes and low abundance in water reservoirs human viral reads are known to constitute a small portion of metagenomic datasets mccall and xagoraraki 2019 to compensate for this a second stage of alignment was carried out on contigs identified as potential human viruses against a custom dataset of human viral proteins protein based alignments are effective at detecting remote homology and therefore allows for the discovery of rapidly evolving viral pathogens breitwieser et al 2018 blastx alignment facilitated the taxonomic classification of several different virus types including enteric respiratory bloodborne and vector borne viruses 4 1 classification of human viral pathogens in wastewater and clinical data comparison enteric and respiratory pathogens were the most frequently detected viruses in sewage samples enteric viruses are viruses that mainly infect the intestinal tract and can be transmitted via the fecal to oral route respiratory viruses generally replicate in the respiratory tract and spread via respiratory secretions picornaviridae obtained 4 of the 10 enteric viruses detected picornaviruses including hepatovirus enterovirus and cardiovirus are an important group of viruses that display a diverse range of human infections and clinical symptoms hepatovirus was detected in all samples with the highest relative abundance among enteric viruses hepatitis a virus hav is the type species of the hepatovirus genus and is the causative agent of hepatitis a lemon et al 2018 over 700 probable and confirmed cases of hepatitis a were reported in the service community during the 2017 2018 sampling years as a result of the 2016 multi state hepatitis a outbreak cdc 2020a mdhhs 2020b the prevalence of hav in sequenced samples suggest the use of wbe for routine surveillance of hepatitis a outbreaks in communities enteroviruses include enteric poliovirus coxsackievirus echovirus and respiratory rhinovirus enterovirus d68 pathogens wells and coyne 2019 enteroviruses cause a host of illnesses including common cold hand foot mouth disease poliomyelitis acute flaccid myelitis afm and aseptic meningitis wells and coyne 2019 in 2018 there was a spike in afm cases in the u s with michigan obtaining 5 cases in that same year cdc 2020b although enteroviruses are not the only viruses that cause afm there have been well established links dyda et al 2018 metagenomic analysis suggest the presence of polioviruses and other enterovirus species in wastewater samples during the 2017 2018 sampling period this indicates the potential circulation of clinically important enteroviruses in the environment and potential connection to interruptions in community health cardioviruses were believed to mainly infect rodents until 2007 when saffold virus safv a novel cardiovirus was identified in human stool since then safv has been identified in stool and nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients suffering from gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses since safv is commonly present in patients with coinfections further investigations are needed to determine virus pathology moreover safv has also been detected in cerebrospinal fluid csf of children but these findings were not consistent across studies even those focusing on patients with neurological disruptions tan et al 2017 nonetheless safv associations with neuropathogenesis is of importance given its close relation to theiler s murine encephalomyelitis virus tmev which causes neuropathogenesis in mice tan et al 2017 cardioviruses have been previously isolated from wastewater blinkova et al 2009 bonanno ferraro et al 2020 and were identified in 17 of 18 samples apart from picornaviruses mamastrovirus was the most prominent enteric virus genus detected in wastewater samples that primarily causes gastrointestinal illness bosch et al 2014 astroviruses are commonly detected in the environment during winter months bosch et al 2014 and suggest the prevalence of astrovirus infections within the community during the sampling period although there were a significant number of cases linked to gastrointestinal illness during the sampling year table a3 it is difficult to assess the burden of astroviruses within the community given the presence of other viruses promoting similar clinical manifestations like norovirus and sapovirus similar to enteric viruses respiratory viruses were abundant in metagenomic samples with orthopoxivirus obtaining the greatest number of hits among the 26 human viral pathogens identified orthopoxiviruses contain respiratory pathogens like variola virus and pathogens transmitted through vaccination zoonoses or close contact such as vaccinia virus buller and palumbo 1991 haller et al 2014 vaccinia virus vacv was the most prevalent species detected within the orthopoxivirus genus vacv has been used widely in human immunization against smallpox haller et al 2014 although routine vaccination against smallpox is no longer performed in the u s recommended vaccination is suggested for individuals who are at risk of exposure for example laboratory workers cdc 2017 the presence of vacv could be a result of viral shedding from recently vaccinated individuals silent community spread or environmental prevalence further investigation is needed to determine potential sources of vacv prevalence in the environment moreover betacoronavirus bcov was detected 8 of 18 wastewater samples bcovs are known to cause respiratory illnesses in humans ranging from common cold to more severe diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 frequent mixing of human and animal reservoirs in densely populated areas facilitated outbreaks of viruses from this group in previous years including sars cov in 2003 kuiken et al 2003 mers cov in 2012 chan et al 2015 and sars cov 2 in 2019 lai et al 2020 along with respiratory ailments gastrointestinal illnesses have also been reported in patients with bcov infections lai et al 2020 albeit viral and clinical data investigations for this study were conducted prior to the covid 19 pandemic two possible novel coronavirus cases were reported in the service community during the 2018 sampling year additionally bcov are known to cause flu like symptoms and have therefore been linked to ili reported in the service community like gi the reporting of non specific diseases poses limitations when determining the burden of such viral pathogens within communities routine testing for bcovs in individuals displaying ili infections is necessary to prevent large scale outbreaks of known and novel coronaviruses several clinically important bloodborne pathogens were also detected in sequenced samples bloodborne pathogens are often transmitted through contact with infected blood bodily fluids or indirect contact with contaminated fomites despite the introduction of vaccines and effective medical interventions bloodborne pathogen hepatitis c virus hcv is the leading cause of liver disease worldwide chen and morgan 2006 hcv is the only species in the hepacivirus genus known to infect humans more than 9000 probable cases of hepatitis c were reported in the service community during the 2017 2018 sampling year table a3 despite the high number of disease cases hcv obtained a low detection rate 2 18 the primary route of transmission location of viral shedding duration of infection and presence of environmental inhibitors can affect the presence of hcv in wastewater nonetheless to our knowledge this is the first study to detect hepacivirus in untreated wastewater from an urban community along with hepacivirus human associated lentivirus contigs were detected in 5 of 18 untreated wastewater samples lentiviruses are a group of retroviruses that cause chronic and often deadly diseases in vertebrates and are known to have long incubation periods human immunodeficiency virus hiv 1 and 2 are the only viruses contained in this group that cause infections in humans hiv is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids hiv has accounted for more than 30 million deaths since 1981 with the highest burden in southern africa del rio 2017 the virus is said to have originated from non human primates through zoonosis and has since evolved to spread through human to human contact fox et al 2002 hiv infections are more persistent within the study area as compared other counties mdhhs 2018b other bloodborne pathogens include lymphocryptovirus erythroparvovirus and deltaretrovirus belonging to the herpesviridae parvoviridae and retroviridae families respectively lymphocryptovirus containing the epstein barrvirus ebv was the third most abundant genus in metagenomic samples ebv is most known for causing mononucleosis mono commonly called the kissing disease the virus is prevalent in 90 of the world s population and is commonly transmitted through saliva but can also be spread via blood tsao et al 2015 ebv infections are also known to cause epithelial cancers such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma npc and ebv associated gastric cancers tsao et al 2015 erythroparvovirus b19v is associated with fifth disease which causes a rash primarily in children it is transmitted mainly by the respiratory route often causing outbreaks in schools and day care centers the virus can also be transmitted via blood and blood contaminated fomites qiu et al 2017 viruses within the deltaretrovirus genus are recognized for causing adult t cell leukemia lymphoma atl and can be transmitted mother to child sexual intercourse and blood transfusions ishitsuka and tamura 2014 no mandatory reporting was required for primary infections associated with the above mentioned viruses during the study period most samples contained contigs associated with vector borne genus alphavirus alphaviruses consists of mainly viruses transmitted through insect bites arthropod borne nearly all arthropod borne viruses are zoonotic weaver et al 2018 zoonotic viruses viruses that spread from animals to humans constitutes an important reservoir of viruses many clinically relevant vector borne viruses are transmitted via mosquitoes including zika west nile yellow fever eastern equine encephalitis virus eeev dengue and chikungunya alphavirus consists of several vector borne viruses including chikungunya virus chikv eeev and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev contigs assigned to human viral associated proteins in the alphavirus genus were detected in 16 of 18 samples eeev and veev were the primary species in 3 and 12 samples respectively eeev and veev cause encephalitis and neurological impairment mainly in equine species and humans and were first identified in the united states in 1933 and in venezuela in 1938 respectively armstrong and andreadis 2013 weaver et al 2004 although eeev infections in humans are rare compared to other clinically relevant vector borne infections it is the deadliest with a fatality rate of 35 75 armstrong and andreadis 2013 this contrasts with veev infections where fatalities rates of less than 1 have been reported weaver et al 2004 one case of eee was reported in the service area during the 2018 sampling year similarly the cdc reported a spiked in the number of eee cases in 2019 with 38 confirmed cases and 15 deaths as of december 2019 among the states affected were michigan with 10 of the 38 cases cdc 2019b re emerging infections of this nature are expected to rise in the future due to urbanization and climate change mcmichael 2004 this study highlights the potential utility of wastewater to be used as a surveillance tool for vector borne viruses to our knowledge no previous study has reported alphaviruses in raw wastewater samples potential exposure routes of alphaviruses into wastewater reservoirs could be facilitated through stormwater collection during rainfall events or viral shedding from infected individuals further studies are warranted to examine the fate of vector borne viruses in wastewater systems 4 2 screening of select human viral pathogens quantitative analysis of select viruses was performed to strengthen metagenomic findings and assess viral concentrations in collected samples hav was detected in all samples during metagenomic analysis with significantly high viral loads in wastewater as compared to other viruses tested the high occurrence of hav concentration in wastewater could signify outbreak conditions and critical locations with increased spatial sampling along with hav hadv sav nov gii and hhv 6 were quantified in wastewater samples with positive detection rates in metagenomic samples hhvs obtained the lowest concentrations among select viruses hhv 6 and 8 also referred to as roseolovirus and kaposi sarcoma ks associated herpesvirus respectively are non enteric viruses which could explain their low concentrations in sewage samples as compared to the other viruses screened hhv 8 was quantified in untreated wastewater using qpcr but went undetected in metagenomic analysis hhv 8 is commonly transmitted through saliva and is said to be more pervasive among men who have sex with men msm engels et al 2007 those with hiv are at greater risk for developing ks engels et al 2007 results here illustrate the utility of wbe to be used for enteric and non enteric viruses furthermore the integration of ngs with qpcr techniques provides a more sensitive application for low abundant viruses in wastewater systems 4 3 calicivirus detection in wastewater lastly a quantitative temporal comparison of nov gii and sav was carried out on wastewater samples to determine presence and burden of these viruses within the community nov and sav are genetically similar producing near identical clinical manifestations proving difficult to distinguish without testing nov is the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis among adults and children in the u s with gii being the responsible genotype in most outbreaks and pandemics glass et al 2009 nonetheless results here highlight the burden of sapovirus infections within the surrounding community sapovirus cases are not routinely reported in public health databases and therefore are linked to gastrointestinal illnesses in this study to assess the burden of nov and sav within the community one should considered the severity of illness incubation period duration of viral shedding and viral shedding load sapovirus disease symptoms tend to be milder than those produced by norovirus with a similar incubation period of 12 48 h lee et al 2013 oka et al 2015 milder symptoms cause by sav infection likely impacts the clinical presence of the virus as compared to norovirus infections like norovirus sapovirus infections result in post symptomatic viral shredding which can persist for several weeks prolonged shedding has been observed in those with compromised immune systems and the elderly in sav and nov infections glass et al 2009 oka et al 2015 such information can distort the immediate burden of nov and sav infections but can provide insight into other community health indicators these include prevalence of hiv other autoimmune infections and help to identify the outbreak population additionally viral shedding concentrations play a key role in loads captured in wastewater previous studies have observed viral shedding loads in feces up to 1011 genome copies g stool for sav oka et al 2015 and 1010 genome copies g stool for nov lee et al 2007 likewise previously reported detection of viral loads in raw wastewater reveal similar concentrations between sav and nov haramoto et al 2018 a recent study observed high concentrations of nov gii in wastewater following several nov gii outbreaks within the surrounding community iwai et al 2009 and higher concentration as compared to sav farkas et al 2018b although frequent wastewater sampling is required to confirm the burden of nov and sav infections within the community results here indicate a higher burden of sav infections during the time of sampling the lack of correlation between nov and sav concentrations and disease cases for norovirus and gastrointestinal illness may indicate interference from wastewater inhibitors rapid changes in viral concentrations due to the short incubation period or the presence of other viruses such as astrovirus adenovirus or rotavirus that may contribute more significantly to symptomatic illnesses that result in clinical cases 5 conclusion metagenomics detected the presence of enteric and non enteric viruses that cause clinically important diseases that were reported within the study area during the sampling year findings reveal evidence of re emerging vector borne viruses frequent and rigorous wastewater sampling along with integrative sample processing strategies can be employed to identify the etiological agent of non specific diseases and viruses that poses a significant burden among inhabitants results presented in this study suggests that wbe has the potential to advance the area of disease outbreak mitigation

17671,traditional fenton or fenton like oxidation has been widely studied for waste activated sludge dewaterability however the narrow ph range 2 0 4 0 and the instabilities of fe2 and h2o2 have hindered its commercial application owing to the high alkalinity of anaerobic digestion ad sludge traditional fenton or fenton like oxidation is economically unfeasible for its dewatering in this study we successfully demonstrated a novel and feasible method that used nitrilotriacetic acid nta fe0 combined with cao2 nta fe0 cao2 at near neutral ph 6 0 a slight ph adjustment in which capillary suction time ratio cst0 cst and centrifuged weight reduction cwr improved by 6 folds and 42 98 0 37 respectively under the optimal conditions the presence of nta accelerated the fe0 corrosion fe2 stability and turnover between fe2 and fe3 as such fe0 could effectively catalyze cao2 to produce hydroxyl radicals oh under near neutral conditions accordingly various molecular weight hydrophilic compounds in different extracellular polymeric substances fractions were significantly reduced after treatment the hydrophilic functional groups especially protein molecules were largely reduced consequently the viscosity of sludge and particle size effectively decreased while the release of bound water surface charge flocculation and flowability of sludge were improved the cost benefit analysis further demonstrated the nta fe0 cao2 treatment has high reusability and stability and is also more economical over the fecl3 cao and fenton s reagent cao treatments in summary the nta fe0 cao2 process is a cost effective and practically feasible technology for improving ad sludge dewaterability graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion sludge dewaterability nta fe0 cao2 critical organic compounds near neutral ph 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad process has been widely implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for energy recovery and sludge reduction appels et al 2008 wacławek et al 2016 however energy consumption occurs in the downstream sludge dewatering process the energy cost of dewatering process would be up to 20 of a wwtp s total energy cost panepinto et al 2016 generally the dewaterability of ad sludge is worse than waste activated sludge was due to the large amount of refractory and sticky biopolymers in ad sludge maqbool et al 2019 thus improving ad sludge dewaterability is essential in order to minimize the operational cost for sludge disposal fenton oxidation treatment a mixture of fe2 and h2o2 as an advanced oxidation process aop has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the was dewaterability zhang et al 2015 masihi and gholikandi 2018 however acidic condition ph 4 0 is a prerequisite for such process acidification and the following neutralization would complicate the process and further increase the operational cost masihi and gholikandi 2018 given the high alkalinity in ad sludge employing traditional fenton oxidation treatment to condition ad sludge may not be economically feasible cho et al 2014 as such it is necessary to optimize modify the fenton oxidation treatment to make it practicable for ad sludge dewatering with a slight ph adjustment or even without ph adjustment implementing the fenton oxidation treatment with chelating agents e g ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or nitrilotriacetic acid nta could be a promising approach to enhance the production of oxidizing radicals since they can chelate iron and preserve its free form conditions amina et al 2018 reported that the addition of edta could effectively promote the fenton like reaction to degrade sulfamethoxazole in wastewater at neutral ph garcía fernández et al 2019 found that edds fenton process could improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh to disinfect e faecalis in wastewater under neutral conditions however both edta and edds are weak biodegradable chelating agents which could have negative impacts on the subsequent treatment likely limiting its broad application de luca et al 2014 compared to edds and edta nta has higher biodegradability and stronger reduction ability it is a safer chelating agent which seems to be a better choice to efficiently enhance fenton or fenton like reactions at near neutral conditions to degrade micropollutants from municipal wastewater jin et al 2018 pan et al 2019 however it still remains unknown if nta could improve the performance of fenton or fenton like systems used for sludge conditioning since sludge is far more complex than contaminated water and nta may interact with metal irons in the sludge vogel and adam 2011 thus reducing its chelating effect on iron in light of the instabilities of h2o2 and fe2 wang et al 2019 directly dosing h2o2 and fe2 to induce fenton reaction in sludge treatment may be hard to control and achieve desired performance the solid state chemical cao2 is a promising and cost effective alternative to h2o2 yuan et al 2019 cao2 can slowly decompose and produce h2o2 eq 1 by controlling its solubility in water in a more manageable manner wang et al 2016 to maintain stable fe2 concentration in the fenton reaction zero valent iron fe0 is frequently used to replace fe2 as fe0 oxidation can continuously provide fe2 for fenton reaction at the strong acidic conditions however near neutral ph cannot help to promote fe0 dissolution like the acidic ph does in the traditional fenton or fenton like reactions instead it may result in iron precipitation pan et al 2019 it therefore remains unknown if fe0 can substitute fe2 to act as an effective catalyst under such conditions 1 c a o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 c a o h 2 furthermore it is well accepted that decomposing extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix is the critical step during the sludge dewatering in the fenton or fenton like systems masihi and gholikandi 2018 in the traditional fenton or fenton like systems the low ph would also change and even break down the eps compositions to some extent besides the strong effects of oh zhang et al 2015 however operating the proposed nta fe0 cao2 process under near neutral conditions certainly loss the advantage of positive effect of low ph on eps decomposition which may decline the sludge dewaterability when treating ad sludge the situation may be even worse due to the much higher content of refractory and sticky biopolymers in ad sludge which can trap the bound water and form stable colloidal structure maqbool et al 2019 as such the feasibility of the nta fe0 cao2 process for ad sludge dewatering should be experimentally demonstrated under near neutral conditions additionally considerable attention has been paid to how the composition and constituent of eps influence the sludge dewaterability during the fenton or fenton like process for instance masihi and gholikandi 2018 reported that fenton treatment promoted the transformation of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps from inner layers to outer layers thus improving ad sludge dewaterability wang et al 2019 found that the protein like materials were key organic constituents of eps affecting ad sludge dewaterability however to date few studies investigated the effect of detailed chemical composition of eps on sludge dewatering niu et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 cao et al 2018 the explicit role of such complex eps in sludge dewaterability has not been fully understood in particular various hydrophilic substances with different molecular weights their functional groups and the secondary structure of pn in eps have not been fully identified which may be the true factors influencing sludge dewaterability as such it is critical to understand how nta fe0 cao2 process affects the eps characteristics deeper insights into the changes in the characteristics of different molecular weight hydrophilic substances their functional groups and the secondary structure of pn in eps would allow us to move a big step forward to understand the mechanisms of nta fe0 cao2 process in improving ad sludge dewaterability under near neutral conditions the objectives of this study are to a evaluate the feasibility of the nta fe0 cao2 treatment to improve ad sludge dewaterability under near neutral conditions b optimize the operating factors in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment c explore the variations in the sludge characteristics with focus on the transformation of molecular weights and hydrophilic functional groups of the refractory biopolymers in the eps and d investigate the reaction mechanism this study for the first time successfully demonstrated a novel nta fe0 cao2 process to efficiently enhance ad sludge dewaterability under near neutral conditions and provided comprehensive insights into the mechanisms towards dewatering process 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of ad sludge and reagents the ad sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester

china 2 2 ad sludge conditioning 2 2 1 feasibility of nta fe0 cao2 treatment to improve ad sludge dewaterability nine sets of batch scale tests were conducted in triplicates each to evaluate the effects of the nta fe0 cao2 treatment on ad sludge dewatering performance the different conditioning methods are presented in table 2 the fe0 and cao2 dosages and reaction time were determined based on the pre tests and the studies of liang et al 2020a and chen et al 2016 methods and results are shown in text s1 and fig s1 the ad sludge without any treatment was used as a reference all the tests were conducted at an intrinsic ph 7 63 0 18 and a constant temperature 25 0 1 0 c after treatment the conditioned ad sludge samples were subject to the determination of filterability and dewaterability which were evaluated by capillary suction time cst and centrifuged weight reduction cwr respectively 2 2 2 optimization of the operating factors affecting ad sludge dewaterability in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment to optimize the critical factors of nta fe0 cao2 treatment the optimal dosages of nta fe0 and cao2 as well as initial ph were investigated in four series of batch tests in triplicates each batch test i was designed to investigate the effects of nta concentrations 0 0 02 0 05 0 08 and 0 10 mm nta g dry solids ds on ad sludge dewaterability at constant dosage of fe0 0 5

adjusted at pre set values second different dosages of nta and fe0 were added into the sludge with a 1 min mixing at 300 rpm third cao2 was added into sludge with 20 min mixing at 300 rpm after treatment the conditioned samples were collected to determine ad sludge filterability and dewaterability bound water contents zeta potential particle size rheological behavior and eps contents the

evaluate the improvement of ad sludge dewaterability which was calculated using eq 2 kim et al 2016 a higher cwr value indicates a better ad sludge dewaterability 2 c w r 1 c w t c w 0 100 where c w 0 and c w t represents the centrifuged weight g l of the ad sludge before and after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment respectively bound water of ad sludge was assessed according to a centrifugation method

logarithmically increased from 0 01 to 1000 s 1 a herschel bulkley model eq 3 was used to characterize the rheological behavior of ad sludge eshtiaghi et al 2013 in the herschel bulkley model an increment of flow behavior n denotes that sludge becomes more sensitive to shear and a decrease in the consistency index k denotes the decrease in apparent viscosity wang et al 2017 3 τ τ y k γ n

lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps were extracted from ad sludge using a modified heat method yu et al 2008 the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc pn and ps of the eps samples were then analyzed after filtration with 0 45 μm filter membrane doc was measured using a total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan total pn concentrations were analyzed using lowry folin method with bovine serum albumin as the standard frølund et al 1995 total ps concentrations were analyzed using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy agilent usa was employed to characterize the eps eem spectra was divided into five regions as shown in table s1 the scanning method of eem spectra was according to a study of chen et al 2003 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection organic nitrogen detection lc ocd ond model 8 doc labor germany was applied to quantify the compositions of doc of eps based on the molecular weight and respective characteristics the organic fractions were classified into biopolymers 20 kda including high molecular weight hmw pn and hmw ps humic substances hs 1000 da building blocks 300 500 da low molecular weight lmw acids 350 da and lmw neutrals 350 da the concentrations of lmw pn and lmw ps were obtained by subtracting hmw pn and hmw ps from total pn and total ps respectively the freeze dried eps samples were characterized using the attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy irprestige 21 shimazu japan with a scan range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 the secondary structure of the pn at 1600 1700 cm 1 in ftir was determined as per li et al 2020a electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer was used to record the variations of oh in the nta fe0 cao2 system the epr analysis was conducted in aqueous solution with nta fe0 cao2 fe0 cao2 or nta fe0 cao2 samples were mixed with the spin trapping agent 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo prior to epr analysis matuszak et al 1997 to trap the oh radicals the details about the radical scavenging tests are described in text s3 before the heavy metal contents determination the sludge was digested according to a study of lu et al 2020 after digestion the concentrations of mg ca fe al cd pb cr ni cu zn and mn were measured using inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 usa after nta fe0 cao2 treatment the fe0 powder were collected from the conditioned ad sludge and then freeze dried for the following characterization the morphology of the fe0 was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol 6340 japan the chemical bonds of fe were analyzed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra kratos analytical usa with an al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev the total fe concentration and fe3 concentration were measured using the 5 sulfosalicylic acid spectrophotometry karamanev et al 2002 cao et al 2019 the fe2 concentration was the difference between the total fe concentration and the fe3 concentration the h2o2 concentration was measured using the titanium potassium oxalate method yuan et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative analysis on fenton fenton like oxidations for ad sludge dewaterability improvement the cst0 cst value of ad sludge conditioned by cao2 was higher than that of h2o2 treatment 1 51 0 08 vs 1 31 0 09 fig 1 even in the presence of fe0 the cst0 cst values of fe0 cao2 treated ad sludge was higher than that of fe0 h2o2 treated ad sludge 3 65 0 14 vs 3 16 0 12 the results reveal that cao2 is an effective alternative to h2o2 for sludge conditioning likely attributing to the flocculation effect of ca2 chen et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 three commonly used cleating agents edds edta and nta were then selected to examine the potential effects of chelating agents on the efficiency of fe0 cao2 compared to fe0 cao2 the cst0 cst values of edds fe0 cao2 edta fe0 cao2 nta fe0 cao2 treated ad sludge increased by 4 86 12 68 and 16 96 respectively fig 1 the excellent filterability obtained in the nta fe0 cao2 system could be due to the fact that nta showed the considerable promotion of fe2 stability and the stronger reduction of fe3 than the other two jin et al 2018 farinelli et al 2020 it should be noted that although the nta fe0 treatment promoted the ad sludge filterability cao2 is still indispensable as the filterability of ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 was significantly weaker than that conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 fig 1 the present results demonstrate that nta fe0 cao2 treatment is feasible and effective for enhancing ad sludge filterability the cwr values show similar trends with the cst0 cst values fig 1 in general the effectiveness of ad sludge conditioning is indicated by both cst0 cst and cwr liu et al 2020 although the cwr value of the ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 was slightly higher than that of edta fe0 cao2 29 98 0 27 vs 28 35 0 29 nta could still be a better option than edta owing to the higher sludge filterability of ad sludge achieved by nta fe0 cao2 and the easier biodegradability of nta 3 2 nta fe0 cao2 treatment process optimization 3 2 1 effects of nta dosages the presence of nta apparently improved both the cst0 cst and cwr values of ad sludge treated by fe0 cao2 fig 2 a likely ascribing to the accelerated oh generation by the presence of more fe2 eqs 4 6 de luca et al 2014 with the increase of nta dosage the cst0 cst value gradually reached a maximum of 4 79 0 06 at 0 08 mm g ds but decreased to 4 48 0 09 when the nta dosage continuously increased to 0 10 mm g ds it was probably due to the consumption of oh by the redundant nta de luca et al 2014 pan et al 2019 cwr had a similar tendency with cst0 cst value and reached a maximum of 34 36 0 28 at 0 08 mm g ds of nta thus the optimum dosage of nta was 0 08 mm g ds in this study 4 2 f e 0 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 4 o h 5 f e 2 n t a f e 2 n t a 6 f e 2 n t a h 2 o 2 f e 3 n t a o h o h 3 2 2 effects of fe0 and cao2 dosages the effects of fe0 dosage with fixed dosages of nta and cao2 are shown in fig 2b with an increasing fe0 dosage from 0 to 0 5 mm g ds the cst0 cst and cwr values gradually increased from 1 42 0 03 and 8 64 0 17 to 4 96 0 09 and 36 17 0 35 respectively increased fe0 dosage can provide more fe2 for h2o2 activation eq 4 thereby producing more oh eq 6 and consequently improving ad sludge dewaterability donadelli et al 2018 however when the fe0 dosage was further increased to 0 9 mm g ds the cst0 cst and cwr values declined to 3 54 0 09 and 33 47 0 59 respectively which may be due to the inhibitory effect of excessive fe0 on oh generation wang et al 2018 similarly the optimal cao2 dosage was found to be 0 3 mm g ds where the cst0 cst and cwr values are 5 25 0 08 and 38 16 0 99 respectively fig 2c the higher cao2 dosage above 0 3 mm g ds may cause the quenching effect of on reactive oxygen radicals yuan et al 2019 3 2 3 effects of initial ph the sludge dewaterability was the best with a cst0 cst value of 7 89 0 25 and a cwr value of 46 22 0 41 at ph 3 0 with ph increased from 3 0 to 10 0 the cst0 cst and cwr values remarkably decreased to 3 58 0 40 and 26 53 0 53 fig 2d it may be attributed to the less production of reactive oxygen species at high ph pan et al 2019 although the nta fe0 cao2 system significantly improved ad sludge dewaterability at ph 3 0 such strong acidic condition is not preferentially recommended due to the release of high amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand chen et al 2019 which would further aggravate the burden of subsequent dewatering liquor treatment moreover considering the high alkalinity of ad sludge cho et al 2014 and reagent cost table s2 a minimal ph adjustment where a satisfied ad sludge dewaterability can be obtained is highly recommended in general when the ad sludge conditioned by the fenton like treatment the cst0 cst and cwr values higher than 6 00 and 40 00 respectively are considered excellent liu et al 2020 guo and zhou 2020 in this light the maximal ph for satisfactory sludge dewatering in this process could be 6 0 where cst0 cst and cwr values were 6 12 0 10 and 42 98 0 37 respectively the nta fe0 cao2 treatment is also superior to the established electrochemical fe2 and peroxymonosulfate pms treatment at the similar ph 6 0 cst0 cst value 6 12 vs 3 09 yang et al 2020 taken together in order to achieve an excellent dewatering performance the dosages of nta fe0 and cao2 shall be controlled at 0 08 mm g ds 0 5 mm g ds and 0 3 mm g ds respectively and the ph shall be adjusted to 6 0 3 3 variations of ad sludge characteristics with nta fe0 cao2 treatment to better understand the ad sludge characteristics during the nta fe0 cao2 treatment a series of sludge parameters e g sludge dewaterability bound water content zeta potential particle size rheological behavior and eps content were measured under the optimal nta fe0 cao2 dosage the cst0 cst values and bound water content of the ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 fe0 cao2 and nta fe0 cao2 are compared in fig 3 a the results confirm that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment lead to the highest cst0 cst value and the lowest bound water content zeta potential of sludge is an important index reflecting the flocculation capacity and dispersion characteristics of sludge kim et al 2016 the zeta potential of the raw ad sludge was 11 8 0 3 mv fig 3b indicating that the abundant functional groups with negative charge distributed on the surface of sludge flocs the ad sludge treated by nta fe0 cao2 had the highest zeta potential 3 9 0 2 mv followed by fe0 cao2 4 8 0 5 mv nta fe0 7 3 0 4 mv and cao2 7 8 0 3 mv the significant increase in zeta potential of ad sludge treated by nta fe0 cao2 treatment may be owing to the destruction of the abundant anionic functional groups in eps masihi and gholikandi 2018 and the dissolved iron li et al 2020a thus obvious charge neutralization of ad sludge occurred after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment favored sludge flocculation and dewaterability sludge dewaterability is also reflected by sludge particle size li et al 2020b the particle size of ad sludge treated by nta fe0 was bigger than that of raw ad sludge fig 3b and table s3 likely ascribing to the flocculation of iron ions liang et al 2020b however the presence of cao2 certainly reduced the particle size by the highly reactive oh that can destroy sludge floc structures liu et al 2020 in the nta fe0 cao2 system although iron had flocculation effect on the ad sludge strong oh oxidation could alleviate such negative effect via cell lysis and hydrophilic colloid polymers reduction and then substantially reduce the particle size of sludge flocs as such the nta fe0 cao2 treatment included oxidation and flocculation processes thus promoting the flocs compression and further enhancing the release of bound water the rheological behavior of sludge reflects the internal structure deformation of sludge flocs li et al 2020a compared with the raw ad sludge the apparent viscosity of treated sludge declined fig 3c suggesting a good flowability of the treated sludge lu et al 2020 among the treated sludge with different methods ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 had the lowest apparent viscosity likely due to the significant reduction of eps discussed below wang et al 2017 after conditioning both the yield stress τ y and k values decreased while the n value increased compared to the raw ad sludge table s4 the sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 had the smallest τ y and k values and the largest n value thus the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could effectively reduce the viscosity and advance the flowability 3 4 eps characteristics the changes in the eps compositions during the nta fe0 cao2 treatment were investigated after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment the doc concentrations in the lb eps and tb eps reduced by 38 88 and 56 74 while the sb eps increased by 44 62 fig 4 a which were the largest magnitude of changes compared with the rest treatments it was mainly due to the combined effects of strong radical oxidation and iron flocculation masihi and gholikandi 2018 the variations of pn and ps in the three eps fractions were similar to the doc concentration in respective eps layers fig 4a additionally the fluorescent intensities of hydrophilic substances i e proteins like compounds fulvic acid like materials and humic acid like substances of lb eps and tb eps treated by the nta fe0 cao2 treatment were lower than other samples text s4 and figs s2 and s3 as such the destruction of lb eps and tb eps could weaken the hydrophilicity of sludge and reduce the bound water content thereby promoting the flocculation and dewaterability of ad sludge li et al 2020a the above results indicated that even without the effect of low ph the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could still effectively destroy the pn and ps in the lb eps and tb eps previous studies reported that pn ps hs with abundant hydrophilic functional groups in the lb eps and tb eps would easily block the filtering channel and deteriorate the sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b as for lb eps the hmw ps lmw pn hs building blocks and lmw neutrals in the nta fe0 cao2 sample significantly decreased by 23 53 29 82 17 69 42 33 and 63 48 fig 4b respectively indicating that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could effectively remove most of the hydrophilic organic compounds xiao et al 2017 also reported that the removal of lmw pn and lmw neutrals in the lb eps was the crucial step to improve the sludge dewaterability which supports the findings of significant enhancement of ad sludge dewaterability after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment for the tb eps hmw ps lmw pn hs building blocks and lmw neutrals in the nta fe0 cao2 sample decreased by 59 73 47 96 33 73 43 93 and 61 71 respectively confirming that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could effectively remove the hydrophilic compounds regarding the s eps the hmw pn hmw ps lmw pn concentrations after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment was higher than that of the raw ad sludge suggesting the decomposed biopolymers released from inner layer to outer layer the present results demonstrated that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment induced the decomposition of the hydrophilic biopolymers in the eps at near neutral ph ftir was employed to study the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of functional groups in the eps during the nta fe0 cao2 process the nta fe0 cao2 treatment weakened the transmittance of the absorption peaks in the lb eps fig 5 b and the tb eps fig 5c while strengthening the transmittance of the absorption peaks in the s eps compared to the raw ad sludge fig 5a reflecting the change in the functional groups i e co stretch amide i c h c n stretch amide ii and co symmetric stretching of coo groups amide ii associated with pn and c oh and c o associated with ps responsible for the hydrophilicity of sludge zhang et al 2020b table s5 this also confirms the pn chains and ps chains were attacked resulting in the reduction of the associated hydrophilic functional groups pn secondary structure in eps can be divided into six regions aggregated strands β sheet random coil α helix 3 turn helix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands zhang et al 2020a the fitting result showed that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment efficiently decreased the relative content of α helix and the ratio of α helix to β sheet random coil in the lb eps and tb eps fig s4 and table s6 indicating the formation of a loose structure and the improvement of eps hydrophobicity li et al 2020a 3 5 reaction mechanism in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment 3 5 1 free radicals epr analysis showed that dmpo oh signals were present in the fe0 cao2 and nta fe0 cao2 systems while the signals were negligible in the nta fe0 and cao2 systems fig 6 a the intensity of dmpo oh in the nta fe0 cao2 system was way stronger than that in the fe0 cao2 system suggesting that more oh was produced in the nta fe0 cao2 system it could be due to the fact that the reaction between fe2 nta with cao2 released more h2o2 which subsequently generated abundant oh eqs 4 6 de luca et al 2014 additionally radical scavenging experiments report that the contribution of oh to cst reduction rate was 67 31 1 43 fig 6b indicating that oh oxidation played an important role in improving ad sludge dewaterability 3 5 2 iron and h2o2 concentrations the corrosion of fe0 would release soluble iron and fe2 and the concentration of total soluble fe and fe2 are displayed in fig 6c and d compared with the other treatment methods the concentrations of soluble iron and fe2 in the nta fe0 cao2 system were the highest indicating that nta could substantially promote the fe2 availability and stability the transformation from fe3 to fe2 was due to the strong complexation and reduction ability of nta pan et al 2019 moreover the h2o2 concentration was stable at about 56 0 mm l in cao2 however in the fe0 cao2 and the nta fe0 cao2 systems the concentrations of h2o2 increased first and then decreased with time fig 6e indicating that fe0 consumed a part of h2o2 produced by cao2 yuan et al 2019 compared with that in the fe0 cao2 system the rate of h2o2 decomposition to oh in the nta fe0 cao2 system was faster due to the presence of more dissolved fe induced by nta fig 6c pan et al 2019 farinelli et al 2020 accordingly the addition of nta could significantly enhance the fe2 stability and the cycle of fe2 and fe3 finally promoting h2o2 decomposition and oh generation which is beneficial for ad sludge dewaterability improvement 3 5 3 fe0 characteristics fesem analysis showed that the surface of pristine fe0 was smooth and dense fig 7 a in the presence of nta the fe0 surface became coarse fig 7b indicating a minor degree of fe0 corrosion after the fe0 cao2 and nta fe0 cao2 reaction some needle like crystals appeared fig 7c and d suggesting a strong corrosion of fe0 surface guo et al 2016 compared with the fe0 cao2 reaction more needle like corrosive products were observed with the nta fe0 cao2 reaction indicating that a more intensive corrosion process occurred due to the stronger oxidation effect of oh to further identify the surface compositions of fe0 xps analysis was performed the ratio of fe2 to total iron increased from 15 58 in the fe0 sample to 29 36 in the nta fe0 sample 34 60 in the fe0 cao2 sample 50 77 in the nta fe0 cao2 sample respectively fig s5 accordingly the strong dissolution of iron occurred in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment these results confirm the hypothesis that fe0 can substitute fe2 to act as an effective catalyst under near neutral conditions ph 6 0 it may be attributable to the fact that fe0 can continuously produce fe2 in the presence of nta under the near neutral conditions pan et al 2019 which could effectively and stably catalyze cao2 to produce oh 3 6 how ad sludge dewaterability is improved by nta fe0 cao2 according to the above mentioned results and discussion we therefore propose a possible ad sludge dewatering mechanism induced by nta fe0 cao2 treatment fig 8 without the effect of low ph on fe0 dissolution fe0 can still act as an effective catalyst in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment at ph of 6 0 because the presence of nta can significantly improve the fe0 corrosion fe2 stability and turnover of fe2 fe3 accordingly iron chelation accelerated the reaction with cao2 and formed more oh and fe3 nta in the sludge layer a synchronous process of oh oxidation and fe2 fe3 flocculation is proposed in the oh oxidation step highly active oh could effectively enhance the disruption of refractory and sticky biopolymers products i e hmw pn hmw ps lmw pn and lmw ps in the lb eps and tb eps which further reduced sludge particle size and eps concentration as well as the bound water meanwhile oh could also decompose the hydrophilic functional groups i e co stretch amide i c h c n stretch amide ii co symmetric stretching of coo groups amide ii c oh and c o and the hydrophilic structure of pn molecules i e α helix in the lb eps and tb eps which could cause disintegration of eps and further promote the release of water in the fe2 fe3 flocculation step fe2 fe3 could reassemble the dissociative sludge flocs and reduce the viscosity of sludge via double electric layers compression and charge neutralization 3 7 potential application of the nta fe0 cao2 process this study demonstrated the feasibility of nta fe0 cao2 process for ad sludge dewatering the recovery test shows that good sludge dewaterability can be still obtained after three cycles cst reduction rate 83 20 and cwr 40 68 fig s6 which is comparable to the results from four cycles of fe0 h2o2 treatment li et al 2020b the three cycles of ultrasound fe0 pms treatment liu et al 2020 and the zero cycle of electrochemical fe2 pms treatment yang et al 2020 see table 3 indicating the strong stability of the nta fe0 cao2 approach in addition cost benefit analysis explains that the annual cost of the nta fe0 cao2 treatment for 750 0 ton year sludge is approximately usd 47625 0 table 4 under the optimum conditions which is significantly lower than those of fecl3 cao process usd 54750 0 liu et al 2016 and fenton s reagent cao process usd 106200 0 liang et al 2020a thus the nta fe0 cao2 process could be a cost effective technology for ad sludge dewaterability more importantly the nta fe0 cao2 process has a competitive advantage over the traditional fenton or fenton like treatments especially at near neutral ph 6 0 where traditional fenton or fenton like treatments cannot achieve satisfactory sludge dewatering results zhang et al 2015 to further minimize the operational cost the pure fe0 powder could be replaced with scrap iron a waste from machinery industries however owing to its bigger particle size smaller specific surface area the effectiveness with scrap iron in the nta fe cao2 process should be further investigated the fe rich dewatered sludge may be in favor of subsequent resource utilization including fertilizer wang et al 2020 and environment friendly functional material ai et al 2019 as long as the low environmental risk of heavy metals in the dewatered ad sludge is achieved in addition iron based materials may also be dosed prior dewatering step e g into the ad reactor which could facilitate the solids reduction and methane production yan et al 2020 and could promote the phosphorus recovery via vivianite prot et al 2020 at the end of digestion cao2 and nta could be then added into digester liquor to develop the cost effective nta fe0 cao2 process for ad sludge dewatering additionally such promising nta fe0 cao2 process should still be further explored to demonstrate its feasibility and stability in pilot or large scale applications it should be noted that the effects of environmental factors i e temperature dissolved organic matter dom contents and inherent metal irons in the sludge and cao2 dissolution rate on the ad sludge dewaterability in the nta fe0 cao2 process at neutral ph is also worthy to be investigated in the future in order to further boost the development and application of the nta fe0 cao2 process a future study to identify the hydrophilic molecules using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry gc ms is essential as well which would be conducive to further understand the sludge dewatering mechanism 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of nta fe0 cao2 process to improve ad sludge dewaterability the main conclusions are 1 the nta fe0 cao2 treatment remarkably enhanced the ad sludge dewaterability at near neutral ph this method is more stable and economical compared to conventional fenton or fenton like process 2 under near neutral conditions ph 6 0 fe0 still acted as an effective catalyst because the fe0 corrosion fe2 stability and the turnover of fe2 fe3 were remarkably enhanced by the presence of nta which in turn accelerated h2o2 decomposition and oh production 3 refractory and sticky biopolymers i e hmw ps lmw pn hs building blocks and lmw neutrals the hydrophilic functional groups i e co stretch c h c n stretch co symmetric stretching of coo groups c oh and c o and the hydrophilic structure of pn molecules i e α helix in the lb eps and tb eps were largely reduced which induced the release of bound water fe2 fe3 flocculated the dissociative sludge flocs and decreased the viscosity of sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17671,traditional fenton or fenton like oxidation has been widely studied for waste activated sludge dewaterability however the narrow ph range 2 0 4 0 and the instabilities of fe2 and h2o2 have hindered its commercial application owing to the high alkalinity of anaerobic digestion ad sludge traditional fenton or fenton like oxidation is economically unfeasible for its dewatering in this study we successfully demonstrated a novel and feasible method that used nitrilotriacetic acid nta fe0 combined with cao2 nta fe0 cao2 at near neutral ph 6 0 a slight ph adjustment in which capillary suction time ratio cst0 cst and centrifuged weight reduction cwr improved by 6 folds and 42 98 0 37 respectively under the optimal conditions the presence of nta accelerated the fe0 corrosion fe2 stability and turnover between fe2 and fe3 as such fe0 could effectively catalyze cao2 to produce hydroxyl radicals oh under near neutral conditions accordingly various molecular weight hydrophilic compounds in different extracellular polymeric substances fractions were significantly reduced after treatment the hydrophilic functional groups especially protein molecules were largely reduced consequently the viscosity of sludge and particle size effectively decreased while the release of bound water surface charge flocculation and flowability of sludge were improved the cost benefit analysis further demonstrated the nta fe0 cao2 treatment has high reusability and stability and is also more economical over the fecl3 cao and fenton s reagent cao treatments in summary the nta fe0 cao2 process is a cost effective and practically feasible technology for improving ad sludge dewaterability graphical abstract image 1 keywords anaerobic digestion sludge dewaterability nta fe0 cao2 critical organic compounds near neutral ph 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad process has been widely implemented in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for energy recovery and sludge reduction appels et al 2008 wacławek et al 2016 however energy consumption occurs in the downstream sludge dewatering process the energy cost of dewatering process would be up to 20 of a wwtp s total energy cost panepinto et al 2016 generally the dewaterability of ad sludge is worse than waste activated sludge was due to the large amount of refractory and sticky biopolymers in ad sludge maqbool et al 2019 thus improving ad sludge dewaterability is essential in order to minimize the operational cost for sludge disposal fenton oxidation treatment a mixture of fe2 and h2o2 as an advanced oxidation process aop has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the was dewaterability zhang et al 2015 masihi and gholikandi 2018 however acidic condition ph 4 0 is a prerequisite for such process acidification and the following neutralization would complicate the process and further increase the operational cost masihi and gholikandi 2018 given the high alkalinity in ad sludge employing traditional fenton oxidation treatment to condition ad sludge may not be economically feasible cho et al 2014 as such it is necessary to optimize modify the fenton oxidation treatment to make it practicable for ad sludge dewatering with a slight ph adjustment or even without ph adjustment implementing the fenton oxidation treatment with chelating agents e g ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or nitrilotriacetic acid nta could be a promising approach to enhance the production of oxidizing radicals since they can chelate iron and preserve its free form conditions amina et al 2018 reported that the addition of edta could effectively promote the fenton like reaction to degrade sulfamethoxazole in wastewater at neutral ph garcía fernández et al 2019 found that edds fenton process could improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh to disinfect e faecalis in wastewater under neutral conditions however both edta and edds are weak biodegradable chelating agents which could have negative impacts on the subsequent treatment likely limiting its broad application de luca et al 2014 compared to edds and edta nta has higher biodegradability and stronger reduction ability it is a safer chelating agent which seems to be a better choice to efficiently enhance fenton or fenton like reactions at near neutral conditions to degrade micropollutants from municipal wastewater jin et al 2018 pan et al 2019 however it still remains unknown if nta could improve the performance of fenton or fenton like systems used for sludge conditioning since sludge is far more complex than contaminated water and nta may interact with metal irons in the sludge vogel and adam 2011 thus reducing its chelating effect on iron in light of the instabilities of h2o2 and fe2 wang et al 2019 directly dosing h2o2 and fe2 to induce fenton reaction in sludge treatment may be hard to control and achieve desired performance the solid state chemical cao2 is a promising and cost effective alternative to h2o2 yuan et al 2019 cao2 can slowly decompose and produce h2o2 eq 1 by controlling its solubility in water in a more manageable manner wang et al 2016 to maintain stable fe2 concentration in the fenton reaction zero valent iron fe0 is frequently used to replace fe2 as fe0 oxidation can continuously provide fe2 for fenton reaction at the strong acidic conditions however near neutral ph cannot help to promote fe0 dissolution like the acidic ph does in the traditional fenton or fenton like reactions instead it may result in iron precipitation pan et al 2019 it therefore remains unknown if fe0 can substitute fe2 to act as an effective catalyst under such conditions 1 c a o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 c a o h 2 furthermore it is well accepted that decomposing extracellular polymeric substances eps matrix is the critical step during the sludge dewatering in the fenton or fenton like systems masihi and gholikandi 2018 in the traditional fenton or fenton like systems the low ph would also change and even break down the eps compositions to some extent besides the strong effects of oh zhang et al 2015 however operating the proposed nta fe0 cao2 process under near neutral conditions certainly loss the advantage of positive effect of low ph on eps decomposition which may decline the sludge dewaterability when treating ad sludge the situation may be even worse due to the much higher content of refractory and sticky biopolymers in ad sludge which can trap the bound water and form stable colloidal structure maqbool et al 2019 as such the feasibility of the nta fe0 cao2 process for ad sludge dewatering should be experimentally demonstrated under near neutral conditions additionally considerable attention has been paid to how the composition and constituent of eps influence the sludge dewaterability during the fenton or fenton like process for instance masihi and gholikandi 2018 reported that fenton treatment promoted the transformation of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps from inner layers to outer layers thus improving ad sludge dewaterability wang et al 2019 found that the protein like materials were key organic constituents of eps affecting ad sludge dewaterability however to date few studies investigated the effect of detailed chemical composition of eps on sludge dewatering niu et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 cao et al 2018 the explicit role of such complex eps in sludge dewaterability has not been fully understood in particular various hydrophilic substances with different molecular weights their functional groups and the secondary structure of pn in eps have not been fully identified which may be the true factors influencing sludge dewaterability as such it is critical to understand how nta fe0 cao2 process affects the eps characteristics deeper insights into the changes in the characteristics of different molecular weight hydrophilic substances their functional groups and the secondary structure of pn in eps would allow us to move a big step forward to understand the mechanisms of nta fe0 cao2 process in improving ad sludge dewaterability under near neutral conditions the objectives of this study are to a evaluate the feasibility of the nta fe0 cao2 treatment to improve ad sludge dewaterability under near neutral conditions b optimize the operating factors in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment c explore the variations in the sludge characteristics with focus on the transformation of molecular weights and hydrophilic functional groups of the refractory biopolymers in the eps and d investigate the reaction mechanism this study for the first time successfully demonstrated a novel nta fe0 cao2 process to efficiently enhance ad sludge dewaterability under near neutral conditions and provided comprehensive insights into the mechanisms towards dewatering process 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of ad sludge and reagents the ad sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester

china 2 2 ad sludge conditioning 2 2 1 feasibility of nta fe0 cao2 treatment to improve ad sludge dewaterability nine sets of batch scale tests were conducted in triplicates each to evaluate the effects of the nta fe0 cao2 treatment on ad sludge dewatering performance the different conditioning methods are presented in table 2 the fe0 and cao2 dosages and reaction time were determined based on the pre tests and the studies of liang et al 2020a and chen et al 2016 methods and results are shown in text s1 and fig s1 the ad sludge without any treatment was used as a reference all the tests were conducted at an intrinsic ph 7 63 0 18 and a constant temperature 25 0 1 0 c after treatment the conditioned ad sludge samples were subject to the determination of filterability and dewaterability which were evaluated by capillary suction time cst and centrifuged weight reduction cwr respectively 2 2 2 optimization of the operating factors affecting ad sludge dewaterability in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment to optimize the critical factors of nta fe0 cao2 treatment the optimal dosages of nta fe0 and cao2 as well as initial ph were investigated in four series of batch tests in

adjusted at pre set values second different dosages of nta and fe0 were added into the sludge with a 1 min mixing at 300 rpm third cao2 was added into sludge with 20 min mixing at 300 rpm after treatment the conditioned samples were collected to determine ad sludge filterability and dewaterability bound water contents zeta potential particle size rheological behavior and eps contents the

evaluate the improvement of ad sludge dewaterability which was calculated using eq 2 kim et al 2016 a higher cwr value indicates a better ad sludge dewaterability 2 c w r 1 c w t c w 0 100 where c w 0 and c w t represents the centrifuged weight g l of the ad sludge before and after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment respectively bound water of ad sludge was assessed according to a centrifugation method

logarithmically increased from 0 01 to 1000 s 1 a herschel bulkley model eq 3 was used to characterize the rheological behavior of ad sludge eshtiaghi et al 2013 in the herschel bulkley model an

humic substances hs 1000 da building blocks 300 500 da low molecular weight lmw acids 350 da and lmw neutrals 350 da the concentrations of lmw pn and lmw ps were obtained by subtracting hmw pn and hmw ps from total pn and total ps respectively the freeze dried eps samples were characterized using the attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy irprestige 21 shimazu japan with a scan range from 400 to 4000 cm 1 kunacheva and stuckey 2014 the secondary structure of the pn at 1600 1700 cm 1 in ftir was determined as per li et al 2020a electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometer was used to record the variations of oh in the nta fe0 cao2 system the epr analysis was conducted in aqueous solution with nta fe0 cao2 fe0 cao2 or nta fe0 cao2 samples were mixed with the spin trapping agent 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo prior to epr analysis matuszak et al 1997 to trap the oh radicals the details about the radical scavenging tests are described in text s3 before the heavy metal contents determination the sludge was digested according to a study of lu et al 2020 after digestion the concentrations of mg ca fe al cd pb cr ni cu zn and mn were measured using inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 usa after nta fe0 cao2 treatment the fe0 powder were collected from the conditioned ad sludge and then freeze dried for the following characterization the morphology of the fe0 was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem jeol 6340 japan the chemical bonds of fe were analyzed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra kratos analytical usa with an al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev the total fe concentration and fe3 concentration were measured using the 5 sulfosalicylic acid spectrophotometry karamanev et al 2002 cao et al 2019 the fe2 concentration was the difference between the total fe concentration and the fe3 concentration the h2o2 concentration was measured using the titanium potassium oxalate method yuan et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative analysis on fenton fenton like oxidations for ad sludge dewaterability improvement the cst0 cst value of ad sludge conditioned by cao2 was higher than that of h2o2 treatment 1 51 0 08 vs 1 31 0 09 fig 1 even in the presence of fe0 the cst0 cst values of fe0 cao2 treated ad sludge was higher than that of fe0 h2o2 treated ad sludge 3 65 0 14 vs 3 16 0 12 the results reveal that cao2 is an effective alternative to h2o2 for sludge conditioning likely attributing to the flocculation effect of ca2 chen et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 three commonly used cleating agents edds edta and nta were then selected to examine the potential effects of chelating agents on the efficiency of fe0 cao2 compared to fe0 cao2 the cst0 cst values of edds fe0 cao2 edta fe0 cao2 nta fe0 cao2 treated ad sludge increased by 4 86 12 68 and 16 96 respectively fig 1 the excellent filterability obtained in the nta fe0 cao2 system could be due to the fact that nta showed the considerable promotion of fe2 stability and the stronger reduction of fe3 than the other two jin et al 2018 farinelli et al 2020 it should be noted that although the nta fe0 treatment promoted the ad sludge filterability cao2 is still indispensable as the filterability of ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 was significantly weaker than that conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 fig 1 the present results demonstrate that nta fe0 cao2 treatment is feasible and effective for enhancing ad sludge filterability the cwr values show similar trends with the cst0 cst values fig 1 in general the effectiveness of ad sludge conditioning is indicated by both cst0 cst and cwr liu et al 2020 although the cwr value of the ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 was slightly higher than that of edta fe0 cao2 29 98 0 27 vs 28 35 0 29 nta could still be a better option than edta owing to the higher sludge filterability of ad sludge achieved by nta fe0 cao2 and the easier biodegradability of nta 3 2 nta fe0 cao2 treatment process optimization 3 2 1 effects of nta dosages the presence of nta apparently improved both the cst0 cst and cwr values of ad sludge treated by fe0 cao2 fig 2 a likely ascribing to the accelerated oh generation by the presence of more fe2 eqs 4 6 de luca et al 2014 with the increase of nta dosage the cst0 cst value gradually reached a maximum of 4 79 0 06 at 0 08 mm g ds but decreased to 4 48 0 09 when the nta dosage continuously increased to 0 10 mm g ds it was probably due to the consumption of oh by the redundant nta de luca et al 2014 pan et al 2019 cwr had a similar tendency with cst0 cst value and reached a maximum of 34 36 0 28 at 0 08 mm g ds of nta thus the optimum dosage of nta was 0 08 mm g ds in this study 4 2 f e 0 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 2 4 o h 5 f e 2 n t a f e 2 n t a 6 f e 2 n t a h 2 o 2 f e 3 n t a o h o h 3 2 2 effects of fe0 and cao2 dosages the effects of fe0 dosage with fixed dosages of nta and cao2 are shown in fig 2b with an increasing fe0 dosage from 0 to 0 5 mm g ds the cst0 cst and cwr values gradually increased from 1 42 0 03 and 8 64 0 17 to 4 96 0 09 and 36 17 0 35 respectively increased fe0 dosage can provide more fe2 for h2o2 activation eq 4 thereby producing more oh eq 6 and consequently improving ad sludge dewaterability donadelli et al 2018 however when the fe0 dosage was further increased to 0 9 mm g ds the cst0 cst and cwr values declined to 3 54 0 09 and 33 47 0 59 respectively which may be due to the inhibitory effect of excessive fe0 on oh generation wang et al 2018 similarly the optimal cao2 dosage was found to be 0 3 mm g ds where the cst0 cst and cwr values are 5 25 0 08 and 38 16 0 99 respectively fig 2c the higher cao2 dosage above 0 3 mm g ds may cause the quenching effect of on reactive oxygen radicals yuan et al 2019 3 2 3 effects of initial ph the sludge dewaterability was the best with a cst0 cst value of 7 89 0 25 and a cwr value of 46 22 0 41 at ph 3 0 with ph increased from 3 0 to 10 0 the cst0 cst and cwr values remarkably decreased to 3 58 0 40 and 26 53 0 53 fig 2d it may be attributed to the less production of reactive oxygen species at high ph pan et al 2019 although the nta fe0 cao2 system significantly improved ad sludge dewaterability at ph 3 0 such strong acidic condition is not preferentially recommended due to the release of high amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand chen et al 2019 which would further aggravate the burden of subsequent dewatering liquor treatment moreover considering the high alkalinity of ad sludge cho et al 2014 and reagent cost table s2 a minimal ph adjustment where a satisfied ad sludge dewaterability can be obtained is highly recommended in general when the ad sludge conditioned by the fenton like treatment the cst0 cst and cwr values higher than 6 00 and 40 00 respectively are considered excellent liu et al 2020 guo and zhou 2020 in this light the maximal ph for satisfactory sludge dewatering in this process could be 6 0 where cst0 cst and cwr values were 6 12 0 10 and 42 98 0 37 respectively the nta fe0 cao2 treatment is also superior to the established electrochemical fe2 and peroxymonosulfate pms treatment at the similar ph 6 0 cst0 cst value 6 12 vs 3 09 yang et al 2020 taken together in order to achieve an excellent dewatering performance the dosages of nta fe0 and cao2 shall be controlled at 0 08 mm g ds 0 5 mm g ds and 0 3 mm g ds respectively and the ph shall be adjusted to 6 0 3 3 variations of ad sludge characteristics with nta fe0 cao2 treatment to better understand the ad sludge characteristics during the nta fe0 cao2 treatment a series of sludge parameters e g sludge dewaterability bound water content zeta potential particle size rheological behavior and eps content were measured under the optimal nta fe0 cao2 dosage the cst0 cst values and bound water content of the ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 fe0 cao2 and nta fe0 cao2 are compared in fig 3 a the results confirm that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment lead to the highest cst0 cst value and the lowest bound water content zeta potential of sludge is an important index reflecting the flocculation capacity and dispersion characteristics of sludge kim et al 2016 the zeta potential of the raw ad sludge was 11 8 0 3 mv fig 3b indicating that the abundant functional groups with negative charge distributed on the surface of sludge flocs the ad sludge treated by nta fe0 cao2 had the highest zeta potential 3 9 0 2 mv followed by fe0 cao2 4 8 0 5 mv nta fe0 7 3 0 4 mv and cao2 7 8 0 3 mv the significant increase in zeta potential of ad sludge treated by nta fe0 cao2 treatment may be owing to the destruction of the abundant anionic functional groups in eps masihi and gholikandi 2018 and the dissolved iron li et al 2020a thus obvious charge neutralization of ad sludge occurred after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment favored sludge flocculation and dewaterability sludge dewaterability is also reflected by sludge particle size li et al 2020b the particle size of ad sludge treated by nta fe0 was bigger than that of raw ad sludge fig 3b and table s3 likely ascribing to the flocculation of iron ions liang et al 2020b however the presence of cao2 certainly reduced the particle size by the highly reactive oh that can destroy sludge floc structures liu et al 2020 in the nta fe0 cao2 system although iron had flocculation effect on the ad sludge strong oh oxidation could alleviate such negative effect via cell lysis and hydrophilic colloid polymers reduction and then substantially reduce the particle size of sludge flocs as such the nta fe0 cao2 treatment included oxidation and flocculation processes thus promoting the flocs compression and further enhancing the release of bound water the rheological behavior of sludge reflects the internal structure deformation of sludge flocs li et al 2020a compared with the raw ad sludge the apparent viscosity of treated sludge declined fig 3c suggesting a good flowability of the treated sludge lu et al 2020 among the treated sludge with different methods ad sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 had the lowest apparent viscosity likely due to the significant reduction of eps discussed below wang et al 2017 after conditioning both the yield stress τ y and k values decreased while the n value increased compared to the raw ad sludge table s4 the sludge conditioned by nta fe0 cao2 had the smallest τ y and k values and the largest n value thus the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could effectively reduce the viscosity and advance the flowability 3 4 eps characteristics the changes in the eps compositions during the nta fe0 cao2 treatment were investigated after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment the doc concentrations in the lb eps and tb eps reduced by 38 88 and 56 74 while the sb eps increased by 44 62 fig 4 a which were the largest magnitude of changes compared with the rest treatments it was mainly due to the combined effects of strong radical oxidation and iron flocculation masihi and gholikandi 2018 the variations of pn and ps in the three eps fractions were similar to the doc concentration in respective eps layers fig 4a additionally the fluorescent intensities of hydrophilic substances i e proteins like compounds fulvic acid like materials and humic acid like substances of lb eps and tb eps treated by the nta fe0 cao2 treatment were lower than other samples text s4 and figs s2 and s3 as such the destruction of lb eps and tb eps could weaken the hydrophilicity of sludge and reduce the bound water content thereby promoting the flocculation and dewaterability of ad sludge li et al 2020a the above results indicated that even without the effect of low ph the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could still effectively destroy the pn and ps in the lb eps and tb eps previous studies reported that pn ps hs with abundant hydrophilic functional groups in the lb eps and tb eps would easily block the filtering channel and deteriorate the sludge dewaterability xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b as for lb eps the hmw ps lmw pn hs building blocks and lmw neutrals in the nta fe0 cao2 sample significantly decreased by 23 53 29 82 17 69 42 33 and 63 48 fig 4b respectively indicating that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could effectively remove most of the hydrophilic organic compounds xiao et al 2017 also reported that the removal of lmw pn and lmw neutrals in the lb eps was the crucial step to improve the sludge dewaterability which supports the findings of significant enhancement of ad sludge dewaterability after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment for the tb eps hmw ps lmw pn hs building blocks and lmw neutrals in the nta fe0 cao2 sample decreased by 59 73 47 96 33 73 43 93 and 61 71 respectively confirming that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment could effectively remove the hydrophilic compounds regarding the s eps the hmw pn hmw ps lmw pn concentrations after the nta fe0 cao2 treatment was higher than that of the raw ad sludge suggesting the decomposed biopolymers released from inner layer to outer layer the present results demonstrated that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment induced the decomposition of the hydrophilic biopolymers in the eps at near neutral ph ftir was employed to study the hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of functional groups in the eps during the nta fe0 cao2 process the nta fe0 cao2 treatment weakened the transmittance of the absorption peaks in the lb eps fig 5 b and the tb eps fig 5c while strengthening the transmittance of the absorption peaks in the s eps compared to the raw ad sludge fig 5a reflecting the change in the functional groups i e co stretch amide i c h c n stretch amide ii and co symmetric stretching of coo groups amide ii associated with pn and c oh and c o associated with ps responsible for the hydrophilicity of sludge zhang et al 2020b table s5 this also confirms the pn chains and ps chains were attacked resulting in the reduction of the associated hydrophilic functional groups pn secondary structure in eps can be divided into six regions aggregated strands β sheet random coil α helix 3 turn helix and antiparallel β sheet aggregated strands zhang et al 2020a the fitting result showed that the nta fe0 cao2 treatment efficiently decreased the relative content of α helix and the ratio of α helix to β sheet random coil in the lb eps and tb eps fig s4 and table s6 indicating the formation of a loose structure and the improvement of eps hydrophobicity li et al 2020a 3 5 reaction mechanism in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment 3 5 1 free radicals epr analysis showed that dmpo oh signals were present in the fe0 cao2 and nta fe0 cao2 systems while the signals were negligible in the nta fe0 and cao2 systems fig 6 a the intensity of dmpo oh in the nta fe0 cao2 system was way stronger than that in the fe0 cao2 system suggesting that more oh was produced in the nta fe0 cao2 system it could be due to the fact that the reaction between fe2 nta with cao2 released more h2o2 which subsequently generated abundant oh eqs 4 6 de luca et al 2014 additionally radical scavenging experiments report that the contribution of oh to cst reduction rate was 67 31 1 43 fig 6b indicating that oh oxidation played an important role in improving ad sludge dewaterability 3 5 2 iron and h2o2 concentrations the corrosion of fe0 would release soluble iron and fe2 and the concentration of total soluble fe and fe2 are displayed in fig 6c and d compared with the other treatment methods the concentrations of soluble iron and fe2 in the nta fe0 cao2 system were the highest indicating that nta could substantially promote the fe2 availability and stability the transformation from fe3 to fe2 was due to the strong complexation and reduction ability of nta pan et al 2019 moreover the h2o2 concentration was stable at about 56 0 mm l in cao2 however in the fe0 cao2 and the nta fe0 cao2 systems the concentrations of h2o2 increased first and then decreased with time fig 6e indicating that fe0 consumed a part of h2o2 produced by cao2 yuan et al 2019 compared with that in the fe0 cao2 system the rate of h2o2 decomposition to oh in the nta fe0 cao2 system was faster due to the presence of more dissolved fe induced by nta fig 6c pan et al 2019 farinelli et al 2020 accordingly the addition of nta could significantly enhance the fe2 stability and the cycle of fe2 and fe3 finally promoting h2o2 decomposition and oh generation which is beneficial for ad sludge dewaterability improvement 3 5 3 fe0 characteristics fesem analysis showed that the surface of pristine fe0 was smooth and dense fig 7 a in the presence of nta the fe0 surface became coarse fig 7b indicating a minor degree of fe0 corrosion after the fe0 cao2 and nta fe0 cao2 reaction some needle like crystals appeared fig 7c and d suggesting a strong corrosion of fe0 surface guo et al 2016 compared with the fe0 cao2 reaction more needle like corrosive products were observed with the nta fe0 cao2 reaction indicating that a more intensive corrosion process occurred due to the stronger oxidation effect of oh to further identify the surface compositions of fe0 xps analysis was performed the ratio of fe2 to total iron increased from 15 58 in the fe0 sample to 29 36 in the nta fe0 sample 34 60 in the fe0 cao2 sample 50 77 in the nta fe0 cao2 sample respectively fig s5 accordingly the strong dissolution of iron occurred in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment these results confirm the hypothesis that fe0 can substitute fe2 to act as an effective catalyst under near neutral conditions ph 6 0 it may be attributable to the fact that fe0 can continuously produce fe2 in the presence of nta under the near neutral conditions pan et al 2019 which could effectively and stably catalyze cao2 to produce oh 3 6 how ad sludge dewaterability is improved by nta fe0 cao2 according to the above mentioned results and discussion we therefore propose a possible ad sludge dewatering mechanism induced by nta fe0 cao2 treatment fig 8 without the effect of low ph on fe0 dissolution fe0 can still act as an effective catalyst in the nta fe0 cao2 treatment at ph of 6 0 because the presence of nta can significantly improve the fe0 corrosion fe2 stability and turnover of fe2 fe3 accordingly iron chelation accelerated the reaction with cao2 and formed more oh and fe3 nta in the sludge layer a synchronous process of oh oxidation and fe2 fe3 flocculation is proposed in the oh oxidation step highly active oh could effectively enhance the disruption of refractory and sticky biopolymers products i e hmw pn hmw ps lmw pn and lmw ps in the lb eps and tb eps which further reduced sludge particle size and eps concentration as well as the bound water meanwhile oh could also decompose the hydrophilic functional groups i e co stretch amide i c h c n stretch amide ii co symmetric stretching of coo groups amide ii c oh and c o and the hydrophilic structure of pn molecules i e α helix in the lb eps and tb eps which could cause disintegration of eps and further promote the release of water in the fe2 fe3 flocculation step fe2 fe3 could reassemble the dissociative sludge flocs and reduce the viscosity of sludge via double electric layers compression and charge neutralization 3 7 potential application of the nta fe0 cao2 process this study demonstrated the feasibility of nta fe0 cao2 process for ad sludge dewatering the recovery test shows that good sludge dewaterability can be still obtained after three cycles cst reduction rate 83 20 and cwr 40 68 fig s6 which is comparable to the results from four cycles of fe0 h2o2 treatment li et al 2020b the three cycles of ultrasound fe0 pms treatment liu et al 2020 and the zero cycle of electrochemical fe2 pms treatment yang et al 2020 see table 3 indicating the strong stability of the nta fe0 cao2 approach in addition cost benefit analysis explains that the annual cost of the nta fe0 cao2 treatment for 750 0 ton year sludge is approximately usd 47625 0 table 4 under the optimum conditions which is significantly lower than those of fecl3 cao process usd 54750 0 liu et al 2016 and fenton s reagent cao process usd 106200 0 liang et al 2020a thus the nta fe0 cao2 process could be a cost effective technology for ad sludge dewaterability more importantly the nta fe0 cao2 process has a competitive advantage over the traditional fenton or fenton like treatments especially at near neutral ph 6 0 where traditional fenton or fenton like treatments cannot achieve satisfactory sludge dewatering results zhang et al 2015 to further minimize the operational cost the pure fe0 powder could be replaced with scrap iron a waste from machinery industries however owing to its bigger particle size smaller specific surface area the effectiveness with scrap iron in the nta fe cao2 process should be further investigated the fe rich dewatered sludge may be in favor of subsequent resource utilization including fertilizer wang et al 2020 and environment friendly functional material ai et al 2019 as long as the low environmental risk of heavy metals in the dewatered ad sludge is achieved in addition iron based materials may also be dosed prior dewatering step e g into the ad reactor which could facilitate the solids reduction and methane production yan et al 2020 and could promote the phosphorus recovery via vivianite prot et al 2020 at the end of digestion cao2 and nta could be then added into digester liquor to develop the cost effective nta fe0 cao2 process for ad sludge dewatering additionally such promising nta fe0 cao2 process should still be further explored to demonstrate its feasibility and stability in pilot or large scale applications it should be noted that the effects of environmental factors i e temperature dissolved organic matter dom contents and inherent metal irons in the sludge and cao2 dissolution rate on the ad sludge dewaterability in the nta fe0 cao2 process at neutral ph is also worthy to be investigated in the future in order to further boost the development and application of the nta fe0 cao2 process a future study to identify the hydrophilic molecules using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry gc ms is essential as well which would be conducive to further understand the sludge dewatering mechanism 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the feasibility of nta fe0 cao2 process to improve ad sludge dewaterability the main conclusions are 1 the nta fe0 cao2 treatment remarkably enhanced the ad sludge dewaterability at near neutral ph this method is more stable and economical compared to conventional fenton or fenton like process 2 under near neutral conditions ph 6 0 fe0 still acted as an effective catalyst because the fe0 corrosion fe2 stability and the turnover of fe2 fe3 were remarkably enhanced by the presence of nta which in turn accelerated h2o2 decomposition and oh production 3 refractory and sticky biopolymers i e hmw ps lmw pn hs building blocks and lmw neutrals the hydrophilic functional groups i e co stretch c h c n stretch co symmetric stretching of coo groups c oh and c o and the hydrophilic structure of pn molecules i e α helix in the lb eps and tb eps were largely reduced which induced the release of bound water fe2 fe3 flocculated the dissociative sludge flocs and decreased the viscosity of sludge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17672,micro nanoplastics have raised worldwide concern with extensive research on its transfer toxicity and removal however the primary environmental process adsorption of nanoplastics has not been uncovered since the discovery of nanosized plastics here we synthesized nanoscale polystyrene ps particles with mean diameter of 40 nm to avoid unknown properties from purchased ones and thoroughly investigated its adsorption towards two typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps with distinct characteristics which are antibiotic ciprofloxacin and endocrine disruptor bisphenol a moreover uv radiation is applied to simulate aging process in natural cases and the carbonyl index derived from ftir spectra increased clearly from 0 183 to 0 387 the adsorption capacity at equilibrium of cip and bpa increased from 0 15 to 4 07 to 4 92 and 8 71 mg g after weathering respectively besides the effect of environmental factors ph humic acid salinity and cations was also studied furthermore electrosorption technology is applied to remove nanoplastics in solution for the first time with the capacity of 0 707 g nano polystyrene g ac and 0 322 g aged nano polystyrene g ac suggesting that adsorption under electric field is presumably a feasible tertiary treatment method targeted at nanoplastics in wastewater treatment plants wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics nanoplastics interfacial interaction removal electrosorption 1 introduction nanoplastics with size smaller than ca 200 nm have occurred in natural aqueous environment ter halle et al 2017 there are mainly two origins of nanosized plastic particles one is the direct release from waterborne paints biomedical products and personal care products containing microbeads such as facial scrubs hernandez et al 2017 wagner and reemtsma 2019 and the other is the fragmentation of macro micro plastics under physical abrasion for example washing fibrous materials and weathering processes lambert and wagner 2016 wagner and reemtsma 2019 conventional wastewater treatment plant wwtp is a large source and sink of microplastics at the same time as it can intercept most large sized plastics and release small sized plastics long et al 2019 sun et al 2019 currently the removal efficiency of microplastics larger than 20 μm can reach 97 in wwtps with tertiary treatment processes such as filtration floatation and membrane bio reactor mbr sun et al 2019 among which mbr is the most efficient one with reported efficiency over 99 lares et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017 still the removal rate in other cases is varied 79 3 97 8 long et al 2019 up to now no data on the removal of nanoplastics have been reported considering the incomplete elimination of microplastics and large volume of treated water wwtp is definitely a huge source of nanoplastics the micro nano plastics in the effluent will exert adverse effects to organisms in the receiving water microplastics can be adsorbed on the shell and accumulate into stomach and digestive systems of mussels causing serious histological change and inflammatory response on the tissue and cellular level arossa et al 2019 von moos et al 2012 besides the growth and reproduction of a freshwater amphipod was greatly suppressed under microplastics exposure au et al 2015 when the size of plastic becomes nanoscale it can adsorb and release more chemicals due to larger surface to volume ratio more importantly it is more active biologically i e higher potential for uptake into cells and tissue oberdorster et al 2005 wagner and reemtsma 2019 polystyrene ps nanoplastic affects shoot and root development of macrophytes more significantly than the counterpart in micro size van weert et al 2019 in addition the reduction of population and chlorophyll concentration in algae and elevated neonate malformation rate of zooplankter under nano ps exposure have been proved besseling et al 2014 therefore nanoplastic targeted removal technology are urgently needed to sustain the resilience of aquatic ecosystems during the transport of nanoplastics in natural aqueous environment adsorption of contaminants and weathering under physiochemical stresses such as light and current shearing are inevitable processes yuan et al 2020b microplastics accumulate in the vicinity of shorelines due to sewage discharge especially in populous areas browne et al 2011 providing the opportunity of coexisting with emerging micropollutants ppcps for example ciprofloxacin cip and bisphenol a bpa cip is an anti bacterial agent which can induce antibiotic resistance for abuse and bpa is used as plastic additive but with strong estrogenic activity wang et al 2019a furthermore the toxicity of microplastics can be severely altered after adsorbing pollutants zhu et al 2019 however the surface interaction between aged nanoplastics and pollutants is still blank which has been systematically investigated here with underlying mechanism aimed at microplastics various newly proposed technologies are reported including photodegradation tofa et al 2019 catalysis assisted hydrothermal hydrolysis kang et al 2019 magnetic extraction shen et al 2020 microbial degradation yuan et al 2020a and photocatalytic micromotors wang et al 2019b except traditional methods such as electro coagulation ma et al 2019 and membrane separation li et al 2020 however ways to remove nanoplastics have not been covered as of yet electrochemical methods are independent of chemical reagents and microorganisms thus minimizing the amount of sludge which can be easily coupled into wwtps zhang and chen 2020 capacitive deionization cdi is widely applied in separation of charged ions via the formation of electrical double layer edl ma et al 2020a porada et al 2013 enlightened by cdi we adopted electrosorption technique i e adsorption assisted by electric field to adsorb nano ps for the first time in this paper and results showed an average removal capacity of 0 707 and 0 322 g nanoplastic g ac for nano polystyrene nps and aged nps respectively overall electrosorption holds great potential towards removing nanoplastics in water with further enhancement from microplastics to nanoplastics adsorption rate and maximum capacity between plastics and pollutants is not monotonously increased due to elevated surface area as predicted and the influence of dimension reduction to interfacial interaction is closely related to the type of plastics and pollutants furthermore bpa and cip display totally different adsorption behavior towards nanoplastics the sorption capacity of hydrophobic bpa is enhanced more significantly than cip after aging treatment to nanoplastics while cip is more susceptible to environmental factors this paper sets a foundation to future research on nanoplastics adsorption and deepens the understanding of nanoplastics behaviors in aqueous environment combining with removal via electrosorption 2 materials and methods 2 1

potential of micro nano plastics as contaminant carriers was determined through adsorption experiments micro nano plastics with different particle sizes nps ps pvc s pvc l and pollutants with different properties cip bpa were selected besides aged nps was used to investigate the effect of aging process on adsorption behavior the adsorption experiments were carried out in 30 ml glass bottles each of which contained 10 mg micro nano plastics and 20 ml cip or bpa solution the bottles were placed in a thermostatic shaker ts 2102c shanghai tensuc experimental instrument manufacturing co ltd china under a constant temperature of 298k at 150 rpm each datapoint was run in duplicate with a blank sample adsorption kinetics were evaluated in a given time interval 1 2 4 8 16 20 24 36 and 48 h to determine the adsorption equilibrium time adsorption isotherms were carried out with cip or bpa concentrations ranging from 2 to 50 mg l ph values between 3 and 11 were adjusted by adding hcl or naoh the effect of salinity on adsorption were conducted by manipulating nacl concentration 5 10 15 25 and 35 and different amount of cacl2 and mgcl2 were added to study the effect of cation types and ionic strength pollutant solutions with humic acid ha concentration from 0 to 40 mg l were prepared to simulate the influence of natural organic matter nom after adsorption reaching equilibrium supernatant was obtained by using 0 22 or 0 02 μm membrane filter the concentration of cip and bpa was detected by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer uv2310ⅱ shanghai techcomp scientific instrument co ltd china at the wavelength of 275 and 266 nm respectively the following formula was used to determine the adsorption capacity q c 0 c i v m where q mg g is the adsorption capacity for cip or bpa c0 and ci mg l are the initial and equilibrium concentration of pollutant solutions v ml is the solution volume and m mg is the adsorbent mass the fitting models of the adsorption kinetics and isotherms are given in the supporting information 2 5 electrochemical removal experiments electrode fabrication activated carbon ac electrode was prepared as follows ac acetylene black and polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf were mixed under magnetic stirring at the ratio of 8 1 1 after 30 min n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp was added with consecutive agitation for 24 h to obtain homogeneous slurry which was then coated on graphite paper and dried at 60 c for 12 h under vacuum to remove redundant solvent the graphite paper was pretreated with ethanol to clear adsorbed impurities the thickness of ac electrode is 75 μm and the mass loading is 9 2 1 8 mg two electrodes with similar mass were applied in one electrosorption test electrosorption performance test the handcrafted electrosorption apparatus is composed of power source provided by battery testing system land electrode clampers ac electrodes and nps aged nps solution and the schematic diagram is shown in fig 7a the distance between cathode and anode is 1 cm nps aged nps solutions were prepared as follows 80 mg sample was added in 230 ml deionized water and the mixture was treated by ultrasonic crusher for 90 min 1 s on 1 s off to enhance dissolution of nanoparticles into water the voltage between two electrodes changed from 1 2 to 1 2 v equal to one charging process ac electrodes were dried at 60 c for 12 h after electrosorption test and the mass difference of electrodes was determined by analytical balance the adsorption capacity is determined as follows q m f m i n a c t i v e m a t e r i a l where q mg g is the electrosorption capacity mf and mi g are anode or cathode mass after and before electrosorption respectively n g is the mass of active material in anode or cathode 2 6 characterization the morphological properties of microplastics and nanoplastics were characterized by scanning electron microscope sem quanta feg fei co usa and transmission electron microscope tem jeol 2010f japan the surface wettability was tested by water contact angle admeasuring apparatus wca jc2000d2w powereach co china the crystallinity and chemical structure were reflected by x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker germany and fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nexus 670 thermo nicolet co usa respectively the elemental composition of nanoplastics before and after aging was analyzed by the energy dispersive spectrometer eds system of sem in addition the nanoplastics were separated and dried after adsorption and then characterized by ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher escalab 250xi thermo fisher scientific co usa to study the adsorption mechanisms the surface potential of nanoplastics at different ph values were measured using zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern instruments ltd uk 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nanoplastics fig 1 a shows the morphology and size of synthesized nps it can be seen that nps are regular microspheres with an average particle size of 40 1 9 1 nm and calculated uniformity ratio of 1 15 indicating that particle size distribution is relatively uneven details in formula s1 and fig s2 however this coincides with real environment after the uv radiation experiment the external color of aged nps turns to yellow significantly compared with pristine nps fig 1b owing to the photo degradation induced by unsaturated chromophoric groups gewert et al 2015 hu et al 2019 rosu et al 2009 wang et al 2020 sem images fig 1c exhibit the surface changes of nps before and after uv aging indicating that the surface of aged nps is slightly deformed and irregular which may be due to partial breakage caused by light degradation hüffer et al 2018 based on eds analysis fig 1d ps nanoplastics mainly include c and o and the content of o increases after uv irradiation suggesting the formation of oxygen containing groups which can be testified by element content from xps table s6 and the reduction of water contact angle wca fig 1e shen et al 2018 still the wca of nanoplastics before and after aging are both over 90 indicating relatively hydrophobic adsorption surface the position of characteristic peaks in ftir spectra for nano sized ps is the same as micro sized ps fig 1f and fig s1 photodegradation will trigger surface functional group change especially for carbonyl determined 1648 1780 cm 1 therefore the carbonyl index ci is a typical proxy of aging degree defined as the ratio of the maximum absorbance of carbonyl band at 1739 cm 1 to the symmetric stretching band of ch2 at 2850 cm 1 for ps mylläri et al 2015 ci value increases from 0 183 to 0 378 after 120 h uv irradiation which is consistent with eds analysis the weak alteration of ftir spectra is probably ascribed to unique anti aging property of polystyrene and short irradiation time on the other hand nanoscale polystyrene might be more resistive to aging than microscale one mylläri et al 2015 besides xrd indicates no crystallinity change fig 1g additionally nanoplastics have negative surface charge over wide ph range fig 1h as the ph value of solution increases the surface charge value of nanoplastics becomes more negative overall ultraviolet radiation can accelerate nanoplastic aging inducing physical deformation and surface chemical composition changes 3 2 comparison of adsorption behavior between microplastics and nanoplastics the reduction of size affects adsorption rate for ps and pvc in different ways fig 2 a b when the dimension of ps becomes nanoscale the rate constant for cip declines obviously which might be due to severe competitive adsorption at surface while the rate constant for bpa remains unchanged basically however when the diameter of pvc is reduced from 74 μm to 1 μm it adsorbs cip more quickly but more sluggishly for bpa table s2 the isotherms of four plastics for cip are fitted well by langmuir model fig 2c indicating monolayer adsorption onto surface from ps to nps and pvc l to pvc s the adsorption capacity at equilibrium for cip becomes lower for bpa adsorption the isotherms of four plastics cannot be properly interpreted by models fig 2d it is inferred that the adsorption capacity reach saturated at relatively low concentration and thus the capacity at different initial bpa concentration seems to fluctuate around a mean value taking the average adsorption capacity of all datapoints as an indicator fig 2e the equilibrium capacity for bpa become higher when the size of ps and pvc shrinks which is opposite to cip from fig 2a and c the highest capacity for cip comes from pvc other than ps which is due to the participation of halogen bond arising from chorine atom as electron acceptor liu et al 2019b wu et al 2019b besides distribution coefficient k d is applied to explore the affinity of plastics to pollutants k d cm ce at single concentration point k d values of all data point on the isotherms were taken to obtain the average value bakir et al 2012 2014 noticeably k d value of four plastics for bpa are all higher than cip meaning that plastics hold greater adsorption affinity for bpa and stressing the importance of hydrophobic interaction in bpa logkow 3 64 2 5 adsorption overall the decrease of plastic size will present totally different adsorption behavior which is strongly dependent on the type of plastic and pollutant therefore plastics travelling in open environment will exhibits variable adsorption processes after degraded into nanoscale 3 3 comparison of adsorption behavior between nanoplastics and aged nanoplastics aging process exerts contrary influence on the kinetics of cip and bpa fig 3 a and b the rate constant of cip adsorption is enhanced evidently after weathering which is likely due to stronger electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond induced by extra oxygen containing groups ocgs li et al 2019 ma et al 2020b 2020c however the rate of bpa adsorption onto aged nps is reduced which might result from the steric hindrance of uneven surface besides the fitting results of webber morris model were all deviated from original data indicating that internal particle diffusion is not the only diffusion pathway and surface diffusion including external particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion is also important in the adsorption process lopez ramon et al 2019 wu et al 2019b the isotherms of aged nps are better illustrated by freundlich model fig 3c and d suggesting multi layer adsorption created by pores and cracks after aging referring as pore filling mechanism liu et al 2019b in addition the maximum adsorption capacity of cip and bpa is elevated significantly after aging especially for bpa proving that aging will introduce more adsorption sites at surface moreover dubinin radushkevich model suggests e value less than 8 kj mol for nps and aged nps adsorption revealing that the adsorption process was dominated by physical and noncovalent interactions including electrostatic interplay hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bond and π π interaction which can be corroborated by ftir and xps spectra change basically there were no noteworthy changes in ftir spectra figs s4a and s4b verifying that noncovalent interplay dominants in cip and bpa adsorption by nanoplastics rather than the formation of covalent bonds the peak at around 3430 cm 1 was attributed to hydroxy or carboxy moieties and hydrogen bonds between molecules and its disappearance confirms the existence of hydrogen bonding during adsorption figs s4d and s4f liu et al 2019a after adsorbing cip and bpa molecule the intensity of peat at approximately 1600 cm 1 which is assigned to aromatic cc bond alters obviously especially for aged nps confirming the role of π π interaction figs s4c and s4e liu et al 2020 based on xps the amount of c and o on nanoplastics surface altered after adsorption moreover n and f appeared representing adsorbed cip table s6 besides the emergence of c n and c oh subpeaks confirm the adsorption of pollutants fig 4 a b c1s subpeak of aged nps at 284 3 ev ascribed to aromatic c h is enhanced after adsorption lu et al 2018 which could be viewed as a characteristic for aged nps adsorption besides the peak at around 291 7 ev pertaining to phenyl rings is slightly decreased certificating π π interaction liu et al 2019c o1s peaks move to lower binding energy fig 4c d which is an indicator of electron transfer from contaminants to adsorbents after adsorption o c o oh subpeak at 532 8ev appears as a sign of hydrogen bonding moreover this peak takes larger proportion in aged nps revealing significant role of ocgs in aged nanoplastics 3 4 influence of environmental factors on nps and aged nps 3 4 1 ph and humic acid ph as ph increases aged nps presents analogous trend as nps but with a stronger extent resulting from more ocgs and crevices at surface when ph goes from acidic to basic cip becomes electronegative due to dissociation and intense electrostatic repulsion between cip and negatively charged plastic surface fig 1h leads to capacity drop fig 5 a ma et al 2020c similarly the capacity of bpa goes down at around pka 9 60 fig 5c besides the capacity of cip is suppressed at extremely acidic environment because of competitive adsorption between cip and h to summarize ph primarily affects the electrostatic interaction between plastic and pollutants to change adsorption behavior and the migration of nanoplastics from acidic or neutral environment to basic environment is likely to induce the desorption of cip and bpa ha humic acid a main component of natural organic matter exerts almost the same influence on the adsorption of nps and aged nps however the adsorption performance of bpa and cip affected by ha is totally different the capacity of cip is prominently enhanced as ha concentration increases fig 5b zhao et al 2011 because the introduction of ha makes solution acidic and strengthens the attraction between cip and nanoplastic ha besides ha can form ha adlayer easily due to hydrophobicity and aromaticity engendering strong affinity towards pollutants lian et al 2015 when the ha concentration is extremely high the cip adsorption begins to drop which might result from the spatial block of ha and aggregation of nanoplastics li et al 2018 wu et al 2019a on the other hand bpa adsorption is marginally affected by ha as bpa is of neutral charge in acidic environment fig 5d basically the effect of ha follows the rule governing in ph 3 4 2 salinity and cations salinity evidently the adsorption capacity of aged nps is higher than nps in any salinity and they present the same pattern under changing salinity besides salinity affects cip adsorption more significantly than bpa the adsorption capacity of cip increases firstly and then decreases reaching its maximum at 15 salinity fig 6 a it is speculated that the presence of salt will compress the electric double layer edl at the adsorbent surface leading to the formation of nanoplastic cluster which resembles the coagulation mechanism with fe3 or al3 salts nanoplastic particle cluster presumably exerts stronger electrostatic interaction to cip compared with single particulate thus promoting the adsorption capacity liu et al 2019d quan et al 2019 however nacl can be a competitor when in extremely high salinity and reduce the capacity liu et al 2018 salinity has marginal effect on bpa adsorption in general fig 6b for which bpa adsorption is mainly controlled by hydrophobic interaction under neutral environment still the tiny increase of capacity till 25 salinity can be explained by salting out effect besides the increase of salinity will reduce the solubility of non polar and weakly polar organic pollutants in water which leads to the relatively easy adsorption of pollutants by nanoplastics alimi et al 2018 tourinho et al 2019 overall cip adsorption to nanoplastics is more susceptible to ocean water with different salinity cations divalent cations mg2 ca2 exerts different influence on cip and bpa adsorption compared with monovalent cation na na have both positive and negative impacts on adsorption while mg2 and ca2 basically attenuate cip or bpa adsorption with increasing cation concentration which might be due to irreversible aggregation of nanoplastics and squeezing out effect cho et al 2011 gigault et al 2018 wu et al 2019a besides divalent cations hold two charges and thus compete with contaminants more strongly than na moreover the inhibition effect of ca2 is more obvious especially in the adsorption of bpa to nps fig 6c which is possibly related to smaller radius of solvated ca2 0 271 nm than mg2 0 299 nm marcus 1991 additionally divalent cations affect cip and bpa adsorption in different patterns at low cation concentration fig 6c d the capacity of bpa is slightly enhanced when cation concentration 0 1 mol l while the capacity for cip is weakened 3 5 electrochemical removal of nanoplastics a handmade electrosorption device is shown in fig 7 a after electro sorption process white precipitate can be clearly seen on the electrode surface fig 7b showing that nanoplastics removal by electro sorption is feasible the average removal capacity for nps and aged nps is 0 707 and 0 322 g plastic g ac respectively fig 7c for carbon based electrodes positively charged anode can attract negatively charged particles and form an electrical double layer at the electrode surface and the adsorption amount is determined by the specific capacity of electrode i e total charge accumulated at the electrode surface the solubility of prepared nano ps is relatively low as a result of nanoparticle aggregation and blank surface modification so ultrasonic pretreatment was applied to facilitate dissolution distinct tyndall effect can be observed by red laser after ultrasonication fig s5 which was a strong evidence of colloids with particulate diameter at the range of 1 100 nm besides this effect was still observable after 10 days indicating the stability of nps aged nps solutions however the particle concentration is not determined here according to zeta potential test fig 1h nps and aged nps spheres display negative charges on the surface indicating that they can be removed by electrostatic attraction with anode cv curve fig s6a of ac electrode confirms that no other redox reactions occur during charging and discharging process one charging process half cycle is applied to cdi device to circumvent the desorption of adsorbed nanoparticles during discharging in this proof of concept fig 7a the voltage profile from 1 2 to 1 2 v is shown in fig s6b and the large ohmic drop is presumably derived from low conductivity of solutions besides different charging time for nps and aged nps solutions is due to the different mass loading of ac electrodes and overall ohmic resistance the efficiency can be further improved through adjusting operation parameters including electrode distance electrode material and current density for example a small current density leads to prolonged discharging time and therefore higher energy consumption while the time for nanoparticles to move towards electrode surface is not enough under a high current density under the influence of electric field chain scission products of nano ps particles are likely to dissolve into water and styrene monomers with oxygen containing terminal groups are degraded products of ps in general gewert et al 2015 2018 besides a tiny part of active material and adhesive from electrodes might release without the cover of ionic exchange membranes therefore the impacts of electrochemical tertiary treatment to nanoplastics separation in water still need further investigation overall cdi is a promising technology to clear nanoplastics because of easy operation and less chemically intensive but careful design of electrode and configuration such as applying ionic exchange membranes is required to avoid secondary pollution considering that natural nanoplastics could contain additives and adsorb pops on their surface 4 conclusions in this work the adsorption behavior of synthesized polystyrene nanoparticles to typical micropollutants is thoroughly studied with special concern on the influence of aging and various environmental factors the adsorption capacity of nanoplastics is over microplastics for hydrophobic organic pollutants especially at higher initial concentration aging as a crucial environmental driving force can boost the capacity for both cip and bpa with bpa to larger extent the interplay mechanism between nanosized ps and different pollutants is distinct hydrophobic interaction and π π stacking are crucial for bpa adsorbing onto nanoplastics thus the adsorption of bpa is not obviously affected by environmental conditions while electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding are dominant in cip adsorption particularly for aged nanoplastics with more interfacial oxygen containing groups this work provides a comprehensive portrait of nanoplastic adsorption with hydrophilic and hydrophobic contaminants based on lab results more significantly electrosorption is proposed to remove nanoplastics from water and the efficiency is believed to be enhanced via advanced design for future research collecting nanoplastics samples from environment to analyze surface chemistry is encouraged and the adsorption behavior change with different aging degrees should be revealed besides more attention should be paid to nanoplastics in wwtps along with

17672,micro nanoplastics have raised worldwide concern with extensive research on its transfer toxicity and removal however the primary environmental process adsorption of nanoplastics has not been uncovered since the discovery of nanosized plastics here we synthesized nanoscale polystyrene ps particles with mean diameter of 40 nm to avoid unknown properties from purchased ones and thoroughly investigated its adsorption towards two typical pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps with distinct characteristics which are antibiotic ciprofloxacin and endocrine disruptor bisphenol a moreover uv radiation is applied to simulate aging process in natural cases and the carbonyl index derived from ftir spectra increased clearly from 0 183 to 0 387 the adsorption capacity at equilibrium of cip and bpa increased from 0 15 to 4 07 to 4 92 and 8 71 mg g after weathering respectively besides the effect of environmental factors ph humic acid salinity and cations was also studied furthermore electrosorption technology is applied to remove nanoplastics in solution for the first time with the capacity of 0 707 g nano polystyrene g ac and 0 322 g aged nano polystyrene g ac suggesting that adsorption under electric field is presumably a feasible tertiary treatment method targeted at nanoplastics in wastewater treatment plants wwtps graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics nanoplastics interfacial interaction removal electrosorption 1 introduction nanoplastics with size smaller than ca 200 nm have occurred in natural aqueous environment ter halle et al 2017 there are mainly two origins of nanosized plastic particles one is the direct release from waterborne paints biomedical products and personal care products containing microbeads such as facial scrubs hernandez et al 2017 wagner and reemtsma 2019 and the other is the fragmentation of macro micro plastics under physical abrasion for example washing fibrous materials and weathering processes lambert and wagner 2016 wagner and reemtsma 2019 conventional wastewater treatment plant wwtp is a large source and sink of microplastics at the same time as it can intercept most large sized plastics and release small sized plastics long et al 2019 sun et al 2019 currently the removal efficiency of microplastics larger than 20 μm can reach 97 in wwtps with tertiary treatment processes such as filtration floatation and membrane bio reactor mbr sun et al 2019 among which mbr is the most efficient one with reported efficiency over 99 lares et al 2018 talvitie et al 2017 still the removal rate in other cases is varied 79 3 97 8 long et al 2019 up to now no data on the removal of nanoplastics have been reported considering the incomplete elimination of microplastics and large volume of treated water wwtp is definitely a huge source of nanoplastics the micro nano plastics in the effluent will exert adverse effects to organisms in the receiving water microplastics can be adsorbed on the shell and accumulate into stomach and digestive systems of mussels causing serious histological change and inflammatory response on the tissue and cellular level arossa et al 2019 von moos et al 2012 besides the growth and reproduction of a freshwater amphipod was greatly suppressed under microplastics exposure au et al 2015 when the size of plastic becomes nanoscale it can adsorb and release more chemicals due to larger surface to volume ratio more importantly it is more active biologically i e higher potential for uptake into cells and tissue oberdorster et al 2005 wagner and reemtsma 2019 polystyrene ps nanoplastic affects shoot and root development of macrophytes more significantly than the counterpart in micro size van weert et al 2019 in addition the reduction of population and chlorophyll concentration in algae and elevated neonate malformation rate of zooplankter under nano ps exposure have been proved besseling et al 2014 therefore nanoplastic targeted removal technology are urgently needed to sustain the resilience of aquatic ecosystems during the transport of nanoplastics in natural aqueous environment adsorption of contaminants and weathering under physiochemical stresses such as light and current shearing are inevitable processes yuan et al 2020b microplastics accumulate in the vicinity of shorelines due to sewage discharge especially in populous areas browne et al 2011 providing the opportunity of coexisting with emerging micropollutants ppcps for example ciprofloxacin cip and bisphenol a bpa cip is an anti bacterial agent which can induce antibiotic resistance for abuse and bpa is used as plastic additive but with strong estrogenic activity wang et al 2019a furthermore the toxicity of microplastics can be severely altered after adsorbing pollutants zhu et al 2019 however the surface interaction between aged nanoplastics and pollutants is still blank which has been systematically investigated here with underlying mechanism aimed at microplastics various newly proposed technologies are reported including photodegradation tofa et al 2019 catalysis assisted hydrothermal hydrolysis kang et al 2019 magnetic extraction shen et al 2020 microbial degradation yuan et al 2020a and photocatalytic micromotors wang et al 2019b except traditional methods such as electro coagulation ma et al 2019 and membrane separation li et al 2020 however ways to remove nanoplastics have not been covered as of yet electrochemical methods are independent of chemical reagents and microorganisms thus minimizing the amount of sludge which can be easily coupled into wwtps zhang and chen 2020 capacitive deionization cdi is widely applied in separation of charged ions via the formation of electrical double layer edl ma et al 2020a porada et al 2013 enlightened by cdi we adopted electrosorption technique i e adsorption assisted by electric field to adsorb nano ps for the first time in this paper and results showed an average removal capacity of 0 707 and 0 322 g nanoplastic g ac for nano polystyrene nps and aged nps respectively overall electrosorption holds great potential towards removing nanoplastics in water with further enhancement from microplastics to nanoplastics adsorption rate and maximum capacity between plastics and pollutants is not monotonously increased due to elevated surface area as predicted and the influence of dimension reduction to interfacial interaction is closely related to the type of plastics and pollutants furthermore bpa and cip display totally different adsorption behavior towards nanoplastics the sorption capacity of hydrophobic bpa is enhanced more significantly than cip after aging treatment to nanoplastics while cip is more susceptible to environmental factors this paper sets a foundation to future research on nanoplastics adsorption and deepens the understanding of nanoplastics behaviors in aqueous environment combining with removal via electrosorption 2 materials and methods 2 1

coincides with real environment after the uv radiation experiment the external color of aged nps turns to yellow significantly compared with pristine nps fig 1b owing to the photo degradation induced by unsaturated chromophoric groups gewert et al 2015 hu et al 2019 rosu et al 2009 wang et al 2020 sem images fig 1c exhibit the surface changes of nps before and after uv aging indicating that the surface of aged nps is slightly deformed and irregular which may be due to partial breakage caused by light degradation hüffer et al 2018 based on eds analysis fig 1d ps nanoplastics mainly include c and o and the content of o increases after uv irradiation suggesting the formation of oxygen containing groups which can be testified by element content from xps table s6 and the reduction of water contact angle wca fig 1e shen et al 2018 still the wca of nanoplastics before and after aging are both over 90 indicating relatively hydrophobic adsorption surface the position of characteristic peaks in ftir spectra for nano sized ps is the same as micro sized ps fig 1f and fig s1 photodegradation will trigger surface functional group change especially for carbonyl determined 1648 1780 cm 1 therefore the carbonyl index ci is a typical proxy of aging degree defined as the ratio of the maximum absorbance of carbonyl band at 1739 cm 1 to the symmetric stretching band of ch2 at 2850 cm 1 for ps mylläri et al 2015 ci value increases from 0 183 to 0 378 after 120 h uv irradiation which is consistent with eds analysis the weak alteration of ftir spectra is probably ascribed to unique anti aging property of polystyrene and short irradiation time on the other hand nanoscale polystyrene might be more resistive to aging than microscale one mylläri et al 2015 besides xrd indicates no crystallinity change fig 1g additionally nanoplastics have negative surface charge over wide ph range fig 1h as the ph value of solution increases the surface charge value of nanoplastics becomes more negative overall ultraviolet radiation can accelerate nanoplastic aging inducing physical deformation and surface chemical composition changes 3 2 comparison of adsorption behavior between microplastics and nanoplastics the reduction of size affects adsorption rate for ps and pvc in different ways fig 2 a b when the dimension of ps becomes nanoscale the rate constant for cip declines obviously which might be due to severe competitive adsorption at surface while the rate constant for bpa remains unchanged basically however when the diameter of pvc is reduced from 74 μm to 1 μm it adsorbs cip more quickly but more sluggishly for bpa table s2 the isotherms of four plastics for cip are fitted well by langmuir model fig 2c indicating monolayer adsorption onto surface from ps to nps and pvc l to pvc s the adsorption capacity at equilibrium for cip becomes lower for bpa adsorption the isotherms of four plastics cannot be properly interpreted by models fig 2d it is inferred that the adsorption capacity reach saturated at relatively low concentration and thus the capacity at different initial bpa concentration seems to fluctuate around a mean value taking the average adsorption capacity of all datapoints as an indicator fig 2e the equilibrium capacity for bpa become higher when the size of ps and pvc shrinks which is opposite to cip from fig 2a and c the highest capacity for cip comes from pvc other than ps which is due to the participation of halogen bond arising from chorine atom as electron acceptor liu et al 2019b wu et al 2019b besides distribution coefficient k d is applied to explore the affinity of plastics to pollutants k d cm ce at single concentration point k d values of all data point on the isotherms were taken to obtain the average value bakir et al 2012 2014 noticeably k d value of four plastics for bpa are all higher than cip meaning that plastics hold greater adsorption affinity for bpa and stressing the importance of hydrophobic interaction in bpa logkow 3 64 2 5 adsorption overall the decrease of plastic size will present totally different adsorption behavior which is strongly dependent on the type of plastic and pollutant therefore plastics travelling in open environment will exhibits variable adsorption processes after degraded into nanoscale 3 3 comparison of adsorption behavior between nanoplastics and aged nanoplastics aging process exerts contrary influence on the kinetics of cip and bpa fig 3 a and b the rate constant of cip adsorption is enhanced evidently after weathering which is likely due to stronger electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond induced by extra oxygen containing groups ocgs li et al 2019 ma et al 2020b 2020c however the rate of bpa adsorption onto aged nps is reduced which might result from the steric hindrance of uneven surface besides the fitting results of webber morris model were all deviated from original data indicating that internal particle diffusion is not the only diffusion pathway and surface diffusion including external particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion is also important in the adsorption process lopez ramon et al 2019 wu et al 2019b the isotherms of aged nps are better illustrated by freundlich model fig 3c and d suggesting multi layer adsorption created by pores and cracks after aging referring as pore filling mechanism liu et al 2019b in addition the maximum adsorption capacity of cip and bpa is elevated significantly after aging especially for bpa proving that aging will introduce more adsorption sites at surface moreover dubinin radushkevich model suggests e value less than 8 kj mol for nps and aged nps adsorption revealing that the adsorption process was dominated by physical and noncovalent interactions including electrostatic interplay hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bond and π π interaction which can be corroborated by ftir and xps spectra change basically there were no noteworthy changes in ftir spectra figs s4a and s4b verifying that noncovalent interplay dominants in cip and bpa adsorption by nanoplastics rather than the formation of covalent bonds the peak at around 3430 cm 1 was attributed to hydroxy or carboxy moieties and hydrogen bonds between molecules and its disappearance confirms the existence of hydrogen bonding during adsorption figs s4d and s4f liu et al 2019a after adsorbing cip and bpa molecule the intensity of peat at approximately 1600 cm 1 which is assigned to aromatic cc bond alters obviously especially for aged nps confirming the role of π π interaction figs s4c and s4e liu et al 2020 based on xps the amount of c and o on nanoplastics surface altered after adsorption moreover n and f appeared representing adsorbed cip table s6 besides the emergence of c n and c oh subpeaks confirm the adsorption of pollutants fig 4 a b c1s subpeak of aged nps at 284 3 ev ascribed to aromatic c h is enhanced after adsorption lu et al 2018 which could be viewed as a characteristic for aged nps adsorption besides the peak at around 291 7 ev pertaining to phenyl rings is slightly decreased certificating π π interaction liu et al 2019c o1s peaks move to lower binding energy fig 4c d which is an indicator of electron transfer from contaminants to adsorbents after adsorption o c o oh subpeak at 532 8ev appears as a sign of hydrogen bonding moreover this peak takes larger proportion in aged nps revealing significant role of ocgs in aged nanoplastics 3 4 influence of environmental factors on nps and aged nps 3 4 1 ph and humic acid ph as ph increases aged nps presents analogous trend as nps but with a stronger extent resulting from more ocgs and crevices at surface when ph goes from acidic to basic cip becomes electronegative due to dissociation and intense electrostatic repulsion between cip and negatively charged plastic surface fig 1h leads to capacity drop fig 5 a ma et al 2020c similarly the capacity of bpa goes down at around pka 9 60 fig 5c besides the capacity of cip is suppressed at extremely acidic environment because of competitive adsorption between cip and h to summarize ph primarily affects the electrostatic interaction between plastic and pollutants to change adsorption behavior and the migration of nanoplastics from acidic or neutral environment to basic environment is likely to induce the desorption of cip and bpa ha humic acid a main component of natural organic matter exerts almost the same influence on the adsorption of nps and aged nps however the adsorption performance of bpa and cip affected by ha is totally different the capacity of cip is prominently enhanced as ha concentration increases fig 5b zhao et al 2011 because the introduction of ha makes solution acidic and strengthens the attraction between cip and nanoplastic ha besides ha can form ha adlayer easily due to hydrophobicity and aromaticity engendering strong affinity towards pollutants lian et al 2015 when the ha concentration is extremely high the cip adsorption begins to drop which might result from the spatial block of ha and aggregation of nanoplastics li et al 2018 wu et al 2019a on the other hand bpa adsorption is marginally affected by ha as bpa is of neutral charge in acidic environment fig 5d basically the effect of ha follows the rule governing in ph 3 4 2 salinity and cations salinity evidently the adsorption capacity of aged nps is higher than nps in any salinity and they present the same pattern under changing salinity besides salinity affects cip adsorption more significantly than bpa the adsorption capacity of cip increases firstly and then decreases reaching its maximum at 15 salinity fig 6 a it is speculated that the presence of salt will compress the electric double layer edl at the adsorbent surface leading to the formation of nanoplastic cluster which resembles the coagulation mechanism with fe3 or al3 salts nanoplastic particle cluster presumably exerts stronger electrostatic interaction to cip compared with single particulate thus promoting the adsorption capacity liu et al 2019d quan et al 2019 however nacl can be a competitor when in extremely high salinity and reduce the capacity liu et al 2018 salinity has marginal effect on bpa adsorption in general fig 6b for which bpa adsorption is mainly controlled by hydrophobic interaction under neutral environment still the tiny increase of capacity till 25 salinity can be explained by salting out effect besides the increase of salinity will reduce the solubility of non polar and weakly polar organic pollutants in water which leads to the relatively easy adsorption of pollutants by nanoplastics alimi et al 2018 tourinho et al 2019 overall cip adsorption to nanoplastics is more susceptible to ocean water with different salinity cations divalent cations mg2 ca2 exerts different influence on cip and bpa adsorption compared with monovalent cation na na have both positive and negative impacts on adsorption while mg2 and ca2 basically attenuate cip or bpa adsorption with increasing cation concentration which might be due to irreversible aggregation of nanoplastics and squeezing out effect cho et al 2011 gigault et al 2018 wu et al 2019a besides divalent cations hold two charges and thus compete with contaminants more strongly than na moreover the inhibition effect of ca2 is more obvious especially in the adsorption of bpa to nps fig 6c which is possibly related to smaller radius of solvated ca2 0 271 nm than mg2 0 299 nm marcus 1991 additionally divalent cations affect cip and bpa adsorption in different patterns at low cation concentration fig 6c d the capacity of bpa is slightly enhanced when cation concentration 0 1 mol l while the capacity for cip is weakened 3 5 electrochemical removal of nanoplastics a handmade electrosorption device is shown in fig 7 a after electro sorption process white precipitate can be clearly seen on the electrode surface fig 7b showing that nanoplastics removal by electro sorption is feasible the average removal capacity for nps and aged nps is 0 707 and 0 322 g plastic g ac respectively fig 7c for carbon based electrodes positively charged anode can attract negatively charged particles and form an electrical double layer at the electrode surface and the adsorption amount is determined by the specific capacity of electrode i e total charge accumulated at the electrode surface the solubility of prepared nano ps is relatively low as a result of nanoparticle aggregation and blank surface modification so ultrasonic pretreatment was applied to facilitate dissolution distinct tyndall effect can be observed by red laser after ultrasonication fig s5 which was a strong evidence of colloids with particulate diameter at the range of 1 100 nm besides this effect was still observable after 10 days indicating the stability of nps aged nps solutions however the particle concentration is not determined here according to zeta potential test fig 1h nps and aged nps spheres display negative charges on the surface indicating that they can be removed by electrostatic attraction with anode cv curve fig s6a of ac electrode confirms that no other redox reactions occur during charging and discharging process one charging process half cycle is applied to cdi device to circumvent the desorption of adsorbed nanoparticles during discharging in this proof of concept fig 7a the voltage profile from 1 2 to 1 2 v is shown in fig s6b and the large ohmic drop is presumably derived from low conductivity of solutions besides different charging time for nps and aged nps solutions is due to the different mass loading of ac electrodes and overall ohmic resistance the efficiency can be further improved through adjusting operation parameters including electrode distance electrode material and current density for example a small current density leads to prolonged discharging time and therefore higher energy consumption while the time for nanoparticles to move towards electrode surface is not enough under a high current density under the influence of electric field chain scission products of nano ps particles are likely to dissolve into water and styrene monomers with oxygen containing terminal groups are degraded products of ps in general gewert et al 2015 2018 besides a tiny part of active material and adhesive from electrodes might release without the cover of ionic exchange membranes therefore the impacts of electrochemical tertiary treatment to nanoplastics separation in water still need further investigation overall cdi is a promising technology to clear nanoplastics because of easy operation and less chemically intensive but careful design of electrode and configuration such as applying ionic exchange membranes is required to avoid secondary pollution considering that natural nanoplastics could contain additives and adsorb pops on their surface 4 conclusions in this work the adsorption behavior of synthesized polystyrene nanoparticles to typical micropollutants is thoroughly studied with special concern on the influence of aging and various environmental factors the adsorption capacity of nanoplastics is over microplastics for hydrophobic organic pollutants especially at higher initial concentration aging as a crucial environmental driving force can boost the capacity for both cip and bpa with bpa to larger extent the interplay mechanism between nanosized ps and different pollutants is distinct hydrophobic interaction and π π stacking are crucial for bpa adsorbing onto nanoplastics thus the adsorption of bpa is not obviously affected by environmental conditions while electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding are dominant in cip adsorption particularly for aged nanoplastics with more interfacial oxygen containing groups this work provides a comprehensive portrait of nanoplastic adsorption with hydrophilic and hydrophobic contaminants based on lab results more significantly electrosorption is proposed to remove nanoplastics from water and the efficiency is believed to be enhanced via advanced design for future research collecting nanoplastics samples from environment to analyze surface chemistry is encouraged and the adsorption behavior change with different aging degrees should be revealed besides more attention should be paid to nanoplastics in wwtps along with relevant treatment technologies for safer water environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17673,this study examined effects of aquatic and soil natural organic matter nom exemplified by standard suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa respectively on the electrochemical ec reactivity and mass transfer properties of the cationic organic probe toluidine blue tb that forms complexes with nom ec measurements that were carried out using the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde showed that for disc potentials below 0 4 v vs the standard ag agcl reference electrode tb molecules undergo ec reduction accompanied by the formation of ec active products that undergo oxidation at the ring electrode ec reactions of tb in the range of potentials 0 2 to 0 4 v were determined to involve free tb cations and tb species adsorbed on the electrode surface the ec reduction of tb species at the disc potentials 0 4 v was controlled by the mass transfer of the free tb cations and tb nom complexes to the electrode surface formation of tb nom complexes caused the mass transfer controlled tb currents to undergo a consistent decrease the observed changes were correlated with the extent of tb nom complexation and decreases of the diffusion coefficients of tb nom complexes that have higher molecular weights mw than the free cations properties of the intermediates formed upon the reduction of tb cations were also affected by nom these results demonstrate that rrde measurements of ec reactions of tb or possibly other ec active probes allow probing the complexation of ec active organic species with nom and mass transfer properties of nom complexes and ultimately nom itself graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter nom rotating ring disc electrode rrde organic cations toluidine blue tb diffusion coefficient complexation 1 introduction natural organic matter nom comprises multiple compound classes e g fulvic and humic acids other nom fractions with varying hydrophilicities and proton affinities proteins polysaccharides and other components with highly varying molecular weights that range from several hundred to hundreds of thousands of daltons filella 2009 leenheer and croué 2003 determination of the molecular weights and other parameters for instance conformations radii and diffusion properties of nom molecules is non trivial due to their intrinsic heterogeneity and the presence of multiple types of reactive moieties in their structure and the resultant impossibility to find molecular weight standards that approximate sufficiently well nom properties as a result alternative experimental methods to determine molecular weights of nom for instance vapor pressure osmometry marinsky et al 1990 size exclusion chromatography brezinski and gorczyca 2019 her et al 2002 perminova et al 2003 flow field fractionation ham et al 2013 electrophoretic mobility mass spectroscopy hosse and wilkinson 2001 and several other methods baalousha et al 2006 egeberg et al 2002 fattahi and solouki 2003 tend to yield divergent results structurally nom molecules are dominated by aliphatic and aromatic units activated with carboxylic and hydroxyl groups quinone amine and thiol functionalities that are active in forming complexes with organic or inorganic ions kretzschmar 2004 due to these properties aquatic and soil nom affect the speciation mobility toxicity and fate of most aquatic and soil pollutants in natural environments benedetti et al 1995 cabaniss 2010 croue et al 2000 leenheer 2009 lu and allen 2002 römkens et al 1998 tipping 1998 given that nom can be only partially removed by any of the currently existing water treatment processes other than reverse osmosis nom continues to represent an essential challenge for further development of novel treatment approaches the mobility and complexation activity of nom are critically important for engineered systems because nom affects the efficiency of electrochemical ec water treatment methods trellu et al 2016 särkkä et al 2015 membrane fouling contaminant adsorption by activated carbon and other sorbents ion exchange and other processes gao et al 2012 leenheer 2009 newcombe et al 1997 shimizu et al 2018 teixeira and sousa 2013 effects of nom in the decline in membrane flux in desalination other membrane filtration methods and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi have been associated with the propensity of nom to contribute to the formation of fouling layers and the rate of transfer of nom to the membrane surfaces mossad and zou 2013 zhang et al 2013 formation of complexes of nom with inorganic ions and other species is also important for membrane systems for instance banasiak and schäfer reported that a significant amount of f and b oh 4 was deposited on the ion exchange membrane rather than transported through the membrane in the presence of nom because these anions tended to form bonds with the carboxylate groups of nom leading to an increased stack resistance and reduced flux of the membrane banasiak and schäfer 2009 other studies have observed that the presence of nom is associated with the occurrence of accelerated membrane fouling caused by the formation of metal nom complexes jermann et al 2007 weng et al 2005 the kinetics of the removal of environmental contaminants are frequently governed by the diffusion of contaminants from bulk solution to the surface of the membranes and electrodes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 liu et al 2017 2018 in general the effectiveness of any interfacially controlled process designed to remove trace level contaminants tends to be strongly affected by mass transfer limitations given that many contaminants form complexes with nom and the mobility of these complexes may much lower than that of the contaminants per se due to the high molecular weight of nom it is important to quantify the actual changes of the diffusion coefficients in nom affected systems thus gaining insight into the effects of nom complexation on its mass transfer properties is essential for further improvement of water treatment operations and deeper understanding and modeling of natural systems amy et al 1992 engebretson and von wandruszka 1998 lead et al 1994 lead et al 2000 wilkinson et al 1997 while there is a general consensus on the effects of nom on mass transfer processes involving its complexes with environmental contaminants diffusion coefficients dnom of nom are difficult to quantify due to the intrinsic heterogeneity and site specificity of nom and the ambiguity concerning its molecular weight and conformations techniques that have been used to determine dnom values require its concentrations that are much higher than nom levels typical for environmental systems pinheiro et al 1998 reid et al 1991 these factors may result in artifacts due to the difficulties of isolating nom without affecting its composition electrochemical methods allow quantifying some key nom properties for instance its complexation with heavy metals at environmentally relevant nom concentrations greter et al 1979 helal et al 2007 nurmi and tratnyek 2002 use of the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde is attractive in this context jeong et al 2010 kormos et al 2010 matsushita et al 2015 because ec currents measured by rrde are affected by the intrinsic kinetics of the ec reactions of nom complexes their mobility that depends on dnom and formation of reactive intermediates rrde utilizes an arrangement of two planar electrodes whose surfaces form a disc and a coaxially positioned ring with independently controlled ec potentials liao et al 1988 rotation of the rrde causes soluble ec reactive products generated at the disc to be convectively transferred to the ec controlled ring where the ec currents associated with the ec active species generated at the disc can be measured at varying rrde rotation rates ec potentials of the disc and the ring and other system conditions the utility of rrde technique to investigate the ec reactions and diffusion behavior of environmental contaminants such as monoiodoacetic acid iodoform iodinated contrast media such as diatrizoate and iopamidol has been demonstrated in prior studies yan et al 2018 however little effort has been made to use the rrde approach to characterize the intrinsic properties of nom notably its diffusivity and formation of intermediates generated in redox reactions involving nom contaminant complexes in addition a large part of prior research concerned with the mass transfer and redox properties of nom and its complexes has tended to utilize nom concentrations that are much higher than those typical for most environmental systems while the rrde method as shown below can generate reliable data needed to explore these aspects of nom chemistry without its preconcentration finally in contrast with the vast amount of information on nom metal ion complexation relatively little is known about the redox reactivity of nom complexes with organic species in this study that addresses these issues the rrde method was applied to explore ec reactions and mass transfer properties of nom complexes with the organic cation toluidine blue tb whose complexation with nom and selected environmentally relevant polymeric species has been explored in prior studies fradj et al 2014 kam and gregory 2001 sheng et al 2008 2009 usacheva et al 2003 xie et al 2019 yurekli et al 2005 zularisam et al 2006 standard suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa were selected to represent aquatic and soil nom respectively the data demonstrate the presence of strong effects of nom on the ec and mass transfer properties of free tb cations and tb nom complexes and the feasibility of the rrde approach to quantify nom properties that important for natural and engineered systems at environmentally relevant nom concentrations 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals all reagents used in the study were analytical grade all solutions were prepared using milli q water 18 2 mω cm 1 millipore corp ma usa the cationic dye toluidine blue o tb was purchased from sigma aldrich usa and used without further processing 0 01 m tb stock solution was prepared in di water before the experiments samples of standard pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa sample 2s103f and standard suwannee river fulvic acid srfa sample 1s101f were obtained from the international humic substances society ihss doc concentrations were measured with a shimadzu toc v cpn instrument sodium chloride nacl was purchased from aldrich chemical co milwaukee wi ph of the solutions was controlled from 3 0 to 9 0 by adding requisite amounts of hcl or naoh stock solutions of 0 01 0 1 and 1 m concentrations 2 2 electrochemical and absorbance measurements ec experiments were performed using a 125 ml five port cell with a gold rrde working electrode affixed to a pine afmsrx rotator a platinum counter electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode the disc and ring electrodes were controlled by a pine sfcbp1 bipotentiostat pine instrument co lawrence ks the outer diameters of the disc and ring electrodes were 4 57 mm and 5 38 mm respectively the gap distance between ring and disc was 0 18 mm for this electrode geometry and the electrolyte flow dynamics controlled by it the highest theoretically predicted efficiency of collecting disc electrode generated mobile intermediates on the ring is 28 filinovskiĭ and pleskov 1976 the counter electrode was separated from the working electrode by a glass frit ec potentials were measured and quoted vs the ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs the standard hydrogen electrode she the schematic diagram of the rrde methodology is shown in figure sm 1 in the supplementary material sm section all ec experiments were performed in the presence of 0 01 m nacl background electrolyte prior to each experiment the surface of the rrde was polished with magnesium oxide 96 purity and rinsed with methanol and di water for 30 s respectively following this the electrode was cycled ten times between 1 2 and 1 2 v in 0 1 m na2so4 the reproducibility of the rrde performance was confirmed by a cathodic scan in the background electrolyte all solutions were purged with n2 for 5 min before each experiment to remove dissolved oxygen and the ec cell was sealed by a teflon stopper and a n2 gas line with continuing flow of nitrogen to prevent ingress of oxygen into the solution the concentration of tb was 25 μm in all rrde experiments rrde measurements were carried out in stationary and potentiodynamic conditions in the stationary experiments the potentials of the disc and the ring denoted as edisc and ering respectively were held constant at 0 4 v and 0 1 v respectively and the disc and ring currents were measured at the electrode rotation rates that were gradually increased from 0 to 1200 rpm following each increase of the electrode rotation rate the disc and ring currents were allowed to stabilize 60 s after which the ring and disc currents were measured in the potentiodynamic measurements edisc potential was scanned from 0 8 to 0 9 v at a 10 v s 1 scan rate while the potential of the ring referred to as ering was held at 0 1 v the ec currents corresponding to the redox reactions at both electrodes were recorded in each scan rrde rotation rates denoted henceforth as ω ranged from 0 to 1200 rpm spectroscopic experiments to examine interaction between tb probe and nom were carried out using a shimadzu uv 2700 spectrophotometer with a 5 cm quartz cuvette the photometric accuracy of that instrument has been reported to be at 0 002 0 003 and 0 006 a u for 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 absorbance levels respectively gao et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 rrde measurements of the reduction of tb fig 1 shows the results of rrde measurements in the nom free solution containing 25 μm tb 0 01 m nacl background salt at ph 7 0 the reduction currents observed in the presence of tb strongly depended on the electrode rotation rate and were an order of magnitude higher than those in the background electrolyte fig sm 2 in which case they did not depend vs the electrode rotation rate these data for tb per se and those obtained in the presence of varying nom concentrations figs 2 and 3 exhibit two main features of the disc currents these features are denoted as feature a and b in figs 1 3 feature b corresponds to the rapid increase of the cathodic current at the disc potentials from 0 2 to 0 3 v the disc current plateaus at potentials 0 3 to 0 40 v and increases somewhat in the range of potentials 0 40 to 0 45 v thus forming feature a the intensities of features a and b increase with the electrode rotation rate the nature of these features can be interpreted in the context of the ec reactivity and transport of tb solutes prior research cai and xue 1998 persson and gorton 1990 zhou et al 1998 demonstrates that tb cations dominate the speciation of tb at ph 7 ionic strength 0 01 and its 25 μm total concentration these cations undergo ec reduction that involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons to form a reduced form of tb denoted henceforth as tbh2 red persson and gorton 1990 these redox and protonation reactions are shown in scheme 1 the reduction of tb cations and ensuing formation of tbh2 red is deemed to correspond to feature a in the potentiodynamic data shown in fig 1 increases of the total tb concentrations in aqueous solutions result in the shift of the speciation of tb from the dominance of free tb cations to tb2 dimers and in some extent higher order tb aggregates denoted as tbn persson and gorton 1990 the existence of higher local concentration of tb cations on the electrode surface is likely to promote the formation of the adsorbed tb2 dimers and other tb aggregates these species undergo ec reduction at potentials that are more positive than those characteristic for the reduction of tb monomers zhou et al 1998 accordingly the disc currents in the range of feature b potentials appear to comprise the currents associated with the reduction of both adsorbed and convectively transferred tb monomers as well as the reduction of adsorbed tb2 dimers the pathway is also shown in scheme 1 the ec active products formed upon the reduction of tb were detected on the ring electrode whose potential was kept at 0 1 v fig 1b shows that the ring current corresponding to the oxidation of the tb reduction products formed on the disc exhibits a very sharp increase as the disc potentials is shifted from ca 0 2 v to 0 3 v while in the range of disc potentials 0 35 v to 0 9 v the ring current plateaus figure sm 3 shows the disc and ring currents at varying ph values the characteristic features e g features a and b observed in the disc tb reduction currents at ph values other than 7 tend to overlap to exhibit a prominent increase of the cathodic current in the potential range 0 2 to 0 6 v the disc currents at potentials 0 45 v decrease as the ph increases from 5 to 9 this change of disc current may be related to the aggregation of tb molecules and or formation of neutral tb0 species similarly to the observation made for tb reduction at ph 7 the products of tb reduction at ph 5 and 9 were readily oxidized on the ring as shown in figure sm 3c and d in all the cases increases of the rrde rotation rates from 0 to 1200 rpm were accompanied by increases of the reduction currents of tb this is characteristic for ec reactions that are controlled by mass transfer of the ec active species to the electrode surface bard et al 1980 ma et al 2015 mayrhofer et al 2008 the importance of mass transfer limitations of the reduction of tb on the disc electrode is confirmed by the existence of strong linear relationships r2 1 00 between disc currents measured for instance at edisc 0 45 v vs the square root of rrde rotation rate ω1 2 values fig 4 a as discussed in more detail in the section that follows 3 2 effects of nom on the electrochemical reactions of tb the rrde measurements for srfa concentrations varying from 0 to 20 mg l 1 as doc at ph 7 in the absence of tb are shown in figure sm 4 in the sm section these data and those for varying ph as well as for ppfa not shown demonstrate that nom is not ec active while srfa per se does not exhibit any ec activity it strongly affects the currents associated with the reactions of the tb for instance fig 2 demonstrates that for a constant rotation rate e g ω 1200 rpm the disc and ring currents at ph 7 in the region edisc 0 2 v decrease as the concentration of srfa increases from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the decrease of the disc currents assigned to feature a is more prominent than that of feature b for instance when the concentration of srfa increases from 0 to 2 mg l 1 the disc currents located at feature a decreased by 35 when the concentration of srfa was increased to 10 mg l 1 the disc currents decreased by 64 and largely plateaued for higher srfa concentrations similar changes were observed for the disc currents measured at ph 5 0 and 9 0 fig s4 in which case the presence of srfa resulted in consistent and significant decreases of the disc currents at potentials 0 45 v the observed effects can be posited to be caused by the formation of tb srfa complexes because these complexes are characterized by higher molecular weights than free tb cations they have lower diffusion coefficients and thus lower rates of their convective transfer to the electrode surface with resultant decreases of the disc currents to explore this point in more detail tb srfa and tb ppfa complexation was quantified based on the absorbance measurements results of these measurements for srfa are shown in figure sm 5 the data demonstrate that the presence of srfa causes the intensity of the features at 600 and 640 nm to decrease while another feature with a maximum at ca 550 nm emerges simultaneously similar observations were made for tb ppfa solutions figure sm 7 absorbance spectra of the tb nom systems comprise contributions of six gaussian bands denoted in prior studies as a0 a5 xie et al 2019 the maxima of bands a1 to a5 are located at 502 556 602 642 and 697 nm respectively gaussian bands a3 and a4 correspond to the absorbance of free tb cations while bands a2 and a5 primarily reflect the formation of tb2 dimers d ilario and martinelli 2006 usacheva et al 2003 xie et al 2019 selected results of deconvolution of the absorbance spectra of the tb nom solutions examined in this study are shown in figure sm 8 sm 9 and sm 10 for ph values 5 7 and 9 respectively the observations presented in figures sm 6 to sm 10 show that the intensities of bands a3 at 602 nm and a4 at 642 nm at all phs decrease with the increasing concentration of srfa from 0 to 10 mg l 1 while that of bands a2 at 556 nm and a5 at 697 nm simultaneously increase but their changes are less prominent than those of band a3 and a4 these results are summarized in figure sm 11 the behavior of the disc and ring currents observed for the reduction of tb in the presence of ppfa fig 3 exhibits trends similar to those for srfa but with some additional features for instance increases of ppfa concentrations are accompanied by a gradual shift of the maximum of the feature b toward a more negative potential this may indicate that the tb ppfa complexes may be less ec active compared with the tb sfra complex potentially due to a tighter bond between tb and ppfa molecules in the complexes 3 3 comparison of mass transfer properties of free tb cations and tb nom complexes higher rrde rotation rates were associated with increases of the disc currents of the reduction of tb cations for all examined concentrations of srfa and ppfa fig 4 demonstrates the dependence of the disc current measured at edisc 0 45 vs ω1 2 values with varying concentrations of srfa and ppfa at ph 7 the strong linearity of the correlations between the disc current and ω1 2 values confirms the point that the ec reduction of tb and tb nom complexes is limited by their diffusion to the electrode surface slopes of the correlations between the disc currents vs ω1 2 values decreased as srfa concentrations increased fig 5 a this result reinforces the notion that the system is dominated by tb nom complexes especially for srfa concentration 10 mg l 1 to interpret the observed effects in more detail we introduced an expression based on the levich equation bard and faulkner 2002 1 i 0 62 n f a α d t b 2 3 1 α d t b n o m 2 3 ν 1 6 ω 1 2 c in the above formula i stands for feature a disc currents d t b and d t b n o m are the diffusion coefficients of free tb and tb nom complexes respectively the parameter α denotes the dimensionless speciation coefficients of free tb cations in the presence of varying nom concentrations n is the number of electrons transferred in the ec reaction n 2 f is the faraday constant f 96495 c mol 1 a is the electrode area a 0 164 cm 2 ω is the angular rotation rate of the electrode ν is the kinematic viscosity of water ν 0 01 cm2 s 1 and c is the analyte concentration fig 5b presents effect of srfa tb complexation on the diffusion coefficients of tb calculated using equation 1 and stationary currents measured at 0 45 v disc potential the value of d t b calculated in the absence of nom was determined to be 8 3 10 6 6 3 10 6 5 2 10 6 and 2 2 10 6 cm2 s 1 at ph 3 5 7 and 9 respectively the observed decreases of the diffusion coefficient of free tb cations at increasing phs in the absence of nom were unexpected they may be related to possible effects of the electrokinetic phenomena induced by the difference of the ec potentials between the disc and ring electrodes 0 45 and 0 1 v respectively that can affect the mobility of tb cations in the vicinity of the disc electrode surface this phenomenon can also be associated with changes of the ionic composition of the hydration sphere is tb cations at varying phs further elucidation of this phenomenon goes beyond the scope of this study and will not be discussed here the diffusion coefficients determined for a 10 mg l 1 srfa concentration when the system is dominated by tb srfa complexes as discussed in section 3 2 were 2 84 10 6 1 40 10 6 5 50 10 7 and 9 00 10 7 cm2 s 1 at ph 3 5 7 and 9 respectively for all ph values and srfa concentrations the diffusion coefficients calculated based on the levich equation fig 5b were closely correlated with the concurrent changes of the absorbance at 640 nm fig 6 given that the changes of the absorbance of tb srfa solutions at this wavelength are closely related with the decrease of the intensity of gaussian band a3 and a4 the data shown in figure confirm further that the formation of tb srfa complexes is associated with consistent decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficients that characterize mass transfer phenomena in the presence of nom at its environmentally relevant concentrations 3 4 effects of nom on the products of electrochemical reduction of tb and its complexes products of the ec reduction of tb on the disc electrode were readily oxidized on the ring electrode whose potential was held at 0 1 v fig 1b according to the scheme of reversible ec reactions of tb shown in scheme 1 the anodic ring currents corresponds to the ec oxidation of intermediates tbh2 red and possibly tb2h4 red to form free tb cations and tb2 dimers the ring currents increase from zero at the edisc of ca 0 2 v to reach a maximum at ca 0 45 v and then plateau for edisc 0 45 v similarly to the observation in the case of disc currents fig 1a increases of the rrde rotation rates from 0 to 1200 rpm caused a consistent increase of the ring currents the presence of nom suppressed the ring currents associated with the oxidation of tbh2 red and tb2h4 red reduction products at all phs figs 2b and 3b figure sm 3 and sm 5 the correlations between the ring currents and ω1 2 values were strongly linear as exemplified by the data shown in fig 7 increasing srfa concentrations caused the slope of the correlation between the ring currents and the ω1 2 values to decrease fig 8 demonstrates that the slopes of the correlations of the ring currents vs ω1 2 values decrease with the ph even in the absence of srfa increases of doc concentrations cause these slopes to decrease more prominently especially for doc concentrations above 4 mg l 1 this indicates that the yields of the ec reactive intermediates formed upon the reduction of free tb cations or tb srfa complexes decrease as the prevalence of tb srfa complexes in the speciation of tb solutes increases this point can be ascertained in more detail via calculations of the ratios of the ring to disc currents these ratios determine the fraction of a reactive intermediate transferred by convection from the disc to the ring electrode in the calculations for the stationary ec data the absolute values of the ratio of the slopes of the ring currents vs ω1 2 values fig 8a divided by the corresponding slopes of the disc currents vs ω1 2 values shown in fig 5a can be used these ratios are similar to the ring collection efficiencies whose maximum for any rrde system is determined by its geometry the maximum ring collection efficiency for the rrde used in this study is 0 28 filinovskiĭ and pleskov 1976 results of the calculations of the slope ratios are shown in fig 8b it demonstrates that in the absence of nom the slope ratio is ca 0 20 with relatively low variability vs ph this ratio is lower than its maximum value of 0 28 indicating that the ec active intermediates tbh2 red and possibly tb2h4 red scheme 1 formed upon the reduction of free tb cations undergo a fractional breakdown during their convective transfer from the disc to the ring or alternatively the rate of their ec oxidation at the ring electrode may be limited compared with the mass transfer limited rate of tb reduction on the disc electrode the presence of srfa causes the slope ratios to decrease the relevant trends are somewhat difficult to quantify due to the scatter of the data still the data shown in fig 8b demonstrate that at ph 3 the slope ratio decreases at srfa concentrations above 6 mg l as doc the data for ph 5 and 7 are more scattered but they also show that the fraction of the ec active intermediates reaching the ring decreases for doc concentration exceeding 4 mg l 1 the data for ph 9 confirm this trend in all cases the fraction of the ec active intermediates convectively transferred to the ring decreases by almost an order of magnitude for doc concentration above 6 mg l 1 this result may be indicative of the involvement of several alternative mechanisms it can be posited that the reduced products tbh2 red or tb2h4 red remain bound by nom or these complexes do not break down instantaneously given that the diffusion coefficients of the nom complexes with tbh2 red or tb2h4 red products are close to those of the initial tb nom complexes and at the same time they are much lower as shown in the preceding section than those of the free tb cations the time needed for the reduced complexes to be transferred convectively from the ring to the disc will increase because tbh2 red or tb2h4 red species appear to be unstable this will result in a lower fraction of these complexes reaching the ring at which they are ec oxidized alternatively the complexes of nom with tbh2 red or tb2h4 red products may exhibit lower ec reactivity due to the existence of stronger chemical bonds between the reduced forms of tb and nom the ec generated reduced form of tb may also undergo a sequential chemical reaction with the free nom molecules that are present at the surfaces of the disc and ring electrode as well in the solution adjacent to these electrodes these interactions will reduce further the availability of the reduced forms of tb for their ec driven oxidation at the ring electrode while the occurrence and relative contributions of these mechanisms remain to be ascertained the data presented in this section demonstrate that the rrde approach can be used to examine the yields and reactivity of intermediates formed upon ec transformations of nom complexes with organic redox active species at varying environmental conditions in terms of the practical significance of this study its results show that the rrde approach allows quantifying the ec reactivity of nom contaminant complexes the intermediates formed as a result of their redox reactions and last but not least mass transfer properties of nom and its complexes at environmentally relevant nom concentrations given that the quantitation mass transfer of nom and its complexes is critically important for any interfacially controlled process concerned with the removal of trace level contaminants notably the ec treatment adsorption and membrane methods the data of this study and its experimental approach can be used to optimize the design and operating conditions of relevant engineered systems for instance one or several ec active pollutants probes that form complexes with nom can be used to determine the mass transfer properties of these complexes with at varying operational conditions and water treatment relevant nom concentrations in the context of fundamental studies of nom the diffusion coefficients determined based on the rrde data can be used to develop more detailed correlations between the diffusivity of nom its complexes and on the other hand nom molecular weights hydrodynamic radii and conformations while prior research have demonstrated the existence of correlations between the molecular weights of nom and its diffusivity beckett et al 1987 considerably more data needs to be generated for nom of varying provenance and a wide range of ph and ionic strengths in addition the rrde examination of nom pollutant complexation or the use of this approach to study redox or halogenation induced transformations of nom per se e g in the case of ozonation or chlorination are likely to yield currently absent data concerning the generation of redox active intermediates that may play important roles in the generation of the by products of nom treatment 4 conclusions the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde was used to quantify the ec reactions and mass transfer properties of the complexes of aquatic and soil nom exemplified by suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa respectively with the organic cation toluidine blue tb the rrde experiments demonstrated that in the range of the disc potentials 0 2 to 0 4 v vs the standard ag agcl reference electrode the reduction of both tb solutes and surface adsorbed species takes place at disc potentials 0 4 v the ec reduction is controlled by the convective transfer of free tb cations and tb nom complexes to the electrode surface the disc currents associated with the ec reduction of tb decrease consistently in the presence of nom this was shown be caused by the increased mass transfer limitations characteristic for tb nom complexes primarily to much lower diffusion coefficients of these complexes compared with those of the free tb cations the ec reduction of tb cations and tb nom complexes was accompanied by the formation of the ec active products e g tbh2 red or tb2h4 red and their complexes with nom the rrde data showed that the presence of nom results in strong decreases of the fraction of ec active intermediates that are convectively transferred from the disc to the ring the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain to be ascertained the reported results facilitate a better understanding of the mass transfer properties of complexes of nom with organic cations and other redox active species formed at environmentally relevant nom concentrations this approach may be expanded to study the intrinsic chemistry

17673,this study examined effects of aquatic and soil natural organic matter nom exemplified by standard suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa respectively on the electrochemical ec reactivity and mass transfer properties of the cationic organic probe toluidine blue tb that forms complexes with nom ec measurements that were carried out using the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde showed that for disc potentials below 0 4 v vs the standard ag agcl reference electrode tb molecules undergo ec reduction accompanied by the formation of ec active products that undergo oxidation at the ring electrode ec reactions of tb in the range of potentials 0 2 to 0 4 v were determined to involve free tb cations and tb species adsorbed on the electrode surface the ec reduction of tb species at the disc potentials 0 4 v was controlled by the mass transfer of the free tb cations and tb nom complexes to the electrode surface formation of tb nom complexes caused the mass transfer controlled tb currents to undergo a consistent decrease the observed changes were correlated with the extent of tb nom complexation and decreases of the diffusion coefficients of tb nom complexes that have higher molecular weights mw than the free cations properties of the intermediates formed upon the reduction of tb cations were also affected by nom these results demonstrate that rrde measurements of ec reactions of tb or possibly other ec active probes allow probing the complexation of ec active organic species with nom and mass transfer properties of nom complexes and ultimately nom itself graphical abstract image 1 keywords natural organic matter nom rotating ring disc electrode rrde organic cations toluidine blue tb diffusion coefficient complexation 1 introduction natural organic matter nom comprises multiple compound classes e g fulvic and humic acids other nom fractions with varying hydrophilicities and proton affinities proteins polysaccharides and other components with highly varying molecular weights that range from several hundred to hundreds of thousands of daltons filella 2009 leenheer and croué 2003 determination of the molecular weights and other parameters for instance conformations radii and diffusion properties of nom molecules is non trivial due to their intrinsic heterogeneity and the presence of multiple types of reactive moieties in their structure and the resultant impossibility to find molecular weight standards that approximate sufficiently well nom properties as a result alternative experimental methods to determine molecular weights of nom for instance vapor pressure osmometry marinsky et al 1990 size exclusion chromatography brezinski and gorczyca 2019 her et al 2002 perminova et al 2003 flow field fractionation ham et al 2013 electrophoretic mobility mass spectroscopy hosse and wilkinson 2001 and several other methods baalousha et al 2006 egeberg et al 2002 fattahi and solouki 2003 tend to yield divergent results structurally nom molecules are dominated by aliphatic and aromatic units activated with carboxylic and hydroxyl groups quinone amine and thiol functionalities that are active in forming complexes with organic or inorganic ions kretzschmar 2004 due to these properties aquatic and soil nom affect the speciation mobility toxicity and fate of most aquatic and soil pollutants in natural environments benedetti et al 1995 cabaniss 2010 croue et al 2000 leenheer 2009 lu and allen 2002 römkens et al 1998 tipping 1998 given that nom can be only partially removed by any of the currently existing water treatment processes other than reverse osmosis nom continues to represent an essential challenge for further development of novel treatment approaches the mobility and complexation activity of nom are critically important for engineered systems because nom affects the efficiency of electrochemical ec water treatment methods trellu et al 2016 särkkä et al 2015 membrane fouling contaminant adsorption by activated carbon and other sorbents ion exchange and other processes gao et al 2012 leenheer 2009 newcombe et al 1997 shimizu et al 2018 teixeira and sousa 2013 effects of nom in the decline in membrane flux in desalination other membrane filtration methods and membrane capacitive deionization mcdi have been associated with the propensity of nom to contribute to the formation of fouling layers and the rate of transfer of nom to the membrane surfaces mossad and zou 2013 zhang et al 2013 formation of complexes of nom with inorganic ions and other species is also important for membrane systems for instance banasiak and schäfer reported that a significant amount of f and b oh 4 was deposited on the ion exchange membrane rather than transported through the membrane in the presence of nom because these anions tended to form bonds with the carboxylate groups of nom leading to an increased stack resistance and reduced flux of the membrane banasiak and schäfer 2009 other studies have observed that the presence of nom is associated with the occurrence of accelerated membrane fouling caused by the formation of metal nom complexes jermann et al 2007 weng et al 2005 the kinetics of the removal of environmental contaminants are frequently governed by the diffusion of contaminants from bulk solution to the surface of the membranes and electrodes radjenovic and sedlak 2015 liu et al 2017 2018 in general the effectiveness of any interfacially controlled process designed to remove trace level contaminants tends to be strongly affected by mass transfer limitations given that many contaminants form complexes with nom and the mobility of these complexes may much lower than that of the contaminants per se due to the high molecular weight of nom it is important to quantify the actual changes of the diffusion coefficients in nom affected systems thus gaining insight into the effects of nom complexation on its mass transfer properties is essential for further improvement of water treatment operations and deeper understanding and modeling of natural systems amy et al 1992 engebretson and von wandruszka 1998 lead et al 1994 lead et al 2000 wilkinson et al 1997 while there is a general consensus on the effects of nom on mass transfer processes involving its complexes with environmental contaminants diffusion coefficients dnom of nom are difficult to quantify due to the intrinsic heterogeneity and site specificity of nom and the ambiguity concerning its molecular weight and conformations techniques that have been used to determine dnom values require its concentrations that are much higher than nom levels typical for environmental systems pinheiro et al 1998 reid et al 1991 these factors may result in artifacts due to the difficulties of isolating nom without affecting its composition electrochemical methods allow quantifying some key nom properties for instance its complexation with heavy metals at environmentally relevant nom concentrations greter et al 1979 helal et al 2007 nurmi and tratnyek 2002 use of the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde is attractive in this context jeong et al 2010 kormos et al 2010 matsushita et al 2015 because ec currents measured by rrde are affected by the intrinsic kinetics of the ec reactions of nom complexes their mobility that depends on dnom and formation of reactive intermediates rrde utilizes an arrangement of two planar electrodes whose surfaces form a disc and a coaxially positioned ring with independently controlled ec potentials liao et al 1988 rotation of the rrde causes soluble ec reactive products generated at the disc to be convectively transferred to the ec controlled ring where the ec currents associated with the ec active species generated at the disc can be measured at varying rrde rotation rates ec potentials of the disc and the ring and other system conditions the utility of rrde technique to investigate the ec reactions and diffusion behavior of environmental contaminants such as monoiodoacetic acid iodoform iodinated contrast media such as diatrizoate and iopamidol has been demonstrated in prior studies yan et al 2018 however little effort has been made to use the rrde approach to characterize the intrinsic properties of nom notably its diffusivity and formation of intermediates generated in redox reactions involving nom contaminant complexes in addition a large part of prior research concerned with the mass transfer and redox properties of nom and its complexes has tended to utilize nom concentrations that are much higher than those typical for most environmental systems while the rrde method as shown below can generate reliable data needed to explore these aspects of nom chemistry without its preconcentration finally in contrast with the vast amount of information on nom metal ion complexation relatively little is known about the redox reactivity of nom complexes with organic species in this study that addresses these issues the rrde method was applied to explore ec reactions and mass transfer properties of nom complexes with the organic cation toluidine blue tb whose complexation with nom and selected environmentally relevant polymeric species has been explored in prior studies fradj et al 2014 kam and gregory 2001 sheng et al 2008 2009 usacheva et al 2003 xie et al 2019 yurekli et al 2005 zularisam et al 2006 standard suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa were selected to represent aquatic and soil nom respectively the data demonstrate the presence of strong effects of nom on the ec and mass transfer properties of free tb cations and tb nom complexes and the feasibility of the rrde approach to quantify nom properties

milwaukee wi ph of the solutions was controlled from 3 0 to 9 0 by adding requisite amounts of hcl or naoh stock solutions of 0 01 0 1 and 1 m concentrations 2 2 electrochemical and absorbance measurements ec experiments were performed using a 125 ml five port cell with a gold rrde working electrode affixed to a pine afmsrx rotator a platinum counter electrode and an ag agcl reference electrode the disc and ring electrodes were controlled by a pine sfcbp1 bipotentiostat pine instrument co lawrence ks the outer diameters of the disc and ring electrodes were 4 57 mm and 5 38 mm respectively the gap distance between ring and disc was 0 18 mm for this electrode geometry and the electrolyte flow dynamics controlled by it the highest theoretically predicted efficiency of collecting disc electrode generated mobile intermediates on the ring is 28 filinovskiĭ and pleskov 1976 the counter electrode was separated from the working electrode by a glass frit ec potentials were measured and quoted vs the ag agcl reference electrode 0 197 v vs the standard hydrogen electrode she the schematic diagram of the rrde methodology is shown in figure sm 1 in the supplementary material sm section all ec experiments were performed in the presence of 0 01 m nacl background electrolyte prior to each experiment the surface of the rrde was polished with magnesium oxide 96 purity and rinsed with methanol and di water for 30 s respectively following this the electrode was cycled ten times between 1 2 and 1 2 v in 0 1 m na2so4 the reproducibility of the rrde performance was confirmed by a cathodic scan in the background electrolyte all solutions were purged with n2 for 5 min before each experiment to remove dissolved oxygen and the ec cell was sealed by a teflon stopper and a n2 gas line with continuing flow of nitrogen to prevent ingress of oxygen into the solution the concentration of tb was 25 μm in all rrde experiments rrde measurements were carried out in stationary and potentiodynamic conditions in the stationary experiments the potentials of the disc and the ring denoted as edisc and ering respectively were held constant at 0 4 v and 0 1 v respectively and the disc and ring currents were measured at the electrode rotation rates that were gradually increased from 0 to 1200 rpm following each increase of the electrode rotation rate the disc and ring currents were allowed to stabilize 60 s after which the ring and disc currents were measured in the potentiodynamic measurements edisc potential was scanned from 0 8 to 0 9 v at a 10 v s 1 scan rate while the potential of the ring referred to as ering was held at 0 1 v the ec currents corresponding to the redox reactions at both electrodes were recorded in each scan rrde rotation rates denoted henceforth as ω ranged from 0 to 1200 rpm spectroscopic experiments to examine interaction between tb probe and nom were carried out using a shimadzu uv 2700 spectrophotometer with a 5 cm quartz cuvette the photometric accuracy of that instrument has been reported to be at 0 002 0 003 and 0 006 a u for 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 absorbance levels respectively gao et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 rrde measurements of the reduction of tb fig 1 shows the results of rrde measurements in the nom free solution containing 25 μm tb 0 01 m nacl background salt at ph 7 0 the reduction currents observed in the presence of tb strongly depended on the electrode rotation rate and were an order of magnitude higher than those in the background electrolyte fig sm 2 in which case they did not depend vs the electrode rotation rate these data for tb per se and those obtained in the presence of varying nom concentrations figs 2 and 3 exhibit two main features of the disc currents these features are denoted as feature a and b in figs 1 3 feature b corresponds to the rapid increase of the cathodic current at the disc potentials from 0 2 to 0 3 v the disc current plateaus at potentials 0 3 to 0 40 v and increases somewhat in the range of potentials 0 40 to 0 45 v thus forming feature a the intensities of features a and b increase with the electrode rotation rate the nature of these features can be interpreted in the context of the ec reactivity and transport of tb solutes prior research cai and xue 1998 persson and gorton 1990 zhou et al 1998 demonstrates that tb cations dominate the speciation of tb at ph 7 ionic strength 0 01 and its 25 μm total concentration these cations undergo ec reduction that involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons to form a reduced form of tb denoted henceforth as tbh2 red persson and gorton 1990 these redox and protonation reactions are shown in scheme 1 the reduction of tb cations and ensuing formation of tbh2 red is deemed to correspond to feature a in the potentiodynamic data shown in fig 1 increases of the total tb concentrations in aqueous solutions result in the shift of the speciation of tb from the dominance of free tb cations to tb2 dimers and in some extent higher order tb aggregates denoted as tbn persson and gorton 1990 the existence of higher local concentration of tb cations on the electrode surface is likely to promote the formation of the adsorbed tb2 dimers and other tb aggregates these species undergo ec reduction at potentials that are more positive than those characteristic for the reduction of tb monomers zhou et al 1998 accordingly the disc currents in the range of feature b potentials appear to comprise the currents associated with the reduction of both adsorbed and convectively transferred tb monomers as well as the reduction of adsorbed tb2 dimers the pathway is also shown in scheme 1 the ec active products formed upon the reduction of tb were detected on the ring electrode whose potential was kept at 0 1 v fig 1b shows that the ring current corresponding to the oxidation of the tb reduction products formed on the disc exhibits a very sharp increase as the disc potentials is shifted from ca 0 2 v to 0 3 v while in the range of disc potentials 0 35 v to 0 9 v the ring current plateaus figure sm 3 shows the disc and ring currents at varying ph values the characteristic features e g features a and b observed in the disc tb reduction currents at ph values other than 7 tend to overlap to exhibit a prominent increase of the cathodic current in the potential range 0 2 to 0 6 v the disc currents at potentials 0 45 v decrease as the ph increases from 5 to 9 this change of disc current may be related to the aggregation of tb molecules and or formation of neutral tb0 species similarly to the observation made for tb reduction at ph 7 the products of tb reduction at ph 5 and 9 were readily oxidized on the ring as shown in figure sm 3c and d in all the cases increases of the rrde rotation rates from 0 to 1200 rpm were accompanied by increases of the reduction currents of tb this is characteristic for ec reactions that are controlled by mass transfer of the ec active species to the electrode surface bard et al 1980 ma et al 2015 mayrhofer et al 2008 the importance of mass transfer limitations of the reduction of tb on the disc electrode is confirmed by the existence of strong linear relationships r2 1 00 between disc currents measured for instance at edisc 0 45 v vs the square root of rrde rotation rate ω1 2 values fig 4 a as discussed in more detail in the section that follows 3 2 effects of nom on the electrochemical reactions of tb the rrde measurements for srfa concentrations varying from 0 to 20 mg l 1 as doc at ph 7 in the absence of tb are shown in figure sm 4 in the sm section these data and those for varying ph as well as for ppfa not shown demonstrate that nom is not ec active while srfa per se does not exhibit any ec activity it strongly affects the currents associated with the reactions of the tb for instance fig 2 demonstrates that for a constant rotation rate e g ω 1200 rpm the disc and ring currents at ph 7 in the region edisc 0 2 v decrease as the concentration of srfa increases from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the decrease of the disc currents assigned to feature a is more prominent than that of feature b for instance when the concentration of srfa increases from 0 to 2 mg l 1 the disc currents located at feature a decreased by 35 when the concentration of srfa was increased to 10 mg l 1 the disc currents decreased by 64 and largely plateaued for higher srfa concentrations similar changes were observed for the disc currents measured at ph 5 0 and 9 0 fig s4 in which case the presence of srfa resulted in consistent and significant decreases of the disc currents at potentials 0 45 v the observed effects can be posited to be caused by the formation of tb srfa complexes because these complexes are characterized by higher molecular weights than free tb cations they have lower diffusion coefficients and thus lower rates of their convective transfer to the electrode surface with resultant decreases of the disc currents to explore this point in more detail tb srfa and tb ppfa complexation was quantified based on the absorbance measurements results of these measurements for srfa are shown in figure sm 5 the data demonstrate that the presence of srfa causes the intensity of the features at 600 and 640 nm to decrease while another feature with a maximum at ca 550 nm emerges simultaneously similar observations were made for tb ppfa solutions figure sm 7 absorbance spectra of the tb nom systems comprise contributions of six gaussian bands denoted in prior studies as a0 a5 xie et al 2019 the maxima of bands a1 to a5 are located at 502 556 602 642 and 697 nm respectively gaussian bands a3 and a4 correspond to the absorbance of free tb cations while bands a2 and a5 primarily reflect the formation of tb2 dimers d ilario and martinelli 2006 usacheva et al 2003 xie et al 2019 selected results of deconvolution of the absorbance spectra of the tb nom solutions examined in this study are shown in figure sm 8 sm 9 and sm 10 for ph values 5 7 and 9 respectively the observations presented in figures sm 6 to sm 10 show that the intensities of bands a3 at 602 nm and a4 at 642 nm at all phs decrease with the increasing concentration of srfa from 0 to 10 mg l 1 while that of bands a2 at 556 nm and a5 at 697 nm simultaneously increase but their changes are less prominent than those of band a3 and a4 these results are summarized in figure sm 11 the behavior of the disc and ring currents observed for the reduction of tb in the presence of ppfa fig 3 exhibits trends similar to those for srfa but with some additional features for instance increases of ppfa concentrations are accompanied by a gradual shift of the maximum of the feature b toward a more negative potential this may indicate that the tb ppfa complexes may be less ec active compared with the tb sfra complex potentially due to a tighter bond between tb and ppfa molecules in the complexes 3 3 comparison of mass transfer properties of free tb cations and tb nom complexes higher rrde rotation rates were associated with increases of the disc currents of the reduction of tb cations for all examined concentrations of srfa and ppfa fig 4 demonstrates the dependence of the disc current measured at edisc 0 45 vs ω1 2 values with varying concentrations of srfa and ppfa at ph 7 the strong linearity of the correlations between the disc current and ω1 2 values confirms the point that the ec reduction of tb and tb nom complexes is limited by their diffusion to the electrode surface slopes of the correlations between the disc currents vs ω1 2 values decreased as srfa concentrations increased fig 5 a this result reinforces the notion that the system is dominated by tb nom complexes especially for srfa concentration 10 mg l 1 to interpret the observed effects in more detail we introduced an expression based on the levich equation bard and faulkner 2002 1 i 0 62 n f a α d t b 2 3 1 α d t b n o m 2 3 ν 1 6 ω 1 2 c in the above formula i stands for feature a disc currents d t b and d t b n o m are the diffusion coefficients of free tb and tb nom complexes respectively the parameter α denotes the dimensionless speciation coefficients of free tb cations in the presence of varying nom concentrations n is the number of electrons transferred in the ec reaction n 2 f is the faraday constant f 96495 c mol 1 a is the electrode area a 0 164 cm 2 ω is the angular rotation rate of the electrode ν is the kinematic viscosity of water ν 0 01 cm2 s 1 and c is the analyte concentration fig 5b presents effect of srfa tb complexation on the diffusion coefficients of tb calculated using equation 1 and stationary currents measured at 0 45 v disc potential the value of d t b calculated in the absence of nom was determined to be 8 3 10 6 6 3 10 6 5 2 10 6 and 2 2 10 6 cm2 s 1 at ph 3 5 7 and 9 respectively the observed decreases of the diffusion coefficient of free tb cations at increasing phs in the absence of nom were unexpected they may be related to possible effects of the electrokinetic phenomena induced by the difference of the ec potentials between the disc and ring electrodes 0 45 and 0 1 v respectively that can affect the mobility of tb cations in the vicinity of the disc electrode surface this phenomenon can also be associated with changes of the ionic composition of the hydration sphere is tb cations at varying phs further elucidation of this phenomenon goes beyond the scope of this study and will not be discussed here the diffusion coefficients determined for a 10 mg l 1 srfa concentration when the system is dominated by tb srfa complexes as discussed in section 3 2 were 2 84 10 6 1 40 10 6 5 50 10 7 and 9 00 10 7 cm2 s 1 at ph 3 5 7 and 9 respectively for all ph values and srfa concentrations the diffusion coefficients calculated based on the levich equation fig 5b were closely correlated with the concurrent changes of the absorbance at 640 nm fig 6 given that the changes of the absorbance of tb srfa solutions at this wavelength are closely related with the decrease of the intensity of gaussian band a3 and a4 the data shown in figure confirm further that the formation of tb srfa complexes is associated with consistent decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficients that characterize mass transfer phenomena in the presence of nom at its environmentally relevant concentrations 3 4 effects of nom on the products of electrochemical reduction of tb and its complexes products of the ec reduction of tb on the disc electrode were readily oxidized on the ring electrode whose potential was held at 0 1 v fig 1b according to the scheme of reversible ec reactions of tb shown in scheme 1 the anodic ring currents corresponds to the ec oxidation of intermediates tbh2 red and possibly tb2h4 red to form free tb cations and tb2 dimers the ring currents increase from zero at the edisc of ca 0 2 v to reach a maximum at ca 0 45 v and then plateau for edisc 0 45 v similarly to the observation in the case of disc currents fig 1a increases of the rrde rotation rates from 0 to 1200 rpm caused a consistent increase of the ring currents the presence of nom suppressed the ring currents associated with the oxidation of tbh2 red and tb2h4 red reduction products at all phs figs 2b and 3b figure sm 3 and sm 5 the correlations between the ring currents and ω1 2 values were strongly linear as exemplified by the data shown in fig 7 increasing srfa concentrations caused the slope of the correlation between the ring currents and the ω1 2 values to decrease fig 8 demonstrates that the slopes of the correlations of the ring currents vs ω1 2 values decrease with the ph even in the absence of srfa increases of doc concentrations cause these slopes to decrease more prominently especially for doc concentrations above 4 mg l 1 this indicates that the yields of the ec reactive intermediates formed upon the reduction of free tb cations or tb srfa complexes decrease as the prevalence of tb srfa complexes in the speciation of tb solutes increases this point can be ascertained in more detail via calculations of the ratios of the ring to disc currents these ratios determine the fraction of a reactive intermediate transferred by convection from the disc to the ring electrode in the calculations for the stationary ec data the absolute values of the ratio of the slopes of the ring currents vs ω1 2 values fig 8a divided by the corresponding slopes of the disc currents vs ω1 2 values shown in fig 5a can be used these ratios are similar to the ring collection efficiencies whose maximum for any rrde system is determined by its geometry the maximum ring collection efficiency for the rrde used in this study is 0 28 filinovskiĭ and pleskov 1976 results of the calculations of the slope ratios are shown in fig 8b it demonstrates that in the absence of nom the slope ratio is ca 0 20 with relatively low variability vs ph this ratio is lower than its maximum value of 0 28 indicating that the ec active intermediates tbh2 red and possibly tb2h4 red scheme 1 formed upon the reduction of free tb cations undergo a fractional breakdown during their convective transfer from the disc to the ring or alternatively the rate of their ec oxidation at the ring electrode may be limited compared with the mass transfer limited rate of tb reduction on the disc electrode the presence of srfa causes the slope ratios to decrease the relevant trends are somewhat difficult to quantify due to the scatter of the data still the data shown in fig 8b demonstrate that at ph 3 the slope ratio decreases at srfa concentrations above 6 mg l as doc the data for ph 5 and 7 are more scattered but they also show that the fraction of the ec active intermediates reaching the ring decreases for doc concentration exceeding 4 mg l 1 the data for ph 9 confirm this trend in all cases the fraction of the ec active intermediates convectively transferred to the ring decreases by almost an order of magnitude for doc concentration above 6 mg l 1 this result may be indicative of the involvement of several alternative mechanisms it can be posited that the reduced products tbh2 red or tb2h4 red remain bound by nom or these complexes do not break down instantaneously given that the diffusion coefficients of the nom complexes with tbh2 red or tb2h4 red products are close to those of the initial tb nom complexes and at the same time they are much lower as shown in the preceding section than those of the free tb cations the time needed for the reduced complexes to be transferred convectively from the ring to the disc will increase because tbh2 red or tb2h4 red species appear to be unstable this will result in a lower fraction of these complexes reaching the ring at which they are ec oxidized alternatively the complexes of nom with tbh2 red or tb2h4 red products may exhibit lower ec reactivity due to the existence of stronger chemical bonds between the reduced forms of tb and nom the ec generated reduced form of tb may also undergo a sequential chemical reaction with the free nom molecules that are present at the surfaces of the disc and ring electrode as well in the solution adjacent to these electrodes these interactions will reduce further the availability of the reduced forms of tb for their ec driven oxidation at the ring electrode while the occurrence and relative contributions of these mechanisms remain to be ascertained the data presented in this section demonstrate that the rrde approach can be used to examine the yields and reactivity of intermediates formed upon ec transformations of nom complexes with organic redox active species at varying environmental conditions in terms of the practical significance of this study its results show that the rrde approach allows quantifying the ec reactivity of nom contaminant complexes the intermediates formed as a result of their redox reactions and last but not least mass transfer properties of nom and its complexes at environmentally relevant nom concentrations given that the quantitation mass transfer of nom and its complexes is critically important for any interfacially controlled process concerned with the removal of trace level contaminants notably the ec treatment adsorption and membrane methods the data of this study and its experimental approach can be used to optimize the design and operating conditions of relevant engineered systems for instance one or several ec active pollutants probes that form complexes with nom can be used to determine the mass transfer properties of these complexes with at varying operational conditions and water treatment relevant nom concentrations in the context of fundamental studies of nom the diffusion coefficients determined based on the rrde data can be used to develop more detailed correlations between the diffusivity of nom its complexes and on the other hand nom molecular weights hydrodynamic radii and conformations while prior research have demonstrated the existence of correlations between the molecular weights of nom and its diffusivity beckett et al 1987 considerably more data needs to be generated for nom of varying provenance and a wide range of ph and ionic strengths in addition the rrde examination of nom pollutant complexation or the use of this approach to study redox or halogenation induced transformations of nom per se e g in the case of ozonation or chlorination are likely to yield currently absent data concerning the generation of redox active intermediates that may play important roles in the generation of the by products of nom treatment 4 conclusions the method of rotating ring disc electrode rrde was used to quantify the ec reactions and mass transfer properties of the complexes of aquatic and soil nom exemplified by suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and pahokee peat fulvic acid ppfa respectively with the organic cation toluidine blue tb the rrde experiments demonstrated that in the range of the disc potentials 0 2 to 0 4 v vs the standard ag agcl reference electrode the reduction of both tb solutes and surface adsorbed species takes place at disc potentials 0 4 v the ec reduction is controlled by the convective transfer of free tb cations and tb nom complexes to the electrode surface the disc currents associated with the ec reduction of tb decrease consistently in the presence of nom this was shown be caused by the increased mass transfer limitations characteristic for tb nom complexes primarily to much lower diffusion coefficients of these complexes compared with those of the free tb cations the ec reduction of tb cations and tb nom complexes was accompanied by the formation of the ec active products e g tbh2 red or tb2h4 red and their complexes with nom the rrde data showed that the presence of nom results in strong decreases of the fraction of ec active intermediates that are convectively transferred from the disc to the ring the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain to be ascertained the reported results facilitate a better understanding of the mass transfer properties of complexes of nom with organic cations and other redox active species formed at environmentally relevant nom concentrations this approach may be expanded to study the intrinsic chemistry

17674,disinfection by products dbps are associated with various adverse health effects diversiform advanced treatment processes have been applied for the control of dbps but dbps can still be frequently detected in tap water tea leaves can be made into popular beverage and is itself a porous bio adsorbent by simulating tea brewing process this study evaluated the removal of dbps from drinking water during the tea brewing process removal of four trihalomethanes thms and four haloacetamides hams by different fermentation degree tea leaves was investigated little dbps were removed by unfermented and semi fermented tea leaves i e meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea with less than 5 removal of hams whereas 40 hams can be removed by fermented tea i e jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea tea soup is neutral and slightly acidic so little dbp hydrolysis was observed under typical tea leaf brewing process dbps were mainly removed by volatilization and adsorption during tea brewing removal difference caused by dbp volatilization is very small the dbp removal difference of four kinds of tea leaves may be caused by fermentation degree the surface of unfermented meitan turquoise bud had a smooth and regular morphology whereas a rough irregular hollow and spongy surface of fermented tea i e jinjunmei and shuixian tea was observed generally the higher the degree of tea fermentation the more adsorption sites and the more removal of dbps finally the model which takes the dbp initial concentration tea leaf dose and brewing time into account was established under the experimental conditions to predict the variation of dbp concentration during tea brewing and suggestions for dbp removal were provided to reduce dbp exposure risk the integrated toxic risk during tea brewing was also investigated and about 30 integrated cytotoxicity and 26 genotoxicity was reduced during jinjunmei and shuixian tea leaf brewing graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products tea adsorption volatilization 1 introduction the diminishing availability of pristine water compels human to use waste impacted waters as source of drinking water chlorine disinfection is an indispensable process to prevent the transmission of potentially fatal waterborne disease disinfection by products dbps are inevitably generated due to the reaction between complex organics halides i e br and i in water and disinfectants richardson et al 2007 the dbps has always been a focus of public health issue epidemiological studies provided sufficient evidence revealing the association between increasing risk of bladder cancer colorectal cancer poor pregnancy outcomes and long time chlorinated water exposure bove et al 2002 2007 in 1970s trihalomethanes thms were first detected in drinking water rook and authoranonymous 1973 followed by haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals and other carbonaceous dbps c dbps thms are the most prevalent dbps in chlorinated drinking water accounting for approximately 13 7 of the halogenated dbps reported at 12 drinking water treatment plants in united states krasner et al 2006 the maximum allowed levels of total thms and five haas in drinking water were set at an annual average of 80 μg l and 60 μg l respectively by the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2006 in the past decade nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams have been spotlighted due to high toxicity and detection frequency i e hams are 142 more cytotoxic than 5 regulated haas plewa et al 2008a 2008b chu et al 2010 2015a muellner et al 2007 yun and reckhow 2015 in order to mitigate health risk numerous attempts have been implemented to control dbps the removal of dbp precursors prior to disinfection is considered to be the most effective method chu et al 2011 2015b 2016b shah et al 2012 xie et al 2013 it has been reported that formation potential of hams decreased by 91 1 with uv persulfate pretreatment chu et al 2015b replacing chlorine disinfectant with other disinfectants such as chloramine ozone chlorine dioxide and ultraviolet could be another option for controlling dbps although a lot of studies showed considerable removal efficiency of dbps at the laboratory level yao et al 2018 their application in drinking water treatment plants is limited due to high cost or inferior operability in addition the secondary chlorine addition would also affect the dbp concentration in distribution system lee et al 2006 sadiq et al 2007 islam et al 2017 all in all dbps are still frequently detected in tap water for instance four regulated thms was detected at a mean level of 38 μg l in distribution system in united states richardson et al 2007 the total concentration of four regulated thms was detected to be lower than 92 8 μg l in drinking water in china deng et al 2008 hans and hams have been widely detected at μg l level in drinking waters krasner et al 2006 sun et al 2019 tea is an internationally popular beverage second only to water in consumption bajpai and jain 2010 it has been reported that approximately 20 billion cups of tea are drunk daily in the world razmovski and šćiban 2008 with annual per capita consumption exceeding 40 l international tea committee 1980 except for the delicious flavor tea leaf is a porous solid and a good bio absorbent porous reticular structure on the tea leaf surface and intricate microporous structure on the inner tea leaf surface result into a higher specific surface area which is conducive to the enrichment and separation of pollutants bajpai and jain 2010 kameda et al 2020 previous studies have reported that tea waste i e tea leaves that have been brewed in hot water was a good adsorbent with multi layer physical adsorption capacity ng et al 2013 tea leaf was able to adsorb large amount of heavy metal pollutants in waters including pb2 cd2 and cu2 bajpai and jain 2010 mayumi et al 2004 as well as organic matter like phenols gundogdu et al 2012 there is still a certain concentration of dbps in tap water and tea leaves as the last substance added to drinking water may contribute to the removal of dbps with its good adsorption performance thus reduce our exposure to dbps however little is known regarding the dbp removal from tap water during tea brewing dbps are closely related to human health and tea leaves may significantly reduce human exposure to dbps therefore tea leaves were tested as a potential bio sorbent for the removal of dbps from drinking water in this work in this study the removal of dbps during simulation tea brewing process was investigated one of the objectives of this study was to evaluate the impacts of tea leaf type contact time tea leaf dose initial dbp concentration on the removal efficiency of two class of typical dbps another key objective of this study was to investigate the removal mechanism during tea brewing the mathematical model was established according to kinetic analysis to predict the variation of dbps in terms of the tea type contact time tea leaf dose and initial dbp concentration the establishment of the model is conductive to understand the attenuation of dbps during tea brewing under different conditions and provide suggestions for reducing the toxicity risk caused by dbps lastly the toxicity variation during tea leaf brewing was investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 chemical and material four ham standards dichloroacetamide dcam 99 bromochloroacetamide bcam 99 trichloroacetamide tcam 99 and bromodichloroacetamide bdcam 99 were obtained from alfa aesar inc karlsruhe germany four mixed thm standards trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm tribromomethane tbm dibromochloromethane dbcm were provided by sigma aldrich inc usa four kinds of tea leaves meitan turquoise bud dahongpao tea jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea were obtained from local supermarket methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and anhydrous sodium sulfate were purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china all other chemicals were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and were of analytical grade ultrapure water was produced from millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mώ cm billerica usa hot water was heated from ultrapure water solution ph was measured onsite using a solid selective electrode electrolytic gel connected to a multimeter wtw3410 germany 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were conducted in 250 ml beakers fig 1 accurate 200 ml hot water 99 c 1 c was added into beakers mixed with a certain amount of dbps four thms and four hams and a certain amount of tea leaves keep still after stirring 1 min in order to simulate the real tea brewing process the contact time was controlled within 60 min there was no cover on the top of the beaker at prescribed reaction times 10 ml of samples were withdrawn with a 25 ml gas tight syringe and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the samples were quickly transferred into a cool water bath at 20 c for the determination of residual dbps so the recovery rate is not affected by temperature 3 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added into 10 ml of the filtered solutions for better phase separation then the solution was mixed with 4 ml of mtbe and shaken by an ika oscillator staufen german at 2300 r min for 5 min and then held still for 10 min thereafter 1 ml of the organic phase was extracted into the gas chromatograph gc autosampler vial for further analysis the fermentation of tea is actually a series of biological oxidation process catalyzed by oxidases originally present in cell walls which can promote the oxidation of catechins after cell wall damage lin et al 2003 the fermentation degree affects the characteristics of tea leaf surface which may affect the removal efficiency thus four kinds of tea leaves i e meitan turquoise bud dahongpao tea jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea with different fermentation degree were selected to evaluate the effect of fermentation degree on the removal of dbps fermentation degree of meitan turquoise bud dahongpao tea jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea is 0 30 60 100 and 100 respectively the effects of tea leaf dose 2 5 g l 5 g l 7 5 g l 10 g l initial dbp concentration 40 80 and 140 μg l and contact time 0 15 30 45 60 min on the removal of dbps were also evaluated the control experiment was performed without any tea leaf addition the reaction between tea soup and dbps was investigated to examine the impact of dissolved matter released from tea leaves on dbp removal shuixian tea leaves were added into hot water particularly the preparation of tea soup was carried out in a vacuum cup which was placed in a 99 c 1 c water bath to maintain the temperature after an hour of brewing the tea leaves were filtered then 200 μg l individual dbps were added into the tea soup sampling as described above at prescribed reaction times the removal percentage was calculated by the following formula 1 e t c 0 c t c 0 100 where et is dbp removal percentage c0 is initial dbp concentration μg l ct is dbp concentration at t min μg l the error bars in all the figures represent the relative standard deviation of two replicates 2 3 analytical method 2 3 1 dbp determination the analysis of target dbps using a gc coupled with an electron capture detector ecd qp 2010 plus shimadzu japan a gc column rtx 5 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm film thickness was used for separation more details of this method have been presented in the previous studies krasner et al 2006 chu et al 2010 thm and ham detection was shown as follow the gc oven temperature was kept at 30 c for 10 min then the temperature was ramped to 72 c at 14 c min and was held for 1 min finally the temperature was raised to 200 c at 40 c min and was maintained for 2 min 2 3 2 quality assurance and quality control eight dbp standard solutions with a concentration of 1 g l for each dbp were dissolved in the methanol and mixed well which as the stock solution was stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c before use new working solutions were prepared by diluting stock solutions with ultrapure water the extracted samples were analyzed within 24 h each time that the new dbps are prepared the quality control samples were analyzed to check laboratory performance to analyze the recoveries of dbps matrix spiked samples and blank spiked samples were analyzed along with field samples the results showed that all dbps presented good recoveries in the range of 88 95 the limits of detection lods and limits of quantification loqs of dbps were calculated by a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and 10 respectively which were 0 04 0 08 and 0 10 0 28 μg l table s1 2 3 3 scanning electron microscope scanning electron microscope sem fei nova nano 450 analysis was carried out in order to observe the surface structure of tea leaves the original tea leaves are generally curly and tightly compressed which is not conducive to the observation of tea leaf surface tea leaves were brewing with hot water without dbp addition to stretch surface for a better scanning after 60 min the water was removed and the brewed tea leaves were transferred to a freezer dryer for further evaporation afterwards the dry tea leaves were selected to be observed by sem 2 3 4 total organic halogen tox total organic halogen tox in water samples were determined using a tox analyzer multi x 2000 aox jena germany acidified samples ph 2 were adsorbed on activated carbon washed with nitric acid to remove inorganic carbon then the processed sample was put into the instrument to quantify using combustion and coulomb titration 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tea fermentation degree on dbp removal the concentration of dbps during four kinds of tea leaf brewing processes was observed to investigate the effect of tea leaf fermentation degree on dbp removal fig 2 shows the removal percentages of four thms and four hams during tea brewing by four fermentation degree tea leaves four thms were found to be removed in varying degrees in control experiment without tea leaf addition the ph in hot water without tea addition ranged from 6 8 to 7 2 hams were stable under neutral and weakly acidic conditions and the hydrolysis can be neglected within an hour ding et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 it has been reported that at a ph of 6 9 the observed hydrolysis rate constants for tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were 4 9 10 3 5 5 10 2 5 1 10 2 and 1 8 10 2 h 1 respectively at 90 c zhang et al 2015 when the initial concentration of thms is 200 μg l same with the control experiment in this study hydrolysis percentages of tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were 0 5 5 3 4 0 and 1 7 respectively the total removal percentages of tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were 21 5 19 4 14 6 and 7 9 respectively in addition the water temperature in this experiment is gradually reduced so the hydrolysis percentage is lower than the value calculated except for hydrolysis the residual removal of thms in control experiment was mainly caused by volatilization the removal of tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm caused by volatilization was about 21 0 14 1 12 6 and 6 2 respectively it has been reported that 69 thms was reduced in heating water to boiling batterman et al 2000 no ham volatilization was observed in fig 2a which can be explained by that boiling points of hams are higher than 200 c as shown in table s1 and no obvious hydrolysis of ham was observed during the experiment boiling points of four thms are relatively low especially for tcm and bdcm with boiling points lower than 100 c causing up to 20 volatilization obvious dbp removal can be observed during tea leaf brewing process however it has been reported that tea leaf can also act as dbp precursor lou et al 2019 wu et al 1998 actual finished water usually contains about 1 mg l of residual chlorine and the residual chlorine decreases rapidly as distance from the treatment plant increases and even disappear in the peripheral sections of distribution system al jasser 2007 in addition chlorine can be removed during boiling tom bond et al 2016 the residual chlorine in boiling water we actually to brew tea leaves is extremely low anyway water without chlorine was recommended for tea leaf brewing removal percentages at 30 min and 60 min in control experiment were similar showing that volatilization was close to its maximum within 30 min afterwards little volatilization was observed the water temperature gradually decreased because of not being heated during the simulation experiment which might result in a decreasing dbp volatilization with time even no more volatilization after 30 min the dbp removal efficiency at 60 min were all higher than 30 min for four kinds of tea leaves as is shown in fig 2b removal percentages of four hams by meitan turquoise bud were close to control experiment whereas removal of thms was slightly higher than the control experiment and the same trend for dahongpao tea the selective removal on thms and hams shown by meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea may be related to the molecular structure of thms and hams for jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea although the removal percentages of hams were not as good as thms ham removal percentages were significantly higher than the other two kinds of tea leaves even reaching 40 the removal difference showed by four kinds of tea leaves and the mechanism of dbp removal during tea brewing was further discussed in the next section 3 2 mechanism of dbp removal during tea brewing it can be seen from the control experiment fig 2a that volatilization contributed to the dbp removal 80 of the insoluble parts of tea leaves are composed of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin and polyphenols wu et al 1998 substances with reducing capacity e g tea polyphenols will be dissolved during tea brewing yoshino et al 1994 and may react with dbps therefore the reactions between dissolved matter in tea soup and dbps were investigated in terms of the chemical composition the essence of fermentation is the oxidation reaction of tea polyphenols jin et al 2020 as fermentation duration increases the proportion of tea polyphenols decreased and was oxidized to theaflavin and thearubigins as is shown in fig 2 unfermented meitan turquoise bud and semi fermented dahongpao tea leaves have a poor removal effect on dbps even including removal caused by volatilization even if the dissolved matter from unfermented meitan turquoise bud and semi fermented dahongpao tea leaves react with dbps it will be weak therefore one of full fermented tea leaves i e shuixian tea leaves with good removal effect was selected to explore the reaction between dissolved substance from tea leaves and dbps as is shown in fig 3 dbp removal efficiency of tea soup was slightly higher than that of control experiment without tea leaf addition from 0 6 to 2 9 indicating a weak reaction of dissolved matters and the dbps tox was also tested tox is an index of total concentration of all the halogenated organic compounds in the solution as is shown in fig s1 the tox value of tea soup was lower than that of control experiment indicating that reduced dbps may be dehalogenated rather than react with dissolved substances to form new halogenated substances tox can also be detected in tea soup without adding dbps which may be contributed by organochlorine pesticides such as hexachlorobenzene heptachlor and aldrin and organobromine pesticide and so on sajid and alhooshani 2020 liu and min 2012 the removal percentage difference between tea leaf and tea soup is mainly caused by adsorption it is noteworthy that adsorption and volatilization are the main contributors while the role of dissolved matters from tea leaves can be ignored in dbp removal the removal selectivity of meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea leaves to thm and ham in fig 2 could be explained by that compared to hams the thms have lower molecular weight and are more easily adsorbed into the tea leaves resulting higher thm adsorption newcombe et al 1997 water with high temperature can cause various degree of dbp volatilization and volatilization of dbps with high boiling points can be negligible i e hams the volatilization and the adsorption of tcm and bdcm boiling points below 100 c during tea brewing were evaluated dbp removal in the control experiment is considered as volatilization the volatilization and adsorption percentages were calculated according to equations 2 and 3 and the results are shown in fig 4 2 vt k0 kt 100 k0 3 at et vt where vt is volatilization percentage at t min k0 is initial dbp concentration in control experiment kt is dbp concentration at t min in control experiment at is adsorption percentage at t min et is removal percentage in the presence of tea for tcm the adsorption percentages of four kinds of tea leaves during the brewing process were all lower than volatilization so volatilization was the main contributor on the elimination of tcm however the adsorption percentage increased with time generally physical adsorption is mainly related to weak interaction such as van der waals force which is an exothermic reaction chemical adsorption is usually endothermic because of the formation of chemical bonds kameda et al 2020 adsorption rates tend to increase with the decreasing water temperature as shown in fig 4 so that the adsorption caused by tea leaves was considered to be physical adsorption the adsorption proportion of bdcm by meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea was lower than the volatilization proportion but for jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea adsorption percentages kept increasing with time and were higher than volatilization after 30 min leading to high removal efficiency of bdcm it has been reported that oh group was the main tea leaf function group qiao et al 2019 therefore compared with tcm bdcm with higher polarity was more easily adsorbed and similar results was observed on activated carbon adsorption zhang 2019 in general although the volatilization of bdcm was weaker than tcm bdcm was well absorbed on the tea leaves which makes the overall bdcm removal percentage slightly higher than that of tcm as is shown in figs 2 and 4 the removal percentages on dbps of the four tea leaves were different the volatilization of dbps and dissolved matters had little difference in the same temperature so the difference was mainly caused by adsorption the adsorption performance is often related to the number of adsorption sites provided by adsorbents the fermentation process has a great influence on the quality of tea leaves so tea leaves are usually classified according to the fermentation degree qiong 2019 in addition to chemical oxidation jin et al 2020 microorganisms are also involved during tea fermentation wen et al 2010 and the enzymes secreted by them can decompose organic matters such as natural fibers and pectin which may contribute to the porous structure of tea leaves abe et al 2008 the longer the fermentation time is the higher the fermentation degree is and the more the surface structure of tea leaves is affected unfermented shuixian tea leaves were obtained and the dbp removal was observed during brewing of unfermented shuixian tea leaves as is shown in fig s2 dbp removal by unfermented shuixian tea leaves was similar to the control experiment indicating that fermentation play an important role on tea leaf adsorption capacity therefore different fermentation degree may related to the different adsorption of dbps surface morphologies of four kinds of tea leaves were observed through sem fig 5 as is shown in fig 5 compared to the semi fermented dahongpao tea leaves fig 5b the surface of unfermented meitan turquoise bud had a smooth and regular morphology fig 5a after a thorough fermentation the surface morphology of jinjunmei fig 5c and shuixian tea leaves fig 5d was significantly different from meitan turquoise with a rough irregular hollow and spongy surface the higher the degree of fermentation is the richer the microporous structure is and the more adsorption sites it can provide this also explains the different removal capacity of four kinds of tea leaves in fig 2 for the adsorption of hams the adsorption caused by the pore structure of jinjunmei and shuixian tea may offset the weak interaction of function groups on the tea leaf surface leading to high removal percentage of hams 3 3 the effect of tea leaf dose on the removal of thms shuixian tea leaf showed the best removal efficiency on the removal of dbps especially for thms therefore the effect of shuixian tea leaf dose on thm removal was evaluated the experimental results are shown in fig 6 the removal percentage was slightly enhanced with the increasing tea leaf dose the removal percentages of tcm bdcm and dbcm were only increased by about 20 at 60 min when the tea leaf dose was increased from 2 5 g l to 10 g l for tcm removal percentage continued increasing with the increasing tea leaf dose while for bdcm dbcm and tbm the removal percentage of tea leaf dose at 7 5 g l and 10 g l were similar indicating that continuous increasing of the dose greater than 7 5 g l will not significantly affect the removal percentage of these three thms it might be explained that too much tea leaves caused the overlap and the adsorption site did not increase when the tea leaf dose exceeded 7 5 g l in addition a large number of tea dissolute substance may compete with dbp for adsorption sites the removal amount of 1 g tea leaf is about 4 3 4 8 and 4 7 μg for bdcm dbcm and tbm respectively original tea adsorption capacity is limited only through the modification adsorption performance can be greatly improved qiao et al 2019 the time limitation of typical tea brewing process was taken into account so the experiment was not carried out for a longer time span from the perspective of time change dbp removal rate and time were roughly linear and the thm adsorption of four tea leaves did not reach saturation within 60 min so the concentrations of four thms kept decreasing as is shown in table s2 the four thms decayed linearly with time when the tea leaf dose was less than 7 5 g l a good linear correlation r2 0 88 0 99 between the tea leaf dose and the slope of the degradation curve was observed in fig s3 in general the change of tea leaf dose had a limited influence on the removal of dbps within 60 min 3 4 the effect of dbp initial concentration on the removal of thms dbps vary in concentration in drinking water and dbps with different initial concentrations are likely to affect the removal percentage therefore the experiment explored the thm removal with different initial concentrations in shuixian tea leaf brewing process as shown in fig 7 the concentrations of all the four thms under different initial concentration showed a linear correlation with time moreover the dbp concentration had a continuous downward trend with time when initial thms were below 80 μg l indicating that adsorption has not reached saturation within 60 min during the experiment when the initial thm concentration was around 140 μg l the adsorption reached saturation at 45 min linear fitting was performed on the experimental data and the slope of the obtained degradation curve was shown in table s3 the initial concentration of each dbp and the absolute value of the degradation curve slope were analyzed by linear fitting as shown in fig s4 all of the four initial concentration absolute slope value of degradation curve curve had good linear relations for the four dbps tested in the experiment the absolute slope value of the degradation curve also increased with the increasing initial dbp concentration namely the reaction rate increased with the increasing initial dbps concentration this indicates that the initial concentration is an important factor influencing the change of dbp concentration during tea brewing the removal amount of 1 g tea leaves increased with increasing initial dbp concentration because of the increasing adsorbate adsorbent interaction which is same with phenol adsorption by chemically activated tea waste gundogdu et al 2012 although the removal rates or removal capacity of 1 g tea leaf increased with the increasing initial dbps concentration the removal percentage decreased with the increasing initial concentration as shown in table s4 this could be explained by that the adsorption site of tea leaf was sufficient at the beginning of the experiment the dbp addition would rapidly bind the site showing a faster reaction rate a given dose of tea leaves provides a limited reaction site resulting in a lower removal percentages of higher initial dbp concentrations 3 5 establishment of mathematic model to predict dbp concentration variation as stated earlier the thm concentration decreased continuously in the reaction time of 60 min showing that the adsorption of tea was unsaturated in addition the reaction rate the initial dbp concentrations and the time were all linearly correlated therefore mathematics model can be established under limited conditions to predict the attenuation of dbps during tea brewing the following conclusions are only applicable to typical shuixian tea leaf brewing process with the brewing time no more than 60 min and the tea leaf dose ranging from 2 5 to 7 5 g l 3 5 1 effect of initial dbp concentration on the mathematic model as is shown in fig 7 in the case of a certain amount of tea the initial dbp concentration was a major factor affecting dbps removal percentage during tea brewing the slope of degradation curves was linearly correlated with initial dbp concentration and it can be expressed as equation 4 4 q m c 0 n q the absolute value of the slope of the curve c0 dbps initial concentration m n parameters related to dbps parameters i e m and n was calculated based on the data of fig 7 and are shown in table s5 then the concentration of dbps in the reaction process can be expressed as equation 5 5 ct c0 qt c0 mc0 n t 1 mt c0 nt 3 5 2 effect of tea leaf dose on the on the mathematic model according to the fig 6 the tea leaf dose slightly affected the removal percentage of dbps four times of tea leaf dose only led to a 20 improvement in the removal therefore the dose factor was taken into account as a secondary factor in this prediction model and a single influencing factor η was introduced to characterize the effect of tea leaf dose on removal rate η was calculated by the following formula 6 η a a ref 7 qd ηq where a is slope of removal curve during tea brewing a ref is removal rate used as reference the slope of removal curve when the tea leaf dose was 5 0 g l was set as reference qd is the slope of dbps removal curve when the tea leaf dose is d there was a linear relationship between the tea leaf dose 2 5 7 5 g l and the slope of dbp removal curve and it can be shown as equation 8 8 a u d v where u and v are parameters related to dbps type d is tea leaf dose the value of u and v can be calculated based on the data of fig 6 and are shown in table s6 thus 9 η u d v u d ref v u d v 5 u v where d ref is tea leaf dose used as reference i e 5 0 g l substitute equation 9 into equation 5 to get equation 10 10 c t c 0 u d v 5 u v m c 0 n t there was little difference in temperature between samples during tea brewing so temperature is not considered in this estimation model this model is only for the prediction of thms concentration in the brewing process of shuixian tea and the brewing time is limited to 60 min the tea leaf dose is from 2 5 g l to 7 5 g l other types of tea and other dbps need further experimental exploration according to the model the halving period of thms at different initial concentrations can be predicted the results are shown in fig 8 for example at the shuixian tea leaf dose of 7 5 g l it took 25 min to halve the concentration of 20 μg l bdcm fermented tea high dose tea and long time brewing are more conducive to dbp removal 3 6 the integrated toxic risk during tea leaf brewing to systematically investigate the toxicological characteristics of this process cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti were introduced as a comprehensive toxicity indicator chu et al 2016a the calculation formula is shown in equations 11 and 12 and the results are shown in fig s5 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values were derived from plewa s vitro toxicity test using chinese hamster ovarian cells wagner and plewa 2017 11 c t i 1 c 1 2 x c x 12 g t i 1 g e n o t o x i c p o t e n c y x c x c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx expressed forms of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity defined elsewhere wagner and plewa 2017 cx is concentration nm 1 of each dbp x tcm dbcm dcbm tbm dcam bcam tcam and bdcam the higher the cti and gti value the higher the toxicity risk according to the fig s5 after 60 min brewing of jinjunmei and shuixian tea about 33 cti and 26 gti were reduced however the decrease of cti and gti was not significant when other tea leaves were brewed mainly because that meitan turqueise bud and dahongpao tea leaves mainly removed thms with lower toxicity 4 conclusion this experiment explored the removal of four thms and four hams by different types of tea during the brewing process the adsorption capacity of unfermented meitan turquois and semi fermented dahongpao tea was relatively weak due to less adsorption site with smooth tea surface fermented jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea showed good adsorption of both thms and hams for dbps with higher boiling point the removal of dbps mainly from adsorption for dbps with low boiling point both volatilization and adsorption were main contributors additionally the dbps removal caused by dissolved matters from tea leaves can be ignored tea leaf dose slightly affected the removal percentage of dbps the higher the initial dbp concentration the higher the removal rate however the increase of initial concentration lead to the decrease of overall removal percentage under the condition of this experiment a preliminary estimation mathematical model was established to predict the change of dbp concentration during tea brewing with known initial dbp concentration and tea leaf dose on the top of that boiled water which does not contain disinfectant is recommended for tea leaf brewing to avoid the reaction between chlorine and tea not only does tea taste good it can also reduce health risks associated with dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17674,disinfection by products dbps are associated with various adverse health effects diversiform advanced treatment processes have been applied for the control of dbps but dbps can still be frequently detected in tap water tea leaves can be made into popular beverage and is itself a porous bio adsorbent by simulating tea brewing process this study evaluated the removal of dbps from drinking water during the tea brewing process removal of four trihalomethanes thms and four haloacetamides hams by different fermentation degree tea leaves was investigated little dbps were removed by unfermented and semi fermented tea leaves i e meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea with less than 5 removal of hams whereas 40 hams can be removed by fermented tea i e jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea tea soup is neutral and slightly acidic so little dbp hydrolysis was observed under typical tea leaf brewing process dbps were mainly removed by volatilization and adsorption during tea brewing removal difference caused by dbp volatilization is very small the dbp removal difference of four kinds of tea leaves may be caused by fermentation degree the surface of unfermented meitan turquoise bud had a smooth and regular morphology whereas a rough irregular hollow and spongy surface of fermented tea i e jinjunmei and shuixian tea was observed generally the higher the degree of tea fermentation the more adsorption sites and the more removal of dbps finally the model which takes the dbp initial concentration tea leaf dose and brewing time into account was established under the experimental conditions to predict the variation of dbp concentration during tea brewing and suggestions for dbp removal were provided to reduce dbp exposure risk the integrated toxic risk during tea brewing was also investigated and about 30 integrated cytotoxicity and 26 genotoxicity was reduced during jinjunmei and shuixian tea leaf brewing graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection by products tea adsorption volatilization 1 introduction the diminishing availability of pristine water compels human to use waste impacted waters as source of drinking water chlorine disinfection is an indispensable process to prevent the transmission of potentially fatal waterborne disease disinfection by products dbps are inevitably generated due to the reaction between complex organics halides i e br and i in water and disinfectants richardson et al 2007 the dbps has always been a focus of public health issue epidemiological studies provided sufficient evidence revealing the association between increasing risk of bladder cancer colorectal cancer poor pregnancy outcomes and long time chlorinated water exposure bove et al 2002 2007 in 1970s trihalomethanes thms were first detected in drinking water rook and authoranonymous 1973 followed by haloacetic acids haas haloacetaldehydes hals and other carbonaceous dbps c dbps thms are the most prevalent dbps in chlorinated drinking water accounting for approximately 13 7 of the halogenated dbps reported at 12 drinking water treatment plants in united states krasner et al 2006 the maximum allowed levels of total thms and five haas in drinking water were set at an annual average of 80 μg l and 60 μg l respectively by the united states environmental protection agency u s epa 2006 in the past decade nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and haloacetamides hams have been spotlighted due to high toxicity and detection frequency i e hams are 142 more cytotoxic than 5 regulated haas plewa et al 2008a 2008b chu et al 2010 2015a muellner et al 2007 yun and reckhow 2015 in order to mitigate health risk numerous attempts have been implemented to control dbps the removal of dbp precursors prior to disinfection is considered to be the most effective method chu et al 2011 2015b 2016b shah et al 2012 xie et al 2013 it has been reported that formation potential of hams decreased by 91 1 with uv persulfate pretreatment chu et al 2015b replacing chlorine disinfectant with other disinfectants such as chloramine ozone chlorine dioxide and ultraviolet could be another option for controlling dbps although a lot of studies showed considerable removal efficiency of dbps at the laboratory level yao et al 2018 their application in drinking water treatment plants is limited due to high cost or inferior operability in addition the secondary chlorine addition would also affect the dbp concentration in distribution system lee et al 2006 sadiq et al 2007 islam et al 2017 all in all dbps are still frequently detected in tap water for instance four regulated thms was detected at a mean level of 38 μg l in distribution system in united states richardson et al 2007 the total concentration of four regulated thms was detected to be lower than 92 8 μg l in drinking water in china deng et al 2008 hans and hams have been widely detected at μg l level in drinking waters krasner et al 2006 sun et al 2019 tea is an internationally popular beverage second only to water in consumption bajpai and jain 2010 it has been reported that approximately 20 billion cups of tea are drunk daily in the world razmovski and šćiban 2008 with annual per capita consumption exceeding 40 l international tea committee 1980 except for the delicious flavor tea leaf is a porous solid and a good bio absorbent porous reticular structure on the tea leaf surface and intricate microporous structure on the inner tea leaf surface result into a higher specific surface area which is conducive to the enrichment and separation of pollutants bajpai and jain 2010 kameda et al 2020 previous studies have reported that tea waste i e tea leaves that have been brewed in hot water was a good adsorbent with multi layer physical adsorption capacity ng et al 2013 tea leaf was able to adsorb large amount of heavy metal pollutants in waters including pb2 cd2 and cu2 bajpai and jain 2010 mayumi et al 2004 as well as organic matter like phenols gundogdu et al 2012 there is still a certain concentration of dbps in tap water and tea leaves as the last substance added to drinking water may contribute to the removal of dbps with its good adsorption performance thus reduce our exposure to dbps however little is known regarding the dbp removal from tap water during tea brewing dbps are closely related to human health and tea leaves may significantly reduce human exposure to dbps therefore tea leaves were tested as a potential bio sorbent for the removal of dbps from drinking water in this work in this study the removal of dbps during simulation tea brewing process was investigated one of the objectives of this study was to evaluate the impacts of tea leaf type contact time tea leaf dose initial dbp concentration on the removal efficiency of two class of typical dbps another key objective of this study was to investigate the removal mechanism during tea brewing the mathematical model was established according to kinetic analysis to predict the variation of dbps in terms of the tea type contact time tea leaf dose and initial dbp concentration the establishment of the model is conductive to understand the attenuation of dbps during tea brewing under different conditions and provide suggestions for reducing the toxicity risk caused by dbps lastly the toxicity variation during tea leaf brewing was investigated 2 materials and method 2 1 chemical and material four ham standards dichloroacetamide dcam 99 bromochloroacetamide bcam 99 trichloroacetamide tcam 99 and bromodichloroacetamide bdcam 99 were obtained from alfa aesar inc karlsruhe germany four mixed thm standards trichloromethane tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm tribromomethane tbm dibromochloromethane dbcm were provided by sigma aldrich inc usa four kinds of tea leaves meitan turquoise bud dahongpao tea jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea were obtained from local supermarket methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and anhydrous sodium sulfate were purchased from aladdin industrial inc shanghai china all other chemicals were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and were of analytical grade ultrapure water was produced from millipore milli q gradient water purification system 18 mώ cm billerica usa hot water was heated from ultrapure water solution ph was measured onsite using a solid selective electrode electrolytic gel connected to a multimeter wtw3410 germany 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were conducted in 250 ml beakers fig 1 accurate 200 ml hot water 99 c 1 c was added into beakers mixed with a certain amount of dbps four thms and four hams and a certain amount of tea leaves keep still after stirring 1 min in order to simulate the real tea brewing process the contact time was controlled within 60 min there was no cover on the top of the beaker at prescribed reaction times 10 ml of samples were withdrawn with a 25 ml gas tight syringe and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane filter the samples were quickly transferred into a cool water bath at 20 c for the determination of residual dbps so the recovery rate is not affected by temperature 3 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added into 10 ml of the filtered solutions for better phase separation then the solution was mixed with 4 ml of mtbe and shaken by an ika oscillator staufen german at 2300 r min for 5 min and then held still for 10 min thereafter 1 ml of the organic phase was extracted into the gas chromatograph gc autosampler vial for further analysis the fermentation of tea is actually a series of biological oxidation process catalyzed by oxidases originally present in cell walls which can promote the oxidation of catechins after cell wall damage lin et al 2003 the fermentation degree affects the characteristics of tea leaf surface which may affect the removal efficiency thus four kinds of tea leaves i e meitan turquoise bud dahongpao tea jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea with different fermentation degree were selected to evaluate the effect of fermentation degree on the removal of dbps fermentation degree of meitan turquoise bud dahongpao tea jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea is 0 30 60 100 and 100 respectively the effects of tea leaf dose 2 5 g l 5 g l 7 5 g l 10 g l initial dbp concentration 40 80 and 140 μg l and contact time 0 15 30 45 60 min on the removal of dbps were also evaluated the control experiment was performed without any tea leaf addition the reaction between tea soup and dbps was investigated to examine the impact of dissolved matter released from tea leaves on dbp removal shuixian tea leaves were added into hot water particularly the preparation of tea soup was carried out in a vacuum cup which was placed in a 99 c 1 c water bath to maintain the temperature after an hour of brewing the tea leaves were filtered then 200 μg l individual dbps were added into the tea soup sampling as described above at prescribed reaction times the removal percentage was calculated by the following formula 1 e t c 0 c t c 0 100 where et is dbp removal percentage c0 is initial dbp concentration μg l ct is dbp concentration at t min μg l the error bars in all the figures represent the relative standard deviation of two replicates 2 3 analytical method 2 3 1 dbp determination the analysis of target dbps using a gc coupled with an electron capture detector ecd qp 2010 plus shimadzu japan a gc column rtx 5 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm film thickness was used for separation more details of this method have been presented in the previous studies krasner et al 2006 chu et al 2010 thm and ham detection was shown as follow the gc oven temperature was kept at 30 c for 10 min then the temperature was ramped to 72 c at 14 c min and was held for 1 min finally the temperature was raised to 200 c at 40 c min and was maintained for 2 min 2 3 2 quality assurance and quality control eight dbp standard solutions with a concentration of 1 g l for each dbp were dissolved in the methanol and mixed well which as the stock solution was stored in amber glass bottles at 4 c before use new working solutions were prepared by diluting stock solutions with ultrapure water the extracted samples were analyzed within 24 h each time that the new dbps are prepared the quality control samples were analyzed to check laboratory performance to analyze the recoveries of dbps matrix spiked samples and blank spiked samples were analyzed along with field samples the results showed that all dbps presented good recoveries in the range of 88 95 the limits of detection lods and limits of quantification loqs of dbps were calculated by a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and 10 respectively which were 0 04 0 08 and 0 10 0 28 μg l table s1 2 3 3 scanning electron microscope scanning electron microscope sem fei nova nano 450 analysis was carried out in order to observe the surface structure of tea leaves the original tea leaves are generally curly and tightly compressed which is not conducive to the observation of tea leaf surface tea leaves were brewing with hot water without dbp addition to stretch surface for a better scanning after 60 min the water was removed and the brewed tea leaves were transferred to a freezer dryer for further evaporation afterwards the dry tea leaves were selected to be observed by sem 2 3 4 total organic halogen tox total organic halogen tox in water samples were determined using a tox analyzer multi x 2000 aox jena germany acidified samples ph 2 were adsorbed on activated carbon washed with nitric acid to remove inorganic carbon then the processed sample was put into the instrument to quantify using combustion and coulomb titration 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of tea fermentation degree on dbp removal the concentration of dbps during four kinds of tea leaf brewing processes was observed to investigate the effect of tea leaf fermentation degree on dbp removal fig 2 shows the removal percentages of four thms and four hams during tea brewing by four fermentation degree tea leaves four thms were found to be removed in varying degrees in control experiment without tea leaf addition the ph in hot water without tea addition ranged from 6 8 to 7 2 hams were stable under neutral and weakly acidic conditions and the hydrolysis can be neglected within an hour ding et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 it has been reported that at a ph of 6 9 the observed hydrolysis rate constants for tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were 4 9 10 3 5 5 10 2 5 1 10 2 and 1 8 10 2 h 1 respectively at 90 c zhang et al 2015 when the initial concentration of thms is 200 μg l same with the control experiment in this study hydrolysis percentages of tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were 0 5 5 3 4 0 and 1 7 respectively the total removal percentages of tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm were 21 5 19 4 14 6 and 7 9 respectively in addition the water temperature in this experiment is gradually reduced so the hydrolysis percentage is lower than the value calculated except for hydrolysis the residual removal of thms in control experiment was mainly caused by volatilization the removal of tcm dcbm dbcm and tbm caused by volatilization was about 21 0 14 1 12 6 and 6 2 respectively it has been reported that 69 thms was reduced in heating water to boiling batterman et al 2000 no ham volatilization was observed in fig 2a which can be explained by that boiling points of hams are higher than 200 c as shown in table s1 and no obvious hydrolysis of ham was observed during the experiment boiling points of four thms are relatively low especially for tcm and bdcm with boiling points lower than 100 c causing up to 20 volatilization obvious dbp removal can be observed during tea leaf brewing process however it has been reported that tea leaf can also act as dbp precursor lou et al 2019 wu et al 1998 actual finished water usually contains about 1 mg l of residual chlorine and the residual chlorine decreases rapidly as distance from the treatment plant increases and even disappear in the peripheral sections of distribution system al jasser 2007 in addition chlorine can be removed during boiling tom bond et al 2016 the residual chlorine in boiling water we actually to brew tea leaves is extremely low anyway water without chlorine was recommended for tea leaf brewing removal percentages at 30 min and 60 min in control experiment were similar showing that volatilization was close to its maximum within 30 min afterwards little volatilization was observed the water temperature gradually decreased because of not being heated during the simulation experiment which might result in a decreasing dbp volatilization with time even no more volatilization after 30 min the dbp removal efficiency at 60 min were all higher than 30 min for four kinds of tea leaves as is shown in fig 2b removal percentages of four hams by meitan turquoise bud were close to control experiment whereas removal of thms was slightly higher than the control experiment and the same trend for dahongpao tea the selective removal on thms and hams shown by meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea may be related to the molecular structure of thms and hams for jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea although the removal percentages of hams were not as good as thms ham removal percentages were significantly higher than the other two kinds of tea leaves even reaching 40 the removal difference showed by four kinds of tea leaves and the mechanism of dbp removal during tea brewing was further discussed in the next section 3 2 mechanism of dbp removal during tea brewing it can be seen from the control experiment fig 2a that volatilization contributed to the dbp removal 80 of the insoluble parts of tea leaves are composed of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin and polyphenols wu et al 1998 substances with reducing capacity e g tea polyphenols will be dissolved during tea brewing yoshino et al 1994 and may react with dbps therefore the reactions between dissolved matter in tea soup and dbps were investigated in terms of the chemical composition the essence of fermentation is the oxidation reaction of tea polyphenols jin et al 2020 as fermentation duration increases the proportion of tea polyphenols decreased and was oxidized to theaflavin and thearubigins as is shown in fig 2 unfermented meitan turquoise bud and semi fermented dahongpao tea leaves have a poor removal effect on dbps even including removal caused by volatilization even if the dissolved matter from unfermented meitan turquoise bud and semi fermented dahongpao tea leaves react with dbps it will be weak therefore one of full fermented tea leaves i e shuixian tea leaves with good removal effect was selected to explore the reaction between dissolved substance from tea leaves and dbps as is shown in fig 3 dbp removal efficiency of tea soup was slightly higher than that of control experiment without tea leaf addition from 0 6 to 2 9 indicating a weak reaction of dissolved matters and the dbps tox was also tested tox is an index of total concentration of all the halogenated organic compounds in the solution as is shown in fig s1 the tox value of tea soup was lower than that of control experiment indicating that reduced dbps may be dehalogenated rather than react with dissolved substances to form new halogenated substances tox can also be detected in tea soup without adding dbps which may be contributed by organochlorine pesticides such as hexachlorobenzene heptachlor and aldrin and organobromine pesticide and so on sajid and alhooshani 2020 liu and min 2012 the removal percentage difference between tea leaf and tea soup is mainly caused by adsorption it is noteworthy that adsorption and volatilization are the main contributors while the role of dissolved matters from tea leaves can be ignored in dbp removal the removal selectivity of meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea leaves to thm and ham in fig 2 could be explained by that compared to hams the thms have lower molecular weight and are more easily adsorbed into the tea leaves resulting higher thm adsorption newcombe et al 1997 water with high temperature can cause various degree of dbp volatilization and volatilization of dbps with high boiling points can be negligible i e hams the volatilization and the adsorption of tcm and bdcm boiling points below 100 c during tea brewing were evaluated dbp removal in the control experiment is considered as volatilization the volatilization and adsorption percentages were calculated according to equations 2 and 3 and the results are shown in fig 4 2 vt k0 kt 100 k0 3 at et vt where vt is volatilization percentage at t min k0 is initial dbp concentration in control experiment kt is dbp concentration at t min in control experiment at is adsorption percentage at t min et is removal percentage in the presence of tea for tcm the adsorption percentages of four kinds of tea leaves during the brewing process were all lower than volatilization so volatilization was the main contributor on the elimination of tcm however the adsorption percentage increased with time generally physical adsorption is mainly related to weak interaction such as van der waals force which is an exothermic reaction chemical adsorption is usually endothermic because of the formation of chemical bonds kameda et al 2020 adsorption rates tend to increase with the decreasing water temperature as shown in fig 4 so that the adsorption caused by tea leaves was considered to be physical adsorption the adsorption proportion of bdcm by meitan turquoise bud and dahongpao tea was lower than the volatilization proportion but for jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea adsorption percentages kept increasing with time and were higher than volatilization after 30 min leading to high removal efficiency of bdcm it has been reported that oh group was the main tea leaf function group qiao et al 2019 therefore compared with tcm bdcm with higher polarity was more easily adsorbed and similar results was observed on activated carbon adsorption zhang 2019 in general although the volatilization of bdcm was weaker than tcm bdcm was well absorbed on the tea leaves which makes the overall bdcm removal percentage slightly higher than that of tcm as is shown in figs 2 and 4 the removal percentages on dbps of the four tea leaves were different the volatilization of dbps and dissolved matters had little difference in the same temperature so the difference was mainly caused by adsorption the adsorption performance is often related to the number of adsorption sites provided by adsorbents the fermentation process has a great influence on the quality of tea leaves so tea leaves are usually classified according to the fermentation degree qiong 2019 in addition to chemical oxidation jin et al 2020 microorganisms are also involved during tea fermentation wen et al 2010 and the enzymes secreted by them can decompose organic matters such as natural fibers and pectin which may contribute to the porous structure of tea leaves abe et al 2008 the longer the fermentation time is the higher the fermentation degree is and the more the surface structure of tea leaves is affected unfermented shuixian tea leaves were obtained and the dbp removal was observed during brewing of unfermented shuixian tea leaves as is shown in fig s2 dbp removal by unfermented shuixian tea leaves was similar to the control experiment indicating that fermentation play an important role on tea leaf adsorption capacity therefore different fermentation degree may related to the different adsorption of dbps surface morphologies of four kinds of tea leaves were observed through sem fig 5 as is shown in fig 5 compared to the semi fermented dahongpao tea leaves fig 5b the surface of unfermented meitan turquoise bud had a smooth and regular morphology fig 5a after a thorough fermentation the surface morphology of jinjunmei fig 5c and shuixian tea leaves fig 5d was significantly different from meitan turquoise with a rough irregular hollow and spongy surface the higher the degree of fermentation is the richer the microporous structure is and the more adsorption sites it can provide this also explains the different removal capacity of four kinds of tea leaves in fig 2 for the adsorption of hams the adsorption caused by the pore structure of jinjunmei and shuixian tea may offset the weak interaction of function groups on the tea leaf surface leading to high removal percentage of hams 3 3 the effect of tea leaf dose on the removal of thms shuixian tea leaf showed the best removal efficiency on the removal of dbps especially for thms therefore the effect of shuixian tea leaf dose on thm removal was evaluated the experimental results are shown in fig 6 the removal percentage was slightly enhanced with the increasing tea leaf dose the removal percentages of tcm bdcm and dbcm were only increased by about 20 at 60 min when the tea leaf dose was increased from 2 5 g l to 10 g l for tcm removal percentage continued increasing with the increasing tea leaf dose while for bdcm dbcm and tbm the removal percentage of tea leaf dose at 7 5 g l and 10 g l were similar indicating that continuous increasing of the dose greater than 7 5 g l will not significantly affect the removal percentage of these three thms it might be explained that too much tea leaves caused the overlap and the adsorption site did not increase when the tea leaf dose exceeded 7 5 g l in addition a large number of tea dissolute substance may compete with dbp for adsorption sites the removal amount of 1 g tea leaf is about 4 3 4 8 and 4 7 μg for bdcm dbcm and tbm respectively original tea adsorption capacity is limited only through the modification adsorption performance can be greatly improved qiao et al 2019 the time limitation of typical tea brewing process was taken into account so the experiment was not carried out for a longer time span from the perspective of time change dbp removal rate and time were roughly linear and the thm adsorption of four tea leaves did not reach saturation within 60 min so the concentrations of four thms kept decreasing as is shown in table s2 the four thms decayed linearly with time when the tea leaf dose was less than 7 5 g l a good linear correlation r2 0 88 0 99 between the tea leaf dose and the slope of the degradation curve was observed in fig s3 in general the change of tea leaf dose had a limited influence on the removal of dbps within 60 min 3 4 the effect of dbp initial concentration on the removal of thms dbps vary in concentration in drinking water and dbps with different initial concentrations are likely to affect the removal percentage therefore the experiment explored the thm removal with different initial concentrations in shuixian tea leaf brewing process as shown in fig 7 the concentrations of all the four thms under different initial concentration showed a linear correlation with time moreover the dbp concentration had a continuous downward trend with time when initial thms were below 80 μg l indicating that adsorption has not reached saturation within 60 min during the experiment when the initial thm concentration was around 140 μg l the adsorption reached saturation at 45 min linear fitting was performed on the experimental data and the slope of the obtained degradation curve was shown in table s3 the initial concentration of each dbp and the absolute value of the degradation curve slope were analyzed by linear fitting as shown in fig s4 all of the four initial concentration absolute slope value of degradation curve curve had good linear relations for the four dbps tested in the experiment the absolute slope value of the degradation curve also increased with the increasing initial dbp concentration namely the reaction rate increased with the increasing initial dbps concentration this indicates that the initial concentration is an important factor influencing the change of dbp concentration during tea brewing the removal amount of 1 g tea leaves increased with increasing initial dbp concentration because of the increasing adsorbate adsorbent interaction which is same with phenol adsorption by chemically activated tea waste gundogdu et al 2012 although the removal rates or removal capacity of 1 g tea leaf increased with the increasing initial dbps concentration the removal percentage decreased with the increasing initial concentration as shown in table s4 this could be explained by that the adsorption site of tea leaf was sufficient at the beginning of the experiment the dbp addition would rapidly bind the site showing a faster reaction rate a given dose of tea leaves provides a limited reaction site resulting in a lower removal percentages of higher initial dbp concentrations 3 5 establishment of mathematic model to predict dbp concentration variation as stated earlier the thm concentration decreased continuously in the reaction time of 60 min showing that the adsorption of tea was unsaturated in addition the reaction rate the initial dbp concentrations and the time were all linearly correlated therefore mathematics model can be established under limited conditions to predict the attenuation of dbps during tea brewing the following conclusions are only applicable to typical shuixian tea leaf brewing process with the brewing time no more than 60 min and the tea leaf dose ranging from 2 5 to 7 5 g l 3 5 1 effect of initial dbp concentration on the mathematic model as is shown in fig 7 in the case of a certain amount of tea the initial dbp concentration was a major factor affecting dbps removal percentage during tea brewing the slope of degradation curves was linearly correlated with initial dbp concentration and it can be expressed as equation 4 4 q m c 0 n q the absolute value of the slope of the curve c0 dbps initial concentration m n parameters related to dbps parameters i e m and n was calculated based on the data of fig 7 and are shown in table s5 then the concentration of dbps in the reaction process can be expressed as equation 5 5 ct c0 qt c0 mc0 n t 1 mt c0 nt 3 5 2 effect of tea leaf dose on the on the mathematic model according to the fig 6 the tea leaf dose slightly affected the removal percentage of dbps four times of tea leaf dose only led to a 20 improvement in the removal therefore the dose factor was taken into account as a secondary factor in this prediction model and a single influencing factor η was introduced to characterize the effect of tea leaf dose on removal rate η was calculated by the following formula 6 η a a ref 7 qd ηq where a is slope of removal curve during tea brewing a ref is removal rate used as reference the slope of removal curve when the tea leaf dose was 5 0 g l was set as reference qd is the slope of dbps removal curve when the tea leaf dose is d there was a linear relationship between the tea leaf dose 2 5 7 5 g l and the slope of dbp removal curve and it can be shown as equation 8 8 a u d v where u and v are parameters related to dbps type d is tea leaf dose the value of u and v can be calculated based on the data of fig 6 and are shown in table s6 thus 9 η u d v u d ref v u d v 5 u v where d ref is tea leaf dose used as reference i e 5 0 g l substitute equation 9 into equation 5 to get equation 10 10 c t c 0 u d v 5 u v m c 0 n t there was little difference in temperature between samples during tea brewing so temperature is not considered in this estimation model this model is only for the prediction of thms concentration in the brewing process of shuixian tea and the brewing time is limited to 60 min the tea leaf dose is from 2 5 g l to 7 5 g l other types of tea and other dbps need further experimental exploration according to the model the halving period of thms at different initial concentrations can be predicted the results are shown in fig 8 for example at the shuixian tea leaf dose of 7 5 g l it took 25 min to halve the concentration of 20 μg l bdcm fermented tea high dose tea and long time brewing are more conducive to dbp removal 3 6 the integrated toxic risk during tea leaf brewing to systematically investigate the toxicological characteristics of this process cytotoxicity index cti and genotoxicity index gti were introduced as a comprehensive toxicity indicator chu et al 2016a the calculation formula is shown in equations 11 and 12 and the results are shown in fig s5 the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity values were derived from plewa s vitro toxicity test using chinese hamster ovarian cells wagner and plewa 2017 11 c t i 1 c 1 2 x c x 12 g t i 1 g e n o t o x i c p o t e n c y x c x c1 2x and genotoxic potencyx expressed forms of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity defined elsewhere wagner and plewa 2017 cx is concentration nm 1 of each dbp x tcm dbcm dcbm tbm dcam bcam tcam and bdcam the higher the cti and gti value the higher the toxicity risk according to the fig s5 after 60 min brewing of jinjunmei and shuixian tea about 33 cti and 26 gti were reduced however the decrease of cti and gti was not significant when other tea leaves were brewed mainly because that meitan turqueise bud and dahongpao tea leaves mainly removed thms with lower toxicity 4 conclusion this experiment explored the removal of four thms and four hams by different types of tea during the brewing process the adsorption capacity of unfermented meitan turquois and semi fermented dahongpao tea was relatively weak due to less adsorption site with smooth tea surface fermented jinjunmei tea and shuixian tea showed good adsorption of both thms and hams for dbps with higher boiling point the removal of dbps mainly from adsorption for dbps with low boiling point both volatilization and adsorption were main contributors additionally the dbps removal caused by dissolved matters from tea leaves can be ignored tea leaf dose slightly affected the removal percentage of dbps the higher the initial dbp concentration the higher the removal rate however the increase of initial concentration lead to the decrease of overall removal percentage under the condition of this experiment a preliminary estimation mathematical model was established to predict the change of dbp concentration during tea brewing with known initial dbp concentration and tea leaf dose on the top of that boiled water which does not contain disinfectant is recommended for tea leaf brewing to avoid the reaction between chlorine and tea not only does tea taste good it can also reduce health risks associated with dbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
