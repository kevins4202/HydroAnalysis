12125,we present an evidence based approach to identify how best to support development of groundwater for small scale irrigation in sub saharan africa ssa we argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources we demonstrate and test this proposal at a case study site dangila woreda in the north western highlands of ethiopia this site was selected to allow exploration of a shallow weathered volcanic regolith type aquifer formation which is found to the south of lake tana and also exists more extensively across ethiopia we believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small scale irrigated agriculture in ssa in comparison with other global regions the groundwater resources of ssa are among the least understood borehole records and hydrogeological studies are lacking assessments of groundwater resources do exist but they rely on remotely sensed data combined with modelling at national or regional scale and they focus on deeper aquifers there is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments the case study here presents such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats associated with developing small scale irrigation utilising shallow groundwater a multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community based monitoring field investigation and existing published data water table recovery tests at existing hand dug wells confirm that well yields of 1 l s are achievable at the end of the wet season when water would be available to support an additional irrigated crop hydraulic conductivity estimates ranged from 0 2 to 6 4 m d in the dry season and from 2 8 to 22 3 m day in the wet season specific yield estimations have a wider range though the mean value of 0 09 is as would be expected records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period april 2014 to april 2018 show that all the wells maintained useable water levels beyond the end of the rainy season an assessment of the hydrology of the kilti catchment provided insights into groundwater availability within the wider area the catchment receives about 1600 mm year of rainfall of which about 350 mm year enters the groundwater as recharge discharging to the river as baseflow with a similar amount of rapid runoff contributing to a total river flow of about 400 mm year the lowest value of baseflow is 82 of the mean baseflow which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year we conclude that arguments previously put forward against the promotion of shallow groundwater use for agriculture in ssa appear exaggerated our analysis challenges the view that shallow aquifers are unproductive and that irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater dependent ecosystems we believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small scale irrigated agriculture in sub saharan africa it appears that factors other than the physical availability of groundwater control the triggering of development interventions to promote development of groundwater resources should recognise the importance of shallow aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater irrigation participatory approach swot analysis ethiopia 1 introduction 1 1 context there is abundant groundwater in africa more than 100 times the annual renewable freshwater resource and 20 times the amount of freshwater stored in lakes macdonald et al 2012 but its productive use for irrigation in sub saharan africa ssa remains low examining the evidence on use of groundwater for irrigation in ssa pavelic et al 2013 argued for action to unlock its potential for improving livelihoods of smallholder farmers however there is a clear tendency for the discourse on groundwater development in ssa to focus on deep aquifers with high well yields korzenevica 2019 van koppen and schreiner 2018 in contrast we examine here the opportunities and constraints to promote use of shallow groundwater for small scale irrigation in ssa drawing upon evidence from ethiopia to demonstrate the case for action the literature on groundwater in ssa considers shallow groundwater as any aquifer up to 50 m or 60 m depth pavelic et al 2012a whereas much of the existing small scale irrigation depends on a water table depth less than 5 m because of power limits on water lifting see supplementary material and also because of available technology for well construction we adopt a working definition of shallow groundwater as 25 m depth historically groundwater exploitation has not been seen as an important component of water resources development in ssa braune and xu 2010 for most countries in ssa groundwater use represents 5 of national sustainable yield cobbing and hiller 2019 its contribution to rural water supply is recognised but groundwater has been seen more as a local resource which supports domestic demand rather than as a strategic resource which can support productive use and economic development arguments historically put forward against the promotion of groundwater use for agriculture in ssa include that aquifers are said to be low in transmissivity and that well yields are inadequate to support agricultural development at scales larger than garden irrigation wright 1992 chilton and foster 1995 macdonald et al 2012 it has also been argued that groundwater use for irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater dependent ecosystems and on domestic supplies adams 1993 giordano and villholth 2007 macdonald et al 2009 these concerns represent perceived barriers to triggering a groundwater development revolution that will unlock ssa s potential cobbing and hiller 2019 a review of the project portfolios of the world bank and african development bank cobbing and hiller 2019 reveals the neglect of groundwater investment however the agenda has shifted and groundwater irrigation gwi by smallholder farmers is increasingly being recognised by governments donors and ngos abric et al 2011 caadp 2009 chokkakula and giordano 2013 gwi is now seen as an important vehicle to promote poverty alleviation food security rural employment market oriented agriculture and climate change adaptation ngigi 2009 cobbing and hiller 2019 groundwater resources are ideally suited to development of distributed irrigation systems burney et al 2013 in which farmers enjoy far greater autonomy and flexibility of water supply than is possible through canal systems survey evidence shows that smallholder farmers prefer gwi abric et al 2011 giordano et al 2012 villholth 2013 the global area equipped for irrigation has been estimated siebert et al 2010 as 301 mha of which 38 depends on groundwater in ssa the extent of gwi is much less with only 6 of the irrigated area reported by siebert et al 2010 and 10 by giordano 2006 to be supported by groundwater however a note of caution is necessary when considering official statistics because of problems of definition and invisibility of so called informal irrigation giordano 2006 frenken 2005 using evidence from various countries in ssa villholth 2013 revised this estimate to 20 of the total irrigated area notable examples of public sector initiatives exist such as in the fadama development programme in nigeria abric et al 2011 but it is important to recognise the dominance of the informal sector which is characterised by autonomous farmer initiatives based upon the exploitation of shallow groundwater resources such initiatives receive little official recognition and support chokkakula and giordano 2013 and there is an urgent need to develop capacity for the state to function in a dual role as facilitator and regulator of gwi we argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources since it is shallow aquifers that are most likely to be accessible to poorer rural communities in ssa 1 2 shallow groundwater the opportunity in the past few decades in asia a paradigm shift has occurred in irrigation practice such that distributed irrigation using privately owned wells and small motorised pumps has expanded rapidly this development has enabled smallholder farmers to diversify their farming systems and grow high value crops for the market there is growing but patchy evidence that a similar irrigation revolution is happening in ssa de fraiture and giordano 2014 dessalegn and merrey 2015 cobbing and hiller 2019 irrigation does not currently play a major role in african agriculture the area equipped for irrigation as a percentage of total cultivated land is 19 4 globally but only 3 3 for ssa siebert et al 2010 where agriculture remains almost entirely rainfed you et al 2010 there have been many assessments of the irrigation potential eg frenken 2005 and ambitious plans for its expansion such as commission for africa 2005 which proposed doubling the area under irrigation in reviewing the investment needs on behalf of the world bank you et al 2010 examined biophysical and socio economic factors affecting large and small scale irrigation development they found that small scale irrigation offered far greater potential than large scale development offering five times the expansion potential and double the estimated rate of economic return gwi can make an important contribution to irrigation expansion in ssa provided that the focus is on technology that is appropriate for small scale farmers a focus on shallow groundwater offers this advantage in that technologies for well construction and for water lifting are accessible to these farmers amjath babu et al 2016 1 3 shallow groundwater anticipated constraints shallow groundwater is accessible to small scale farmers with simple technologies for well construction and water lifting and offers the best opportunity to develop low cost gwi however it is important to consider constraints since shallow groundwater resources are likely to be vulnerable to over exploitation and climatic variability while the reported abundance of groundwater in ssa macdonald et al 2012 is encouraging renewability and accessibility issues need to be addressed edmunds 2012 villholth 2013 notes that sustainable development of groundwater use for irrigation is limited by replenishment rates extractability in some regions and as a provider of environmental services and argues that there is a need for understanding integrated groundwater and surface water systems at different scales broad scale assessments of groundwater resource potential at national or continental scales e g macdonald et al 2012 and at sub national scales e g awulachew et al 2010 provide an indication of the spatial extent and storage volume in aquifer formations but an assessment of the resource potential is critically dependent on understanding groundwater dynamics a recent review of groundwater conditions in 15 ssa countries concluded that information on aquifer characteristics groundwater recharge rates flow regimes quality controls and use is still rather patchy pavelic et al 2012b there is widespread use of shallow groundwater for domestic supply in most ssa countries and indigenous knowledge generally exists on the seasonal performance of wells during typical and drought years however this knowledge is localised qualitative and unrecorded in contrast there is increasing availability of relevant global remote sensing data including topography land cover soil moisture and climate products providing broad scale information that can be used to estimate resource availability broad scale quantitative mapping of groundwater potential for africa was revisited by altchenko and villholth 2015 who considered the potential for sustainable gwi based on renewable groundwater resources with 0 5 spatial resolution they adopted an approach based on conservative estimates of groundwater recharge and alternative scenarios for allocation of groundwater to satisfy environmental requirements they concluded that throughout most of the sahel and for the eastern tract of ssa from ethiopia to zimbabwe renewable groundwater is under exploited and in some countries is sufficient to irrigate all cropland any such assessment is subject to uncertainty and temporal variability of recharge estimates due to the fragmented and localised nature of shallow groundwater resources pavelic et al 2012a their potential may be limited by available storage to a greater extent than in the case of extensive deep aquifer formations as identified by dessalegn and merrey 2015 there is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments the case study presented here is an attempt to deliver such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats i e swot analysis and to argue that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small scale irrigated agriculture in sub saharan africa 2 study area the appropriate scale for the case study was considered to be a single administrative district known in ethiopia as a woreda as this allowed consideration of both technical and socio economic aspects of groundwater resource assessment and management in view of the priority given to agricultural transformation in the area and availability of hydrogeological data the tana basin was selected as a suitable site for the pilot study several woredas in the basin were considered on the basis of their accessibility the dominant farming system and their status within the agricultural growth strategy dangila woreda was selected as the case study site fig 1 dangila woreda is situated in the north western highlands with altitudes generally between 1850 m and 2350 m dangila town is situated along the addis ababa bahir dar road at a distance of 60 km south west of bahir dar part of dangila woreda drains north east towards gilgel abay river and lake tana the remaining area drains either west or south west towards beles river both of these are part of the abay blue nile tributary of the river nile the climate is sub tropical with annual rainfall around 1600 mm and the main rainy season known as kiremt occurring in june september the total population of dangila woreda is estimated at about 200 000 people in an area of about 800 km2 crop livestock mixed subsistence farming is the primary source of livelihood according to a recent survey belay and bewket 2013 approximately 14 of cropland is irrigated this compares with estimates for ethiopia as a whole of 1 8 by siebert et al 2010 and 2 5 by altchenko and villholth 2015 irrigation is mainly by means of shared gravity diversions from seasonal and perennial streams though there are some reports of water lifting there are many shallow up to 15 m dug wells throughout the woreda but they are used primarily for domestic supply with only small pockets of garden irrigation there are some deeper drilled wells fitted with hand pumps and some springs have been developed for community water supply ethiopia s hydrogeology is complex basement aquifers volcanic aquifers and mesozoic sediment aquifers are most extensive but these are generally poor aquifers and consequently quaternary alluvial and regolith aquifers are more important the geology is often highly varied and due to tectonic movement areas with very shallow groundwater can occur alongside rift areas with very deep groundwater kebede 2013 mapped the extent of alluvio lacustrine sediments in ethiopia covering around 25 of the total land area the alluvial deposits are of two types 1 extensive alluvial plains and 2 more localised strips of land and river beds along rivers and streams occurring in most places both in the highlands and in the lowlands existing mapping of shallow aquifers shows an extensive area of shallow regoliths to the south of lake tana the study site was selected to allow its exploration as a representative of the extensive shallow aquifer formations at the case study site the geology consists of predominantly quaternary basalt and trachyte above eocene oligocene basalts and trachyte the ages of these formations are taken from the 1 2 000 000 scale geological map of ethiopia tefera et al 1996 outcrops are visible in river beds and occasionally on steeper slopes and in a few man made excavations the basalts are variously massive fractured and vesicular with variations occurring over short distances above the solid geology lies weathered basalt regolith itself overlain by red soils nitisols the red soils become more lithic and clayey with depth grading into the regolith usually with no obvious boundary the regolith becomes greyer and stronger and has to be chiselled as it deepens though it is still quite friable the most friable regolith is the result of weathering of scoriaceous basalt the superficial materials underlying the floodplains are darker in colour with deep and wide desiccation cracks suggesting a high clay content vertisols though occasionally containing fluvial sands and gravels the depth to the top of the solid geology is highly variable wells are typically excavated until further excavation becomes impossible therefore the location of the rock head can be inferred from well depth the rivers have often incised to the level of the rock head where solid basalt forms the river bed with banks of only 1 3 m in height 3 assessment of the shallow groundwater resource 3 1 methodology 3 1 1 hydrogeological assessment hydrogeological assessments of the dangila case study site were conducted between october 2013 and february 2017 the pre existing geological map was reinterpreted on the basis of observation of surface features combined with sampling from dug wells and springs evaluation of the controlling factors for groundwater movement and storage and identification of geological structures faults lineaments joints and their role to control flow direction in relation to the direction of major and minor structures was evidenced by measurement or estimation of spring discharge estimation of dug well yield based on users information and measurement of some stream flows rivers were surveyed in order to accurately locate using gps perennial and seasonal reaches and water depth channel incision and bank width was measured while geology of the river banks and river bed was recorded transects were surveyed to validate assessments of land use and vegetation type using google earth imagery this was found to be satisfactory for the purpose of assigning land use and vegetation type categories well tests were conducted on seven selected dug wells in order to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity and specific yield tests were repeated in march dry season and october wet season of 2015 drawdown and recovery were analysed separately applying the moench 1985 and barker and herbert 1989 methods respectively details of the tests and analyses are presented in walker 2016 3 1 2 groundwater recharge assessment a multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community based hydrometeorological monitoring data field investigation data and existing published data the methods were applied at local scale in the case of water table fluctuation methods to catchment scale with water balance methods and up to regional scale with consideration of published national and continental scale recharge maps unsaturated zone methods were applied such as soil moisture balance in addition to saturated zone methods such as chloride mass balance methods that consider only surface water e g baseflow separation and methods considering all zones e g physically based modelling for further information see walker et al 2019 3 1 3 hydrometeorological assessment time series data were available from the national hydrometric network for the kilti river gauge at durbete fig 1 and for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration from a meteorological station near dangila town a 7 year period of daily data from january 1997 to december 2003 was chosen for which almost complete data were available the daily rainfall amounts were compared against data from the tropical rainfall monitoring mission trmm to determine if they are likely to be representative of the spatial average over the catchment area the river flow data were processed to identify baseflow using a standard flow separation method tallaksen and van lanen 2004 various other methods exist for flow separation but this provided a consistent approach to estimate the seasonal contribution from groundwater to the river flow during years with different meteorological conditions 3 1 4 community based mapping and monitoring following selection of the dangesheta kebele sub district as the focus site gender separated focus groups delivered a participatory mapping exercise of available local water resources and areas of land used for pastoral and crop agriculture followed by a broader discussion of existing understanding of the hydrological system current water use and constraints and aspirations for agricultural development subsequently a small sub group of the participants assisted in identifying appropriate sites on two of the main river systems for monitoring river levels as well as sites for monitoring rainfall and groundwater levels two standard river staff gauges were installed by the community a suitable site was identified for installation of a non recording manual rain gauge and 5 shallow hand dug wells were selected to be monitored using a dipmeter these activities were carried out by members of the community from whom observers were selected by the community to take daily readings a workshop was then held to demonstrate the equipment and its use to a mixed gender and age group audience the installations and training were carried out in february 2014 and daily monitoring has continued without interruption and is still continuing up to and beyond the time of writing this close engagement with the community has ensured that the equipment has been protected as there is a sense of ownership by the community data derived from the monitoring has been tested for its reliability walker et al 2016 and fed back to the community in order to ensure there is motivation for continued monitoring through demonstrating the usefulness of this level of quantitative understanding 3 2 results of resource assessment 3 2 1 hydrogeological assessments previous hydrogeological investigations kebede et al 2005 have focussed on deeper aquifers and reported well depths of 30 100 m here the focus is on the shallow aquifer water table depth is seen to be controlled by topography and regolith thickness with clear seasonal variations near the end of the dry season in march april within the floodplains where the solid geology is at a depth of 3 4 m the water table lies at around 2 5 3 5 m the water table can often be seen as a seepage face at this depth within river bank regolith sections however on the larger and steeper slopes where rock head is around 15 m deep the water table is at a depth of around 12 15 m despite the shallow aquifer being considered to be the weathered basalt regolith and alluvial materials above the solid geology it is possible that fractures within the solid geology are influential to the hydrogeological regime heterogeneities within the regolith such as the clay content and the fractured or vesicular nature of the pre weathered rock determine the productivity of a well though this is very difficult to estimate prior to excavation fissure flow in the immediately underlying basalt is not observed and is likely to be very restricted as any fractures are probably filled with weathered material with the same properties as the overlying materials hydraulic conductivity estimates obtained from well tests ranged from 0 2 to 6 4 m d in the dry season and from 2 8 to 22 3 m day in the wet season indicating that more transmissive layers occur higher in the aquifer that are intercepted when saturated thickness is greater walker 2016 specific yield estimations have a wider range and are more uncertain though the mean value of 0 09 is as would be expected walker 2018 a summary of the results is presented in table 1 they confirm that well yields of 1 l s are achievable at the end of the wet season when irrigation water would be required for an additional irrigated crop analysis presented as supplementary material shows that this target well yield is sufficient to irrigate a plot size of 1 ha if pumping is continuous at times of peak demand following field investigations and community workshops it became evident that topography has a significant influence on well locations and most likely also on well yields more so than the nature of the underlying parent geology lowland areas comprising expansive floodplains and low relief topography have greater yield though floodplains have reduced storage as the regolith aquifer is thin conversely higher ground such as near catchment boundaries has a thick regolith aquifer but drainage occurs soon into the dry season and measured yields are low the locations of the five wells and the rain gauge monitored by the dangesheta community are shown in fig 2 against the background of a google earth satellite image it is clearly evident that these wells follow the general pattern of being mostly close to the edge of the floodplains where they remain accessible for the whole year but are downslope from the higher ground which provides recharge 3 2 2 groundwater recharge assessment the multimethod recharge assessment resulted in a wide range of groundwater recharge estimates this can be explained by differences in what the calculated recharge actually represents for particular methods and the spatial and temporal scales that the method considers as discussed by walker et al 2019 the best estimate of annual recharge for dangila woreda is in the range 280 430 mm see walker et al 2019 water table fluctuation methods gave higher results confirming that monitoring wells situated at the base of hillslopes receive lateral as well as vertical recharge 3 2 3 community based mapping and monitoring records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period april 2014 to april 2018 are shown in fig 3 these show that only one of the wells mw1 dries out completely early in the dry season three of the wells mw2 mw3 and mw5 show similar behaviour draining exponentially through most of the dry season with small but non zero depths of water present throughout the season water depths in well mw4 remain high through most of the dry season before falling sharply in april may these data do however show that all the wells maintained useable water levels into at least the end of december and in some cases for considerably longer 3 2 4 hydrometeorological assessments an assessment of the hydrology of the kilti catchment fig 1 for the period 1997 2003 provides insights into groundwater availability within the wider catchment area rainfall data for this period was compared with a longer record 1993 2014 of monthly rainfall in order to allow an assessment of whether it reflected a sufficiently wide range of conditions it was found that 1999 2000 and 1997 represent wet years 96 86 and 73 probability of non exceedance respectively while 2002 and 2003 represent dry years 9 and 14 probability of non exceedance respectively and 1998 represents an average year 40 probability of non exceedance the data for 1997 2003 therefore provide an adequate representation of longer term variability annual water balance components for the kilti catchment are summarised in table 2 and shown in fig 4 the catchment receives about 1600 mm year of rainfall of which about 350 mm year enters the groundwater as recharge discharge to the river as baseflow about 200 mm year is less than actual recharge this indicates that losses occur from the groundwater reservoir following recharge these losses can be explained walker et al 2019 as a combination of evapotranspiration from the saturated zone which would be expected given the very shallow wet season water table and seepage into the deeper aquifer it can be seen that the wettest year rainfall 1960 mm yields 12 8 baseflow whereas the driest year rainfall 1350 mm yields 15 8 baseflow the lowest value of baseflow is 82 of the mean baseflow which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year mean monthly water balance components for the period 1997 2003 are summarised in table 3 and shown in fig 5 storage change is negative during the dry season and positive during the wet season it should be noted that apparently high negative changes in storage are attributable to the use of potential evapotranspiration rather than actual evapotranspiration it is possible that the rainfall totals from dangila underestimate rainfall totals in the higher ground for which we have no data the shape of the annual kilti hydrograph follows that of the annual precipitation cycle it can be seen that baseflow does not begin to recover until june thus indicating that groundwater recharge during belg season early small wet season is minimal however there is evidence of baseflow persistence beyond the cessation of kiremt season main wet season mean baseflows for 1997 2003 at the end of the months of september to december are estimated as 8 8 5 3 2 1 and 0 93 m3 s respectively following an exponential decline indicative of natural drainage of groundwater within the catchment during the driest year of 2002 with rainfall probability of non exceedence of only 9 based on the long term data the baseflow at the end of december remained at 0 52 m3 s representing 43 of the mean value for that date indicating that groundwater remains available at this time even during dry years 4 discussion 4 1 insights gained from the case study there is an expanding literature on smallholder groundwater irrigation in ssa giordano 2006 giordano and villholth 2007 siebert et al 2010 pavelic et al 2013 villholth 2013 altchenko and villholth 2015 previous studies have estimated the extent of groundwater irrigation potential across ssa and most recently altchenko and villholth 2015 identified the scope for developing small scale gwi they concluded that the semi arid sahel and east africa regions offer appreciable potential in ethiopia their estimate of sustainable gwi potential based on renewable groundwater was in the range 1 8 106 to 4 3 106 ha depending on provision for environmental requirements the focus has generally been on assessing potential at country level and there is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments the case study presented here for dangila woreda in ethiopia is an attempt to deliver such an assessment in order to support a wider analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats i e swot analysis as with the study of fogera woreda presented by dessalegn and merrey 2015 useful insights into the wider issues are revealed by the localised case study approach this detailed case study has explored the feasibility of exploiting shallow groundwater for small scale irrigation over a range of rainfall conditions we have shown that variability of rainfall 9 96 probability of non exceedance does not translate into equivalent variability in groundwater levels and baseflow recharge quantities are high enough to create a productive shallow groundwater resource capable of supporting small scale irrigation groundwater levels observed in most shallow wells persist into the dry season to at least the end of december and generally into february indicating that water is potentially available for irrigation use during the period after the cessation of the wet season typically mid october catchment baseflows also persist to at least the end of december even during dry years indicating that groundwater is available more widely across the catchment during this period well tests indicate that shallow wells 25 m can support abstraction rates of 3 6 m3 hr which are sufficient to support small scale irrigation see supplementary material at the end of the kiremt wet season from october to december a single well can support irrigated cropping on a plot up to 1 ha using technology for well construction and water lifting that is accessible to small scale farmers in general it will be necessary to avoid the second part of the dry season when groundwater levels have generally declined through natural drainage and which may be required to support other environmental requirements a conservative approach to extrapolation which considers only the geology that characterises the shallow aquifer at the case study site ie weathered regolith above cenozoic volcanics provides an indication of the wider relevance of insights gained from this case study around 40 of ethiopia is underlain by cenozoic volcanic rocks prave et al 2016 and similar geology exists along the east african rift from eritrea to malawi and in unconnected areas such as western cameroon eastern nigeria and southwest sudan additional evidence comes from kebede 2013 who estimates that shallow unconsolidated aquifer types exist across 25 of ethiopia in addition ata 2019 estimated that active shallow aquifers in the tana beles and tarmaber maychew basins cover 27 080 km2 83 5 of total area and 9070 km2 69 8 of total area respectively the localised assessment reported here supports broad evaluations of groundwater potential for irrigation siebert et al 2010 altchenko and villholth 2015 however sustainability of small scale shallow groundwater based irrigation sgwi is determined by socioeconomic and institutional factors as well as technical considerations while the focus of this investigation has been on technical dimensions of sustainability sgwi like any other type of irrigation development should be seen as a socio technical problem dessalegn and merrey 2015 4 2 socioeconomic and institutional considerations some insight into the important role of non technical considerations is revealed through consideration of the literature on rural water supply rws where much of the effort in ssa has been devoted to developing shallow groundwater resources for hand pumped water points whaley and cleaver 2017 argue that the drive to develop rural water supplies under the impetus of various international initiatives favoured a focus on achieving targets for coverage with considerations of sustainability taking second place the sustainability concern was transposed into a policy of promoting community based management cbm whereby a local level organisation was charged with the responsibility for delivering it in principle cbm creates a relationship between the water point and its users ie between the technology and its users the high failure rate of newly installed water points is evidence of poor performance of the cbm paradigm which has been explained by the concept of functionality as noted by whaley and cleaver 2017 it is not only the functionality of the physical infrastructure that it of concern but also the functionality of the community organisation charged with managing it the lesson for sgwi would appear to be that it is important to establish an effective arrangement for cbm but this can be problematic within the cbm model whether for rws or for sgwi the local organisation is responsible for operation and management of the technical infrastructure these roles involve activities such as devising rules for access and use enforcing these rules maintaining shared physical infrastructure collecting financial contributions for these works there is an obvious connection here also to the extensive literature on performance of farmer managed canal based irrigation veldwisch et al 2019 haileslassie et al 2016 senanayake et al 2015 whaley and cleaver 2017 as with other critiques of the cbm model identify concerns around i neglect of local institutions and power relations ii broader governance issues and iii the socio technical interface whaley et al 2019 based on a survey of 600 sites in ssa concluded that the evidence does not support the cbm paradigm for rws the scope of the investigation reported here did not permit a full exploration of these issues as they relate to sgwi but some insights can be identified firstly it should be recognised that the small scale sgwi technology under investigation differs from the rws hand pump technology and canal based irrigation in that sgwi technology is privately owned sgwi is an example of a distributed irrigation system burney et al 2013 in which users enjoy far greater autonomy than is possible through canal systems or public water points in this case cbm is limited to devising rules for access and use and enforcing these rules secondly the adoption of a participatory approach to resource mapping and monitoring citizen science at the case study site was seen as the entry point for developing a localised approach to resource governance alley et al 2016 note that groundwater governance is inadequate in most if not all countries and they attribute this in part to the invisibility of the resource transparency of groundwater information through effective monitoring is a key aspect of good governance as with all cbm for natural resource management cox et al 2010 the lessons for sgwi would appear to be that cbm must exist within a clear governance framework and that a citizen science approach is necessary to address the resource visibility challenge a different but equally informative perspective on the important role of non technical considerations is offered by cobbing and hiller 2019 who argue that these secondary factors appear to be the predominant barrier to triggering ssa s groundwater development revolution in other words the absence of the necessary enabling environment and predominance of limiting conditions is seen as the explanation for ssa lagging behind other global regions in developing its groundwater resources the discourse on semi anarchic unmanaged over abstraction that has followed the boom phase of groundwater development in south asia china and parts of usa has influenced attitudes towards investment in groundwater based development in ssa and added to the already considerable inertia cobbing and hiller 2019 challenge this thinking and conclude that there is a need to choose between the current situation in which little groundwater is being used and therefore it is not significantly contributing to economic development and future groundwater development where only partial control may be possible we can consider this challenge and evaluate the role of sgwi in the format of a swot analysis 4 3 swot analysis of sgwi previously published swot analyses for development of shallow groundwater resources focus on the issue of water quality and pollution eg kallioras et al 2010 here we propose an analysis derived from the case study which focuses on socio technical issues affecting use of the groundwater resource for small scale irrigation in ssa i strengths ie intrinsic characteristics that provide an advantage groundwater is available beyond the end of the rainy season allowing small scale farmers to extend their cropping season reliable access to sufficient groundwater for irrigation permits farmers to adopt market oriented horticultural crops access to shallow groundwater is achievable by individual farmers using available technology for well construction and water lifting sgwi is suited to autonomous development by individual farmers with requirement for collective action limited to resource management ii weaknesses ie intrinsic characteristics that represent disadvantages lack of data groundwater levels spring flow rainfall creates a problem for assessing resource potential and managing resource use lack of hydrogeological mapping for shallow aquifers in particular creates a problem for identifying suitable sites where sgwi can be developed successfully shallow aquifers are vulnerable to over exploitation and management by existing formal institutions is beyond their capability adoption of sgwi is restricted by energy constraint on water lifting technology see supplementary material iii opportunities ie extrinsic factors that could be exploited to advantage use of shallow groundwater resources can unlock potential for growth in irrigated agriculture provided that good market access exists sgwi represents an attractive agri technology innovation that is accessible to individual farmers provided that an appropriate enabling environment exists existing community based watershed management initiatives demonstrate successful participatory resource management and provide an entry point for developing sgwi solar power has become a mature and affordable technology option for groundwater pumping thus alleviating the energy constraint iv threats ie extrinsic factors that could represent disadvantages climate change and or land use change may impact adversely on groundwater recharge and reduce reliability of shallow groundwater resource competition from other water uses domestic supply abstraction from deep aquifers run of river irrigation may lead to disputes over resource allocation market failure may limit availability of appropriate water lifting technology unless action is taken to stimulate the market weak governance arrangements for groundwater resources may contribute to vulnerability unless functional community based institutions can be enabled the sgwi model for small scale irrigation development has discernible strengths in both technical and social dimensions combining swot features into a response matrix table 4 indicates a feasible way forward for developing sgwi for a range of scenarios likely to be encountered at any potential site scenario a represents the most favourable case where shallow groundwater is available at a site with good market access and capacity exists for effective community based resource management autonomous development of sgwi by individual farmers should be actively promoted and the required response is to target actions towards the enabling environment for sgwi this requires i alleviating the market failure in providing appropriate water lifting technology and ii adopting a groundwater governance framework that permits participatory resource management at local community scale other scenarios represent cases where intrinsic weaknesses or external threats are more evident in scenario b capacity for community management exists at a site with good market access but knowledge of the shallow groundwater resource is inadequate the required response is to promote a citizen science approach to data collection in order to gain better understanding of the opportunity in scenario c shallow groundwater is available but competition from other water uses domestic supply abstraction from deep aquifers run of river irrigation may lead to disputes over resource allocation this may represent a severe challenge for community based management requiring additional support to enable engagement with wider governance arrangements in scenario d the shallow groundwater resource does not allow sustainable exploitation and sgwi should not be promoted improved mapping of shallow aquifers is required to identify sites more likely to be suitable for development 5 conclusion shallow groundwater resources represent a neglected opportunity for sustainable intensification of small scale agriculture in ethiopia and the analysis presented here informs the debate about irrigation policy across ssa this case study approach adds detail to the existing broad scale assessments of groundwater resource potential at national and sub national scales a conservative approach to extrapolation which considers only the geology that characterises the shallow aquifer at the case study site provides an indication of the wider relevance of insights gained from this case study strengths are that shallow groundwater 25 m depth is accessible to small scale farmers and permits farmers to adopt market oriented horticultural crops sgwi allows development of distributed irrigation systems in which farmers enjoy far greater autonomy than is possible through canal systems sgwi can be developed quickly with minimal infrastructure investment provided that appropriate water lifting technology is made available to farmers see supplementary material weaknesses exist in that current information on shallow aquifers is inadequate but concerns over low aquifer transmissivity low well yields aquifer vulnerability and resource conflict appear to be exaggerated weak governance arrangements for groundwater resources contribute to vulnerability but the localised nature of shallow aquifers is ideally suited to an approach based around participatory resource management by local communities community based monitoring has been shown to be valuable in providing the data required for resource management walker et al 2016 there is widespread use of shallow groundwater for domestic supply in most ssa countries and indigenous knowledge generally exists on the seasonal performance of wells during typical and drought years this knowledge is localised qualitative and unrecorded but it provides an entry point for a participatory approach at the same time this citizen science approach can also provide an entry point for introducing devolved governance of the shallow groundwater resource experience of community based management of rws indicates the importance of socioeconomic and institutional factors in determining functionality the participatory citizen science approach as adopted for this case study delivers the information needed to overcome the problem of resource invisibility we propose an approach to developing irrigation from shallow groundwater in ssa with a focus on community led adaptive resource management this is based on four responses a bottom up approach with close engagement between local communities and professionals is necessary for development of shallow groundwater resources for small scale irrigation the opportunities for distributed irrigation using privately owned wells as previously occurred in asia requires attention to the enabling environment in particular provision of small motorised pumps an adaptive approach to integrated management of groundwater and surface water resources is necessary for long term sustainability and this requires a citizen science approach to hydrological monitoring at the local scale existing hydrogeological data for shallow aquifers should be used to target action for promoting bottom up community based initiatives there is a need for further action research at this scale in places like dangila woreda to develop capacity for the state to function in a dual role as facilitator and regulator of

12125,we present an evidence based approach to identify how best to support development of groundwater for small scale irrigation in sub saharan africa ssa we argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources we demonstrate and test this proposal at a case study site dangila woreda in the north western highlands of ethiopia this site was selected to allow exploration of a shallow weathered volcanic regolith type aquifer formation which is found to the south of lake tana and also exists more extensively across ethiopia we believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small scale irrigated agriculture in ssa in comparison with other global regions the groundwater resources of ssa are among the least understood borehole records and hydrogeological studies are lacking assessments of groundwater resources do exist but they rely on remotely sensed data combined with modelling at national or regional scale and they focus on deeper aquifers there is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments the case study here presents such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats associated with developing small scale irrigation utilising shallow groundwater a multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community based monitoring field investigation and existing published data water table recovery tests at existing hand dug wells confirm that well yields of 1 l s are achievable at the end of the wet season when water would be available to support an additional irrigated crop hydraulic conductivity estimates ranged from 0 2 to 6 4 m d in the dry season and from 2 8 to 22 3 m day in the wet season specific yield estimations have a wider range though the mean value of 0 09 is as would be expected records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period april 2014 to april 2018 show that all the wells maintained useable water levels beyond the end of the rainy season an assessment of the hydrology of the kilti catchment provided insights into groundwater availability within the wider area the catchment receives about 1600 mm year of rainfall of which about 350 mm year enters the groundwater as recharge discharging to the river as baseflow with a similar amount of rapid runoff contributing to a total river flow of about 400 mm year the lowest value of baseflow is 82 of the mean baseflow which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year we conclude that arguments previously put forward against the promotion of shallow groundwater use for agriculture in ssa appear exaggerated our analysis challenges the view that shallow aquifers are unproductive and that irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater dependent ecosystems we believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small scale irrigated agriculture in sub saharan africa it appears that factors other than the physical availability of groundwater control the triggering of development interventions to promote development of groundwater resources should recognise the importance of shallow aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater irrigation participatory approach swot analysis ethiopia 1 introduction 1 1 context there is abundant groundwater in africa more than 100 times the annual renewable freshwater resource and 20 times the amount of freshwater stored in lakes macdonald et al 2012 but its productive use for irrigation in sub saharan africa ssa remains low examining the evidence on use of groundwater for irrigation in ssa pavelic et al 2013 argued for action to unlock its potential for improving livelihoods of smallholder farmers however there is a clear tendency for the discourse on groundwater development in ssa to focus on deep aquifers with high well yields korzenevica 2019 van koppen and schreiner 2018 in contrast we examine here the opportunities and constraints to promote use of shallow groundwater for small scale irrigation in ssa drawing upon evidence from ethiopia to demonstrate the case for action the literature on groundwater in ssa considers shallow groundwater as any aquifer up to 50 m or 60 m depth pavelic et al 2012a whereas much of the existing small scale irrigation depends on a water table depth less than 5 m because of power limits on water lifting see supplementary material and also because of available technology for well construction we adopt a working definition of shallow groundwater as 25 m depth historically groundwater exploitation has not been seen as an important component of water resources development in ssa braune and xu 2010 for most countries in ssa groundwater use represents 5 of national sustainable yield cobbing and hiller 2019 its contribution to rural water supply is recognised but groundwater has been seen more as a local resource which supports domestic demand rather than as a strategic resource which can support productive use and economic development arguments historically put forward against the promotion of groundwater use for agriculture in ssa include that aquifers are said to be low in transmissivity and that well yields are inadequate to support agricultural development at scales larger than garden irrigation wright 1992 chilton and foster 1995 macdonald et al 2012 it has also been argued that groundwater use for irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater dependent ecosystems and on domestic supplies adams 1993 giordano and villholth 2007 macdonald et al 2009 these concerns represent perceived barriers to triggering a groundwater development revolution that will unlock ssa s potential cobbing and hiller 2019 a review of the project portfolios of the world bank and african development bank cobbing and hiller 2019 reveals the neglect of groundwater investment however the agenda has shifted and groundwater irrigation gwi by smallholder farmers is increasingly being recognised by governments donors and ngos abric et al 2011 caadp 2009 chokkakula and giordano 2013 gwi is now seen as an important vehicle to promote poverty alleviation food security rural employment market oriented agriculture and climate change adaptation ngigi 2009 cobbing and hiller 2019 groundwater resources are ideally suited to development of distributed irrigation systems burney et al 2013 in which farmers enjoy far greater autonomy and flexibility of water supply than is possible through canal systems survey evidence shows that smallholder farmers prefer gwi abric et al 2011 giordano et al 2012 villholth 2013 the global area equipped for irrigation has been estimated siebert et al 2010 as 301 mha of which 38 depends on groundwater in ssa the extent of gwi is much less with only 6 of the irrigated area reported by siebert et al 2010 and 10 by giordano 2006 to be supported by groundwater however a note of caution is necessary when considering official statistics because of problems of definition and invisibility of so called informal irrigation giordano 2006 frenken 2005 using evidence from various countries in ssa villholth 2013 revised this estimate to 20 of the total irrigated area notable examples of public sector initiatives exist such as in the fadama development programme in nigeria abric et al 2011 but it is important to recognise the dominance of the informal sector which is characterised by autonomous farmer initiatives based upon the exploitation of shallow groundwater resources such initiatives receive little official recognition and support chokkakula and giordano 2013 and there is an urgent need to develop capacity for the state to function in a dual role as facilitator and regulator of gwi we argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources since it is shallow aquifers that are most likely to be accessible to poorer rural communities in ssa 1 2 shallow groundwater the opportunity in the past few decades in asia a paradigm shift has occurred in irrigation practice such that distributed irrigation using privately owned wells and small motorised pumps has expanded rapidly this development has enabled smallholder farmers to diversify their farming systems and grow high value crops for the market there is growing but patchy evidence that a similar irrigation revolution is happening in ssa de fraiture and giordano 2014 dessalegn and merrey 2015 cobbing and hiller 2019 irrigation does not currently play a major role in african agriculture the area equipped for irrigation as a percentage of total cultivated land is 19 4 globally but only 3 3 for ssa siebert et al 2010 where agriculture remains almost entirely rainfed you et al 2010 there have been many assessments of the irrigation potential eg frenken 2005 and ambitious plans for its expansion such as commission for africa 2005 which proposed doubling the area under irrigation in reviewing the investment needs on behalf of the world bank you et al 2010 examined biophysical and socio economic factors affecting large and small scale irrigation development they found that small scale irrigation offered far greater potential than large scale development offering five times the expansion potential and double the estimated rate of economic return gwi can make an important contribution to irrigation expansion in ssa provided that the focus is on technology that is appropriate for small scale farmers a focus on shallow groundwater offers this advantage in that technologies for well construction and for water lifting are accessible to these farmers amjath babu et al 2016 1 3 shallow groundwater anticipated constraints shallow groundwater is accessible to small scale farmers with simple technologies for well construction and water lifting and offers the best opportunity to develop low cost gwi however it is important to consider constraints since shallow groundwater resources are likely to be vulnerable to over exploitation and climatic variability while the reported abundance of groundwater in ssa macdonald et al 2012 is encouraging renewability and accessibility issues need to be addressed edmunds 2012 villholth 2013 notes that sustainable development of groundwater use for irrigation is limited by replenishment rates extractability in some regions and as a provider of environmental services and argues that there is a need for understanding integrated groundwater and surface water systems at different scales broad scale assessments of groundwater resource potential at national or continental scales e g macdonald et al 2012 and at sub national scales e g awulachew et al 2010 provide an indication of the spatial extent and storage volume in aquifer formations but an assessment of the resource potential is critically dependent on understanding groundwater dynamics a recent review of groundwater conditions in 15 ssa countries concluded that information on aquifer characteristics groundwater recharge rates flow regimes quality controls and use is still rather patchy pavelic et al 2012b there is widespread use of shallow groundwater for domestic supply in most ssa countries and indigenous knowledge generally exists on the seasonal performance of wells during typical and drought years however this knowledge is localised qualitative and unrecorded in contrast there is increasing availability of relevant global remote sensing data including topography land cover soil moisture and climate products providing broad scale information that can be used to estimate resource availability broad scale quantitative mapping of groundwater potential for africa was revisited by altchenko and villholth 2015 who considered the potential for sustainable gwi based on renewable groundwater resources with 0 5 spatial resolution they adopted an approach based on conservative estimates of groundwater recharge and alternative scenarios for allocation of groundwater to satisfy environmental requirements they concluded that throughout most of the sahel and for the eastern tract of ssa from ethiopia to zimbabwe renewable groundwater is under exploited and in some countries is sufficient to irrigate all cropland any such assessment is subject to uncertainty and temporal variability of recharge estimates due to the fragmented and localised nature of shallow groundwater resources pavelic et al 2012a their potential may be limited by available storage to a greater extent than in the case of extensive deep aquifer formations as identified by dessalegn and merrey 2015 there is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments the case study presented here is an attempt to deliver such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats i e swot analysis and to argue that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small scale irrigated agriculture in sub saharan africa 2 study area the appropriate scale for the case study was considered to be a single administrative district known in ethiopia as a woreda as this allowed consideration of both technical and socio economic aspects of groundwater resource assessment and management in view of the priority given to agricultural transformation in the area and availability of hydrogeological data the tana basin was selected as a suitable site for the pilot study several woredas in the basin were considered on the basis of their accessibility the dominant farming system and their status within the agricultural growth strategy dangila woreda was selected as the case study site fig 1 dangila woreda is situated in the north western highlands with altitudes generally between 1850 m and 2350 m dangila town is situated along the addis ababa bahir dar road at a distance of 60 km south west of bahir dar part of dangila woreda drains north east towards gilgel abay river and lake tana the remaining area drains either west or south west towards beles river both of these are part of the abay blue nile tributary of the river nile the climate is sub tropical with annual rainfall around 1600 mm and the main rainy season known as kiremt occurring in june september the total population of dangila woreda is estimated at about 200 000 people in an area of about 800 km2 crop livestock mixed subsistence farming is the primary source of livelihood according to a recent survey belay and bewket 2013 approximately 14 of cropland is irrigated this compares with estimates for ethiopia as a whole of 1 8 by siebert et al 2010 and 2 5 by altchenko and villholth 2015 irrigation is mainly by means of shared gravity diversions from seasonal and perennial streams though there are some reports of water lifting there are many shallow up to 15 m dug wells throughout the woreda but they are used primarily for domestic supply with only small pockets of garden irrigation there are some deeper drilled wells fitted with hand pumps and some springs have been developed for community water supply ethiopia s hydrogeology is complex basement aquifers volcanic aquifers and mesozoic sediment aquifers are most extensive but these are generally poor aquifers and consequently quaternary alluvial and regolith aquifers are more important the geology is often highly varied and due to tectonic movement areas with very shallow groundwater can occur alongside rift areas with very deep groundwater kebede 2013 mapped the extent of alluvio lacustrine sediments in ethiopia covering around 25 of the total land area the alluvial deposits are of two types 1 extensive alluvial plains and 2 more localised strips of land and river beds along rivers and streams occurring in most places both in the highlands and in the lowlands existing mapping of shallow aquifers shows an extensive area of shallow regoliths to the south of lake tana the study site was selected to allow its exploration as a representative of the extensive shallow aquifer formations at the case study site the geology consists of predominantly quaternary basalt and trachyte above eocene oligocene basalts and trachyte the ages of these formations are taken from the 1 2 000 000 scale geological map of ethiopia tefera et al 1996 outcrops are visible in river beds and occasionally on steeper slopes and in a few man made excavations the basalts are variously massive fractured and vesicular with variations occurring over short distances above the solid geology lies weathered basalt regolith itself overlain by red soils nitisols the red soils become more lithic and clayey with depth grading into the regolith usually with no obvious boundary the regolith becomes greyer and stronger and has to be chiselled as it deepens though it is still quite friable the most friable regolith is the result of weathering of scoriaceous basalt the superficial materials underlying the floodplains are darker in colour with deep and wide desiccation cracks suggesting a high clay content vertisols though occasionally containing fluvial sands and gravels the depth to the top of the solid geology is highly variable wells are typically excavated until further excavation becomes impossible therefore the location of the rock head can be inferred from well depth the rivers have often incised to the level of the rock head where solid basalt forms the river bed with banks of only 1 3 m in height 3 assessment of the shallow groundwater resource 3 1 methodology 3 1 1 hydrogeological assessment hydrogeological assessments of the dangila case study site were conducted between october 2013 and february 2017 the pre existing geological map was reinterpreted on the basis of observation of surface features combined with sampling from dug wells and springs evaluation of the controlling factors for groundwater movement and storage and identification of geological structures faults lineaments joints and their role to control flow direction in relation to the direction of major and minor structures was evidenced by measurement or estimation of spring discharge estimation of dug well yield based on users information and measurement of some stream flows rivers were surveyed in order to accurately locate using gps perennial and seasonal reaches and water depth channel incision and bank width was measured while geology of the river banks and river bed was recorded transects were surveyed to validate assessments of land use and vegetation type using google earth imagery this was found to be satisfactory for the purpose of assigning land use and vegetation type categories well tests were conducted on seven selected dug wells in order to estimate aquifer hydraulic conductivity and specific yield tests were repeated in march dry season and october wet season of 2015 drawdown and recovery were analysed separately applying the moench 1985 and barker and herbert 1989 methods respectively details of the tests and analyses are presented in walker 2016 3 1 2 groundwater recharge assessment a multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community based hydrometeorological monitoring data field investigation data and existing published data the methods were applied at local scale in the case of water table fluctuation methods to catchment scale with water balance methods and up to regional scale with consideration of published national and continental scale recharge maps unsaturated zone methods were applied such as soil moisture balance in addition to saturated zone methods such as chloride mass balance methods that consider only surface water e g baseflow separation and methods considering all zones e g physically based modelling for further information see walker et al 2019 3 1 3 hydrometeorological assessment time series data were available from the national hydrometric network for the kilti river gauge at durbete fig 1 and for rainfall and potential evapotranspiration from a meteorological station near dangila town a 7 year period of daily data from january 1997 to december 2003 was chosen for which almost complete data were available the daily rainfall amounts were compared against data from the tropical rainfall monitoring mission trmm to determine if they are likely to be representative of the spatial average over the catchment area the river flow data were processed to identify baseflow using a standard flow separation method tallaksen and van lanen 2004 various other methods exist for flow separation but this provided a consistent approach to estimate the seasonal contribution from groundwater to the river flow during years with different meteorological conditions 3 1 4 community based mapping and monitoring following selection of the dangesheta kebele sub district as the focus site gender separated focus groups delivered a participatory mapping exercise of available local water resources and areas of land used for pastoral and crop agriculture followed by a broader discussion of existing understanding of the hydrological system current water use and constraints and aspirations for agricultural development subsequently a small sub group of the participants assisted in identifying appropriate sites on two of the main river systems for monitoring river levels as well as sites for monitoring rainfall and groundwater levels two standard river staff gauges were installed by the community a suitable site was identified for installation of a non recording manual rain gauge and 5 shallow hand dug wells were selected to be monitored using a dipmeter these activities were carried out by members of the community from whom observers were selected by the community to take daily readings a workshop was then held to demonstrate the equipment and its use to a mixed gender and age group audience the installations and training were carried out in february 2014 and daily monitoring has continued without interruption and is still continuing up to and beyond the time of writing this close engagement with the community has ensured that the equipment has been protected as there is a sense of ownership by the community data derived from the monitoring has been tested for its reliability walker et al 2016 and fed back to the community in order to ensure there is motivation for continued monitoring through demonstrating the usefulness of this level of quantitative understanding 3 2 results of resource assessment 3 2 1 hydrogeological assessments previous hydrogeological investigations kebede et al 2005 have focussed on deeper aquifers and reported well depths of 30 100 m here the focus is on the shallow aquifer water table depth is seen to be controlled by topography and regolith thickness with clear seasonal variations near the end of the dry season in march april within the floodplains where the solid geology is at a depth of 3 4 m the water table lies at around 2 5 3 5 m the water table can often be seen as a seepage face at this depth within river bank regolith sections however on the larger and steeper slopes where rock head is around 15 m deep the water table is at a depth of around 12 15 m despite the shallow aquifer being considered to be the weathered basalt regolith and alluvial materials above the solid geology it is possible that fractures within the solid geology are influential to the hydrogeological regime heterogeneities within the regolith such as the clay content and the fractured or vesicular nature of the pre weathered rock determine the productivity of a well though this is very difficult to estimate prior to excavation fissure flow in the immediately underlying basalt is not observed and is likely to be very restricted as any fractures are probably filled with weathered material with the same properties as the overlying materials hydraulic conductivity estimates obtained from well tests ranged from 0 2 to 6 4 m d in the dry season and from 2 8 to 22 3 m day in the wet season indicating that more transmissive layers occur higher in the aquifer that are intercepted when saturated thickness is greater walker 2016 specific yield estimations have a wider range and are more uncertain though the mean value of 0 09 is as would be expected walker 2018 a summary of the results is presented in table 1 they confirm that well yields of 1 l s are achievable at the end of the wet season when irrigation water would be required for an additional irrigated crop analysis presented as supplementary material shows that this target well yield is sufficient to irrigate a plot size of 1 ha if pumping is continuous at times of peak demand following field investigations and community workshops it became evident that topography has a significant influence on well locations and most likely also on well yields more so than the nature of the underlying parent geology lowland areas comprising expansive floodplains and low relief topography have greater yield though floodplains have reduced storage as the regolith aquifer is thin conversely higher ground such as near catchment boundaries has a thick regolith aquifer but drainage occurs soon into the dry season and measured yields are low the locations of the five wells and the rain gauge monitored by the dangesheta community are shown in fig 2 against the background of a google earth satellite image it is clearly evident that these wells follow the general pattern of being mostly close to the edge of the floodplains where they remain accessible for the whole year but are downslope from the higher ground which provides recharge 3 2 2 groundwater recharge assessment the multimethod recharge assessment resulted in a wide range of groundwater recharge estimates this can be explained by differences in what the calculated recharge actually represents for particular methods and the spatial and temporal scales that the method considers as discussed by walker et al 2019 the best estimate of annual recharge for dangila woreda is in the range 280 430 mm see walker et al 2019 water table fluctuation methods gave higher results confirming that monitoring wells situated at the base of hillslopes receive lateral as well as vertical recharge 3 2 3 community based mapping and monitoring records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period april 2014 to april 2018 are shown in fig 3 these show that only one of the wells mw1 dries out completely early in the dry season three of the wells mw2 mw3 and mw5 show similar behaviour draining exponentially through most of the dry season with small but non zero depths of water present throughout the season water depths in well mw4 remain high through most of the dry season before falling sharply in april may these data do however show that all the wells maintained useable water levels into at least the end of december and in some cases for considerably longer 3 2 4 hydrometeorological assessments an assessment of the hydrology of the kilti catchment fig 1 for the period 1997 2003 provides insights into groundwater availability within the wider catchment area rainfall data for this period was compared with a longer record 1993 2014 of monthly rainfall in order to allow an assessment of whether it reflected a sufficiently wide range of conditions it was found that 1999 2000 and 1997 represent wet years 96 86 and 73 probability of non exceedance respectively while 2002 and 2003 represent dry years 9 and 14 probability of non exceedance respectively and 1998 represents an average year 40 probability of non exceedance the data for 1997 2003 therefore provide an adequate representation of longer term variability annual water balance components for the kilti catchment are summarised in table 2 and shown in fig 4 the catchment receives about 1600 mm year of rainfall of which about 350 mm year enters the groundwater as recharge discharge to the river as baseflow about 200 mm year is less than actual recharge this indicates that losses occur from the groundwater reservoir following recharge these losses can be explained walker et al 2019 as a combination of evapotranspiration from the saturated zone which would be expected given the very shallow wet season water table and seepage into the deeper aquifer it can be seen that the wettest year rainfall 1960 mm yields 12 8 baseflow whereas the driest year rainfall 1350 mm yields 15 8 baseflow the lowest value of baseflow is 82 of the mean baseflow which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year mean monthly water balance components for the period 1997 2003 are summarised in table 3 and shown in fig 5 storage change is negative during the dry season and positive during the wet season it should be noted that apparently high negative changes in storage are attributable to the use of potential evapotranspiration rather than actual evapotranspiration it is possible that the rainfall totals from dangila underestimate rainfall totals in the higher ground for which we have no data the shape of the annual kilti hydrograph follows that of the annual precipitation cycle it can be seen that baseflow does not begin to recover until june thus indicating that groundwater recharge during belg season early small wet season is minimal however there is evidence of baseflow persistence beyond the cessation of kiremt season main wet season mean baseflows for 1997 2003 at the end of the months of september to december are estimated as 8 8 5 3 2 1 and 0 93 m3 s respectively following an exponential decline indicative of natural drainage of groundwater within the catchment during the driest year of 2002 with rainfall probability of non exceedence of only 9 based on the long term data the baseflow at the end of december remained at 0 52 m3 s representing 43 of the mean value for that date indicating that groundwater remains available at this time even during dry years 4 discussion 4 1 insights gained from the case study there is an expanding literature on smallholder groundwater irrigation in ssa giordano 2006 giordano and villholth 2007 siebert et al 2010 pavelic et al 2013 villholth 2013 altchenko and villholth 2015 previous studies have estimated the extent of groundwater irrigation potential across ssa and most recently altchenko and villholth 2015 identified the scope for developing small scale gwi they concluded that the semi arid sahel and east africa regions offer appreciable potential in ethiopia their estimate of sustainable gwi potential based on renewable groundwater was in the range 1 8 106 to 4 3 106 ha depending on provision for environmental requirements the focus has generally been on assessing potential at country level and there is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments the case study presented here for dangila woreda in ethiopia is an attempt to deliver such an assessment in order to support a wider analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats i e swot analysis as with the study of fogera woreda presented by dessalegn and merrey 2015 useful insights into the wider issues are revealed by the localised case study approach this detailed case study has explored the feasibility of exploiting shallow groundwater for small scale irrigation over a range of rainfall conditions we have shown that variability of rainfall 9 96 probability of non exceedance does not translate into equivalent variability in groundwater levels and baseflow recharge quantities are high enough to create a productive shallow groundwater resource capable of supporting small scale irrigation groundwater levels observed in most shallow wells persist into the dry season to at least the end of december and generally into february indicating that water is potentially available for irrigation use during the period after the cessation of the wet season typically mid october catchment baseflows also persist to at least the end of december even during dry years indicating that groundwater is available more widely across the catchment during this period well tests indicate that shallow wells 25 m can support abstraction rates of 3 6 m3 hr which are sufficient to support small scale irrigation see supplementary material at the end of the kiremt wet season from october to december a single well can support irrigated cropping on a plot up to 1 ha using technology for well construction and water lifting that is accessible to small scale farmers in general it will be necessary to avoid the second part of the dry season when groundwater levels have generally declined through natural drainage and which may be required to support other environmental requirements a conservative approach to extrapolation which considers only the geology that characterises the shallow aquifer at the case study site ie weathered regolith above cenozoic volcanics provides an indication of the wider relevance of insights gained from this case study around 40 of ethiopia is underlain by cenozoic volcanic rocks prave et al 2016 and similar geology exists along the east african rift from eritrea to malawi and in unconnected areas such as western cameroon eastern nigeria and southwest sudan additional evidence comes from kebede 2013 who estimates that shallow unconsolidated aquifer types exist across 25 of ethiopia in addition ata 2019 estimated that active shallow aquifers in the tana beles and tarmaber maychew basins cover 27 080 km2 83 5 of total area and 9070 km2 69 8 of total area respectively the localised assessment reported here supports broad evaluations of groundwater potential for irrigation siebert et al 2010 altchenko and villholth 2015 however sustainability of small scale shallow groundwater based irrigation sgwi is determined by socioeconomic and institutional factors as well as technical considerations while the focus of this investigation has been on technical dimensions of sustainability sgwi like any other type of irrigation development should be seen as a socio technical problem dessalegn and merrey 2015 4 2 socioeconomic and institutional considerations some insight into the important role of non technical considerations is revealed through consideration of the literature on rural water supply rws where much of the effort in ssa has been devoted to developing shallow groundwater resources for hand pumped water points whaley and cleaver 2017 argue that the drive to develop rural water supplies under the impetus of various international initiatives favoured a focus on achieving targets for coverage with considerations of sustainability taking second place the sustainability concern was transposed into a policy of promoting community based management cbm whereby a local level organisation was charged with the responsibility for delivering it in principle cbm creates a relationship between the water point and its users ie between the technology and its users the high failure rate of newly installed water points is evidence of poor performance of the cbm paradigm which has been explained by the concept of functionality as noted by whaley and cleaver 2017 it is not only the functionality of the physical infrastructure that it of concern but also the functionality of the community organisation charged with managing it the lesson for sgwi would appear to be that it is important to establish an effective arrangement for cbm but this can be problematic within the cbm model whether for rws or for sgwi the local organisation is responsible for operation and management of the technical infrastructure these roles involve activities such as devising rules for access and use enforcing these rules maintaining shared physical infrastructure collecting financial contributions for these works there is an obvious connection here also to the extensive literature on performance of farmer managed canal based irrigation veldwisch et al 2019 haileslassie et al 2016 senanayake et al 2015 whaley and cleaver 2017 as with other critiques of the cbm model identify concerns around i neglect of local institutions and power relations ii broader governance issues and iii the socio technical interface whaley et al 2019 based on a survey of 600 sites in ssa concluded that the evidence does not support the cbm paradigm for rws the scope of the investigation reported here did not permit a full exploration of these issues as they relate to sgwi but some insights can be identified firstly it should be recognised that the small scale sgwi technology under investigation differs from the rws hand pump technology and canal based irrigation in that sgwi technology is privately owned sgwi is an example of a distributed irrigation system burney et al 2013 in which users enjoy far greater autonomy than is possible through canal systems or public water points in this case cbm is limited to devising rules for access and use and enforcing these rules secondly the adoption of a participatory approach to resource mapping and monitoring citizen science at the case study site was seen as the entry point for developing a localised approach to resource governance alley et al 2016 note that groundwater governance is inadequate in most if not all countries and they attribute this in part to the invisibility of the resource transparency of groundwater information through effective monitoring is a key aspect of good governance as with all cbm for natural resource management cox et al 2010 the lessons for sgwi would appear to be that cbm must exist within a clear governance framework and that a citizen science approach is necessary to address the resource visibility challenge a different but equally informative perspective on the important role of non technical considerations is offered by cobbing and hiller 2019 who argue that these secondary factors appear to be the predominant barrier to triggering ssa s groundwater development revolution in other words the absence of the necessary enabling environment and predominance of limiting conditions is seen as the explanation for ssa lagging behind other global regions in developing its groundwater resources the discourse on semi anarchic unmanaged over abstraction that has followed the boom phase of groundwater development in south asia china and parts of usa has influenced attitudes towards investment in groundwater based development in ssa and added to the already considerable inertia cobbing and hiller 2019 challenge this thinking and conclude that there is a need to choose between the current situation in which little groundwater is being used and therefore it is not significantly contributing to economic development and future groundwater development where only partial control may be possible we can consider this challenge and evaluate the role of sgwi in the format of a swot analysis 4 3 swot analysis of sgwi previously published swot analyses for development of shallow groundwater resources focus on the issue of water quality and pollution eg kallioras et al 2010 here we propose an analysis derived from the case study which focuses on socio technical issues affecting use of the groundwater resource for small scale irrigation in ssa i strengths ie intrinsic characteristics that provide an advantage groundwater is available beyond the end of the rainy season allowing small scale farmers to extend their cropping season reliable access to sufficient groundwater for irrigation permits farmers to adopt market oriented horticultural crops access to shallow groundwater is achievable by individual farmers using available technology for well construction and water lifting sgwi is suited to autonomous development by individual farmers with requirement for collective action limited to resource management ii weaknesses ie intrinsic characteristics that represent disadvantages lack of data groundwater levels spring flow rainfall creates a problem for assessing resource potential and managing resource use lack of hydrogeological mapping for shallow aquifers in particular creates a problem for identifying suitable sites where sgwi can be developed successfully shallow aquifers are vulnerable to over exploitation and management by existing formal institutions is beyond their capability adoption of sgwi is restricted by energy constraint on water lifting technology see supplementary material iii opportunities ie extrinsic factors that could be exploited to advantage use of shallow groundwater resources can unlock potential for growth in irrigated agriculture provided that good market access exists sgwi represents an attractive agri technology innovation that is accessible to individual farmers provided that an appropriate enabling environment exists existing community based watershed management initiatives demonstrate successful participatory resource management and provide an entry point for developing sgwi solar power has become a mature and affordable technology option for groundwater pumping thus alleviating the energy constraint iv threats ie extrinsic factors that could represent disadvantages climate change and or land use change may impact adversely on groundwater recharge and reduce reliability of shallow groundwater resource competition from other water uses domestic supply abstraction from deep aquifers run of river irrigation may lead to disputes over resource allocation market failure may limit availability of appropriate water lifting technology unless action is taken to stimulate the market weak governance arrangements for groundwater resources may contribute to vulnerability unless functional community based institutions can be enabled the sgwi model for small scale irrigation development has discernible strengths in both technical and social dimensions combining swot features into a response matrix table 4 indicates a feasible way forward for developing sgwi for a range of scenarios likely to be encountered at any potential site scenario a represents the most favourable case where shallow groundwater is available at a site with good market access and capacity exists for effective community based resource management autonomous development of sgwi by individual farmers should be actively promoted and the required response is to target actions towards the enabling environment for sgwi this requires i alleviating the market failure in providing appropriate water lifting technology and ii adopting a groundwater governance framework that permits participatory resource management at local community scale other scenarios represent cases where intrinsic weaknesses or external threats are more evident in scenario b capacity for community management exists at a site with good market access but knowledge of the shallow groundwater resource is inadequate the required response is to promote a citizen science approach to data collection in order to gain better understanding of the opportunity in scenario c shallow groundwater is available but competition from other water uses domestic supply abstraction from deep aquifers run of river irrigation may lead to disputes over resource allocation this may represent a severe challenge for community based management requiring additional support to enable engagement with wider governance arrangements in scenario d the shallow groundwater resource does not allow sustainable exploitation and sgwi should not be promoted improved mapping of shallow aquifers is required to identify sites more likely to be suitable for development 5 conclusion shallow groundwater resources represent a neglected opportunity for sustainable intensification of small scale agriculture in ethiopia and the analysis presented here informs the debate about irrigation policy across ssa this case study approach adds detail to the existing broad scale assessments of groundwater resource potential at national and sub national scales a conservative approach to extrapolation which considers only the geology that characterises the shallow aquifer at the case study site provides an indication of the wider relevance of insights gained from this case study strengths are that shallow groundwater 25 m depth is accessible to small scale farmers and permits farmers to adopt market oriented horticultural crops sgwi allows development of distributed irrigation systems in which farmers enjoy far greater autonomy than is possible through canal systems sgwi can be developed quickly with minimal infrastructure investment provided that appropriate water lifting technology is made available to farmers see supplementary material weaknesses exist in that current information on shallow aquifers is inadequate but concerns over low aquifer transmissivity low well yields aquifer vulnerability and resource conflict appear to be exaggerated weak governance arrangements for groundwater resources contribute to vulnerability but the localised nature of shallow aquifers is ideally suited to an approach based around participatory resource management by local communities community based monitoring has been shown to be valuable in providing the data required for resource management walker et al 2016 there is widespread use of shallow groundwater for domestic supply in most ssa countries and indigenous knowledge generally exists on the seasonal performance of wells during typical and drought years this knowledge is localised qualitative and unrecorded but it provides an entry point for a participatory approach at the same time this citizen science approach can also provide an entry point for introducing devolved governance of the shallow groundwater resource experience of community based management of rws indicates the importance of socioeconomic and institutional factors in determining functionality the participatory citizen science approach as adopted for this case study delivers the information needed to overcome the problem of resource invisibility we propose an approach to developing irrigation from shallow groundwater in ssa with a focus on community led adaptive resource management this is based on four responses a bottom up approach with close engagement between local communities and professionals is necessary for development of shallow groundwater resources for small scale irrigation the opportunities for distributed irrigation using privately owned wells as previously occurred in asia requires attention to the enabling environment in particular provision of small motorised pumps an adaptive approach to integrated management of groundwater and surface water resources is necessary for long term sustainability and this requires a citizen science approach to hydrological monitoring at the local scale existing hydrogeological data for shallow aquifers should be used to target action for promoting bottom up community based initiatives there is a need for further action research at this scale in places like dangila woreda to develop capacity for the state to function in a dual role as facilitator and regulator of

12126,groundwater is the most abundant freshwater resource and it needs protection and sustainable management therefore knowing the groundwater level is important for many reasons for instance groundwater level monitoring provides essential data for decision makers to adopt policies in order to provide a plan for controlling discharge rate and contaminant sources in aquifers many regions have missing data in long term groundwater level observations that can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data the aim of this study is evaluating missing data in monitoring wells with statistical methods statistical analysis was conducted on the monitoring wells data in the kazeroun plain fars province iran the results were compared with traditional methods for filling the gaps for this purpose groundwater level in 39 monitoring wells were considered as variables with 6552 individual samples from 1995 to 2009 one well located in the middle of the plain was selected and its 15 years groundwater table data were recalculated based on traditional such as mean estimation approach and modern methods such as interpolation and multivariate analysis according to the results traditional methods showed a high level of inaccuracy and decreased data quality conversely modern methods solved the missing values problem with high possible accuracy minimal error and acceptable r square in particular multivariate analysis has been carried out using k means algorithm principal components analysis and regression analysis k mean analysis as a clustering procedure classified data in five clusters and then the regression analysis method was applied on data finally we present a simple formula that shows a numerical relationship between the selected monitoring wells in a cluster graphical abstract image 1 keywords monitoring well multivariate analysis k mean clustering regression missing data 1 introduction in arid and semiarid parts of the world groundwater resources are often the major sources of agricultural industrial and drinking water chezgi et al 2015 in iran according to food and agriculture organization fao the groundwater abstraction is 53 100 million cubic meters mcm annually that implies a national over exploitation of 3800 mcm in order to develop a sustainable groundwater management the national water resources law places emphasis on the monitoring topic and on basic data collection especially for groundwater resources since the lack of essential data limits the controlling measures fao 2009 indeed the monitoring topic in the hydrological cycle is being recently promoted by scientific community thanks to the creation of small scale niu et al 2014 petroselli and tauro 2017 and large scale settings robinson et al 2008 templeton et al 2014 for instance the international association of hydrological sciences iahs established the measurements and observations in the xxi century moxxi working group the group comprises a growing community of hydrologists that adopt a multidisciplinary perspective in tackling complex observations often use low cost equipment tauro et al 2018 regarding groundwater measurements from observation wells are the principal source of information on the hydrologic stresses acting on aquifers and indicate how these stresses affect ground water recharge storage and discharge taylor and alley 2001 many developing countries are suffering from short breaks and gaps in data recording system due to various reasons such as absence of the observer instrumental failure power failure or communication line breakdown in iran groundwater depletion is mainly linked to inefficient agriculture sector and due to overexploitation of aquifers 291 out of 609 aquifers are depleted and water withdrawal is not allowed anymore in such aquifers moridi 2017 in order to reduce the vulnerability of surface and groundwater resources improving the monitoring systems for water quantity and quality measurements is crucial although the monitoring well is a key tool to understand the groundwater level and how the water moves underground in many regions in iran there are not enough monitoring wells or the data are not collected regularly in order to handle the missing data statistical analysis can be a solution to deal with based on available information many researchers applied statistical methods on filling missing data in the fields of hydrology and hydrogeology multivariate analysis such as k means and factor analysis in groundwater were used in water quality investigations vivienne et al 2005 unmesh et al 2006 omoleomo et al 2008 cheng shin 2010 sandow 2010 vikaskumar et al 2007 factor analysis combined with kriging and information entropy theory was applied for mapping and evaluating the stability of groundwater quality variation in taiwan and also for predicting outflow rate based on available quantity and quality data from qanat in iran shyu et al 2011 asgharinia and kompanizare 2012 statistical methods were conducted to address trend and variation of groundwater level fluctuation in bangladesh zafor et al 2017 notwithstanding in iran according to our best knowledge most of investigators use filling methods without particular selection criteria for completing data series in different climatological and hydrological studies broadly speaking there are several statistical methods for groundwater trend analysis which vary from simple linear regression to more advanced parametric and non parametric methods helsel and hirsch 1992 mishra 1994 chen et al 2007 jahan et al 2010 multiple linear correlation and regression analysis were used for analyzing the groundwater table depths jasmin et al 2010 the artificial neural network ann method were used to predict the missing data and forecasting groundwater level dastorani et al 2009 dogan et al 2008 clustering piezometric wells and using time series models for forecasting groundwater level were used in iran mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 time series data are becoming one of the most likely to have missing values in it the method of estimating missing values can affect the result of the analysis or data mining process several methods have been introduced to solve missing data from conventional or traditional methods to more advanced or modern methods traditional methods are simple methods such as ignoring deleting mean or mode estimation methods but they are risky because they solve a problem creating another problem at the same time although they are simple to apply they are effective only for a low percentage of missing values indeed for a great percentage of missing values the quality of results will be effected by data quality modern methods such as interpolation maximum likehood fuzzy rough set and regression analysis come as a solution to give better result aydilek and arslan 2013 sitaram et al 2015 pratama et al 2016 the main purpose of this study is using and comparing the statistical methods for analyzing the groundwater table for a better planning and management of aquifer in the semi arid area this research is designed to investigate the capabilities of arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and multivariate analysis methods to fill the gaps of the monthly recorded groundwater levels data for a period of 15 years in 39 monitoring wells in kazeroun plain iran the statistical analysis is examined to recalculate groundwater levels data based on formula with exact coefficients for a monitoring well which is located in the center of the investigated case study and then the results are compared with observed data 2 materials and methods to carry out this research minitab software as a comprehensive set of statistics was used to analyze data minitab provides a simple effective way to input statistical data manipulate the data identify trends and patterns and then extrapolate answers to the problem at hand minitab 2019 karafilowska 2004 in this study minitab 16 was used specifically for regression analysis interpolation clustering and multivariate analysis the further explanation of the missing values handling techniques will be provided in the next section 2 1 study area the kazeroun plain covers an area of 136 km2 and is located in south west of iran with coordinates of 29 31 29 48 n and 51 32 51 48 e the plain is a syncline filled with sediments is surrounded by two parallel north south anticlines in two sides and leads to the parishan lake in the south fourth period of geological time alluvial sediments filled up the aquifer of the kazeroon plain with flat area in the central part that gradually extend into the rugged plain borders in the northern parts of the plain especially in aghajari formation the aquifer is coarse grained and has good storage capacity wells are drilled in this range having high quality water and good efficiency but in the south part such conditions do not exist the parishan lake is composed of very low permeability clay and silt sediments and therefore there is no possibility of feeding the aquifer by the lake fig 1 shows study area location with selected monitoring wells and the direction of groundwater flow in the aquifer according to previous studies zamin ara consulting engineers of fars 2011 and jahanbakhsh ganjeh et al 2017 the direction of groundwater flow follows the slope of the study area moreover in the present study mapping the groundwater table based on the latest available data 2009 confirmed the gravitational flow direction in the aquifer fig 1 in this research w21 was selected as representative to apply the arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and multivariate analysis methods for analyzing the groundwater level data in 15 years the required data for performing this study were digital elevation model dem groundwater table and rainfall data dem at 30m resolution was downloaded from aster gdem website https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp synchronized monthly rainfall data were retrieved thanks to iran meteorological organization and monthly groundwater table data for the kazeroun aquifer were retrieved thanks to iran water resources management company 2 2 arithmetic mean method arithmetic mean is the sum of a collection of values divided by the number of values in the collection langley and russell 1968 in iran this method usually employs as a classic approach for evaluating of missing data in this study the collection is the monthly records of groundwater level in monitoring well for 15 years the mean equation defined as 1 x x 1 x 2 x n n i 1 n x i n x n in this study the arithmetic average of a set of given monthly groundwater level data is calculated in every month for 15 years for w21 2 3 linear spline interpolation the linear spline interpolation erdogan 2017 as a spatial type of piecewise polynomial represents a set of line segments between the two adjacent data points the equations for each line segment can be immediately found in a simple form 2 f x f x 0 f x 1 f x 0 x 1 x 0 x x 0 x 0 x x 1 f x 1 f x 2 f x 1 x 2 x 1 x x 1 x 1 x x 2 f x n 1 f x n f x n 1 x n x n 1 x x n 1 x n 1 x x n in this section monitoring wells number 36 and 37 are selected to conduct the linear spline interpolation equation to estimate monthly groundwater level data for w21 selected wells are almost located in the same elevation of w21 and in a short distance as well 2 4 multivariate analysis k means and factor analysis the first step of multivariate analysis employed in this study is k means which is a multivariate classification method in which the objects can be classified based on their variables values vivienne et al 2005 in this method the procedure follows a simple way to classify a data base on finding k centroids for each clusters clustering is a process of partitioning a set of data or objects into a set of meaningful groups called clusters the more acceptable clusters are the ones where the variance between and inside clusters are maximized and minimized respectively in this study k mean analysis was conducted by minitab 16 through 6552 samples extracted between the monitoring wells in the kazeroun plain the variables are the 39 monitoring wells and the monthly groundwater level records are individual observations the object is looking for balance between clusters and also for an equal number of samples in each cluster the second step of multivariate analysis employed in this study is factor analysis sandow 2010 factor analysis is used to reduce the large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors the factor analysis in this study was conducted using minitab 16 software the effective factors and the relationship between the parameters were determined 2 5 regression analysis the relationship between some independent variables and the dependent variable can be determined by regression analysis in regression analysis the relation between each independent variable and the given dependent variable is determined by its corresponding coefficient and p value the independent variables must be orthogonal and there must be no relationship between the independent variables in order to determine the orthogonal variables the variables should be reduced to smaller number of variables that are orthogonal the orthogonal variables are the principal components or factors determined through principal component of factor analysis in this study the variables or the dimensional parameters reduced to five factors regards to w21 which was selected as representative the regression analysis was conducted on the monthly groundwater level data to find an equation for making a prediction on the monthly groundwater level data of w21 the performance of the regression analysis has been verified through selected performance evaluation criteria as explained below out of the several numerical model performance indicators the coefficient of determination r2 and p value have been selected 3 results and discussion 3 1 k means and factor analysis by the method of k means data were clustered to 5 clusters the best type of clustering occurs when the distance between groups is balanced or equal the member in the groups and distance between the centers of the groups are approximately the same according to table 1 using the trial and error method the data were categorized from 3 to 7 clusters the best condition is when 5 clusters are selected because the data is approximately the same in groups compared to others due to the merging rule that the distance between any two clusters is the euclidean distance between their centroids the distances between clusters centroids have been calculated and shown in table 2 fig 2 a c show the distribution of monitoring wells in the kazeroun plain in different clusters the dendrogram that illustrates the arrangement of the clusters in w1 to w39 and the table of the classification and clustering monitoring wells respectively the percentage of similarity of all clusters is more than 50 section a a fig 2a shows w26 w25 and w29 which located in clusters 3 1 and 5 respectively fig 3 a illustrates the scheme of groundwater table in w26 w25 and w29 along the cross section a a fig 3b shows the fluctuation of groundwater table in different years as well as rainfall data based on the graphs groundwater and rainfall are in a direct relationship different clusters in the one cross sectional sample revealed the groundwater table is related to many factors such as geographical geological and climatic characteristics in fact the main point of this part is emphasizing on the use of nearest neighbor for bridging the gaps not necessarily leads us to accurate estimate indeed multivariate analysis reflected the data differencing and improved missing value estimation after having categorized and grouped the monitoring wells by k means method clustering algorithm in the second step the factor analysis was employed to remove not important data and provide orthogonal and non dependent data in this study as a sample the monitoring well number 21 that is located in the middle of the plain is selected for predicting the groundwater table the data from w21 were hence removed and then the factor analysis was performed in order to understand if data for w21 can be predicted factor analysis is a technique that requires a large sample size factor analysis is based on the correlation matrix of the variables involved and correlations usually need a large sample size before they stabilize in this study the sample size was 6552 cases which is a value that is considered excellent tabachnick and fidell 2001 in order to perform the calculation factor 1 has a strongest effect with a variance value of 24 246 in addition in this factor w38 has the largest share the variance value of the second factor is 3 74 and the others have no significant effect fig 4 shows the scree and score plots of factor analysis the scree plot shows that the first two factors have the largest share and the score plot confirms it and shows the distribution of data in order to factor 1 and 2 3 2 regression analysis to perform regression orthogonal data are needed using non dependent data from factor analysis data for monitoring w21 were predicted the results of the conducted regression analysis on cluster 3 which included w21 are presented in fig 5 the regression has favorable adjusted r square of 92 9 the p value for the analysis of variance of the regression is acceptable and almost equal to zero fig 5 shows the good correlation of data with each other the data dispersion is normal and the distribution curve is almost bell shaped the linear regression equation for the selected monitoring well which was well number 21 in cluster 3 is as follow 3 w 21 29 3 0 111 w 11 0 0039 w 12 0 0465 w 13 0 217 w 14 0 0496 w 15 0 604 w 16 0 0888 w 17 0 0959 w 19 0 196 w 26 0 104 w 30 0 277 w 34 0 0436 w 35 0 002 w 36 0 382 w 37 0 045 w 38 3 3 comparing arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and regression analysis with the aim to understand high variability of groundwater and estimating the missing data in some monitoring wells the arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and regression analysis methods were applied to predict groundwater table data in comparison with real data in w21 and the results are presented in fig 6 average of all data were used in the arithmetic mean method whereas in spline linear interpolation method only w36 and w37 due to the similar geological and topographic conditions as respect to w21 were selected for calculation the regression analysis method based on data in cluster 3 which included w21 was performed for estimating w21 s data as well the horizontal axis of fig 6 shows date for 15 years and the vertical axis shows depth of groundwater measured in meters above sea level in monitoring well no 21 the results illustrate that groundwater levels increased at the end of wet season in april while at the end of dry season groundwater levels decreased due to over withdrawal for farmlands irrigation requirements in iran moreover results of the mentioned methods in fig 6 clarify that regression analysis is a more accurate forecasting method and fitted better to real w21 data in terms of comparing the results of these methods r2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficients were used to assess the predictive ability of statistical methods nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 and nse coefficients for arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and regression analysis methods were calculated 0 83 12 56 0 82 0 17 and 0 93 0 92 respectively fig 7 comparison of these three methods shows that the regression analysis method can evaluate missing data with high accuracy and also linear spline interpolation method compared with the arithmetic mean method that in iran is the method more widely used because of its simplicity offers an acceptable calculation 4 conclusion groundwater constitutes the largest available water resource for water supply and irrigation in semi arid regions in particular in iran and therefore the monitoring and management of groundwater resources is of great interest for decision makers confronting uncertainty and gaps in groundwater table data poses serious challenges in order to monitor and model the aquifer response in this research we tried to find a simple statistical method characterized by a high accuracy to fill the gaps related to groundwater level in monitoring wells the arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation methods and multivariate analysis have been carried out to predict the missing data in 39 monitoring wells in kazeroun plain iran cluster analysis was used to classify monitoring wells into 5 clusters according to the groundwater table then regression analysis on cluster 3 which is including w21 declared more accurate results and close fitting for field data according to the calculations and analysis presented in this paper multivariate analysis is one of the best ways that can help effectively to compute and evaluate data using the regression analysis method a formula is presented for predicting the groundwater table in one of the monitoring wells adjusted r square evaluated 92 9 for regression analysis that is acceptable and as a result the missing data were reconstructed with high reliability thanks to the formula regards to the wide range of statistical techniques examining different methods for handling missing data strongly recommended mostly in developing countries due to short breaks in hydrology and hydrogeology data finding appropriate missing data method will serve to the

12126,groundwater is the most abundant freshwater resource and it needs protection and sustainable management therefore knowing the groundwater level is important for many reasons for instance groundwater level monitoring provides essential data for decision makers to adopt policies in order to provide a plan for controlling discharge rate and contaminant sources in aquifers many regions have missing data in long term groundwater level observations that can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data the aim of this study is evaluating missing data in monitoring wells with statistical methods statistical analysis was conducted on the monitoring wells data in the kazeroun plain fars province iran the results were compared with traditional methods for filling the gaps for this purpose groundwater level in 39 monitoring wells were considered as variables with 6552 individual samples from 1995 to 2009 one well located in the middle of the plain was selected and its 15 years groundwater table data were recalculated based on traditional such as mean estimation approach and modern methods such as interpolation and multivariate analysis according to the results traditional methods showed a high level of inaccuracy and decreased data quality conversely modern methods solved the missing values problem with high possible accuracy minimal error and acceptable r square in particular multivariate analysis has been carried out using k means algorithm principal components analysis and regression analysis k mean analysis as a clustering procedure classified data in five clusters and then the regression analysis method was applied on data finally we present a simple formula that shows a numerical relationship between the selected monitoring wells in a cluster graphical abstract image 1 keywords monitoring well multivariate analysis k mean clustering regression missing data 1 introduction in arid and semiarid parts of the world groundwater resources are often the major sources of agricultural industrial and drinking water chezgi et al 2015 in iran according to food and agriculture organization fao the groundwater abstraction is 53 100 million cubic meters mcm annually that implies a national over exploitation of 3800 mcm in order to develop a sustainable groundwater management the national water resources law places emphasis on the monitoring topic and on basic data collection especially for groundwater resources since the lack of essential data limits the controlling measures fao 2009 indeed the monitoring topic in the hydrological cycle is being recently promoted by scientific community thanks to the creation of small scale niu et al 2014 petroselli and tauro 2017 and large scale settings robinson et al 2008 templeton et al 2014 for instance the international association of hydrological sciences iahs established the measurements and observations in the xxi century moxxi working group the group comprises a growing community of hydrologists that adopt a multidisciplinary perspective in tackling complex observations often use low cost equipment tauro et al 2018 regarding groundwater measurements from observation wells are the principal source of information on the hydrologic stresses acting on aquifers and indicate how these stresses affect ground water recharge storage and discharge taylor and alley 2001 many developing countries are suffering from short breaks and gaps in data recording system due to various reasons such as absence of the observer instrumental failure power failure or communication line breakdown in iran groundwater depletion is mainly linked to inefficient agriculture sector and due to overexploitation of aquifers 291 out of 609 aquifers are depleted and water withdrawal is not allowed anymore in such aquifers moridi 2017 in order to reduce the vulnerability of surface and groundwater resources improving the monitoring systems for water quantity and quality measurements is crucial although the monitoring well is a key tool to understand the groundwater level and how the water moves underground in many regions in iran there are not enough monitoring wells or the data are not collected regularly in order to handle the missing data statistical analysis can be a solution to deal with based on available information many researchers applied statistical methods on filling missing data in the fields of hydrology and hydrogeology multivariate analysis such as k means and factor analysis in groundwater were used in water quality investigations vivienne et al 2005 unmesh et al 2006 omoleomo et al 2008 cheng shin 2010 sandow 2010 vikaskumar et al 2007 factor analysis combined with kriging and information entropy theory was applied for mapping and evaluating the stability of groundwater quality variation in taiwan and also for predicting outflow rate based on available quantity and quality data from qanat in iran shyu et al 2011 asgharinia and kompanizare 2012 statistical methods were conducted to address trend and variation of groundwater level fluctuation in bangladesh zafor et al 2017 notwithstanding in iran according to our best knowledge most of investigators use filling methods without particular selection criteria for completing data series in different climatological and hydrological studies broadly speaking there are several statistical methods for groundwater trend analysis which vary from simple linear regression to more advanced parametric and non parametric methods helsel and hirsch 1992 mishra 1994 chen et al 2007 jahan et al 2010 multiple linear correlation and regression analysis were used for analyzing the groundwater table depths jasmin et al 2010 the artificial neural network ann method were used to predict the missing data and forecasting groundwater level dastorani et al 2009 dogan et al 2008 clustering piezometric wells and using time series models for forecasting groundwater level were used in iran mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 time series data are becoming one of the most likely to have missing values in it the method of estimating missing values can affect the result of the analysis or data mining process several methods have been introduced to solve missing data from conventional or traditional methods to more advanced or modern methods traditional methods are simple methods such as ignoring deleting mean or mode estimation methods but they are risky because they solve a problem creating another problem at the same time although they are simple to apply they are effective only for a low percentage of missing values indeed for a great percentage of missing values the quality of results will be effected by data quality modern methods such as interpolation maximum likehood fuzzy rough set and regression analysis come as a solution to give better result aydilek and arslan 2013 sitaram et al 2015 pratama et al 2016 the main purpose of this study is using and comparing the statistical methods for analyzing the groundwater table for a better planning and management of aquifer in the semi arid area this research is designed to investigate the capabilities of arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and multivariate analysis methods to fill the gaps of the monthly recorded groundwater levels data for a period of 15 years in 39 monitoring wells in kazeroun plain iran the statistical analysis is examined to recalculate groundwater levels data based on formula with exact coefficients for a monitoring well which is located in the center of the investigated case study and then the results are compared with observed data 2 materials and methods to carry out this research minitab software as a comprehensive set of statistics was used to analyze data minitab provides a simple effective way to input statistical data manipulate the data identify trends and patterns and then extrapolate answers to the problem at hand minitab 2019 karafilowska 2004 in this study minitab 16 was used specifically for regression analysis interpolation clustering and multivariate analysis the further explanation of the missing values handling techniques will be provided in the next section 2 1 study area the kazeroun plain covers an area of 136 km2 and is located in south west of iran with coordinates of 29 31 29 48 n and 51 32 51 48 e the plain is a syncline filled with sediments is surrounded by two parallel north south anticlines in two sides and leads to the parishan lake in the south fourth period of geological time alluvial sediments filled up the aquifer of the kazeroon plain with flat area in the central part that gradually extend into the rugged plain borders in the northern parts of the plain especially in aghajari formation the aquifer is coarse grained and has good storage capacity wells are drilled in this range having high quality water and good efficiency but in the south part such conditions do not exist the parishan lake is composed of very low permeability clay and silt sediments and therefore there is no possibility of feeding the aquifer by the lake fig 1 shows study area location with selected monitoring wells and the direction of groundwater flow in the aquifer according to previous studies zamin ara consulting engineers of fars 2011 and jahanbakhsh ganjeh et al 2017 the direction of groundwater flow follows the slope of the study area moreover in the present study mapping the groundwater table based on the latest available data 2009 confirmed the gravitational flow direction in the aquifer fig 1 in this research w21 was selected as representative to apply the arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and multivariate analysis methods for analyzing the groundwater level data in 15 years the required data for performing this study were digital elevation model dem groundwater table and rainfall data dem at 30m resolution was downloaded from aster gdem website https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp synchronized monthly rainfall data were retrieved thanks to iran meteorological organization and monthly groundwater table data for the kazeroun aquifer were retrieved thanks to iran water resources management company 2 2 arithmetic mean method arithmetic mean is the sum of a collection of values divided by the number of values in the collection langley and russell 1968 in iran this method usually employs as a classic approach for evaluating of missing data in this study the collection is the monthly records of groundwater level in monitoring well for 15 years the mean equation defined as 1 x x 1 x 2 x n n i 1 n x i n x n in this study the arithmetic average of a set of given monthly groundwater level data is calculated in every month for 15 years for w21 2 3 linear spline interpolation the linear spline interpolation erdogan 2017 as a spatial type of piecewise polynomial represents a set of line segments between the two adjacent data points the equations for each line segment can be immediately found in a simple form 2 f x f x 0 f x 1 f x 0 x 1 x 0 x x 0 x 0 x x 1 f x 1 f x 2 f x 1 x 2 x 1 x x 1 x 1 x x 2 f x n 1 f x n f x n 1 x n x n 1 x x n 1 x n 1 x x n in this section monitoring wells number 36 and 37 are selected to conduct the linear spline interpolation equation to estimate monthly groundwater level data for w21 selected wells are almost located in the same elevation of w21 and in a short distance as well 2 4 multivariate analysis k means and factor analysis the first step of multivariate analysis employed in this study is k means which is a multivariate classification method in which the objects can be classified based on their variables values vivienne et al 2005 in this method the procedure follows a simple way to classify a data base on finding k centroids for each clusters clustering is a process of partitioning a set of data or objects into a set of meaningful groups called clusters the more acceptable clusters are the ones where the variance between and inside clusters are maximized and minimized respectively in this study k mean analysis was conducted by minitab 16 through 6552 samples extracted between the monitoring wells in the kazeroun plain the variables are the 39 monitoring wells and the monthly groundwater level records are individual observations the object is looking for balance between clusters and also for an equal number of samples in each cluster the second step of multivariate analysis employed in this study is factor analysis sandow 2010 factor analysis is used to reduce the large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors the factor analysis in this study was conducted using minitab 16 software the effective factors and the relationship between the parameters were determined 2 5 regression analysis the relationship between some independent variables and the dependent variable can be determined by regression analysis in regression analysis the relation between each independent variable and the given dependent variable is determined by its corresponding coefficient and p value the independent variables must be orthogonal and there must be no relationship between the independent variables in order to determine the orthogonal variables the variables should be reduced to smaller number of variables that are orthogonal the orthogonal variables are the principal components or factors determined through principal component of factor analysis in this study the variables or the dimensional parameters reduced to five factors regards to w21 which was selected as representative the regression analysis was conducted on the monthly groundwater level data to find an equation for making a prediction on the monthly groundwater level data of w21 the performance of the regression analysis has been verified through selected performance evaluation criteria as explained below out of the several numerical model performance indicators the coefficient of determination r2 and p value have been selected 3 results and discussion 3 1 k means and factor analysis by the method of k means data were clustered to 5 clusters the best type of clustering occurs when the distance between groups is balanced or equal the member in the groups and distance between the centers of the groups are approximately the same according to table 1 using the trial and error method the data were categorized from 3 to 7 clusters the best condition is when 5 clusters are selected because the data is approximately the same in groups compared to others due to the merging rule that the distance between any two clusters is the euclidean distance between their centroids the distances between clusters centroids have been calculated and shown in table 2 fig 2 a c show the distribution of monitoring wells in the kazeroun plain in different clusters the dendrogram that illustrates the arrangement of the clusters in w1 to w39 and the table of the classification and clustering monitoring wells respectively the percentage of similarity of all clusters is more than 50 section a a fig 2a shows w26 w25 and w29 which located in clusters 3 1 and 5 respectively fig 3 a illustrates the scheme of groundwater table in w26 w25 and w29 along the cross section a a fig 3b shows the fluctuation of groundwater table in different years as well as rainfall data based on the graphs groundwater and rainfall are in a direct relationship different clusters in the one cross sectional sample revealed the groundwater table is related to many factors such as geographical geological and climatic characteristics in fact the main point of this part is emphasizing on the use of nearest neighbor for bridging the gaps not necessarily leads us to accurate estimate indeed multivariate analysis reflected the data differencing and improved missing value estimation after having categorized and grouped the monitoring wells by k means method clustering algorithm in the second step the factor analysis was employed to remove not important data and provide orthogonal and non dependent data in this study as a sample the monitoring well number 21 that is located in the middle of the plain is selected for predicting the groundwater table the data from w21 were hence removed and then the factor analysis was performed in order to understand if data for w21 can be predicted factor analysis is a technique that requires a large sample size factor analysis is based on the correlation matrix of the variables involved and correlations usually need a large sample size before they stabilize in this study the sample size was 6552 cases which is a value that is considered excellent tabachnick and fidell 2001 in order to perform the calculation factor 1 has a strongest effect with a variance value of 24 246 in addition in this factor w38 has the largest share the variance value of the second factor is 3 74 and the others have no significant effect fig 4 shows the scree and score plots of factor analysis the scree plot shows that the first two factors have the largest share and the score plot confirms it and shows the distribution of data in order to factor 1 and 2 3 2 regression analysis to perform regression orthogonal data are needed using non dependent data from factor analysis data for monitoring w21 were predicted the results of the conducted regression analysis on cluster 3 which included w21 are presented in fig 5 the regression has favorable adjusted r square of 92 9 the p value for the analysis of variance of the regression is acceptable and almost equal to zero fig 5 shows the good correlation of data with each other the data dispersion is normal and the distribution curve is almost bell shaped the linear regression equation for the selected monitoring well which was well number 21 in cluster 3 is as follow 3 w 21 29 3 0 111 w 11 0 0039 w 12 0 0465 w 13 0 217 w 14 0 0496 w 15 0 604 w 16 0 0888 w 17 0 0959 w 19 0 196 w 26 0 104 w 30 0 277 w 34 0 0436 w 35 0 002 w 36 0 382 w 37 0 045 w 38 3 3 comparing arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and regression analysis with the aim to understand high variability of groundwater and estimating the missing data in some monitoring wells the arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and regression analysis methods were applied to predict groundwater table data in comparison with real data in w21 and the results are presented in fig 6 average of all data were used in the arithmetic mean method whereas in spline linear interpolation method only w36 and w37 due to the similar geological and topographic conditions as respect to w21 were selected for calculation the regression analysis method based on data in cluster 3 which included w21 was performed for estimating w21 s data as well the horizontal axis of fig 6 shows date for 15 years and the vertical axis shows depth of groundwater measured in meters above sea level in monitoring well no 21 the results illustrate that groundwater levels increased at the end of wet season in april while at the end of dry season groundwater levels decreased due to over withdrawal for farmlands irrigation requirements in iran moreover results of the mentioned methods in fig 6 clarify that regression analysis is a more accurate forecasting method and fitted better to real w21 data in terms of comparing the results of these methods r2 and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficients were used to assess the predictive ability of statistical methods nash and sutcliffe 1970 r2 and nse coefficients for arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation and regression analysis methods were calculated 0 83 12 56 0 82 0 17 and 0 93 0 92 respectively fig 7 comparison of these three methods shows that the regression analysis method can evaluate missing data with high accuracy and also linear spline interpolation method compared with the arithmetic mean method that in iran is the method more widely used because of its simplicity offers an acceptable calculation 4 conclusion groundwater constitutes the largest available water resource for water supply and irrigation in semi arid regions in particular in iran and therefore the monitoring and management of groundwater resources is of great interest for decision makers confronting uncertainty and gaps in groundwater table data poses serious challenges in order to monitor and model the aquifer response in this research we tried to find a simple statistical method characterized by a high accuracy to fill the gaps related to groundwater level in monitoring wells the arithmetic mean linear spline interpolation methods and multivariate analysis have been carried out to predict the missing data in 39 monitoring wells in kazeroun plain iran cluster analysis was used to classify monitoring wells into 5 clusters according to the groundwater table then regression analysis on cluster 3 which is including w21 declared more accurate results and close fitting for field data according to the calculations and analysis presented in this paper multivariate analysis is one of the best ways that can help effectively to compute and evaluate data using the regression analysis method a formula is presented for predicting the groundwater table in one of the monitoring wells adjusted r square evaluated 92 9 for regression analysis that is acceptable and as a result the missing data were reconstructed with high reliability thanks to the formula regards to the wide range of statistical techniques examining different methods for handling missing data strongly recommended mostly in developing countries due to short breaks in hydrology and hydrogeology data finding appropriate missing data method will serve to the

skeletal fluorosis myopathy along with renal and neuronal disorders high fluoride levels have neurological effects and skeletal cancer potential the intelligence quotient iq of children is severely affected by it the health risk assessment of fluoride contamination in drinking water has been carried out in various parts of the world the estimation of non cancer risk ncr of fluoride on human health is very essential this assessment of ncr is usually done by determining the hazard quotient hq of the pollutant proposed by usepa 2005 in ncr calculation by hq method individual hq of different routes of exposure to human such as oral dermal and inhalation is determined the hazard index hi is calculated further by combining individual hq s of oral dermal and inhalation but this method is very conservative and a little fluctuation near the boundary doesn t reflect the justified classification artificial intelligence ai computational methods such as genetic algorithms knowledge based systems neural networks and fuzzy logic has been increasingly applied to environmental issues in recent years chau 2006 as they are thought to be effective in solving the above mentioned problems zadeh 1965 introduced fuzzy logic which has become one of ai s most common approaches the design of environmental indicators is regarded suitable as it is capable of reflecting human ideas and knowledge in indices enabling them to handle uncertain non linear ambiguous and subjective information it also allows to include parameters in the index including both qualitative and quantitative variables with different values and meaning it is also a reliable linguistic reporting method that is understandable to public managers decision makers and non experts in general mckone and deshpande

dhanbad india s largest coal mining region is located in the middle of damodar river basin for over a century the incidence and movement of groundwater are limited to semi weathered and fractured rocks in the study area the thickness the dimension and the opening of the weathered area and the linkages between fractures regulate the groundwater movements singh et al 2007 patolia and sinha 2017

given by usepa doesn t reflect the clear picture of the ncr little fluctuations near the boundary values change the degree of impact of the risk here fuzzy theory can be used to overcome this obstacle zadeh 1965 introduced fuzzy logic to create systems that are closer to spirit of human thoughts the knowledge of the experts is used in conjunction with the other parameters to create a system based on information captured by rules defined in a fuzzy inference system fuzzy set a is a subset of the universe of discourse x which is denoted by the following nomenclature 13 a x 1 μ a x x x 0 μ a x 1 where x 1 belongs to x and an element of fuzzy set a and the value of μ a x shows the membership grade of x 1 in fuzzy set a for the assessment of fhi fluoride concentration is taken as input parameter table 3 and their corresponding fhi as output supplementary table s1 the membership functions mfs has defined for each classes and ranks which consists of 5 if then inference rules based on expert s advice and the permissible limits supplementary table s1 if then inference rule applied in this work is as follows later the centroid method is adopted to defuzzify the output if fluoride concentration i e input mf belongs to class a then fhi i e output mf will have rank i if input mf belongs to class b then fhi i e output mf will have rank ii if input mf belongs to class c then fhi i e output mf will have rank iii if input mf belongs to class d then fhi i e output mf will have rank iv if input mf belongs to class e then fhi i e output mf will have rank v 3 results and discussions 3 1 spatial distribution of fluoride concentration in the study area the groundwater samples collected from the study region had a high concentration of fluoride i e an average of 3 57 mg l ranging from 0 3 to 12 5 mg l in locations g 1 and g 20 respectively which were 0 3 12 5 times higher than the acceptable limit i e 1 0 mg l is 10500 2012 elevated fluoride concentrations were observed in study area and the spatial distribution of fluoride concentration is shown in fig 2 according to who standards as per classifications are shown in table 3 it was observed that 5 of the sampling sites were found below 0 5 mg l which means they are prone to dental caries who 2004 while 45 of the sites were found under safe range 0 5 1 5 mg l however 50 of the water samples were found to be in the high risk zone i e 1 5 mg l in the study region the overall fluoride variation and distribution pattern seasons are in abundance and dissimilar mainly due to weathering mineral dissolution the divergent fracture system is mainly associated with hydro chemical processes reddy and rao 2006 3 2 effect of ions on fluoride concentrations all the water samples found in the study area was alkaline in nature i e average 7 85 3 44 the electrical conductivity of average 1750 39 941 57 μs cm and total dissolved solid of average 871 26 468 63 mg l was observed in water samples which indicates water with the high dissolution of organic as well as inorganic constituents the hardness of the water samples varied from 50 to 575 mg l as caco3 while na and k were observed as in the range of 56 4 399 2 mg l and 3 16 8 24 mg l respectively which indicates weathering of rocks in most of the cases domination of hco3 ions was found i e average 318 96 26 mg l while partial domination of cl ions was observed i e average 207 17 74 01 mg l low sulphate content was observed in the water sample i e average 46 24 mg l is associated with the high ph to understand the effect of different ions on fluoride concentration a pearson correlation pcs was carried out and the correlations between the pcs and the original variables were estimated a correlation value above 0 5 is considered important in this study and discussions were carried out accordingly it can be inferred that ph has a positive correlation i e r2 0 848 with fluoride from pearson correlation table 2 it is due to fluoride ion replacement with hydroxide ions that promotes alkaline conditions as h and f have same radicals which is mostly combined as hf khan and ravikumar 2013 patolia and sinha 2017 moreover carbonates and bicarbonates have positive correlation with ph the simultaneous release of hydroxide and bicarbonate ions during the process of dissolution of fluoride bearing mineral in groundwater is responsible for the alkaline condition correlation analysis shows that fluoride solubility in drinking water is ph dependent and the salts of na k and hco3 have demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fluoride concentration which accelerated the favourable ph for dissolution of fluoride compounds in drinking water caused a high concentration of fluoride in drinking water chandio et al 2015 ca2 and so4 have shown strong negative correlation attributed the low concentration of both ions enhances the increase of fluoride concentration which can be attributed from that the high fluoride and low concentration of calcium and so4 may be due to prior precipitation the high fluoride groundwater having higher ph 7 are mainly associated with nahco3 type ions and comparatively low calcium and magnesium concentration these types of water usually have alkaline ph where fluoride ions can be easily released from ores as oh ions and f ions have similar radii and can be exchanged with one another khan et al 2013 the study also exhibited the influence of rock water interaction on fluoride enrichment as well as other major components is the reason for the relationship between f ions and tds wang et al 2009 mamatha and rao 2010 li et al 2014 narsimha and rajitha 2018 higher sodium content and lower calcium concentration are associated with the high alkaline condition the ph of the water sample increases due to weathering of na rich rocks calcium s role in dissolving fluoride in groundwater can be seen from the correlation study which showed the negative correlation between calcium and fluoride which may be due to the formation of caf2 patolia and sinha 2017 it reflected the importance of calcium ions groundwater fluoride dissolution it can also be inferred from the low calcium concentration and high fluoride concentration may be due to prior calcite precipitation the concentration of sulphate nitrate and chloride have negative correlation with the ph of the water sample the pearson correlation showed that so4 2 no3 and cl ions have high negative correlation medium negative correlation and low negative correlation with ph respectively no significant correlation was observed between f and no3 ions analysis of groundwater samples from the study area were classified graphically as percentages of milliequivalents of the major cations and anions through piper diagram using grapher 14 software fig 3 it was apparent that majorly dominant cation was na and k ions i e 60 of the total sampling locations but no cation dominance was observed for mg2 ions in case of anions most of the samples i e 60 were found in no dominant type region but no anion dominance was observed for so4 2 ions almost 60 of the samples obtained from the study area the sodium chloride bicarbonate groundwater quality prevails and could be attributed to the high occurrences of alkali elements in the underlying soil 35 of the water samples were hco3 type water generally high fluoride concentration are associated with na hco3 type water due to fluoride dissolution in sodium bicarbonate water rao et al 1993 guo et al 2007 3 3 human hazard health risk assessment due to fluoride exposure elevated concentration of fluoride is considered to be human health non carcinogenic pollutant the world health organisation who 2011 has set minimum and maximum fluoride content limits of 0 5 1 5 mg l respectively for drinking purposes which is optimum dental range high fluoride water can cause mottling of the teeth calcification of the ligaments and bone disorder who 2011 table 3 encapsulates the groundwater fluoride health risk assessment of the study region which is classified into five classes 3 3 1 assessment of health risk of high fluoride concentration using the conventional method the study highlighted the concentration of different ions in the groundwater ncr of fluoride by calculating hq and hi via oral dermal and inhalation routes in adults and children the estimation of non cancer risk was done by focusing on the total contribution of fluoride in the whole study area by assessing the effects of the same on people dependent on groundwater for drinking and bathing fig 4 a b illustrates the variation of hazard quotients due to oral dermal and inhalation routes of exposure for both adults and children the mean hqoral value was 3 66 and 3 96 which is 3 66 times and 3 96 times higher than the desirable value is 10500 2012 for adults and children respectively very high hq value 4 i e up to 13 88 mg l was observed at several sites of the study area i e g 6 g 7 g 8 g 18 g 19 and g 20 which is amenable for severe health hazards to the exposed population fig 5 illustrates the problem of dental and skeletal fluorosis among the population of gharwar village the toxic levels of fluoride have been coupled with a weakening and bending of bones it leads to increase in hip and wrist fractures some locations i e g 1 g 4 g 9 g 14 g 15 are having very low non cancer risk i e hq 1 are comparatively safer from such grievous health impacts the average hq due to dermal route of exposure was observed as 0 009 and 0 0015 for adults and children respectively for inhalation route of exposure hq was observed as 0 067 and 0 123 for adults and children respectively from the above results it can be inferred that hq due to dermal and inhalation routes of exposure imparts least or negligible contribution in assessment of hi though the usepa method is most widely used method for assessment of non cancer risk due to a particular pollutant but it has limitations the classification has been done in discrete form for non cancer risk of five ranks small fluctuations near the boundary values of hi changed the ranking implementation of fuzzy theory can be used to solve this problem 3 3 2 assessment of health risk of high fluoride concentration using modern method ai for better understanding and overcoming the limitations associated with the traditional method a new ai based fuzzy hazard index was developed to evaluate non cancer risk due to fluoride exposure the combined value of hqdermal and hqinhalation is comparatively very less than hqoral so their contribution is negligible in hi assessment and hence hi is considered almost equal to hqoral for the assessment of fhi fluoride concentration is taken as input parameter and fhi as output which consists of 5 if then inference rules the formation of if then inference rule is based on expert s advice and the permissible limits the mfs classifications were enumerated based upon the classifications supplementary table s1 and expert s advice which are either triangular or trapezoidal in nature fig 6 for defuzzifying the outputs of fhi centroid method was adopted table 4 illustrates the results of fhi along with the degree of memberships for each category and its ranks based on the de fuzzified value fuzzy hi value ranged from 0 42 to 11 9 and 0 43 and 12 2 for adults and children respectively groundwater samples from locations g 2 g 3 g 5 g 9 g 10 g 11 g 13 g 14 g 15 g 16 g17 are considered as safe as their corresponding fluoride concentration lies in range 0 5 1 5 mg l which is identified as essential for development of strong bones and teeth table 3 all population in location g 1 and adults from g 4 has low risk as fluoride concentration lower to 0 5 mg l may result in dental caries while children from g 4 belongs to safe category the population belongs to locations g 7 g 18 and g 19 are at highest threat i e severe risk as they are highly prone to crippling fluorosis the traditional hi method is completely based on borderline classification in which a little fluctuation near the boundary changes the entire class of the risk while fhi provides no discrete outputs in terms of degree of membership as shown in fig 6 for instance g 3 belongs to safe category when traditional method is considered while in terms of fhi g 3 is 72 safe and belongs to 28 of moderate risk the outputs and interpretations obtained from developed fhi which is based on the fuzzy set theory are comparatively more precise and useful for dealing with numerous variables simultaneously than the traditional index method since fhi can deal with vague and uncertain data so it has the ability to allow a reliable rational precise and transparent information stream from data accumulation to data usage in environmental application system to validate the newly developed ai based index i e fhi the results from traditional hi and fhi were compared and a correlation coefficient of 0 97 was observed demonstrating the reliable applicability of the index as shown in fig 7 table 5 describes the detailed statistical data for both traditional hi as well as fuzzy hi method where no significant difference in mean values was observed 4 conclusions the present study suggests severe fluoride contamination in the groundwater of gharwar village which makes it unsuitable for drinking and bathing purpose ncr of fluoride exposure using traditional hi method shows an extremely severe health risk i e 13 and 14 3 times higher than the critical limit for adults and children respectively it has also been observed that the contribution of hqdermal and hqinhalation is very negligible in hi as compared to hqoral the concentration of the pollutants and their characteristics parameters are the inputs in the traditional approach developed by usepa 2005 however both expert knowledge and permissible limits are involved in providing a smart decision on groundwater quality assessment through the use of fuzzy mfs due to distinct computational method applied the newly developed fhi produces more stringent accurate and reliable results than those of traditional hi consequently it is suggested that it can be used as comprehensive tool for assessing ncr especially when examining water for drinking and bathing purpose declaration of competing

concentration i e 1 5 mg l in drinking water can have detrimental effects on soft tissue function and metabolism such as kidney liver lung and testicles zhang et al 2016 it can cause severe dental and skeletal fluorosis myopathy along with renal and neuronal disorders high fluoride levels have neurological effects and skeletal cancer potential the intelligence quotient iq of children is severely affected by it the health risk assessment of fluoride contamination in drinking water has been carried out in various parts of the world the estimation of non cancer risk ncr of fluoride on human health is very essential this assessment of ncr is usually done by determining the hazard quotient hq of the pollutant proposed by usepa 2005 in ncr calculation by hq method individual hq of different routes of exposure to human such as oral dermal and inhalation is determined the hazard index hi is calculated further by combining individual hq s of oral dermal and inhalation but this method is very conservative and a little fluctuation near the boundary doesn t reflect the justified classification artificial intelligence ai computational methods such as genetic algorithms knowledge based systems neural networks and fuzzy logic has been increasingly applied to environmental issues in recent years chau 2006 as they are thought to be effective in solving the above mentioned problems zadeh 1965 introduced fuzzy logic which has become one of ai s most common approaches the design of environmental indicators is regarded suitable as it is capable of reflecting human ideas and knowledge in indices enabling them to handle uncertain non linear ambiguous and subjective information it also allows to include parameters in the index including both qualitative and quantitative variables with different values and meaning it is also a reliable linguistic reporting method that is understandable to public managers decision makers and non experts in general mckone and deshpande 2005 silvert 2000 a number of latest researches have implemented fuzzy techniques for environmental risk analysis and management where information accessibility and reliability inadequate for quantitative conventional methods silvert 2000 ocampo duque et al 2006 gharibi 2012 sdao et al 2013 over the last decade a number of researchers have developed and pretrained fuzzy models to assess the inherent and integrate human health risk assessment li et al 2017 chabukdhara et al 2017 ilbahar et al 2018 mohamed et al 2019 to speculate the pollution echelon and the fate transport mechanism of the fluoride ions in the concerned stretch a study was carried out the prime objective of the study was to adjudicate the health risks consociated with fluoride rich water in adults and children caused due to ingestion and dermal route of exposure proposed by usepa 2005 a comparative study regarding the preciseness and the better understandability of the data was accomplished between the conventional hq based risk assessment and modern ai based risk assessment along with the spatial analysis of fluoride concentration in the considered area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 lies between the latitude 23 39 20 n to 23 40 00 n and longitude 86 32 40 to 86 33 30 e in the dhanbad district which is located in the eastern part of jharkhand state of india dhanbad india s largest coal mining region is located in the middle of damodar river basin for over a century the incidence and movement of groundwater are limited to semi weathered and fractured rocks in the study area the thickness the dimension and the opening of the weathered area and the linkages between fractures regulate the groundwater movements singh et al 2007 patolia and sinha 2017 the area covered for the study was 4 03 km2 the climatic condition of the study area is transitional between humid subtropical climate and tropical wet and dry climate the average summer and winter

zirconium dye lake fluoride dissociates a portion of the dye lake into a colourless complex anion and the dye the dye becomes progressively lighter as fluoride concentration increases absorbance is measured at 570 nm for the analysis of fluoride concentration apha 4500 f d 2017 2 3 human exposure health risk assessment 2 3 1 hazard index due to exposure of groundwater using conventional method an empirical model was used to calculate the ncr in which reference dose rfd was used as the main toxicity factors according to usepa 2005 guidelines parameters of input such as exposed time et

given by usepa doesn t reflect the clear picture of the ncr little fluctuations near the boundary values change the degree of impact of the risk here fuzzy theory can be used to overcome this obstacle zadeh 1965 introduced fuzzy logic to create systems that are closer to spirit of human thoughts the knowledge of the experts is used in conjunction with the other parameters to create a system based on information captured by rules defined in a fuzzy inference system fuzzy set a is a subset of the universe of discourse x which is denoted by the following nomenclature 13 a x 1 μ a x x x 0 μ a x 1 where x 1 belongs to x and an element of fuzzy set a and the value of μ a x shows the membership grade of x 1 in fuzzy set a for the assessment of fhi fluoride concentration is taken as input parameter table 3 and their corresponding fhi as output supplementary table s1 the membership functions mfs has defined for each classes and ranks which consists of 5 if then inference rules based on expert s advice and the permissible limits supplementary table s1 if then inference rule applied in this work is as follows later the centroid method is adopted to defuzzify the output if fluoride concentration i e input mf belongs to class a then fhi i e output mf will have rank i if input mf belongs to class b then fhi i e output mf will have rank ii if input mf belongs to class c then fhi i e output mf will have rank iii if input mf belongs to class d then fhi i e output mf will have rank iv if input mf belongs to class e then fhi i e output mf will have rank v 3 results and discussions 3 1 spatial distribution of fluoride concentration in the study area the groundwater samples collected from the study region had a high concentration of fluoride i e an average of 3 57 mg l ranging from 0 3 to 12 5 mg l in locations g 1 and g 20 respectively which were 0 3 12 5 times higher than the acceptable limit i e 1 0 mg l is 10500 2012 elevated fluoride concentrations were observed in study area and the spatial distribution of fluoride concentration is shown in fig 2 according to who standards as per classifications are shown in table 3 it was observed that 5 of the sampling sites were found below 0 5 mg l which means they are prone to dental caries who 2004 while 45 of the sites were found under safe range 0 5 1 5 mg l however 50 of the water samples were found to be in the high risk zone i e 1 5 mg l in the study region the overall fluoride variation and distribution pattern seasons are in abundance and dissimilar mainly due to weathering mineral dissolution the divergent fracture system is mainly associated with hydro chemical processes reddy and rao 2006 3 2 effect of ions on fluoride concentrations all the water samples found in the study area was alkaline in nature i e average 7 85 3 44 the electrical conductivity of average 1750 39 941 57 μs cm and total dissolved solid of average 871 26 468 63 mg l was observed in water samples which indicates water with the high dissolution of organic as well as inorganic constituents the hardness of the water samples varied from 50 to 575 mg l as caco3 while na and k were observed as in the range of 56 4 399 2 mg l and 3 16 8 24 mg l respectively which indicates weathering of rocks in most of the cases domination of hco3 ions was found i e average 318 96 26 mg l while partial domination of cl ions was observed i e average 207 17 74 01 mg l low sulphate content was observed in the water sample i e average 46 24 mg l is associated with the high ph to understand the effect of different ions on fluoride concentration a pearson correlation pcs was carried out and the correlations between the pcs and the original variables were estimated a correlation value above 0 5 is considered important in this study and discussions were carried out accordingly it can be inferred that ph has a positive correlation i e r2 0 848 with fluoride from pearson correlation table 2 it is due to fluoride ion replacement with hydroxide ions that promotes alkaline conditions as h and f have same radicals which is mostly combined as hf khan and ravikumar 2013 patolia and sinha 2017 moreover carbonates and bicarbonates have positive correlation with ph the simultaneous release of hydroxide and bicarbonate ions during the process of dissolution of fluoride bearing mineral in groundwater is responsible for the alkaline condition correlation analysis shows that fluoride solubility in drinking water is ph dependent and the salts of na k and hco3 have demonstrated a strong positive correlation with fluoride concentration which accelerated the favourable ph for dissolution of fluoride compounds in drinking water caused a high concentration of fluoride in drinking water chandio et al 2015 ca2 and so4 have shown strong negative correlation attributed the low concentration of both ions enhances the increase of fluoride concentration which can be attributed from that the high fluoride and low concentration of calcium and so4 may be due to prior precipitation the high fluoride groundwater having higher ph 7 are mainly associated with nahco3 type ions and comparatively low calcium and magnesium concentration these types of water usually have alkaline ph where fluoride ions can be easily released from ores as oh ions and f ions have similar radii and can be exchanged with one another khan et al 2013 the study also exhibited the influence of rock water interaction on fluoride enrichment as well as other major components is the reason for the relationship between f ions and tds wang et al 2009 mamatha and rao 2010 li et al 2014 narsimha and rajitha 2018 higher sodium content and lower calcium concentration are associated with the high alkaline condition the ph of the water sample increases due to weathering of na rich rocks calcium s role in dissolving fluoride in groundwater can be seen from the correlation study which showed the negative correlation between calcium and fluoride which may be due to the formation of caf2 patolia and sinha 2017 it reflected the importance of calcium ions groundwater fluoride dissolution it can also be inferred from the low calcium concentration and high fluoride concentration may be due to prior calcite precipitation the concentration of sulphate nitrate and chloride have negative correlation with the ph of the water sample the pearson correlation showed that so4 2 no3 and cl ions have high negative correlation medium negative correlation and low negative correlation with ph respectively no significant correlation was observed between f and no3 ions analysis of groundwater samples from the study area were classified graphically as percentages of milliequivalents of the major cations and anions through piper diagram using grapher 14 software fig 3 it was apparent that majorly dominant cation was na and k ions i e 60 of the total sampling locations but no cation dominance was observed for mg2 ions in case of anions most of the samples i e 60 were found in no dominant type region but no anion dominance was observed for so4 2 ions almost 60 of the samples obtained from the study area the sodium chloride bicarbonate groundwater quality prevails and could be attributed to the high occurrences of alkali elements in the underlying soil 35 of the water samples were hco3 type water generally high fluoride concentration are associated with na hco3 type water due to fluoride dissolution in sodium bicarbonate water rao et al 1993 guo et al 2007 3 3 human hazard health risk assessment due to fluoride exposure elevated concentration of fluoride is considered to be human health non carcinogenic pollutant the world health organisation who 2011 has set minimum and maximum fluoride content limits of 0 5 1 5 mg l respectively for drinking purposes which is optimum dental range high fluoride water can cause mottling of the teeth calcification of the ligaments and bone disorder who 2011 table 3 encapsulates the groundwater fluoride health risk assessment of the study region which is classified into five classes 3 3 1 assessment of health risk of high fluoride concentration using the conventional method the study highlighted the concentration of different ions in the groundwater ncr of fluoride by calculating hq and hi via oral dermal and inhalation routes in adults and children the estimation of non cancer risk was done by focusing on the total contribution of fluoride in the whole study area by assessing the effects of the same on people dependent on groundwater for drinking and bathing fig 4 a b illustrates the variation of hazard quotients due to oral dermal and inhalation routes of exposure for both adults and children the mean hqoral value was 3 66 and 3 96 which is 3 66 times and 3 96 times higher than the desirable value is 10500 2012 for adults and children respectively very high hq value 4 i e up to 13 88 mg l was observed at several sites of the study area i e g 6 g 7 g 8 g 18 g 19 and g 20 which is amenable for severe health hazards to the exposed population fig 5 illustrates the problem of dental and skeletal fluorosis among the population of gharwar village the toxic levels of fluoride have been coupled with a weakening and bending of bones it leads to increase in hip and wrist fractures some locations i e g 1 g 4 g 9 g 14 g 15 are having very low non cancer risk i e hq 1 are comparatively safer from such grievous health impacts the average hq due to dermal route of exposure was observed as 0 009 and 0 0015 for adults and children respectively for inhalation route of exposure hq was observed as 0 067 and 0 123 for adults and children respectively from the above results it can be inferred that hq due to dermal and inhalation routes of exposure imparts least or negligible contribution in assessment of hi though the usepa method is most widely used method for assessment of non cancer risk due to a particular pollutant but it has limitations the classification has been done in discrete form for non cancer risk of five ranks small fluctuations near the boundary values of hi changed the ranking implementation of fuzzy theory can be used to solve this problem 3 3 2 assessment of health risk of high fluoride concentration using modern method ai for better understanding and overcoming the limitations associated with the traditional method a new ai based fuzzy hazard index was developed to evaluate non cancer risk due to fluoride exposure the combined value of hqdermal and hqinhalation is comparatively very less than hqoral so their contribution is negligible in hi assessment and hence hi is considered almost equal to hqoral for the assessment of fhi fluoride concentration is taken as input parameter and fhi as output which consists of 5 if then inference rules the formation of if then inference rule is based on expert s advice and the permissible limits the mfs classifications were enumerated based upon the classifications supplementary table s1 and expert s advice which are either triangular or trapezoidal in nature fig 6 for defuzzifying the outputs of fhi centroid method was adopted table 4 illustrates the results of fhi along with the degree of memberships for each category and its ranks based on the de fuzzified value fuzzy hi value ranged from 0 42 to 11 9 and 0 43 and 12 2 for adults and children respectively groundwater samples from locations g 2 g 3 g 5 g 9 g 10 g 11 g 13 g 14 g 15 g 16 g17 are considered as safe as their corresponding fluoride concentration lies in range 0 5 1 5 mg l which is identified as essential for development of strong bones and teeth table 3 all population in location g 1 and adults from g 4 has low risk as fluoride concentration lower to 0 5 mg l may result in dental caries while children from g 4 belongs to safe category the population belongs to locations g 7 g 18 and g 19 are at highest threat i e severe risk as they are highly prone to crippling fluorosis the traditional hi method is completely based on borderline classification in which a little fluctuation near the boundary changes the entire class of the risk while fhi provides no discrete outputs in terms of degree of membership as shown in fig 6 for instance g 3 belongs to safe category when traditional method is considered while in terms of fhi g 3 is 72 safe and belongs to 28 of moderate risk the outputs and interpretations obtained from developed fhi which is based on the fuzzy set theory are comparatively more precise and useful for dealing with numerous variables simultaneously than the traditional index method since fhi can deal with vague and uncertain data so it has the ability to allow a reliable rational precise and transparent information stream from data accumulation to data usage in environmental application system to validate the newly developed ai based index i e fhi the results from traditional hi and fhi were compared and a correlation coefficient of 0 97 was observed demonstrating the reliable applicability of the index as shown in fig 7 table 5 describes the detailed statistical data for both traditional hi as well as fuzzy hi method where no significant difference in mean values was observed 4 conclusions the present study suggests severe fluoride contamination in the groundwater of gharwar village which makes it unsuitable for drinking and bathing purpose ncr of fluoride exposure using traditional hi method shows an extremely severe health risk i e 13 and 14 3 times higher than the critical limit for adults and children respectively it has also been observed that the contribution of hqdermal and hqinhalation is very negligible in hi as compared to hqoral the concentration of the pollutants and their characteristics parameters are the inputs in the traditional approach developed by usepa 2005 however both expert knowledge and permissible limits are involved in providing a smart decision on groundwater quality assessment through the use of fuzzy mfs due to distinct computational method applied the newly developed fhi produces more stringent accurate and reliable results than those of traditional hi consequently it is suggested that it can be used as comprehensive tool for assessing ncr especially when examining water for drinking and bathing purpose declaration of competing

12128,the sustainable use of groundwater from karst aquifers is key for sustainable development in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area gto wca in namibia the ever increasing demand for groundwater for irrigation purposes in the gto wca and for argumentation purposes to the central area of namibia has put the aquifer under pressure proper groundwater management is therefore required to protect this finite resource this study assessed the sustainability of groundwater use in the gto wca by assessing the behaviour of groundwater users in the gto wca and by assessing the current legislation and regulatory mechanisms followed by authorities in their allocation of groundwater to the users the results indicate that groundwater use for irrigation has increased above the sustainable safe yield for the aquifers in this area the paper elaborates on reasons for the current state of affairs and proposes specific management solutions graphical abstract image 1 keywords grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area sustainability groundwater use irrigation karst 1 introduction namibia is one of the most arid countries in sub saharan africa the cuvelai etosha basin ceb in the central parts of northern namibia in particular experiences various water related challenges such as high climate variability saline groundwater and high population density and growth in urban areas liehr et al 2016 groundwater is considered to be the most important source of water supply for both agricultural and industrial use in namibia bann and wood 2012 wanke et al 2008 there is a high demand for freshwater worldwide as a result of population increase agricultural and economic development mackay 2006 namibia is no exception and promoting sustainable use of groundwater resources could limit over exploitation of this scarce water resource sustainable groundwater utilisation is especially important in the namibian karst aquifers of the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area gto wca which is the focus of this article sustainable management should be strongly supported by technical and institutional competency a legal framework that enables governments to implement sustainable development principles and relevant environmental and socio economic information garduno and foster 2010 to safeguard the groundwater use in the country it is essential to incorporate sound technical information on aquifer characteristics recharge and safe yields of water supply aquifers so that regulatory institutions can make informed decisions on water restrictions or allocations giordano and villholth 2007 where information on these aspects is lacking it has led to poor management of groundwater resources in the case of the gto wca a groundwater study with a groundwater model was done in 2004 which was not validated or updated since officials therefore manage groundwater according to an outdated groundwater model with obvious data gaps considering that the data is 15 years old also the 1956 water act rsa 1956 does not speak to integrated water resources management iwrm and is not in line with the current iwrm practices implemented by the namibian department of water affairs dwaf in south africa this act has been repealed and replaced with the national water act of 1998 rsa 1998 which does address iwrm ballweber 2006 identified political will capacitated institutions and technical cooperation as the three pillars required to support the proper implementation of iwrm however in the case of the gto wca poor political will to align legislation with current required practices poorly capacitated institutions to enact legislation and the lack of technical cooperation between stakeholders to identify integrate and share data and to identify data gaps all contribute to poor groundwater resources management in the gto wca although all the groundwater resource management practices and institutions in the gto wca are not aligned with iwrm yet we do however observe a transition in water resources management paradigms van der voorn and quist 2018 from purely technocratic water resources management and allocation based on the water act 1956 to iwrm where sustainable adaptive management must be implemented to consider the complex interconnectedness to water resources systems water allocation methods differ worldwide but there is a greater understanding by water resource managers nowadays on the need to manage groundwater resources sustainably hence the common approach to implement iwrm namibia like any other country that is located in an arid to semi arid environment is striving to ensure that its water resources are managed sustainably however the failure to implement the policies based on the results of aquifer investigations and the poor enforcement of the aquifer management section of the water resources management act wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 have caused complacency amongst individual irrigation farmers and the local municipalities about complying with groundwater irrigation permit conditions all regulations to ensure that the provisions of the wrma are legally binding have not all been promulgated yet and the water sector is still regulated partly by the apartheid era water act of 1956 remmert 2016 with increasing abstraction for irrigation and the added effect of climate change groundwater depletion is an unavoidable consequence madramootoo 2012 in this article the sustainability of groundwater irrigation allocations in the gto wca is assessed this water control area consists of two aquifers the tsumeb aquifer and grootfontein otavi aquifer according to dwa 1990 the tsumeb aquifer s sustainable yield is estimated at 19 million m3 a while the grootfontein otavi aquifer s is estimated at 18 million m3 a with a combined volume of 37 million m3 a the aquifer allocation plan makes provision for primary use domestic and stock watering and industrial use in order of priority according to dwa 1990 approximately 47 9 6 million m3 a of these groundwater resources can be allocated for irrigation in the tsumeb aquifer and 12 2 2 million m3 a for irrigation in the grootfontein otavi aquifer see table 1 a notable decline in the groundwater levels is observed over a 20 year period between 1980 and 2000 over a large area of the gto wca mawrd 2004 consequently many springs in the area including the otavi fountain east of otavi which historically discharged between 100 and 150 m3 h in the 1980 s have dried up or disappeared mawrd 2004 according to the historical data the groundwater table in the two aquifers dropped between 1 5 and 2 0 m a totalling an on average drop of 30 40 m over a 20 year period since the 1980 s dwa 2004 there is therefore a need to quantify the magnitude of depletion of groundwater levels in the area to understand the extent of t the aquifer depletion which is currently poorly documented as is the case for many developing nations konikow and kendy 2005 globally sustainable groundwater management has been identified as a long term priority to manage groundwater resources as many parts of the world face challenges related to climate change gómez et al 2017 even namibia will be severely affected by climate change met 2015 namibia is projected to become hotter in future with a predicted increase in temperature between 1 c and 3 5 c and a more variable pattern of rainfall is predicted for namibia which will cause increased aridity due to the combined effect of variable rainfall and increased evaporation by 2020 angula and kaundjua 2016 the changing climate is already affecting farming and human wellbeing in parts of namibia angula and kaundjua 2016 namibia has put in place a climate change policy and a supporting institutional framework but climate change has not yet been integrated into national sectoral policies such as the water sector crawford and terton 2016 it is hoped that iwrm under the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 linked with water demand management stricter water resources management and an increased focus on artificial recharge will assist with the integration of climate change policy in the water sector crawford and terton 2016 according to the national planning commission 2012 namibia s population is increasing on average over 2 annually the population increase in local municipalities situated in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area has negative implications for water availability to meet the volumes of water required for domestic and agricultural use namibia wants to ensure food security for the country and therefore needs to ensure groundwater security to sustain agricultural activities all the irrigation farmers within the water control area wca are required by law to be in possession of a valid permit for the abstraction of water for irrigation purposes firstly a farmer applies for a quantity of water required for irrigation then the geohydrology division makes an assessment of the quantity that can be allocated in terms of the aquifer management rules for water allocation and makes a decision on the amount to be allowed once the permit to abstract has been awarded the farmer must measure the total amount of water abstracted monthly and submit reports on abstraction rates to the authorities the measurements can also be read by the control inspectors of the department of water affairs and forestry dwaf during compliance monitoring to ensure farmers are adhering to the permit conditions according to the annual status report of the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area of 2015 16 mawf 2016 the groundwater volumes used for irrigation are higher than the amount permitted by the authorities meaning that farmers are irrigating more than their permits allow there is little information on why irrigation farmers are not complying with their permit conditions although the study area is considered to have a high groundwater potential there has been a steady rate of groundwater depletion according to the groundwater levels recorded in the area mawf 2016 this research therefore assesses the sustainability of aquifer management practices and reviews whether recommended quotas for irrigation by the dwaf are considered to be in line with the goal of achieving sustainable groundwater utilisation of the two aquifers by the agricultural sector by gauging the perceptions of farmers in the study area on current and potential water utilisation this study will contribute useful information on groundwater availability and sustainable groundwater use in the area 2 background on water governance for grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area the gto wca was proclaimed as a water control area on november 13 1970 in terms of section 28 of the water act no54 of 1956 heyns 2005 the control and use of subterranean water in a proclaimed water control area are stated in the regulations no r 1278 dated july 12 1971 dwa 1971 requiring that groundwater use in the area must be permitted by the minister of water affairs and forestry no permit is required for the abstraction of water for domestic purposes which in terms of the regulations includes the use for sanitary purposes the watering and dipping of stock and the irrigation of crops on an area of land not exceeding 1 ha in 1969 the south west africa affairs act was promulgated in south africa to control the territory of namibia and provide funding for development plans heyns 2005 this meant that most of the legislation in south africa became applicable to namibia including some clauses in the south african water act no 54 of 1956 rsa 1956 dwa 1956 as already mentioned this act is no longer in use in south africa and has been replaced with the national water act of 1998 rsa 1998 which considers aspects such as iwrm which the 1956 water act does not some regulations under the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 must also be promulgated to ensure that provisions under the wrma are legally binding although the regulations no r 1278 dated july 12 1971 dwa 1971 is still being used as an instrument to manage control and protect the groundwater resources lack of proper enforcement from authorities to ensure compliance by the users and promote sustainable management of the water resources is hampering the process section 170 of the water act act 54 of 1956 deals with offences and penalties but the regulations under r1278 did not adequately provide the details for the enforcement of the permit system to ensure compliance with the permit system the recourse in a situation like this is to amend the regulations but in the absence of any amendments it is important make the groundwater users aware that if they comply with the permit system they would protect the resources they rely upon if all users cooperate the sustainable use of water can be achieved without conflict and the imposition of penalties managing a karst aquifer is usually challenging because of its geological complexity león and parise 2009 however the management of the gto wca karst aquifers is further complicated by the lack of integrated development planning legislation that does not address iwrm adequately and poor implementation of legislation a steady increase in agricultural activities may lead to groundwater depletion in these karst aquifers taheri et al 2016 over exploitation of the karst aquifers could result in the formation of sinkholes although there is an acknowledgement of existing sinkholes in the area limited studies investigate the link between human activities and sinkhole formation in the gto wca managing the groundwater resources in the gto wca proved difficult without the involvement of the local stakeholders therefore to ensure proper management allocation and monitoring of the two aquifers in this wca the namibian government encouraged the formation of a local structure by the local stakeholders for joint management of the groundwater resources heyns 2008 stakeholders supported joint management of the aquifers and this led to the establishment of the karst water management body kwmb in accordance with the national water policy mawrd 2000 and the water resources management act no 24 of 2004 mawrd 2004 which was never enforced and is now replaced by the water resource management act no 11 of 2013 mawf 2013 the namibian government endorsed and recognised the establishment of the kwmb as representative of the gto wca groundwater management body under the constitution of the karst water management body it stated that its objectives are to optimize the management and achieve the most beneficial sustainable use of the water resources of the water control area the partnership was viewed as the best way to achieve maximum security in the supply of water to all people in the wca and to ensure transparency in the allocation of water quotas to different users all new permit applications or renewals that were submitted to the dwaf for abstraction of groundwater were scrutinised based on the water act no 54 of 1956 and recommendations of 10 000 m3 ha a across all crop types as an approach to managing the groundwater sustainably mawrd 2004 all the water permit applications submitted to the dwaf for processing were referred to the kwmb for their input before the application was finalised these provided the kwmb the power to examine the recommendations from the dwaf and to make additional recommendations based on the prevailing situation on the ground although the kwmb did not have the authority to make a final decision their inputs were effective especially on an advisory level to the dwaf regarding illegal irrigation in the gto wca although some water permits were suspended or rejected by both the dwaf and the kwmb irrigation farmers continued to abstract groundwater and no punishments were handed out to those not complying after the formation of the basin management committees bmcs according to the new water resources management act no 11 of 2013 mawf 2013 the bmcs replaced the kwmb according to the iwrm concept although bmcs have been established in some parts of the country the new act awaits its commencement the new water act recommends the establishment of bmcs under section 20 of the water resources management act no 11 of 2013 mawf 2013 whether the establishment of bmcs will improve the sustainable management of groundwater in the gto wca compared to the kwmb is still to be determined the implementation of a basin management policy based on river catchments only without taking cognisance of the fact that aquifers can lie across catchment boundaries this is a major failure of basic comprehension on the part of the dwa and the dwa needs to adapt this weak policy to address specific geohydrological environments and to be more practical and scientifically accurate after the adoption of iwrm in namibia basin management committees bmcs were formed around the country with the sole purpose to manage water resources in a holistic approach however because the basin management committee bmc establishment was based on surface water catchment areas it has split the gto wca aquifers between three bmcs the cuvelai etosha okavango omatako and the ugab huab basin management committee namibia 2010 consequently stakeholders in this wca that were part of karst water management body are now divided among these three bmcs currently the majority of the stakeholders especially the irrigation farmers do not participate in the quarterly bmc meetings as they regard some bmc meetings to be concentrating only on surface water especially meetings for the okavango omatako basin management committee previously meetings were organised by the karst water management body and the dwaf was invited to give updates on the groundwater status of the gto wca during this time concerns were raised by both parties about sustainable groundwater management in the gto wca however bmcs are currently not involved in the issuing of abstraction permits and this raises a question amongst stakeholders about their role and responsibilities and how they can influence groundwater management in their respective areas although the bmc has been formed in the area there is no existing law in place that authorise the formation of the bmc the water resources management act no 11 of 2013 is not enforced yet therefore the department is still using the water act of 1956 which does not provide for the formation of bmcs 3 study area the study was conducted in the gto wca covering an area of approximately 25 500 km2 including the otavi mountainland with its kalahari foreland the gto wca located in the central part of northern namibia fig 1 is a significant food production area for namibia in terms of livestock and crop farming due to the presence of the karst aquifers in this area it is considered an area of high groundwater potential christelis et al 2001 the carbonate rocks found in the karst host large volumes of groundwater resources of good quality and it is of national interest to utilize this groundwater in a sustainable way the large groundwater supply potential of the karst aquifers can be explained by the comparatively high rainfall in this specific area 500 mm dwa 2004 linked with the good groundwater storage potential in the karst aquifers the thin soil cover and the high porosity and permeability of the dolomite and limestone which is a result of intense fracturing of the host rock due to chemical weathering facilitates rapid infiltration of rainfall and storage as groundwater the gto wca also known as the maize triangle has three local municipalities tsumeb grootfontein and otavi and is dominated by irrigation and livestock farming the occurrence of the nosib group sediments and the virtually impervious basement rocks along the e w trending nosib anticline created a hydraulic barrier in n s direction that separates the karst aquifers into a northern portion the so called tsumeb aquifers and a southern portion the grootfontein otavi aquifers these aquifers are divided into eight sub regions fig 1 and each sub region has its recommended environmental sustainable safe yield for irrigation purposes for the specific sub region dwa 1990 the gto wca consists of two aquifers the tsumeb aquifer iv and grootfontein otavi aquifer i to iii see fig 2 4 methodology data collection to assess the sustainability of aquifer management practices and to review the irrigation quotas was done by means of both qualitative and quantitative methods a semi structured questionnaire was designed to capture the required information the questionnaire entailed mostly closed and a few open ended questions on the respondent s background their knowledge and perspective on recommended water irrigation quotas the suitability of groundwater use the identification of alternative groundwater uses their experience with suggested quotas questions on contributing factors to non compliance with permit conditions and lastly questions on economic losses and benefits based on recommended water usage the survey targeted specifically irrigation farmers in the area as they are the majority water user in the area and have a high influence on aquifer sustainability although the evaluation of sustainability was cross cutting element there were specific questions assessing the willingness and ability of the farming community to comply with the irrigation quotas open ended questions such as questions asking about alternatives to irrigation farming were thematically coded to identify the most common themes emerging from the open ended answers of the respondents the closed questions were already categorised according to information derived during water resources management of the gto gwa i e registration information of boreholes reported irrigation volumes reported monitoring of water levels the codes for the closed answers were therefore assigned according to the pre determined categories the study area is divided into eight sub regions as shown in table 2 although sub region e and f are managed as one unit therefore the total managed sub regions are seven each sub region has a specific volume permitted for groundwater abstractions sixty farms were randomly selected over the study area because some respondents owned multiple irrigation permits up to 4 per farmer the targeted respondents who were interviewed were reduced to a total of 37 during the survey the survey was conducted by two interviewers english questions were translated into the afrikaans language in the case where afrikaans speaking respondents were not fluent in english some information on actual groundwater usage in the area was collected via a literature review of dwaf documents qualitative information was collected from stakeholders such as individual experts irrigation farmers dwaf personnel that have experience working in the area organizations associated with crop production and directorates within ministries mandated to support farmers with crop production and water supply the data were analysed using the ibm statistics package for social sciences spss version 22 and the questions were categorised and coded in order to transform the data into table and graphical format 5 results and discussion a total of 37 respondents in the gto wca were interviewed the majority of the irrigation farms 56 8 are managed by landowners followed by farm managers at 32 4 and the remaining farms are managed by chief executive officers decisions on water use on the farms are largely taken by farm owners that have experience and knowledge about their farming environment and should play a role in the sustainability of groundwater use in the area of the 37 respondents only 3 farmers were from the previously disadvantaged group 5 1 sustainable groundwater use namibia is one of the driest countries in the world and about 48 of the water in the country is used for irrigation water demands for agricultural purposes have increased steadily over the years dalin and conway 2016 the situation is exacerbated by frequent droughts in the gto wca with climate predictions indicating that namibia will become drier and rainfall more variable meaning that droughts and floods are likely to become more frequent and intense turpie et al 2010 the erratic weather conditions and recurring droughts in namibia have resulted in significant drawdowns of shallow and deeper groundwater by irrigation farmers to meet their crop water requirements and by local municipalities to supply water for domestic purposes dalin and conway 2016 groundwater is seen as a crucial source of water supply for irrigation in the arid and semi arid areas madramootoo 2012 data from the namibian department of water affairs indicate that current groundwater use is above the sustainable yield of the two aquifers see fig 3 as per permit conditions farmers are required to monitor groundwater levels in their respective farms to understand groundwater fluctuations in the area and this monitoring must occur on a continuous basis however 27 of the respondents do not measure rest water levels on their farms even though this is the function and responsibility of the water resource managers if water users engage in monitoring of rest water levels on their farms they would better understand the impact of the land use activities on the groundwater resources according to dwa 1990 the sub regions in the two aquifers were each allocated a certain portion of the available sustainable yield of the aquifers for irrigation see table 3 these water volumes were divided among the irrigation farmers in the sub regions the criteria for allocating abstraction quotas was that the application under consideration can only be considered if the allocation quota has not been reached heyns 2008 all the abstraction permits awarded in the area should be below 10 000 m3 ha a for each crop type nonetheless dwaf has in recent years increased the groundwater allocation to the irrigation farmers way above the recommended sustainable yield for each sub region as shown in fig 3 groundwater allocation above the sustainable yield can be used to gather more information about the aquifer behaviour under different operational conditions but such decisions must be accompanied by rigorous monitoring especially in the case of sub region b2 that has high water use according to the resource managers at dwaf an irrigation quota of 200 000 m3 a requires an environmental impact assessment eia before approval is granted irrigation farmers who were able to conduct an eia to prove that an increase to their allocated quota above the 10 000 m3 ha a would not have a negative impact on the groundwater were awarded an additional increment however this is against the recommendation from the unpublished policy revised criteria to be considered when allocating a permit for the abstraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area dwa 2004 which advocates the sustainable utilisation of groundwater by recommending 10 000 m3 ha a across all crop types instead of promoting exploitation through groundwater quota increases by individual farmers with the financial means to afford an eia furthermore the groundwater model that was developed in the 1990 s to determine the sustainable groundwater yield in the area dwa 1990 has never been updated to consider new changes such as population growth increased water use in the industrial and irrigation sectors the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge over the last three decades or the behaviour of the aquifers under different operational conditions all irrigation farmers in the wca are legally required to submit their abstraction rates to the dwaf on a quarterly basis about 19 of the survey respondents indicated that they do not submit their abstraction returns these abstraction returns represent the total amount of groundwater abstracted per annum by the farmers for irrigation purposes because not all farmers are complying with submitting their annual abstraction returns to the water resource managers there is a misrepresentation of the total volume of groundwater used by irrigation farmers on an annual basis groundwater abstraction for irrigation has risen significantly in almost all the sub regions of the gto wca over the last few years as indicated in fig 4 according to the respondents groundwater is the only source of water supply for agricultural activities in the gto wca as rainfall is too erratic to be considered as a source of water for irrigation although in good rainfall seasons less groundwater is used for irrigation the majority of irrigation farmers irrigated more than their allocated quotas during the period from 2013 to 2016 during this period the area experienced frequent droughts and high temperatures and no measures were put in place to ensure a reduction in groundwater abstraction even though the permit conditions stipulated that in cases where the groundwater levels approach critical levels that the allocated permit quotas may be reduced or suspended mawrd 2004 no such reductions or suspensions were ever implemented or enforced by dwaf most irrigation farmers therefore increased their groundwater abstraction as a way to counter the high temperatures to keep their crops alive during times when the temperatures were too high if there is a rainfall drought during the growing season farmers would likely pump more water to save the crops and make profit to enable the farmer to repay the capital and interest on his irrigation project although this is an unsustainable activity relative to the safe yield of the aquifer the aquifer can possibly recover while a crop is unrecoverable if they die from lack of water however the measure in which the aquifer recovers and the economics of operating the aquifer on an optimal basis can only be determined by proper and effective monitoring of the aquifer some farmers are addressing bush encroachment on their farms as part of measures to increase aquifer recharge by removing alien vegetation which uses large volumes of water and reduces recharge the recharge will therefore improve over time and the yield of the aquifers can be adjusted upwards however some of those farmers indicated the need to increase irrigation quotas above their current allocated quota as a way of rewarding their efforts of bush encroachment management since reduction of bush encroachment is not subsidized by the state and the farmer must recover the cost from increased agricultural production over the short term this means that water that might be saved after bush encroachment management can still be lost through increased groundwater abstraction many farmers do not really support water saving practices as their main goal is to ensure a good harvest and to recover the costs of their investments in infrastructure and crops seed plough plant irrigate pest control harvesting transport etc some individual farmers believe that drilling deeper boreholes to tap into a deeper aquifer is a sustainable option to ensure pumping is not affected by drawdown and to ensure continuous groundwater supply for irrigation none of the respondents are willing to reduce their cultivation size in times of drought as a way to save the aquifer the fact that the water act 1956 which does not focus on sustainability is still used to manage water resources in the gto wca and the fact that most farmers come from a regime where water was viewed as private water may account for this unwillingness sub region b2 has a total of 6 2 million m3 a as a sustainable safe yield for the area however the currently permitted allocation of approximately 10 5 million m3 a is above the sustainable yield see fig 4 this sub region has the highest water use for irrigation and the groundwater abstraction is rising on an annual basis 5 2 compliance with groundwater abstraction permits groundwater use in the wca is regulated by the water act no 54 of 1956 under sections 29 a and 29 b and requires a permit for drilling and constructing a borehole in a wca dwa 1956 upon completion of drilling the borehole another permit is required for the abstraction of groundwater which might be subjected to different conditions such as the total amount to be abstracted theesfeld 2010 in this area where enforcement of legislation is lacking there is high level of non compliance with the permit conditions as indicated by our survey that shows that about 76 of respondents do not comply with their permit conditions seventy percent of the respondents indicated that their allocated quotas were not sufficient to fulfil their crop production requirement climate change is affecting agricultural activities and the farmers need to abstract more water to save the crops and ensure not losing on investments therefore abstracting more groundwater than their allocated quota will enable them to meet their irrigation needs with high investments in the irrigation sector many farmers are unwilling to compromise on their investment by reducing production climate change threatens the livelihood of many namibians with high temperatures affecting crop harvests especially in the communal areas turpie et al 2010 during the survey frequent dry spells and high temperatures were identified as contributing factors to many farmers irrigating their crops more often in an effort to save the crops from heat irrigation farmers claimed that during high temperatures crop growth can be affected which can also affect production therefore irrigating more often is seen as a solution higher irrigation levels usually occur during the day when the temperature is at its highest eighty six percent of the respondents use centre pivot as an irrigation method fig 5 respondents view centre pivot irrigation as consuming less water than the flood irrigation method and view it as the most suitable irrigation method for maize cultivation however if farmers irrigated at night it would be more cost effective as electricity charges are lower and it would also save water as evaporation is lower than during the daytime 5 3 current land use practices and willingness of respondents to implement alternatives the gto wca is predominantly agricultural with the highest number of irrigation farms in namibia located in this area approximately 43 of the respondents farm with maize as their main crop table 4 the majority of these respondents practice crop rotation and irrigate throughout the year according to the dwaf application form for irrigation crop rotation is not considered in the applications for groundwater abstraction and applicants do not indicate that either which is why respondents claim that their allocated quota is below the required amount water is allocated at 10 000m³ ha a if a farmer wants to irrigate 10 ha and the farmer gets a permitted allocation of 10 10 000 100 000 m³ and the farmer wants to plant two crops per annum then the farmer can only cultivate 5 ha at a time but the farmers do not follow this concept and irrigate the entire size of the field permit conditions must be enforced by a competent resource manager that protects the groundwater resources by enforcing the law most farms especially in the sub region b2 and g have been divided into smaller portions making them unproductive for dryland cropping and also unsuitable for livestock farming the majority of these portions of their land are cultivated with 41 of farmers cultivating between 30 and 70 of their land and with 35 cultivating more than 80 of their land approximately 65 of respondents are not willing to introduce crops that are less water intensive as the type of crops they are cultivating is determined by the market the majority of the farmers are diversifying into cash crops to grow the business but about 68 of respondents are willing to implement alternative land uses if water availability in the area deteriorates they are however only willing to implement alternative land uses once groundwater has been depleted to a point that irrigation cannot take place 6 conclusion groundwater is a finite resource and needs an integrated approach between the user the planners and the managers to ensure its sustainable management this study showed that groundwater use allocation permits in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area in namibia are higher than the sustainable safe yield of these aquifers and the actual permitted water use for irrigation is in most in stances higher than the current sustainable use this non alignment between water availability permit allocation and water abstraction is due to a complex mixture of amongst others knowledge gaps on water availability and abstraction officials manage water based on outdated data and models of more than 15 years old and the fact that institutions and the legal framework is not yet adapted to current iwrm requirements the policies and legislation in namibia have not changed much since the water act of 1956 and this lack of change has hampered sustainable water resources management blackie and tarr 2000 existing legislation that incorporates iwrm the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 and its regulations and guidelines are not being enforced by the dwaf to control water abstractions and allocations possibly because all the regulations under the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 have not yet been promulgated this survey confirms a high level of non compliance to regulations by the farmers in the area in addition the groundwater model for managing water resources the area has not been updated making the decision by dwaf to increase water allocations in the area unsafe and unwise current water use is not included in the groundwater model resulting in a poor understanding of water availability for future expansion there are no punitive measures for non compliance making compliance voluntary instead of compulsory a lack of financial resources has also been hampering compliance monitoring and enforcement in the area high water abstraction in karst aquifers during drought conditions when aquifer recharge does not occur to the degree that it should can however irreversibly damage the aquifer structure and water storage capacity linares et al 2017 as well as the aquifer s ability to transmit water león and parise 2009 groundwater over abstraction in karst aquifers can also lead to the formation of sinkholes and land subsidence linares et al 2017 groundwater abstraction in this region is not sustainable under the current climatic conditions where severe droughts have been experienced from the 2012 13 to the 2015 16 seasons with the 2015 16 season being the driest on record since the droughts of the early 1980s and 1990s archer et al 2017 from the above study it is clear that there is a general lack of sustainable aquifer management and unsustainable aquifer abstraction the following recommendations are made for consideration to improve the sustainable management of the aquifers in the gto wca there are various knowledge gaps in the gto wca specific issues that must be addressed include o there is a lack of updated groundwater information for the gto wca to address this knowledge gap which creates uncertainty in understanding the system and which ultimately leads to uncertainty in how to manage the gto wca groundwater data must be updated o as part of addressing knowledge gaps the ministry of agriculture water and forestry must commission a study to determine the crop water requirement in the country particularly in the gto wca this would help resource managers when allocating irrigation quotas to irrigation farmers o the geohydrology division at dwaf must develop a crop water requirement model and update the groundwater model once the knowledge gaps on groundwater availability water use and crop water requirements have been addressed this will enable the gto wca to gain an understanding of minimum crop water requirements and water availability under current water use conditions thereby ensuring more sustainable water use on an institutional level adaptive management approaches must be implemented to address uncertainties in data and water resources management more effectively van der voorn et al 2012 2017 pahl wostl et al 2008 the following specific institutional challenges must be addressed o the regulatory framework under the water resources management act of 2013 for water resources management in namibia must be finalised outstanding regulations under the wrma 2013 must be promulgated to ensure that provisions under the wrma are legally binding this will ensure that iwrm practices currently implemented in the gto wca are aligned with institutional arrangements and will ensure that iwrm is better implemented at the gto wca the iwrm plan should also be actively endorsed and implemented in the water resources management sector as part of iwrm aspects such as water demand management increased artificial recharge and better water resources use monitoring must be further developed to address climate change concerns o the resource managers from dwaf must perform monitoring on the farms that are not complying with permit conditions and also do regulatory spot checks to verify data that is reported to the dwaf if it is correct this monitoring must form part of the overall monitoring for the implementation of adaptive management o the bmc office must be strengthened by including a hydrogeologist in the structure of the bmc to ensure that a knowledgeable individual in groundwater subjects manages matters of groundwater in the area o the kwmb must be re established to more effectively monitor water use and allow the kwmb to influence water allocations this will ensure the effective concentration of resources and management options for water management during integrated water resources management currently the bmc is less effective in managing groundwater allocations and in conducting compliance monitoring than the kwmb was as they lack key competencies o the legislation and policies by geohydrology division must be amended so that the management of karst aquifers including the allocation of abstraction quotas is clearly addressed dwaf should increase human resource capacity and capacitate existing staff to effectively monitor and manage the water resources in the gto wca o information sharing to the farmers must be improved to change incorrect perceptions about groundwater availability and to promote sustainable groundwater use o a water payment or tax system must be implemented in the area if users pay for the water incentives of cheaper payment or lower taxes per volume of water used can be introduced for users who introduce crops that are less water intensive o water inspectors must be re introduced in the directorate of water resources management structures with an aim to improve and conduct effective compliance monitoring the current structure gives the role of water policing to technicians and administrative officers who are not fully capacitated to deal with law enforcement matters o resource managers should encourage farmers and all other water users to do resource monitoring that includes water level measurements water quality testing and meter readings from the abstraction boreholes as indicated in the permit condition this would enable the water users to understand the status of groundwater in their area over a long period o the water resources managers should raise awareness on a regular basis to create good relationships between them and the water users this would enable the water user to gain trust in the resource managers o there should be a separation of powers between the water sector and the agricultural sector currently the two sectors are headed by one minister and most attention is given to food security and not much attention is given to water security this is shown in the annual budget given to the two departments whereby the agriculture department get a disproportionately higher budget than the water department lastly on a strategic level future water resources management planning must be done for the gto wca to address external pressures on this water system such as climate change that will impact long term water availability in the gto wca this can be done by performing scenario analysis where an updated groundwater model can contribute tremendously as well as by implementing adaptive management am to incrementally change water resources management policies van der voorn et al 2012 pahl wostl et al 2008 to ensure effective am proper assessment of the current gto wca situation is required followed by policy alignment updating the water act and regulatory framework and aligning it with current iwrm practices the implementation of an adapted water resources management plan and monitoring of all newly implemented systems to adapt water resources management if and where required for instance in response to climate change is also necessary the uncertainties in the gto wca knowledge gaps inaccurate allocation of permits high levels of non compliance with permit conditions and high levels of water abstraction from the karst aquifers linked with an unwillingness to implement alternative land uses boils down to groundwater mining if the water resources policy and institutional arrangements are not more effectively aligned with iwrm and if water resource managers do not perform their duties in the national interest to protect the groundwater resources over the longer term irrigation farming will not be able to continue in this area and will go bankrupt karst aquifers in this region may then only recover in time if the aquifer structure has not been irreversibly damaged in addition the karst water in this region must also be reserved for supply to the central area of namibia in future which will become drier in future due to climate change the namibian government must therefore prevent karst aquifers from being destroyed by mismanagement declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data the following

12128,the sustainable use of groundwater from karst aquifers is key for sustainable development in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area gto wca in namibia the ever increasing demand for groundwater for irrigation purposes in the gto wca and for argumentation purposes to the central area of namibia has put the aquifer under pressure proper groundwater management is therefore required to protect this finite resource this study assessed the sustainability of groundwater use in the gto wca by assessing the behaviour of groundwater users in the gto wca and by assessing the current legislation and regulatory mechanisms followed by authorities in their allocation of groundwater to the users the results indicate that groundwater use for irrigation has increased above the sustainable safe yield for the aquifers in this area the paper elaborates on reasons for the current state of affairs and proposes specific management solutions graphical abstract image 1 keywords grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area sustainability groundwater use irrigation karst 1 introduction namibia is one of the most arid countries in sub saharan africa the cuvelai etosha basin ceb in the central parts of northern namibia in particular experiences various water related challenges such as high climate variability saline groundwater and high population density and growth in urban areas liehr et al 2016 groundwater is considered to be the most important source of water supply for both agricultural and industrial use in namibia bann and wood 2012 wanke et al 2008 there is a high demand for freshwater worldwide as a result of population increase agricultural and economic development mackay 2006 namibia is no exception and promoting sustainable use of groundwater resources could limit over exploitation of this scarce water resource sustainable groundwater utilisation is especially important in the namibian karst aquifers of the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area gto wca which is the focus of this article sustainable management should be strongly supported by technical and institutional competency a legal framework that enables governments to implement sustainable development principles and relevant environmental and socio economic information garduno and foster 2010 to safeguard the groundwater use in the country it is essential to incorporate sound technical information on aquifer characteristics recharge and safe yields of water supply aquifers so that regulatory institutions can make informed decisions on water restrictions or allocations giordano and villholth 2007 where information on these aspects is lacking it has led to poor management of groundwater resources in the case of the gto wca a groundwater study with a groundwater model was done in 2004 which was not validated or updated since officials therefore manage groundwater according to an outdated groundwater model with obvious data gaps considering that the data is 15 years old also the 1956 water act rsa 1956 does not speak to integrated water resources management iwrm and is not in line with the current iwrm practices implemented by the namibian department of water affairs dwaf in south africa this act has been repealed and replaced with the national water act of 1998 rsa 1998 which does address iwrm ballweber 2006 identified political will capacitated institutions and technical cooperation as the three pillars required to support the proper implementation of iwrm however in the case of the gto wca poor political will to align legislation with current required practices poorly capacitated institutions to enact legislation and the lack of technical cooperation between stakeholders to identify integrate and share data and to identify data gaps all contribute to poor groundwater resources management in the gto wca although all the groundwater resource management practices and institutions in the gto wca are not aligned with iwrm yet we do however observe a transition in water resources management paradigms van der voorn and quist 2018 from purely technocratic water resources management and allocation based on the water act 1956 to iwrm where sustainable adaptive management must be implemented to consider the complex interconnectedness to water resources systems water allocation methods differ worldwide but there is a greater understanding by water resource managers nowadays on the need to manage groundwater resources sustainably hence the common approach to implement iwrm namibia like any other country that is located in an arid to semi arid environment is striving to ensure that its water resources are managed sustainably however the failure to implement the policies based on the results of aquifer investigations and the poor enforcement of the aquifer management section of the water resources management act wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 have caused complacency amongst individual irrigation farmers and the local municipalities about complying with groundwater irrigation permit conditions all regulations to ensure that the provisions of the wrma are legally binding have not all been promulgated yet and the water sector is still regulated partly by the apartheid era water act of 1956 remmert 2016 with increasing abstraction for irrigation and the added effect of climate change groundwater depletion is an unavoidable consequence madramootoo 2012 in this article the sustainability of groundwater irrigation allocations in the gto wca is assessed this water control area consists of two aquifers the tsumeb aquifer and grootfontein otavi aquifer according to dwa 1990 the tsumeb aquifer s sustainable yield is estimated at 19 million m3 a while the grootfontein otavi aquifer s is estimated at 18 million m3 a with a combined volume of 37 million m3 a the aquifer allocation plan makes provision for primary use domestic and stock watering and industrial use in order of priority according to dwa 1990 approximately 47 9 6 million m3 a of these groundwater resources can be allocated for irrigation in the tsumeb aquifer and 12 2 2 million m3 a for irrigation in the grootfontein otavi aquifer see table 1 a notable decline in the groundwater levels is observed over a 20 year period between 1980 and 2000 over a large area of the gto wca mawrd 2004 consequently many springs in the area including the otavi fountain east of otavi which historically discharged between 100 and 150 m3 h in the 1980 s have dried up or disappeared mawrd 2004 according to the historical data the groundwater table in the two aquifers dropped between 1 5 and 2 0 m a totalling an on average drop of 30 40 m over a 20 year period since the 1980 s dwa 2004 there is therefore a need to quantify the magnitude of depletion of groundwater levels in the area to understand the extent of t the aquifer depletion which is currently poorly documented as is the case for many developing nations konikow and kendy 2005 globally sustainable groundwater management has been identified as a long term priority to manage groundwater resources as many parts of the world face challenges related to climate change gómez et al 2017 even namibia will be severely affected by climate change met 2015 namibia is projected to become hotter in future with a predicted increase in temperature between 1 c and 3 5 c and a more variable pattern of rainfall is predicted for namibia which will cause increased aridity due to the combined effect of variable rainfall and increased evaporation by 2020 angula and kaundjua 2016 the changing climate is already affecting farming and human wellbeing in parts of namibia angula and kaundjua 2016 namibia has put in place a climate change policy and a supporting institutional framework but climate change has not yet been integrated into national sectoral policies such as the water sector crawford and terton 2016 it is hoped that iwrm under the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 linked with water demand management stricter water resources management and an increased focus on artificial recharge will assist with the integration of climate change policy in the water sector crawford and terton 2016 according to the national planning commission 2012 namibia s population is increasing on average over 2 annually the population increase in local municipalities situated in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area has negative implications for water availability to meet the volumes of water required for domestic and agricultural use namibia wants to ensure food security for the country and therefore needs to ensure groundwater security to sustain agricultural activities all the irrigation farmers within the water control area wca are required by law to be in possession of a valid permit for the abstraction of water for irrigation purposes firstly a farmer applies for a quantity of water required for irrigation then the geohydrology division makes an assessment of the quantity that can be allocated in terms of the aquifer management rules for water allocation and makes a decision on the amount to be allowed once the permit to abstract has been awarded the farmer must measure the total amount of water abstracted monthly and submit reports on abstraction rates to the authorities the measurements can also be read by the control inspectors of the department of water affairs and forestry dwaf during compliance monitoring to ensure farmers are adhering to the permit conditions according to the annual status report of the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area of 2015 16 mawf 2016 the groundwater volumes used for irrigation are higher than the amount permitted by the authorities meaning that farmers are irrigating more than their permits allow there is little information on why irrigation farmers are not complying with their permit conditions although the study area is considered to have a high groundwater potential there has been a steady rate of groundwater depletion according to the groundwater levels recorded in the area mawf 2016 this research therefore assesses the sustainability of aquifer management practices and reviews whether recommended quotas for irrigation by the dwaf are considered to be in line with the goal of achieving sustainable groundwater utilisation of the two aquifers by the agricultural sector by gauging the perceptions of farmers in the study area on current and potential water utilisation this study will contribute useful information on groundwater availability and sustainable groundwater use in the area 2 background on water governance for grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area the gto wca was proclaimed as a water control area on november 13 1970 in terms of section 28 of the water act no54 of 1956 heyns 2005 the control and use of subterranean water in a proclaimed water control area are stated in the regulations no r 1278 dated july 12 1971 dwa 1971 requiring that groundwater use in the area must be permitted by the minister of water affairs and forestry no permit is required for the abstraction of water for domestic purposes which in terms of the regulations includes the use for sanitary purposes the watering and dipping of stock and the irrigation of crops on an area of land not exceeding 1 ha in 1969 the south west africa affairs act was promulgated in south africa to control the territory of namibia and provide funding for development plans heyns 2005 this meant that most of the legislation in south africa became applicable to namibia including some clauses in the south african water act no 54 of 1956 rsa 1956 dwa 1956 as already mentioned this act is no longer in use in south africa and has been replaced with the national water act of 1998 rsa 1998 which considers aspects such as iwrm which the 1956 water act does not some regulations under the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 must also be promulgated to ensure that provisions under the wrma are legally binding although the regulations no r 1278 dated july 12 1971 dwa 1971 is still being used as an instrument to manage control and protect the groundwater resources lack of proper enforcement from authorities to ensure compliance by the users and promote sustainable management of the water resources is hampering the process section 170 of the water act act 54 of 1956 deals with offences and penalties but the regulations under r1278 did not adequately provide the details for the enforcement of the permit system to ensure compliance with the permit system the recourse in a situation like this is to amend the regulations but in the absence of any amendments it is important make the groundwater users aware that if they comply with the permit system they would protect the resources they rely upon if all users cooperate the sustainable use of water can be achieved without conflict and the imposition of penalties managing a karst aquifer is usually challenging because of its geological complexity león and parise 2009 however the management of the gto wca karst aquifers is further complicated by the lack of integrated development planning legislation that does not address iwrm adequately and poor implementation of legislation a steady increase in agricultural activities may lead to groundwater depletion in these karst aquifers taheri et al 2016 over exploitation of the karst aquifers could result in the formation of sinkholes although there is an acknowledgement of existing sinkholes in the area limited studies investigate the link between human activities and sinkhole formation in the gto wca managing the groundwater resources in the gto wca proved difficult without the involvement of the local stakeholders therefore to ensure proper management allocation and monitoring of the two aquifers in this wca the namibian government encouraged the formation of a local structure by the local stakeholders for joint management of the groundwater resources heyns 2008 stakeholders supported joint management of the aquifers and this led to the establishment of the karst water management body kwmb in accordance with the national water policy mawrd 2000 and the water resources management act no 24 of 2004 mawrd 2004 which was never enforced and is now replaced by the water resource management act no 11 of 2013 mawf 2013 the namibian government endorsed and recognised the establishment of the kwmb as representative of the gto wca groundwater management body under the constitution of the karst water management body it stated that its objectives are to optimize the management and achieve the most beneficial sustainable use of the water resources of the water control area the partnership was viewed as the best way to achieve maximum security in the supply of water to all people in the wca and to ensure transparency in the allocation of water quotas to different users all new permit applications or renewals that were submitted to the dwaf for abstraction of groundwater were scrutinised based on the water act no 54 of 1956 and recommendations of 10 000 m3 ha a across all crop types as an approach to managing the groundwater sustainably mawrd 2004 all the water permit applications submitted to the dwaf for processing were referred to the kwmb for their input before the application was finalised these provided the kwmb the power to examine the recommendations from the dwaf and to make additional recommendations based on the prevailing situation on the ground although the kwmb did not have the authority to make a final decision their inputs were effective especially on an advisory level to the dwaf regarding illegal irrigation in the gto wca although some water permits were suspended or rejected by both the dwaf and the kwmb irrigation farmers continued to abstract groundwater and no punishments were handed out to those not complying after the formation of the basin management committees bmcs according to the new water resources management act no 11 of 2013 mawf 2013 the bmcs replaced the kwmb according to the iwrm concept although bmcs have been established in some parts of the country the new act awaits its commencement the new water act recommends the establishment of bmcs under section 20 of the water resources management act no 11 of 2013 mawf 2013 whether the establishment of bmcs will improve the sustainable management of groundwater in the gto wca compared to the kwmb is still to be determined the implementation of a basin management policy based on river catchments only without taking cognisance of the fact that aquifers can lie across catchment boundaries this is a major failure of basic comprehension on the part of the dwa and the dwa needs to adapt this weak policy to address specific geohydrological environments and to be more practical and scientifically accurate after the adoption of iwrm in namibia basin management committees bmcs were formed around the country with the sole purpose to manage water resources in a holistic approach however because the basin management committee bmc establishment was based on surface water catchment areas it has split the gto wca aquifers between three bmcs the cuvelai etosha okavango omatako and the ugab huab basin management committee namibia 2010 consequently stakeholders in this wca that were part of karst water management body are now divided among these three bmcs currently the majority of the stakeholders especially the irrigation farmers do not participate in the quarterly bmc meetings as they regard some bmc meetings to be concentrating only on surface water especially meetings for the okavango omatako basin management committee previously meetings were organised by the karst water management body and the dwaf was invited to give updates on the groundwater status of the gto wca during this time concerns were raised by both parties about sustainable groundwater management in the gto wca however bmcs are currently not involved in the issuing of abstraction permits and this raises a question amongst stakeholders about their role and responsibilities and how they can influence groundwater management in their respective areas although the bmc has been formed in the area there is no existing law in place that authorise the formation of the bmc the water resources management act no 11 of 2013 is not enforced yet therefore the department is still using the water act of 1956 which does not provide for the formation of bmcs 3 study area the study was conducted in the gto wca covering an area of approximately 25 500 km2 including the otavi mountainland with its kalahari foreland the gto wca located in the central part of northern namibia fig 1 is a significant food production area for namibia in terms of livestock and crop farming due to the presence of the karst aquifers in this area it is considered an area of high groundwater potential christelis et al 2001 the carbonate rocks found in the karst host large volumes of groundwater resources of good quality and it is of national interest to utilize this groundwater in a sustainable way the large groundwater supply potential of the karst aquifers can be explained by the comparatively high rainfall in this specific area 500 mm dwa 2004 linked with the good groundwater storage potential in the karst aquifers the thin soil cover and the high porosity and permeability of the dolomite and limestone which is a result of intense fracturing of the host rock due to chemical weathering facilitates rapid infiltration of rainfall and storage as groundwater the gto wca also known as the maize triangle has three local municipalities tsumeb grootfontein and otavi and is dominated by irrigation and livestock farming the occurrence of the nosib group sediments and the virtually impervious basement rocks along the e w trending nosib anticline created a hydraulic barrier in n s direction that separates the karst aquifers into a northern portion the so called tsumeb aquifers and a southern portion the grootfontein otavi aquifers these aquifers are divided into eight sub regions fig 1 and each sub region has its recommended environmental sustainable safe yield for irrigation purposes for the specific sub region dwa 1990 the gto wca consists of two aquifers the tsumeb aquifer iv and grootfontein otavi aquifer i to iii see fig 2 4 methodology data collection to assess the sustainability of aquifer management practices and to review the irrigation quotas was done by means of both qualitative and quantitative methods a semi structured questionnaire was designed to capture the required information the questionnaire entailed mostly closed and a few open ended questions on the respondent s background their knowledge and perspective on recommended water irrigation quotas the suitability of groundwater use the identification of alternative groundwater uses their experience with suggested quotas questions on contributing factors to non compliance with permit conditions and lastly questions on economic losses and benefits based on recommended water usage the survey targeted specifically irrigation farmers in the area as they are the majority water user in the area and have a high influence on aquifer sustainability although the evaluation of sustainability was cross cutting element there were specific questions assessing the willingness and ability of the farming community to comply with the irrigation quotas open ended questions such as questions asking about alternatives to irrigation farming were thematically coded to identify the most common themes emerging from the open ended answers of the respondents the closed questions were already categorised according to information derived during water resources management of the gto gwa i e registration information of boreholes reported irrigation volumes reported monitoring of water levels the codes for the closed answers were therefore assigned according to the pre determined categories the study area is divided into eight sub regions as shown in table 2 although sub region e and f are managed as one unit therefore the total managed sub regions are seven each sub region has a specific volume permitted for groundwater abstractions sixty farms were randomly selected over the study area because some respondents owned multiple irrigation permits up to 4 per farmer the targeted respondents who were interviewed were reduced to a total of 37 during the survey the survey was conducted by two interviewers english questions were translated into the afrikaans language in the case where afrikaans speaking respondents were not fluent in english some information on actual groundwater usage in the area was collected via a literature review of dwaf documents qualitative information was collected from stakeholders such as individual experts irrigation farmers dwaf personnel that have experience working in the area organizations associated with crop production and directorates within ministries mandated to support farmers with crop production and water supply the data were analysed using the ibm statistics package for social sciences spss version 22 and the questions were categorised and coded in order to transform the data into table and graphical format 5 results and discussion a total of 37 respondents in the gto wca were interviewed the majority of the irrigation farms 56 8 are managed by landowners followed by farm managers at 32 4 and the remaining farms are managed by chief executive officers decisions on water use on the farms are largely taken by farm owners that have experience and knowledge about their farming environment and should play a role in the sustainability of groundwater use in the area of the 37 respondents only 3 farmers were from the previously disadvantaged group 5 1 sustainable groundwater use namibia is one of the driest countries in the world and about 48 of the water in the country is used for irrigation water demands for agricultural purposes have increased steadily over the years dalin and conway 2016 the situation is exacerbated by frequent droughts in the gto wca with climate predictions indicating that namibia will become drier and rainfall more variable meaning that droughts and floods are likely to become more frequent and intense turpie et al 2010 the erratic weather conditions and recurring droughts in namibia have resulted in significant drawdowns of shallow and deeper groundwater by irrigation farmers to meet their crop water requirements and by local municipalities to supply water for domestic purposes dalin and conway 2016 groundwater is seen as a crucial source of water supply for irrigation in the arid and semi arid areas madramootoo 2012 data from the namibian department of water affairs indicate that current groundwater use is above the sustainable yield of the two aquifers see fig 3 as per permit conditions farmers are required to monitor groundwater levels in their respective farms to understand groundwater fluctuations in the area and this monitoring must occur on a continuous basis however 27 of the respondents do not measure rest water levels on their farms even though this is the function and responsibility of the water resource managers if water users engage in monitoring of rest water levels on their farms they would better understand the impact of the land use activities on the groundwater resources according to dwa 1990 the sub regions in the two aquifers were each allocated a certain portion of the available sustainable yield of the aquifers for irrigation see table 3 these water volumes were divided among the irrigation farmers in the sub regions the criteria for allocating abstraction quotas was that the application under consideration can only be considered if the allocation quota has not been reached heyns 2008 all the abstraction permits awarded in the area should be below 10 000 m3 ha a for each crop type nonetheless dwaf has in recent years increased the groundwater allocation to the irrigation farmers way above the recommended sustainable yield for each sub region as shown in fig 3 groundwater allocation above the sustainable yield can be used to gather more information about the aquifer behaviour under different operational conditions but such decisions must be accompanied by rigorous monitoring especially in the case of sub region b2 that has high water use according to the resource managers at dwaf an irrigation quota of 200 000 m3 a requires an environmental impact assessment eia before approval is granted irrigation farmers who were able to conduct an eia to prove that an increase to their allocated quota above the 10 000 m3 ha a would not have a negative impact on the groundwater were awarded an additional increment however this is against the recommendation from the unpublished policy revised criteria to be considered when allocating a permit for the abstraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area dwa 2004 which advocates the sustainable utilisation of groundwater by recommending 10 000 m3 ha a across all crop types instead of promoting exploitation through groundwater quota increases by individual farmers with the financial means to afford an eia furthermore the groundwater model that was developed in the 1990 s to determine the sustainable groundwater yield in the area dwa 1990 has never been updated to consider new changes such as population growth increased water use in the industrial and irrigation sectors the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge over the last three decades or the behaviour of the aquifers under different operational conditions all irrigation farmers in the wca are legally required to submit their abstraction rates to the dwaf on a quarterly basis about 19 of the survey respondents indicated that they do not submit their abstraction returns these abstraction returns represent the total amount of groundwater abstracted per annum by the farmers for irrigation purposes because not all farmers are complying with submitting their annual abstraction returns to the water resource managers there is a misrepresentation of the total volume of groundwater used by irrigation farmers on an annual basis groundwater abstraction for irrigation has risen significantly in almost all the sub regions of the gto wca over the last few years as indicated in fig 4 according to the respondents groundwater is the only source of water supply for agricultural activities in the gto wca as rainfall is too erratic to be considered as a source of water for irrigation although in good rainfall seasons less groundwater is used for irrigation the majority of irrigation farmers irrigated more than their allocated quotas during the period from 2013 to 2016 during this period the area experienced frequent droughts and high temperatures and no measures were put in place to ensure a reduction in groundwater abstraction even though the permit conditions stipulated that in cases where the groundwater levels approach critical levels that the allocated permit quotas may be reduced or suspended mawrd 2004 no such reductions or suspensions were ever implemented or enforced by dwaf most irrigation farmers therefore increased their groundwater abstraction as a way to counter the high temperatures to keep their crops alive during times when the temperatures were too high if there is a rainfall drought during the growing season farmers would likely pump more water to save the crops and make profit to enable the farmer to repay the capital and interest on his irrigation project although this is an unsustainable activity relative to the safe yield of the aquifer the aquifer can possibly recover while a crop is unrecoverable if they die from lack of water however the measure in which the aquifer recovers and the economics of operating the aquifer on an optimal basis can only be determined by proper and effective monitoring of the aquifer some farmers are addressing bush encroachment on their farms as part of measures to increase aquifer recharge by removing alien vegetation which uses large volumes of water and reduces recharge the recharge will therefore improve over time and the yield of the aquifers can be adjusted upwards however some of those farmers indicated the need to increase irrigation quotas above their current allocated quota as a way of rewarding their efforts of bush encroachment management since reduction of bush encroachment is not subsidized by the state and the farmer must recover the cost from increased agricultural production over the short term this means that water that might be saved after bush encroachment management can still be lost through increased groundwater abstraction many farmers do not really support water saving practices as their main goal is to ensure a good harvest and to recover the costs of their investments in infrastructure and crops seed plough plant irrigate pest control harvesting transport etc some individual farmers believe that drilling deeper boreholes to tap into a deeper aquifer is a sustainable option to ensure pumping is not affected by drawdown and to ensure continuous groundwater supply for irrigation none of the respondents are willing to reduce their cultivation size in times of drought as a way to save the aquifer the fact that the water act 1956 which does not focus on sustainability is still used to manage water resources in the gto wca and the fact that most farmers come from a regime where water was viewed as private water may account for this unwillingness sub region b2 has a total of 6 2 million m3 a as a sustainable safe yield for the area however the currently permitted allocation of approximately 10 5 million m3 a is above the sustainable yield see fig 4 this sub region has the highest water use for irrigation and the groundwater abstraction is rising on an annual basis 5 2 compliance with groundwater abstraction permits groundwater use in the wca is regulated by the water act no 54 of 1956 under sections 29 a and 29 b and requires a permit for drilling and constructing a borehole in a wca dwa 1956 upon completion of drilling the borehole another permit is required for the abstraction of groundwater which might be subjected to different conditions such as the total amount to be abstracted theesfeld 2010 in this area where enforcement of legislation is lacking there is high level of non compliance with the permit conditions as indicated by our survey that shows that about 76 of respondents do not comply with their permit conditions seventy percent of the respondents indicated that their allocated quotas were not sufficient to fulfil their crop production requirement climate change is affecting agricultural activities and the farmers need to abstract more water to save the crops and ensure not losing on investments therefore abstracting more groundwater than their allocated quota will enable them to meet their irrigation needs with high investments in the irrigation sector many farmers are unwilling to compromise on their investment by reducing production climate change threatens the livelihood of many namibians with high temperatures affecting crop harvests especially in the communal areas turpie et al 2010 during the survey frequent dry spells and high temperatures were identified as contributing factors to many farmers irrigating their crops more often in an effort to save the crops from heat irrigation farmers claimed that during high temperatures crop growth can be affected which can also affect production therefore irrigating more often is seen as a solution higher irrigation levels usually occur during the day when the temperature is at its highest eighty six percent of the respondents use centre pivot as an irrigation method fig 5 respondents view centre pivot irrigation as consuming less water than the flood irrigation method and view it as the most suitable irrigation method for maize cultivation however if farmers irrigated at night it would be more cost effective as electricity charges are lower and it would also save water as evaporation is lower than during the daytime 5 3 current land use practices and willingness of respondents to implement alternatives the gto wca is predominantly agricultural with the highest number of irrigation farms in namibia located in this area approximately 43 of the respondents farm with maize as their main crop table 4 the majority of these respondents practice crop rotation and irrigate throughout the year according to the dwaf application form for irrigation crop rotation is not considered in the applications for groundwater abstraction and applicants do not indicate that either which is why respondents claim that their allocated quota is below the required amount water is allocated at 10 000m³ ha a if a farmer wants to irrigate 10 ha and the farmer gets a permitted allocation of 10 10 000 100 000 m³ and the farmer wants to plant two crops per annum then the farmer can only cultivate 5 ha at a time but the farmers do not follow this concept and irrigate the entire size of the field permit conditions must be enforced by a competent resource manager that protects the groundwater resources by enforcing the law most farms especially in the sub region b2 and g have been divided into smaller portions making them unproductive for dryland cropping and also unsuitable for livestock farming the majority of these portions of their land are cultivated with 41 of farmers cultivating between 30 and 70 of their land and with 35 cultivating more than 80 of their land approximately 65 of respondents are not willing to introduce crops that are less water intensive as the type of crops they are cultivating is determined by the market the majority of the farmers are diversifying into cash crops to grow the business but about 68 of respondents are willing to implement alternative land uses if water availability in the area deteriorates they are however only willing to implement alternative land uses once groundwater has been depleted to a point that irrigation cannot take place 6 conclusion groundwater is a finite resource and needs an integrated approach between the user the planners and the managers to ensure its sustainable management this study showed that groundwater use allocation permits in the grootfontein tsumeb otavi subterranean water control area in namibia are higher than the sustainable safe yield of these aquifers and the actual permitted water use for irrigation is in most in stances higher than the current sustainable use this non alignment between water availability permit allocation and water abstraction is due to a complex mixture of amongst others knowledge gaps on water availability and abstraction officials manage water based on outdated data and models of more than 15 years old and the fact that institutions and the legal framework is not yet adapted to current iwrm requirements the policies and legislation in namibia have not changed much since the water act of 1956 and this lack of change has hampered sustainable water resources management blackie and tarr 2000 existing legislation that incorporates iwrm the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 and its regulations and guidelines are not being enforced by the dwaf to control water abstractions and allocations possibly because all the regulations under the wrma of 2013 namibia 2013 have not yet been promulgated this survey confirms a high level of non compliance to regulations by the farmers in the area in addition the groundwater model for managing water resources the area has not been updated making the decision by dwaf to increase water allocations in the area unsafe and unwise current water use is not included in the groundwater model resulting in a poor understanding of water availability for future expansion there are no punitive measures for non compliance making compliance voluntary instead of compulsory a lack of financial resources has also been hampering compliance monitoring and enforcement in the area high water abstraction in karst aquifers during drought conditions when aquifer recharge does not occur to the degree that it should can however irreversibly damage the aquifer structure and water storage capacity linares et al 2017 as well as the aquifer s ability to transmit water león and parise 2009 groundwater over abstraction in karst aquifers can also lead to the formation of sinkholes and land subsidence linares et al 2017 groundwater abstraction in this region is not sustainable under the current climatic conditions where severe droughts have been experienced from the 2012 13 to the 2015 16 seasons with the 2015 16 season being the driest on record since the droughts of the early 1980s and 1990s archer et al 2017 from the above study it is clear that there is a general lack of sustainable aquifer management and unsustainable aquifer abstraction the following recommendations are made for consideration to improve the sustainable management of the aquifers in the gto wca there are various knowledge gaps in the gto wca specific issues that must be addressed include o there is a lack of updated groundwater information for the gto wca to address this knowledge gap which creates uncertainty in understanding the system and which ultimately leads to uncertainty in how to manage the gto wca groundwater data must be updated o as part of addressing knowledge gaps the ministry of agriculture water and forestry must commission a study to determine the crop water requirement in the country particularly in the gto wca this would help resource managers when allocating irrigation quotas to irrigation farmers o the geohydrology division at dwaf must develop a crop water requirement model and update the groundwater model once the knowledge gaps on groundwater availability water use and crop water requirements have been addressed this will enable the gto wca to gain an understanding of minimum crop water requirements and water availability under current water use conditions thereby ensuring more sustainable water use on an institutional level adaptive management approaches must be implemented to address uncertainties in data and water resources management more effectively van der voorn et al 2012 2017 pahl wostl et al 2008 the following specific institutional challenges must be addressed o the regulatory framework under the water resources management act of 2013 for water resources management in namibia must be finalised outstanding regulations under the wrma 2013 must be promulgated to ensure that provisions under the wrma are legally binding this will ensure that iwrm practices currently implemented in the gto wca are aligned with institutional arrangements and will ensure that iwrm is better implemented at the gto wca the iwrm plan should also be actively endorsed and implemented in the water resources management sector as part of iwrm aspects such as water demand management increased artificial recharge and better water resources use monitoring must be further developed to address climate change concerns o the resource managers from dwaf must perform monitoring on the farms that are not complying with permit conditions and also do regulatory spot checks to verify data that is reported to the dwaf if it is correct this monitoring must form part of the overall monitoring for the implementation of adaptive management o the bmc office must be strengthened by including a hydrogeologist in the structure of the bmc to ensure that a knowledgeable individual in groundwater subjects manages matters of groundwater in the area o the kwmb must be re established to more effectively monitor water use and allow the kwmb to influence water allocations this will ensure the effective concentration of resources and management options for water management during integrated water resources management currently the bmc is less effective in managing groundwater allocations and in conducting compliance monitoring than the kwmb was as they lack key competencies o the legislation and policies by geohydrology division must be amended so that the management of karst aquifers including the allocation of abstraction quotas is clearly addressed dwaf should increase human resource capacity and capacitate existing staff to effectively monitor and manage the water resources in the gto wca o information sharing to the farmers must be improved to change incorrect perceptions about groundwater availability and to promote sustainable groundwater use o a water payment or tax system must be implemented in the area if users pay for the water incentives of cheaper payment or lower taxes per volume of water used can be introduced for users who introduce crops that are less water intensive o water inspectors must be re introduced in the directorate of water resources management structures with an aim to improve and conduct effective compliance monitoring the current structure gives the role of water policing to technicians and administrative officers who are not fully capacitated to deal with law enforcement matters o resource managers should encourage farmers and all other water users to do resource monitoring that includes water level measurements water quality testing and meter readings from the abstraction boreholes as indicated in the permit condition this would enable the water users to understand the status of groundwater in their area over a long period o the water resources managers should raise awareness on a regular basis to create good relationships between them and the water users this would enable the water user to gain trust in the resource managers o there should be a separation of powers between the water sector and the agricultural sector currently the two sectors are headed by one minister and most attention is given to food security and not much attention is given to water security this is shown in the annual budget given to the two departments whereby the agriculture department get a disproportionately higher budget than the water department lastly on a strategic level future water resources management planning must be done for the gto wca to address external pressures on this water system such as climate change that will impact long term water availability in the gto wca this can be done by performing scenario analysis where an updated groundwater model can contribute tremendously as well as by implementing adaptive management am to incrementally change water resources management policies van der voorn et al 2012 pahl wostl et al 2008 to ensure effective am proper assessment of the current gto wca situation is required followed by policy alignment updating the water act and regulatory framework and aligning it with current iwrm practices the implementation of an adapted water resources management plan and monitoring of all newly implemented systems to adapt water resources management if and where required for instance in response to climate change is also necessary the uncertainties in the gto wca knowledge gaps inaccurate allocation of permits high levels of non compliance with permit conditions and high levels of water abstraction from the karst aquifers linked with an unwillingness to implement alternative land uses boils down to groundwater mining if the water resources policy and institutional arrangements are not more effectively aligned with iwrm and if water resource managers do not perform their duties in the national interest to protect the groundwater resources over the longer term irrigation farming will not be able to continue in this area and will go bankrupt karst aquifers in this region may then only recover in time if the aquifer structure has not been irreversibly damaged in addition the karst water in this region must also be reserved for supply to the central area of namibia in future which will become drier in future due to climate change the namibian government must therefore prevent karst aquifers from being destroyed by mismanagement declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data the following

12129,groundwater resources play the single most important role in the delivery of potable water to rural communities in northern ghana especially during the long dry season and where surface water sources are polluted or non existent this study sought to assess the quality and main controls on groundwater chemistry in parts of sawla tuna kalba district in the savannah region of ghana multivariate statistical analysis and conventional hydrochemical plots were employed in the analysis of 112 groundwater samples from the study area conventional graphical methods r mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca identified dissolution of silicates and the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters as the main sources of variations in the hydrochemistry in the study area q mode hca coupled with stiff diagrams identified ca hco3 water type in recharge areas and mg ca hco3 water type which evolves into a ca na k hco3 water type in discharge areas in the groundwater flow regime mineral stability diagrams indicate the groundwater is stable in kaolinite which suggests little or no restricted groundwater flow conditions groundwater quality for domestic purposes was assessed using the weighted arithmetic index approach the computed water quality indices wqis from the data suggest that 94 of the sampled boreholes provide groundwater of excellent quality for drinking purposes whereas 5 and 1 present water of good and poor quality respectively spatial interpolation of the estimated wqis suggests the quality of the groundwater in the study area is suitable for domestic purposes the assessment of the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes suggests the water is of excellent to permissible quality and may be used for irrigation without prior treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sawla tuna kalba hydrochemical analysis groundwater quality geostatistics 1 introduction groundwater is being adopted as a preferable source of potable water supply in arid and semi arid climates this is due to its minimal treatment requirements spatial availability and capacity to balance large rainfall variability as well as associated water demands during droughts and when surface water resources exceed their sustainable levels treidel et al 2012 bloomfield et al 2019 a comprehensive groundwater assessment must reflect the several factors and processes influencing groundwater chemistry in space and time and is prerequisite to fully understanding the groundwater system for a proper management of the resource in this regard researchers have adopted several strategies to assess the several sources of variation in groundwater chemistry most of these studies are well documented in literature e g saana et al 2016 hwang et al 2017 telahigue et al 2018 boateng et al 2019 sunkari et al 2019 advanced geostatistical techniques for instance have been at the forefront in this regard in recent times especially in hydrochemical studies where they have been used to characterise groundwater flow regimes discriminate hydrochemical facies make predictions at unsampled locations generate statistical models identify sources of variations and characterise groundwater evolution adomako 2011 jing and yufei 2011 kumar et al 2011 yidana et al 2011 2012a nur et al 2012 sarukkalige 2012 hassan 2014 sharma et al 2015 abanyie et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 in an attempt to assess the main sources of hydrochemical variation and suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes kumar et al 2011 employed factor analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca and geospatial techniques on major physicochemical parameters in the palar river basin india their study concluded that effluent discharge in the palar river basin degraded groundwater quality in the northeast and southeast parts of the river basin and groundwater along such areas were unsuitable for drinking hca when combined with conventional graphical techniques can help explain the evolution of groundwater and the minerals dissolved in it as it moves through the rock matrix belkhiri et al 2011 demonstrated this when they employed q mode hca to distinguish recharge zones from discharge areas in the groundwater flow regime in the ain azel plain algeria geostatistical techniques offer a wide array of powerful statistical models and tools to effectively explore and analyse hydrochemical data however employing these techniques requires an in depth understanding of the prevailing environmental conditions in the study area such as geology hydrogeology topography weather conditions and dominant anthropogenic activities geostatistical techniques have been employed extensively in groundwater studies in ghana for instance with the aim of unveiling the key factors influencing fluoride concentrations in some parts of northern region ghana yidana et al 2012a utilised principal component analysis pca coupled with cluster analysis to explain the hydrochemistry and factors influencing fluoride enrichment and other ions of the groundwater in the middle voltaian aquifers they also adequately distinguished the various facies in the groundwater flow regime using q mode hca furthermore sunkari et al 2019 combined multivariate statistics and mass balance techniques to assess the drivers of groundwater chemistry in ga west ghana their study revealed silicate and carbonate weathering seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities as the main controls on groundwater chemistry in the district other similar studies in ghana are well documented in helstrup et al 2007 banoeng yakubo et al 2009 yidana et al 2010 loh et al 2016 abanyie et al 2018 it follows therefore that when applied properly with adequate knowledge of the terrain geostatistical techniques can be used to satisfactorily characterise groundwater systems this study adopts similar methodology in addition to conventional and mass balance hydrochemical models to unveil the relationships among water parameters and the main influence on groundwater chemistry from the basement aquifers in the sawla tuna kalba district in northern ghana as well as assesses its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes 2 study area the study area fig 1 is located in the western part of the savannah region of ghana it lies between latitudes 8 40 and 9 40 north and longitudes 1 50 and 2 45 west the study area shares common boundaries with wa west and wa east districts to the north bole district to the south west gonja and north gonja districts to the east and la cote d ivoire and burkina faso to the west it has a total land area of about 4226 9 km2 and a population of 99 863 ghana statistical service 2010 generally the topography of the study area is undulating with elevation ranging between 245 m and 350 m the black volta river runs through the study area along the western border and drains the area through several tributaries and streams the area lies within the tropical continental climate and generally is one of the driest parts of the country it experiences a single rainfall season that occurs between early may and late october with the highest rainfall experienced between august and september dickson and benneh 1995 relative humidity is high during the rainy season 65 85 but may fall to as low as 20 during the dry season monthly mean rainfall ranges between 200 mm and 300 mm with an annual average of about 1100 mm sawla tuna kalba district assembly 2014 2 1 geology and hydrogeology the study area is principally underlain by about 80 birimian rocks with the other 20 being granitoids and kwahu morago group of the voltaian supergroup fig 2 the birimian consists of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks which form five subparallel belts of volcanic rock separated by broad basins of sedimentary rocks kesse 1985 rocks of the birimian supergroup have been divided into metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks junner 1935 1940 bates 1955 the birimian metasedimentary are made up of greywackes with turbidite features phyllites slates schists weakly metamorphosed tuffs and sandstones whiles the birimian metavolcanics comprise rock types such as lava flows and dyke rocks of basaltic and andesitic composition most of these rocks have now been metamorphosed to hornblende actinolite schists calcareous chlorite schists and amphibolites kesse 1985 the birimian supergroup is intruded by granitoids of the eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites in ghana four main types of granitoids are recognized to be associated with the birimian supergroup these include the winneba bongo dixcove and the cape coast type granites the cape coast and dixcove granites are seen to be present in the current study area the cape coast type granitoids occur only within the birimian metasediments this group also includes gneisses which are especially well developed in the metasediments banoeng yakubu et al 2011 dixcove type granitoids are metaluminous and typically dioritic to granodioritic in composition and intrude the birimian metavolcanic rocks they are typically hornblende bearing and are commonly associated with gold mineralisation where they occur as small plutons within the volcanic belts kesse 1985 the granitoids are massive in outcrop do not have a compositional banding or foliation and are thus generally considered post deformation banoeng yakubu et al 2011 the kwahu morago group of the voltaian supergroup consist mainly of sandstone which are white medium grained cross bedded flaggy and quartzose hydrogeologically the study area falls within three main hydrogeological provinces namely birimian province voltaian province and crystalline basement granitoid complex province dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 groundwater in the birimian province occurs mainly in the saprolite saprock and in the fractured bedrock the most productive zones in terms of groundwater delivery in the birimian province comprise the lower part of the saprolite and the upper part of the saprock which usually complement each other in terms of permeability and storage carrier et al 2008 the upper less permeable part of the saprolite can act as a semi confining layer for this productive zone while the lower usually saturated part of the saprolite is characterised by lower secondary clay content thus creating a zone of enhanced hydraulic conductivity banoeng yakubu et al 2011 generally areas underlain by the birimian rocks display deeper weathering than areas underlain by the granitoids banoeng yakubo 1989 identified three types of basement aquifers these are the weathered rock aquifers which are fracture related the fractured quartz vein aquifers and the fractured unweathered aquifers banoeng yakubu et al 2011 underscored that in the birimian province aquifers the saprolitic zone is a combination of the topsoil the underlying lateritic soil the highly weathered zone and the moderately weathered zone successful boreholes drilled through the rocks of the birimian and the tarkwaian range between 35 and 55 m with an average of 42 m agyekum 2004 carrier et al 2008 also recorded borehole depth in a similar range of 35 and 55 m with an average of 50 m in the granitoids data collated from wri csir shows that the depth to water table falls within 4 37 m with an average of 21 m there is no well defined local groundwater flow regime however the groundwater flow within the study area follows the regional flow regime which is from north to south and to a large extent toward the south western parts of the study area the aquifer transmissivity of the productive zones of the birimian province has been reported by banoeng yakubu et al 2011 to range between 0 2 m2 d and 119 m2 d with an average of 7 4 m2 d the kwahu morago group which is composed of yabraso sandstone formation has been identified as good aquifer zone based on available data from drilling projects within the area the basement rocks are characterised by little or no primary porosity and therefore the hydrogeology of the area is controlled by secondary permeabilities resulting from weathering and fracturing of the rock which has enhanced the storage and transmissive properties of the rocks to form groundwater reservoirs darko et al 2006 yidana et al 2012b 3 methodology data of groundwater samples collected from boreholes in the study area were obtained from hydronomics ghana limited in accra standard protocols for water sampling and storage as prescribed in apha 2005 usgs 2006 and canada ccme 2011 were adopted one hundred and twelve 112 samples collected 500 ml in pre cleaned sterilized poly propylene plastic bottles were stored in cool boxes about 3 c and transported to the water research institute of the council for scientific and industrial research wri csir laboratory for major and trace cations and anions analyses whiles ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature were determined on the field with the aid of a multi parameter portable meter peli 1521 from hanna instruments in the laboratory the samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator for about a week before they were analysed different methods i e gravimetric tds titrimetric ca total hardness alkalinity spadns f turbidimetric so4 2 argentometric cl atomic absorption spectrometry as mn fe hco3 flame photometry k na mg2 hydrazine reduction no3 stannous chloride po4 2 were used to analyse the major minor and trace elements the dataset was subjected to an internal consistency test using the charge balance error cbe to test its accuracy equation 1 a charge balance error value within 5 is generally acceptable and shows that the laboratory analysis of the parameters are a good balance of the cations and anions appelo and postma 2005 in view of this samples that recoded cbe values above 5 were dropped from the analysis 1 c b e mc zc ma za mc zc ma za 100 where m c and m a and z c and z a are respectively molar concentrations of major cations and anions and charges of cations and anions similarly the resulting datasets were subjected to normality test since optimal multivariate statistical analyses assume gaussian distribution of datasets datasets that were not normally distributed were log transformed and or standardised to their z score equation 2 values 2 z x μ s where x μ and s are respectively the measured value mean and standard deviation of the parameter the transformed datasets were subjected to r mode and q mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca the q mode hca is used to discriminate the spatial associations or evolution of the groundwater into various types in space and or time whereas r mode is used to determine and rank the sources of variation in the hydrochemistry although several similarity dissimilarity and agglomerative techniques are available in hca the squared euclidean distance and ward s agglomeration method were employed in this study since a combination of these two have been identified to yield the best outcomes in hca davis 1986 yidana et al 2010 2012a for significant and optimal stochastic analysis parameters with large missing datasets such as f fe mn and as in most cases were excluded from the cluster analysis principal component analysis pca was also applied to the dataset to identify the main controls on groundwater chemistry pca is a data dimension reduction technique that reveals the significant components factors to aid interpretation of a large set of data and to visualise the correlations between the variables and hopefully be able to limit the number of variables pca was performed using the correlation matrix which brings the measurements onto a common scale and the principal components sorted in a diminishing order of variance such that the most important principal components are listed first to ensure that the extracted components did not correlate with each other an orthogonal varimax rotation technique was used assertions made in relation to the hydrochemical associations and processes based on the multivariate statistical techniques were supported by employing conventional hydrochemical plots and mineral stability diagrams to further establish the main controls on groundwater chemistry and to identify the most stable mineral phases in the groundwater flow system the quality of the groundwater was also assessed for drinking and irrigation purposes quality assessment for domestic purposes was based on a modified form of the water quality index wqi approach sahu and sikdar 2008 which is a weighted arithmetic index method the resultant water quality indices estimated from this method were spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting idw technique in order to minimise the errors associated with the spatial prediction the interpolation was limited to places in the study area with optimal sample point distribution such that places with little no sample points were excluded from the interpolation irrigation quality of the groundwater on the other hand was assessed using the wilcox 1955 and united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagrams 4 results and discussions the statistical summaries of the analysed parameters are presented in table 1 most of the major chemical parameters display high ranges of variance suggesting variable sources and factors influence and contribute to the concentration of these parameters of the groundwater in the study area generally concentrations of the major chemical parameters are within the acceptable who recommended ranges for potable water who 2017 however there are a few cases where some hydrochemical parameters which mostly occur as outliers fall outside the acceptable who 2017 ranges for potable water one instance is the occurrence of high fluoride levels recorded in some parts of gindabo and tuna in the central sections of the study area which may be associated with the leaching and weathering of fluorite and or the influence of alkaline water types in the area alkaline waters have been reported to retard the adsorption of fluoride onto the surfaces of clay minerals viero et al 2009 ph presents the least variance among the major chemical parameters and has ranges falling outside 5 87 9 99 the who 2017 recommended range of 6 5 8 5 signifying a slightly acidic to slightly alkaline groundwater system 4 1 assessment of the main sources of variation in groundwater chemistry results of pearson correlation r analysis are presented in table 2 correlation analysis provides a quick way to visualise the relations between two parameters for purposes of drawing inferences it is obvious from the results that the main contributors to ec in the study area are ca2 na hco3 so4 2 cl and f since these parameters have significant correlations 0 50 with ec similarly bicarbonate shows significant relation with na and ca2 which is consistent with silicate weathering freeze and cherry 1979 and possibly influenced by precipitation r mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca have been used to further unearth the main chemical processes controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area the dendrogram fig 3 for the r mode cluster analysis presents the visual associations among the parameters with a phenon line drawn at a linkage distance of about 22 although the definition of clusters based on the distance of the phenon line is subjective it is informed by the researcher s understanding of the combining environmental factors such as the geology hydrogeology and human activities which prevail in the study area and are likely to affect the chemistry of groundwater yidana et al 2012a the phenon line is drawn such that too many or too few clusters are not generated since the interpretation might be difficult defeating the purpose of cluster analysis or some important hydrochemical processes might be omitted notwithstanding the semi objectivity two clusters were generated which represent two main groundwater associations and or processes cluster 1 consists of na ca2 ec hco3 ph k mg and sio2 which represents the dominance of rock water interaction dominated by dissolution of silicate minerals in the rocks of the area the close association of ec ca2 hco3 na and ph in cluster 1a suggests the dissolution of feldspars in the sandstones found in the study area the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and precipitation and possibly within the soil zone results in the formation of carbonic acid which dissolves such minerals during infiltration thereby releasing hco3 and the associated ions cluster 1b on the other hand consists of sio2 k and mg2 at a much shorter linkage distance than cluster 1a and therefore presents the most similar members of the same cluster given the shorter linkage distance yidana et al 2011 relative to cluster 1a and cluster 2 cluster 1b probably represents silicate mineral weathering especially micas such as biotite which are also present in the study area sawla tuna kalba district assembly 2014 the second cluster links no3 so4 2 and cl cluster 2 represents the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters which are common pollutants of groundwater in agrarian settlements such as the study area han et al 2016 results of principal component analysis pca revealed two main components just like the r mode cluster analysis and these accounted for about 70 of the total variance in the hydrochemistry table 3 the factors were extracted based on variables with communalities of 0 5 and above kaiser 1960 and variables below the set lower limit such as k po4 2 as mn and fe were excluded from the analysis communalities measure the proportion of each variable s variance that can be explained by the factors therefore variables which loaded highly with more than one component such as mg2 and ph were dropped since these variables had duplicate effects and could not be used to explain a particular unique process in the hydrochemistry the first component which accounts for over 40 of the total variance in groundwater chemistry in the study area has high positive loadings for hco3 ec na ca2 and high negative loading for sio2 it can be deduced from the correlation analysis hca and pca that component 1 represents the dissolution of silicates particularly the feldspars in the sandstones underlying the area thus confirming the findings from cluster 1a fig 3 the negative loading of sio2 with component 1 also suggests that the silica in the groundwater does not contribute significantly to the electrical conductivity which is in line with the results of the correlation analyses table 2 a plot of na versus cl fig 4 suggests that the dissolution of halite is not the main source of na in the groundwater and thus the dissolution of silicate minerals could be the source of this ion in the groundwater the strong correlation between f and na r 0 69 as shown in table 2 possibly suggests the dissolution of minerals such as villiaumite and fluorapatite which are common constituents of the bedrock of the study area yidana et al 2012a component 2 on the other hand loads highly with cl so4 2 and no3 and represents the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters as these ions are common constituents of such pollutants since the study area is composed mainly of agrarian communities with farming practices which involves the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers such as manure and npk groundwater is likely to be polluted by such chemicals in the study area cobbina et al 2012 q mode hca resulted in a dendrogram fig 6 showing three main spatial associations in the hydrochemistry in the study area average concentrations from the three clusters are presented with stiff diagrams fig 7 generally aquifers of the birimian deliver groundwater of low ionic concentrations since their hydrochemistry is mainly influenced by silicate mineral weathering yidana et al 2012a notwithstanding the three clusters exhibit varying degrees of ionic concentrations and suggest a flow pattern in the groundwater system it is obvious from fig 7 that on the average cluster 1 presents the least mineralised groundwater system cluster 1 is mainly composed of samples from around kong sooma jilinkon nahari and grungu which are generally high elevation locations in the study area fig 5 conversely cluster 3 presents the highest mean concentration of the major ions and tds and is found at locations with low elevations such as babalayurin degwiwu kalba and generally the south western portions of the study area whereas cluster 2 occurs between clusters 1 and 3 fig 5 in recharge areas the concentration of ions in groundwater is usually low and similar to the precipitation in the area but as the water travels through the subsurface and dissolves minerals and other materials its ionic content increases with time this explains why clusters 1 and 3 have been designated as recharge and discharge zones respectively consistent with topographically driven groundwater flow fitts 2002 whereas cluster 2 samples are considered to represent a transition between clusters 1 and 3 this is clearly demonstrated by the stiff diagrams in fig 7 it is apparent from the stiff diagrams fig 7 that cluster 1 is a ca mg hco3 water type whereas cluster 2 is mg ca hco3 water type which evolves into a ca na k hco3 water type in cluster 3 the dissolution of villiaumite and fluorapatite is plausible when the water had enough time to interact with the rocks as it evolves towards discharge areas thus increasing the concentration of na in those areas similar water types were identified by cobbina et al 2012 in the voltaian and basement aquifers in the savannah region this is in tandem with the assertions made above from table 3 and fig 4 that dissolution of silicates plays a significant role explaining over 40 of the total variance in groundwater chemistry in the study area a gibbs 1970 diagram plotted for all three clusters clearly indicates rock dominance as the main source of the dissolved ions in groundwater from the study area fig 8 however the hydrochemistry of cluster 1 samples is largely influenced by the chemistry of precipitation in the area which is characteristically low in dissolved ions and high in bicarbonate as a result of the co2 charged rainfall although samples from clusters 2 and 3 plot within the rock dominance section it can be seen that samples from cluster 3 plot much closer to rock dominance evaporation crystallization line than the rock dominance precipitation line this supports the argument that waters from cluster 3 are more enriched in dissolved ions as a result of the longer interaction of the groundwater with the rock matrix generally groundwater from the study area is clearly a mixed cation fresh water type dominated by bicarbonate hco3 so4 cl as demonstrated by the stiff diagrams fig 7 durov 1948 diagram has been used to discriminate the hydrochemistry further from fig 9 it is apparent that most of the groundwater samples 42 are dominated by ca hco3 implying the dominance of alkaline earths over alkali thus ca mg na k whereas 36 and 20 are respectively mg hco3 and na k hco3 fresh water types cluster 3 samples plot closer to the na k field and further away from the ca and mg fields with corresponding high tds and ph values fig 9 confirming that these waters have had longer time to interact with the rock matrix and the surrounding environment the low ph values mainly contributed from precipitation as seen in cluster 1 samples are neutralized as the water interacts and dissolves the rock material as it transits the recharge zones and evolves into a more ionically enriched water in cluster 3 the mineral stability diagrams for nao al2o3 sio2 h2o and al2o3 sio2 h2o are presented in fig 10 both plots indicate that the most stable silicate phase in the aquifers is kaolinite indicating the incongruent weathering of silicate minerals such as biotite and muscovite and suggests that the groundwater in the aquifer is relatively young to intermediate in its flow regime and age this implies that there is little or no restricted groundwater flow such that the residence time is not long enough to allow for significant silica leaching into the groundwater edet and okereke 2005 yidana et al 2008a b loh et al 2016 4 2 groundwater quality evaluation for domestic use the quality of the groundwater has further been examined for its potability using the water quality index wqi approach modified after brown et al 1972 this approach is a weighted arithmetic approach which involves a series of steps to arrive at a single value index which describes the overall quality of water in space and time the suitability of groundwater in this study was based on the standards set by the world health organisation who 2017 for domestic drinking water in the first step water quality parameters of concern are assigned weights wi based on their importance and health implications when present in drinking water f no3 and as were assigned a maximum of 5 based on their relative importance in drinking water the rest of the parameters ph tds th ca2 mg2 na k ci so4 2 po4 3 fe and mn were assigned weights of 1 5 also based on their relative importance and health implications when present in drinking water secondly the relative weight wi of each parameter was computed as a fraction of the total weights computed from the fifteen parameters table 4 based on equation 3 3 wi wi wi lastly a quality rating scale qi was calculated for each parameter by dividing its concentration by the set objective who standard and multiplying by 100 equation 4 4 qi ci si 100 where ci and si are respectively parameter concentration and set objective the sub index and wqi are determined respectively using equations 5 and 6 5 si wi qi 6 wqi n 1 n si the calculated wqis are categorised according to sahu and sikdar 2008 as excellent water wqi 50 good water wqi 50 100 poor water wqi 100 200 very poor water wqi 200 300 and unsuitable for drinking wqi 300 the computed wqis have been spatially interpolated based on an inverse distance weighting idw technique which proved to be the most appropriate interpolation technique as a result of the smallest root mean square error associated with it rmse 0 852 the output was reclassified according to sahu and sikdar 2008 fig 11 the estimated wqis ranged from 16 64 to 132 15 with about 94 of the water classified as being excellent for drinking purposes whereas 5 and 1 are considered good and poor quality respectively fig 11 the poor water arises from two samples stkd 086 and stkd 93 located at sawla and soomia which are characterised by elevated levels of fluoride arsenic and fe these samples generally have high tds values and the contamination could be attributed to localised leaching of such ions into the groundwater system 4 3 assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes the presence of sodium ion in groundwater is of grave concern due to its ability to affect the permeability of soil as well as offset the osmotic pressure of plants an offset in the osmotic pressure of the plants affects the rate of water intake by plant roots and its subsequent use in the process of photosynthesis high concentrations of na in soil therefore affect the metabolism of the plants and this can translate negatively to crop yield mohan et al 2000 zaidi et al 2015 saleh et al 1999 concluded that excessively high salinity waters also have the tendency to affect the ability of the plants to absorb nutrients and water fig 12 is based on the united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 which represents a plot of sodium adsorption ratio sar against ec salinity all the samples from the study area plotted within the low sodicity s1 region and low to high salinity ranges c1 c3 about 18 of the samples fell within c1 s1 low salinity low sodicity and are mainly composed of waters from cluster 1 members of the q mode hca samples from cluster 1 have been categorised as recharge zones and have low ionic content most of the samples 72 plotted within the c2 s1 region medium salinity low sodicity irrigation waters whereas only 6 of the samples plot within c3 s1 all three regions present water of good quality and may be used for irrigation without prior treatment this assertion is corroborated by the wilcox 1955 plot in which all the water samples plot in excellent to permissible category it is obvious from figs 12 and 13 that the salinity of the groundwater in the study area increases as the water travels from recharge cluster 1 to discharge cluster 3 areas cluster 1 samples are typically low in both sodium and salinity as a result of the short residence time and interaction with the geology cluster 2 samples appear to present the best balance of sodium and salinity ranges sar 1 5 and ec 500 900 μ cm banoeng yakubo et al 2009 and hence have the best quality for irrigation but as the groundwater interacts and dissolves the rock matrix alongside getting polluted by anthropogenic sources such as agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters its quality for irrigation deteriorates as seen in cluster 3 samples fig 12 5 conclusion the key factors controlling groundwater chemistry and quality in some voltaian and basement aquifers in portions of sawla tuna kalba district northern ghana have been assessed statistical techniques such as hca pca and correlation analysis coupled with conventional hydrochemical plots suggests the dissolution of silicate minerals particularly feldspars and micas in the rocks as well as the influence of agrochemicals and domestic waste as the main factors controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area even though silicate mineral weathering was identified as the dominant process controlling the groundwater chemical composition the concentration of sio2 is low and did not contribute significantly to the ec mineral speciation calculations derived from the analysis also suggests that the most stable silicate mineral phase is kaolinite which suggests that groundwater in the area is at intermediate stage and flow is not restricted mainly due to the occurrence and pervasiveness of secondary permeability q mode hca identified three 3 groundwater flow regimes in the study area recharge zones cluster 1 located in high elevated areas characterised by low tds and dominated by ca hco3 water type transition zones cluster 2 dominated by mg ca hco3 water type and ca na k hco3 water type cluster 3 in discharge areas also groundwater quality for domestic purposes was assessed using a weighted arithmetic index approach the computed water quality indices wqis from the data suggest that 94 of the sampled wells provide groundwater of excellent quality for drinking purposes whereas 5 and 1 present water of good and poor quality respectively the poor quality presented by some of the wells is attributed to elevated levels of fluoride arsenic fe and tds and may have resulted from the leaching of such ions into the groundwater the study also finds groundwater in the area to be permissible for irrigation based on the ussl and wilcox plots funding this work was supported by the catholic missions government of ghana project declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no

12129,groundwater resources play the single most important role in the delivery of potable water to rural communities in northern ghana especially during the long dry season and where surface water sources are polluted or non existent this study sought to assess the quality and main controls on groundwater chemistry in parts of sawla tuna kalba district in the savannah region of ghana multivariate statistical analysis and conventional hydrochemical plots were employed in the analysis of 112 groundwater samples from the study area conventional graphical methods r mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca identified dissolution of silicates and the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters as the main sources of variations in the hydrochemistry in the study area q mode hca coupled with stiff diagrams identified ca hco3 water type in recharge areas and mg ca hco3 water type which evolves into a ca na k hco3 water type in discharge areas in the groundwater flow regime mineral stability diagrams indicate the groundwater is stable in kaolinite which suggests little or no restricted groundwater flow conditions groundwater quality for domestic purposes was assessed using the weighted arithmetic index approach the computed water quality indices wqis from the data suggest that 94 of the sampled boreholes provide groundwater of excellent quality for drinking purposes whereas 5 and 1 present water of good and poor quality respectively spatial interpolation of the estimated wqis suggests the quality of the groundwater in the study area is suitable for domestic purposes the assessment of the groundwater quality for irrigation purposes suggests the water is of excellent to permissible quality and may be used for irrigation without prior treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords sawla tuna kalba hydrochemical analysis groundwater quality geostatistics 1 introduction groundwater is being adopted as a preferable source of potable water supply in arid and semi arid climates this is due to its minimal treatment requirements spatial availability and capacity to balance large rainfall variability as well as associated water demands during droughts and when surface water resources exceed their sustainable levels treidel et al 2012 bloomfield et al 2019 a comprehensive groundwater assessment must reflect the several factors and processes influencing groundwater chemistry in space and time and is prerequisite to fully understanding the groundwater system for a proper management of the resource in this regard researchers have adopted several strategies to assess the several sources of variation in groundwater chemistry most of these studies are well documented in literature e g saana et al 2016 hwang et al 2017 telahigue et al 2018 boateng et al 2019 sunkari et al 2019 advanced geostatistical techniques for instance have been at the forefront in this regard in recent times especially in hydrochemical studies where they have been used to characterise groundwater flow regimes discriminate hydrochemical facies make predictions at unsampled locations generate statistical models identify sources of variations and characterise groundwater evolution adomako 2011 jing and yufei 2011 kumar et al 2011 yidana et al 2011 2012a nur et al 2012 sarukkalige 2012 hassan 2014 sharma et al 2015 abanyie et al 2018 sunkari et al 2019 in an attempt to assess the main sources of hydrochemical variation and suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes kumar et al 2011 employed factor analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca and geospatial techniques on major physicochemical parameters in the palar river basin india their study concluded that effluent discharge in the palar river basin degraded groundwater quality in the northeast and southeast parts of the river basin and groundwater along such areas were unsuitable for drinking hca when combined with conventional graphical techniques can help explain the evolution of groundwater and the minerals dissolved in it as it moves through the rock matrix belkhiri et al 2011 demonstrated this when they employed q mode hca to distinguish recharge zones from discharge areas in the groundwater flow regime in the ain azel plain algeria geostatistical techniques offer a wide array of powerful statistical models and tools to effectively explore and analyse hydrochemical data however employing these techniques requires an in depth understanding of the prevailing environmental conditions in the study area such as geology hydrogeology topography weather conditions and dominant anthropogenic activities geostatistical techniques have been employed extensively in groundwater studies in ghana for instance with the aim of unveiling the key factors influencing fluoride concentrations in some parts of northern region ghana yidana et al 2012a utilised principal component analysis pca coupled with cluster analysis to explain the hydrochemistry and factors influencing fluoride enrichment and other ions of the groundwater in the middle voltaian aquifers they also adequately distinguished the various facies in the groundwater flow regime using q mode hca furthermore sunkari et al 2019 combined multivariate statistics and mass balance techniques to assess the drivers of groundwater chemistry in ga west ghana their study revealed silicate and carbonate weathering seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities as the main controls on groundwater chemistry in the district other similar studies in ghana are well documented in helstrup et al 2007 banoeng yakubo et al 2009 yidana et al 2010 loh et al 2016 abanyie et al 2018 it follows therefore that when applied properly with adequate knowledge of the terrain geostatistical techniques can be used to satisfactorily characterise groundwater systems this study adopts similar methodology in addition to conventional and mass balance hydrochemical models to unveil the relationships among water parameters and the main influence on groundwater chemistry from the basement aquifers in the sawla tuna kalba district in northern ghana as well as assesses its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes 2 study area the study area fig 1 is located in the western part of the savannah region of ghana it lies between latitudes 8 40 and 9 40 north and

comprise rock types such as lava flows and dyke rocks of basaltic and andesitic composition most of these rocks have now been metamorphosed to hornblende actinolite schists calcareous chlorite schists and amphibolites kesse 1985 the birimian supergroup is intruded by granitoids of the eburnean and tamnean plutonic suites in ghana four main types of granitoids are recognized to be associated with the birimian supergroup these include the winneba bongo dixcove and the cape coast type granites the cape coast and dixcove granites are seen to be present in the current study area the cape coast type granitoids occur only within the birimian metasediments this group also includes gneisses which are especially well developed in the metasediments banoeng yakubu et al 2011 dixcove type granitoids are metaluminous and typically dioritic to granodioritic in composition and intrude the birimian metavolcanic rocks they are typically hornblende bearing and are commonly associated with gold mineralisation where they occur as small plutons within the volcanic belts kesse 1985 the granitoids are massive in outcrop do not have a compositional banding or foliation and are thus generally considered post deformation banoeng yakubu et al 2011 the kwahu morago group of the voltaian supergroup consist mainly of sandstone which are white medium grained cross bedded flaggy and quartzose hydrogeologically the study area falls within three main hydrogeological provinces namely birimian province voltaian province and crystalline basement granitoid complex province dapaah siakwan and gyau boakye 2000 groundwater in the birimian province occurs mainly in the saprolite saprock and in the fractured bedrock the most productive zones in terms of groundwater delivery in the birimian province comprise the lower part of the saprolite and the upper part of the saprock which usually complement each other in terms of permeability and storage carrier et al 2008 the upper less permeable part of the saprolite can act as a semi confining layer for this productive zone while the lower usually saturated part of the saprolite is characterised by lower secondary clay content thus creating a zone of enhanced hydraulic conductivity banoeng yakubu et al 2011 generally areas underlain by the birimian rocks display deeper weathering than areas underlain by the granitoids banoeng yakubo 1989 identified three types of basement aquifers these are the weathered rock aquifers which are fracture related the fractured quartz vein aquifers and the fractured unweathered aquifers banoeng yakubu et al 2011 underscored that in the birimian province aquifers the saprolitic zone is a combination of the topsoil the underlying lateritic soil the highly weathered zone and the moderately weathered zone successful boreholes drilled through the rocks of the birimian and the tarkwaian range between 35 and 55 m with an average of 42 m agyekum 2004 carrier et al 2008 also recorded borehole depth in a similar range of 35 and 55 m with an average of 50 m in the granitoids data collated from wri csir shows that the depth to water table falls within 4 37 m with an average of 21 m there is no well defined local groundwater flow regime however the groundwater flow within the study area follows the regional flow regime which is from north to south and to a large extent toward the south western parts of the study area the aquifer transmissivity of the productive zones of the birimian province has been reported by banoeng yakubu et al 2011 to range between 0 2 m2 d and 119 m2 d with an average of 7 4 m2 d the kwahu morago group which is composed of yabraso sandstone formation has been identified as good aquifer zone based on available data from drilling projects within the area the basement rocks are characterised by little or no primary porosity and therefore the hydrogeology of the area is controlled by secondary permeabilities resulting from weathering and fracturing of the rock which has enhanced the storage and transmissive properties of the rocks to form groundwater reservoirs darko et al 2006 yidana et al 2012b 3 methodology data of groundwater samples collected from boreholes in the study area were obtained from hydronomics ghana limited in accra standard protocols for water sampling and storage as prescribed in apha 2005 usgs 2006 and canada ccme 2011 were adopted one hundred and twelve 112 samples collected 500 ml in pre cleaned sterilized poly propylene plastic bottles were stored in cool boxes about 3 c and transported to the water research institute of the council for scientific and industrial research wri csir laboratory for major and trace cations and anions analyses whiles ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature were determined on the field with the aid of a multi parameter portable meter peli 1521 from hanna instruments in the laboratory the samples were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator for about a week before they were analysed

hydrazine reduction no3 stannous chloride po4 2 were used to analyse the major minor and trace elements the dataset was subjected to an internal consistency test using the charge balance error cbe to test its accuracy equation 1 a charge balance error value within 5 is generally acceptable and shows that the laboratory analysis of the parameters are a good balance of the cations and anions appelo and postma 2005 in view of this samples that recoded cbe values above 5 were dropped from the analysis 1 c b e mc zc ma za mc zc ma za 100 where m c and m a and z c and z a are respectively molar concentrations of major cations and anions and charges of cations and anions similarly the resulting datasets were subjected to normality test since optimal multivariate statistical analyses assume gaussian distribution of datasets datasets that were not normally distributed were log transformed and or standardised to their z score equation 2 values 2 z x μ s where x μ and s are respectively the measured value mean and standard deviation of the parameter the transformed datasets were subjected to r mode and q mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca the q mode hca is used to discriminate the spatial associations or evolution of the groundwater into various types in space and or time whereas r mode is used to determine and rank the sources of variation in the hydrochemistry although several similarity dissimilarity and agglomerative techniques are available in hca the squared euclidean distance and ward s agglomeration method were employed in this study since a combination of these two have been identified to yield the best outcomes in hca davis 1986 yidana et al 2010 2012a for significant and optimal stochastic analysis parameters with large missing datasets such as f fe mn and as in most cases were excluded from the cluster analysis principal component analysis pca was also applied to the dataset to identify the main controls on groundwater chemistry pca is a data dimension reduction technique that reveals the significant components factors to aid interpretation of a large set of data and to visualise the correlations between the variables and hopefully be able to limit the number of variables pca was performed using the correlation matrix which brings the measurements onto a common scale and the principal components sorted in a diminishing order of variance such that the most important principal components are listed first to ensure that the extracted components did not correlate with each other an orthogonal varimax rotation technique was used assertions made in relation to the hydrochemical associations and processes based on the multivariate statistical techniques were supported by employing conventional hydrochemical plots and mineral stability diagrams to further establish the main controls on groundwater chemistry and to identify the most stable mineral phases in the groundwater flow system the quality of the groundwater was also assessed for drinking and irrigation purposes quality assessment for domestic purposes was based on a modified form of the water quality index wqi approach sahu and sikdar 2008 which is a weighted arithmetic index method the resultant water quality indices estimated from this method were spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting idw technique in order to minimise the errors associated with the spatial prediction the interpolation was limited to places in the study area with optimal sample point distribution such that places with little no sample points were excluded from the interpolation irrigation quality of the groundwater on the other hand was assessed using the wilcox 1955 and united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 diagrams 4 results and discussions the statistical summaries of the analysed parameters are presented in table 1 most of the major chemical parameters display high ranges of variance suggesting variable sources and factors influence and contribute to the concentration of these parameters of the groundwater in the study area generally concentrations of the major chemical parameters are within the acceptable who recommended ranges for potable water who 2017 however there are a few cases where some hydrochemical parameters which mostly occur as outliers fall outside the acceptable who 2017 ranges for potable water one instance is the occurrence of high fluoride levels recorded in some parts of gindabo and tuna in the central sections of the study area which may be associated with the leaching and weathering of fluorite and or the influence of alkaline water types in the area alkaline waters have been reported to retard the adsorption of fluoride onto the surfaces of clay minerals viero et al 2009 ph presents the least variance among the major chemical parameters and has ranges falling outside 5 87 9 99 the who 2017 recommended range of 6 5 8 5 signifying a slightly acidic to slightly alkaline groundwater system 4 1 assessment of the main sources of variation in groundwater chemistry results of pearson correlation r analysis are presented in table 2 correlation analysis provides a quick way to visualise the relations between two parameters for purposes of drawing inferences it is obvious from the results that the main contributors to ec in the study area are ca2 na hco3 so4 2 cl and f since these parameters have significant correlations 0 50 with ec similarly bicarbonate shows significant relation with na and ca2 which is consistent with silicate weathering freeze and cherry 1979 and possibly influenced by precipitation r mode hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca have been used to further unearth the main chemical processes controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area the dendrogram fig 3 for the r mode cluster analysis presents the visual associations among the parameters with a phenon line drawn at a linkage distance of about 22 although the definition of clusters based on the distance of the phenon line is subjective it is informed by the researcher s understanding of the combining environmental factors such as the geology hydrogeology and human activities which prevail in the study area and are likely to affect the chemistry of groundwater yidana et al 2012a the phenon line is drawn such that too many or too few clusters are not generated since the interpretation might be difficult defeating the purpose of cluster analysis or some important hydrochemical processes might be omitted notwithstanding the semi objectivity two clusters were generated which represent two main groundwater associations and or processes cluster 1 consists of na ca2 ec hco3 ph k mg and sio2 which represents the dominance of rock water interaction dominated by dissolution of silicate minerals in the rocks of the area the close association of ec ca2 hco3 na and ph in cluster 1a suggests the dissolution of feldspars in the sandstones found in the study area the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and precipitation and possibly within the soil zone results in the formation of carbonic acid which dissolves such minerals during infiltration thereby releasing hco3 and the associated ions cluster 1b on the other hand consists of sio2 k and mg2 at a much shorter linkage distance than cluster 1a and therefore presents the most similar members of the same cluster given the shorter linkage distance yidana et al 2011 relative to cluster 1a and cluster 2 cluster 1b probably represents silicate mineral weathering especially micas such as biotite which are also present in the study area sawla tuna kalba district assembly 2014 the second cluster links no3 so4 2 and cl cluster 2 represents the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters which are common pollutants of groundwater in agrarian settlements such as the study area han et al 2016 results of principal component analysis pca revealed two main components just like the r mode cluster analysis and these accounted for about 70 of the total variance in the hydrochemistry table 3 the factors were extracted based on variables with communalities of 0 5 and above kaiser 1960 and variables below the set lower limit such as k po4 2 as mn and fe were excluded from the analysis communalities measure the proportion of each variable s variance that can be explained by the factors therefore variables which loaded highly with more than one component such as mg2 and ph were dropped since these variables had duplicate effects and could not be used to explain a particular unique process in the hydrochemistry the first component which accounts for over 40 of the total variance in groundwater chemistry in the study area has high positive loadings for hco3 ec na ca2 and high negative loading for sio2 it can be deduced from the correlation analysis hca and pca that component 1 represents the dissolution of silicates particularly the feldspars in the sandstones underlying the area thus confirming the findings from cluster 1a fig 3 the negative loading of sio2 with component 1 also suggests that the silica in the groundwater does not contribute significantly to the electrical conductivity which is in line with the results of the correlation analyses table 2 a plot of na versus cl fig 4 suggests that the dissolution of halite is not the main source of na in the groundwater and thus the dissolution of silicate minerals could be the source of this ion in the groundwater the strong correlation between f and na r 0 69 as shown in table 2 possibly suggests the dissolution of minerals such as villiaumite and fluorapatite which are common constituents of the bedrock of the study area yidana et al 2012a component 2 on the other hand loads highly with cl so4 2 and no3 and represents the influence of agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters as these ions are common constituents of such pollutants since the study area is composed mainly of agrarian communities with farming practices which involves the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers such as manure and npk groundwater is likely to be polluted by such chemicals in the study area cobbina et al 2012 q mode hca resulted in a dendrogram fig 6 showing three main spatial associations in the hydrochemistry in the study area average concentrations from the three clusters are presented with stiff diagrams fig 7 generally aquifers of the birimian deliver groundwater of low ionic concentrations since their hydrochemistry is mainly influenced by silicate mineral weathering yidana et al 2012a notwithstanding the three clusters exhibit varying degrees of ionic concentrations and suggest a flow pattern in the groundwater system it is obvious from fig 7 that on the average cluster 1 presents the least mineralised groundwater system cluster 1 is mainly composed of samples from around kong sooma jilinkon nahari and grungu which are generally high elevation locations in the study area fig 5 conversely cluster 3 presents the highest mean concentration of the major ions and tds and is found at locations with low elevations such as babalayurin degwiwu kalba and generally the south western portions of the study area whereas cluster 2 occurs between clusters 1 and 3 fig 5 in recharge areas the concentration of ions in groundwater is usually low and similar to the precipitation in the area but as the water travels through the subsurface and dissolves minerals and other materials its ionic content increases with time this explains why clusters 1 and 3 have been designated as recharge and discharge zones respectively consistent with topographically driven groundwater flow fitts 2002 whereas cluster 2 samples are considered to represent a transition between clusters 1 and 3 this is clearly demonstrated by the stiff diagrams in fig 7 it is apparent from the stiff diagrams fig 7 that cluster 1 is a ca mg hco3 water type whereas cluster 2 is mg ca hco3 water type which evolves into a ca na k hco3 water type in cluster 3 the dissolution of villiaumite and fluorapatite is plausible when the water had enough time to interact with the rocks as it evolves towards discharge areas thus increasing the concentration of na in those areas similar water types were identified by cobbina et al 2012 in the voltaian and basement aquifers in the savannah region this is in tandem with the assertions made above from table 3 and fig 4 that dissolution of silicates plays a significant role explaining over 40 of the total variance in groundwater chemistry in the study area a gibbs 1970 diagram plotted for all three clusters clearly indicates rock dominance as the main source of the dissolved ions in groundwater from the study area fig 8 however the hydrochemistry of cluster 1 samples is largely influenced by the chemistry of precipitation in the area which is characteristically low in dissolved ions and high in bicarbonate as a result of the co2 charged rainfall although samples from clusters 2 and 3 plot within the rock dominance section it can be seen that samples from cluster 3 plot much closer to rock dominance evaporation crystallization line than the rock dominance precipitation line this supports the argument that waters from cluster 3 are more enriched in dissolved ions as a result of the longer interaction of the groundwater with the rock matrix generally groundwater from the study area is clearly a mixed cation fresh water type dominated by bicarbonate hco3 so4 cl as demonstrated by the stiff diagrams fig 7 durov 1948 diagram has been used to discriminate the hydrochemistry further from fig 9 it is apparent that most of the groundwater samples 42 are dominated by ca hco3 implying the dominance of alkaline earths over alkali thus ca mg na k whereas 36 and 20 are respectively mg hco3 and na k hco3 fresh water types cluster 3 samples plot closer to the na k field and further away from the ca and mg fields with corresponding high tds and ph values fig 9 confirming that these waters have had longer time to interact with the rock matrix and the surrounding environment the low ph values mainly contributed from precipitation as seen in cluster 1 samples are neutralized as the water interacts and dissolves the rock material as it transits the recharge zones and evolves into a more ionically enriched water in cluster 3 the mineral stability diagrams for nao al2o3 sio2 h2o and al2o3 sio2 h2o are presented in fig 10 both plots indicate that the most stable silicate phase in the aquifers is kaolinite indicating the incongruent weathering of silicate minerals such as biotite and muscovite and suggests that the groundwater in the aquifer is relatively young to intermediate in its flow regime and age this implies that there is little or no restricted groundwater flow such that the residence time is not long enough to allow for significant silica leaching into the groundwater edet and okereke 2005 yidana et al 2008a b loh et al 2016 4 2 groundwater quality evaluation for domestic use the quality of the groundwater has further been examined for its potability using the water quality index wqi approach modified after brown et al 1972 this approach is a weighted arithmetic approach which involves a series of steps to arrive at a single value index which describes the overall quality of water in space and time the suitability of groundwater in this study was based on the standards set by the world health organisation who 2017 for domestic drinking water in the first step water quality parameters of concern are assigned weights wi based on their importance and health implications when present in drinking water f no3 and as were assigned a maximum of 5 based on their relative importance in drinking water the rest of the parameters ph tds th ca2 mg2 na k ci so4 2 po4 3 fe and mn were assigned weights of 1 5 also based on their relative importance and health implications when present in drinking water secondly the relative weight wi of each parameter was computed as a fraction of the total weights computed from the fifteen parameters table 4 based on equation 3 3 wi wi wi lastly a quality rating scale qi was calculated for each parameter by dividing its concentration by the set objective who standard and multiplying by 100 equation 4 4 qi ci si 100 where ci and si are respectively parameter concentration and set objective the sub index and wqi are determined respectively using equations 5 and 6 5 si wi qi 6 wqi n 1 n si the calculated wqis are categorised according to sahu and sikdar 2008 as excellent water wqi 50 good water wqi 50 100 poor water wqi 100 200 very poor water wqi 200 300 and unsuitable for drinking wqi 300 the computed wqis have been spatially interpolated based on an inverse distance weighting idw technique which proved to be the most appropriate interpolation technique as a result of the smallest root mean square error associated with it rmse 0 852 the output was reclassified according to sahu and sikdar 2008 fig 11 the estimated wqis ranged from 16 64 to 132 15 with about 94 of the water classified as being excellent for drinking purposes whereas 5 and 1 are considered good and poor quality respectively fig 11 the poor water arises from two samples stkd 086 and stkd 93 located at sawla and soomia which are characterised by elevated levels of fluoride arsenic and fe these samples generally have high tds values and the contamination could be attributed to localised leaching of such ions into the groundwater system 4 3 assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation purposes the presence of sodium ion in groundwater is of grave concern due to its ability to affect the permeability of soil as well as offset the osmotic pressure of plants an offset in the osmotic pressure of the plants affects the rate of water intake by plant roots and its subsequent use in the process of photosynthesis high concentrations of na in soil therefore affect the metabolism of the plants and this can translate negatively to crop yield mohan et al 2000 zaidi et al 2015 saleh et al 1999 concluded that excessively high salinity waters also have the tendency to affect the ability of the plants to absorb nutrients and water fig 12 is based on the united states salinity laboratory ussl 1954 which represents a plot of sodium adsorption ratio sar against ec salinity all the samples from the study area plotted within the low sodicity s1 region and low to high salinity ranges c1 c3 about 18 of the samples fell within c1 s1 low salinity low sodicity and are mainly composed of waters from cluster 1 members of the q mode hca samples from cluster 1 have been categorised as recharge zones and have low ionic content most of the samples 72 plotted within the c2 s1 region medium salinity low sodicity irrigation waters whereas only 6 of the samples plot within c3 s1 all three regions present water of good quality and may be used for irrigation without prior treatment this assertion is corroborated by the wilcox 1955 plot in which all the water samples plot in excellent to permissible category it is obvious from figs 12 and 13 that the salinity of the groundwater in the study area increases as the water travels from recharge cluster 1 to discharge cluster 3 areas cluster 1 samples are typically low in both sodium and salinity as a result of the short residence time and interaction with the geology cluster 2 samples appear to present the best balance of sodium and salinity ranges sar 1 5 and ec 500 900 μ cm banoeng yakubo et al 2009 and hence have the best quality for irrigation but as the groundwater interacts and dissolves the rock matrix alongside getting polluted by anthropogenic sources such as agrochemicals and domestic wastewaters its quality for irrigation deteriorates as seen in cluster 3 samples fig 12 5 conclusion the key factors controlling groundwater chemistry and quality in some voltaian and basement aquifers in portions of sawla tuna kalba district northern ghana have been assessed statistical techniques such as hca pca and correlation analysis coupled with conventional hydrochemical plots suggests the dissolution of silicate minerals particularly feldspars and micas in the rocks as well as the influence of agrochemicals and domestic waste as the main factors controlling groundwater chemistry in the study area even though silicate mineral weathering was identified as the dominant process controlling the groundwater chemical composition the concentration of sio2 is low and did not contribute significantly to the ec mineral speciation calculations derived from the analysis also suggests that the most stable silicate mineral phase is kaolinite which suggests that groundwater in the area is at intermediate stage and flow is not restricted mainly due to the occurrence and pervasiveness of secondary permeability q mode hca identified three 3 groundwater flow regimes in the study area recharge zones cluster 1 located in high elevated areas characterised by low tds and dominated by ca hco3 water type transition zones cluster 2 dominated by mg ca hco3 water type and ca na k hco3 water type cluster 3 in discharge areas also groundwater quality for domestic purposes was assessed using a weighted arithmetic index approach the computed water quality indices wqis from the data suggest that 94 of the sampled wells provide groundwater of excellent quality for drinking purposes whereas 5 and 1 present water of good and poor quality respectively the poor quality presented by some of the wells is attributed to elevated levels of fluoride arsenic fe and tds and may have resulted from the leaching of such ions into the groundwater the study also finds groundwater in the area to be permissible for irrigation based on the ussl and wilcox plots funding this work was supported by the
