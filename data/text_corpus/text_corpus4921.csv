24605,this study aims to analyze the factors affecting algal growth due to hydrologic and hydrodynamic changes resulting from eight weir constructions along a length of 207 km on the nakdong river nutrients for algal growth light intensity water temperature and hydrodynamic conditions were examined to study their relationships with algal blooms a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was calibrated based on data from 2006 to 2008 and verified against data from 2013 to 2015 four statistics i e r2 me pbias and cf were used for the model performance assessment changes in algal bloom were not significant in the upper stream area because the nutrient level for algal growth was insufficient compared to that at other locations on the other hand as the nutrient concentration increased in the middle stream area algal blooms increased significantly the upper and middle streams showed increases in algal growth after the construction of weirs however hypereutrophic downstream area locations showed contrasting results showing an overall reduction in algal growth after the construction of weirs except for winter which showed the largest increase in hydraulic residence time these results seem to have positive and negative effects on algal blooms due to the construction of weirs the negative effects seem to be greater in hypereutrophic areas because of the decreased average light effect as a result of increased water depth created through the weir constructions playing a dominant role over the level of nutrients the impacts of the construction of weirs on the occurrence of algae in the nakdong river were as follows 1 as the hydraulic residence time increased the algal bloom increased where the nutrients were sufficient 2 when the nutrients were more than sufficient the average light availability became the dominant factor for algal growth 3 the temperature effect was not a significant algal growth limiting factor for hydrodynamic changes in the river however these results have limitations in terms of the model and data accuracy in order to use them for water resource management additional field experiments are required for confirmation and verification keywords harmful algal blooms algal growth limiting factors hydrodynamic and water quality model weir construction eutrophication water quality management 1 introduction eutrophication is a condition in which there is overenrichment of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen in water paerl 2006 shen et al 2012 since the 20th century industrialization and urbanization across the world have rapidly accelerated the production of contaminants by human activities and as a result the eutrophication of streams and lakes has intensified the nutrients that flow into the water play an important role in forming the ecosystem where an oversupply of nutrients causes a rapid increase in the growth of algae in the water andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 phytoplankton plays an important role in the structure of aquatic systems turning the light energy gained from photosynthesis into carbohydrates and becoming food for the parent ecosystem borowitzka 1997 brown and hohmann 2002 however when certain types of blue green algae occur in large quantities they can cause odor and toxins spoiling the taste of tap water causing discomfort and threatening the health of ecosystems and humans these algae have been categorized as harmful and the importance of managing harmful algae has been emphasized worldwide it is known that the main causes of algal blooms are water temperature solar radiation nutrients heisler et al 2008 and hydrological stability romo et al 2013 elliott 2010 the nakdong river the second largest river in south korea is the source of water supply for major cities such as busan daegu and ulsan the nakdong river is also subject to eutrophication and algal blooms urbanization and industrialization of its basin area since the 1960s has vastly increased pollutant loading to the river causing the water quality to deteriorate significantly andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 an estuarine dam was constructed at the mouth of the river in 1987 to reclaim land and provide fresh water to adjacent farming areas however serious algal blooms have repeatedly occurred inside the dam because of high nutrient concentrations and extended residence times while there have been continuous efforts to reduce incoming pollutants to the river from the basins algal blooms have persisted particularly in downstream areas where nutrient levels are higher and water velocity is slower during 2007 and 2011 eight weirs were built while the total number of weirs was 16 for the four major rivers in korea the eight weirs of the nakdong river may provide more favorable conditions for the growth of algae by increasing the residence time of the river however the increase in water depth by dredging and weir construction can interfere with the supply of solar radiation which is a prerequisite for algal growth and can provide negative conditions for algal growth seo et al 2012 bae and seo 2018 therefore those two aspects should be considered in analyzing the impact of weir construction on algal blooms in a comprehensive manner few studies have explained the relationship between hydraulic conditions and algal blooms owing to changes in hydrological regulation due to construction on major rivers in korea cha et al 2017 reported that water temperature and residence time are important for predicting cyanobacteria in regulated rivers in korea sin and lee 2020 analyzed changes in hydrology water quality and algal blooms in a freshwater system impounded with engineered structures in the youngsan river estuary kim et al 2021a analyzed the factors affecting the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in the geum river with regulated hydrology they reported that the availability of po4 p was the most important factor in response to hydraulic residence time kim et al 2021b reported that tp is a major stressor for chl a in the nakdong river xia et al 2019 tried to explain algal blooms in large rivers by analyzing the relationships among nutrient hydrological and climatic elements through literature reviews although the above studies have tried to explain the main causes of algal bloom occurrences it seems that each river system has a unique condition this paper aims to study the characteristics of algal blooms considering the impact of weir construction on a large river to assist in the development of alternatives for water quality management in this study the complex effects of environmental factors on the changes in algal blooms were analyzed in different regions of the river with different eutrophic statuses 2 material and method 2 1 the study area this study was conducted on 207 3 km of the main stream of the nakdong river which included eight weirs installed as part of the four major river restoration projects the height of the eight weirs was in the range of 9 5 11 8 m and the total storage was 512 billion tons more detailed information and weir resources are provided in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 water quality model the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hamrick 1992 was used for hydrodynamic and water quality modeling and scenario analysis of the impact of weir construction on algal blooms in the river the efdc model is a multifunctional surface water modeling system that includes hydrodynamics sediment transport toxic contaminant transport and water quality components fig 2 shows the efdc model structure and water quality sub model schematic diagram hamrick and wu 1997 park et al 1995 tetra tech 2007a 2007b hydrodynamics and water quality modules were used in this study over the past two decades it has become one of the most widely used models and has been applied to many water bodies for environmental assessment and management huang et al 2017 jeong et al 2010 ji et al 2001 kim and park 2012 kuo et al 1996 moustafa and hamrick 2000 park et al 2005 shen et al 1999 shen et al 2012 tetra tech 1999 wang et al 2013 xie et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 the efdc has also been used to simulate chl a in the prediction of algal blooms and eutrophication in various aquatic systems bae and seo 2018

et al 2013 the water quality module of the efdc is functionally equivalent to the corps of engineers integrated compartment water quality model ce qual icm cerco and cole 1993 and integrated into the model by park et al 1995 it solves mass balance equations for 21 state variables which include three algal groups blue green algae diatoms and green algae various components of carbon nitrogen phosphorus silica cycles dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform bacteria bae and seo 2018 hamrick and wu 1997 tetra tech 2007b wu and xu 2011 2 2 2 model theories the efdc model uses the mass balance equation as shown in eq 1 to consider both the physical transport and kinetic transformation of the water quality variable c 1 c t u c x v c y w c z k x 2 c x 2 k y 2 c y 2 k z 2 c z 2 s i n k s o u r

where pm indicates the maximum growth rate day 1 when the algae have optimal environmental conditions for growth and f1 n f2 l and f3 t are the limiting factors of algae growth by nutrients solar radiation and water temperature respectively the limiting factors of algal growth were expressed as values between 0 and 1 the closer to 1 the less influence on the growth of algae and the closer it is to 0 the higher the restriction on algae growth the f1 n f2 l and f3 t can be estimated by eqs 4 6 4 f 1 n din khn din dip khp dip dsa khs dsa where khn khp and khs are the half saturation

is when the water temperature is higher than tm2 if the water temperature satisfies the optimum water temperature between tm1 and tm2 for algal growth it is assumed that there is no water temperature limitation for algal growth and is calculated as f3 t 1 2 3 model input development 2 3 1 grid development the computational domain setting is an important factor for minimizing the error in any numerical model the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method in the efdc model was used to develop 6715 horizontal grids with three vertical layers the completed grid system is shown in appendix a average orthogonal deviation od was 8 43 with a maximum value of 15 58 in general an od of less than 25 is regarded as acceptable although it is desirable to be as small as possible the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1967 for the developed horizontal grid system was 0 37 with a maximum value of 0 54 the cfl number is often required to be less than unity as a stability criterion the grid system was selected using the trial and error method to keep the two above indices as small as possible 2 3 2 model input data collection environmental monitoring data were collected through the national database of water environment information system nier 2020 water resources management information system hrfco 2020 and korea meteorological administration kma 2020 the collected data included weekly water quality hourly weather and daily hydrological data for a total of six years 2006 2008 2013 2015 fig 1 shows the monitoring stations for environmental data collection the initial parameters and constants for interactions among water quality variables were initially obtained from studies such as bowie et al 1985 and were further calibrated using the trial and error method the final calibrated parameters and constants are listed in table 4 detailed information about the selected grid system and model boundary conditions is given in appendix a 2 4 evaluation methods of model prediction accuracy model prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing the differences in model predictions to field observations the following four statistics and rating levels see table 2 were used to evaluate model accuracy as suggested by allen et al 2007 holt et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 and ostojski et al 2016 see allen et al 2007 for a more detailed explanation of these statistics table 2 lists the performance ratings of the four statistics for the model performance assessment the coefficient of determination r 2 indicates the percentage of variability in data that can be accounted for by the model and can be expressed by squaring the equation of the pearson correlation coefficient 7 r 2 n 1 n d n d n m n m n 2 n 1 n d n d n 2 n 1 n m n m n 2 the nash

out to analyze the effects of eight weirs constructed in the nakdong river on algal blooms table 3 lists the scenarios developed in this study the scenario bpbw before pollution and before weir indicates the actual situation from 2006 2008 when the weirs were not constructed yet and served as a control in this study the scenario bpaw before pollution and after weir indicates a hypothetical situation in which the weirs were constructed for the period from 2006 2008 the same boundary conditions were applied in both the cases the scenario apaw after pollution and after weir draws from the real situation from 2013 2015 when the construction of the weirs was completed the differences between bpaw and apaw are the pollutant input loading rates reflecting each representing period as shown in table 3 while bpbw can be regarded as a model calibration result apaw can be viewed as a validation of the model as well 3 results 3 1 model calibration and verification the calibration and verification of the model were performed for the years 2006 2008 and 2013 2015 these were evaluated based on the performance rating levels as shown in table 2 of the four statistical values r2 nse pbias and cf 3 1 1 water level and temperature the water levels were calibrated and verified at 10 water level monitoring stations in the study area as shown in appendix b and table 4 the performance ratings of the model calibration are evaluated as being very good for all statistical methods as shown in table 4 the model was verified by comparing the simulation results from 2013 2015 the performance ratings of all statistical methods for water level verification are evaluated as being very good as shown in table 4 the model was calibrated and verified for water temperatures at 18 stations in the study area appendix c and table 4 show the results of calibration and verification and performance ratings for four statistical values that were evaluated as being very good 3 1 2 water quality model calibration and verification were performed for seven water quality variables including chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do toc total organic carbon tn total nitrogen din dissolved inorganic nitrogen tp total phosphorus and dip dissolved inorganic phosphorus in 18 water quality monitoring stations the parameters used to calibrate the water quality model are listed in table 5 appendix d shows the calibration and verification results for chl a in the water quality model the left side shows the model calibration results and the right side shows the model verification results in the graph on the left the model calculation values represent the trends of the observed data for the chl a calibration r2 is evaluated as good with 0 51 nse is satisfactory with 0 48 pbias is very good with 2 52 and cf is very good with 0 5 in addition in the chl a verification r2 is evaluated as satisfactory with 0 38 nse is good with 0 52 pbias is very good with 16 43 and cf is very good with 0 3 the six other water quality variables including do toc tn din tp and dip are also calibrated and verified in the same manner as chl a in table 5 all variables are rated at or above the satisfactory level in the evaluation of the four statistical values the performance rating level of the four statistical values r2 nse pbias and cf for all water quality variables is also evaluated as above the satisfactory level so it is concluded that the model reflects the observations well 3 2 the effect of weirs construction from 2006 2008 fig 3 shows the changes in the hydraulic residence time hrt and average water velocity inside each weir location for the bpbw and bpaw scenarios fig 3 a shows the annual average changes and fig 3 b through fig 3 e indicate seasonal changes similar to figs 3 and 4 a shows the annual average change and fig 4 b e indicate seasonal changes in water velocity and residence time for each section according to fig 3 a the annual cumulative residence time in bpaw 102 8 d increases by about 1 8 times than that of bpbw 57 4 d for a distance of 207 3 km from headwater to r8 see fig 1 the increase in residence time by weir construction is the largest in winter and the smallest in summer as shown in fig 3 and table 4 as shown in fig 4 the rate of the residence time change after r5 rapidly decreases from 152 3 per year to 51 3 the increase rate of the residence time from r6 r8 sections in summer ranges from 7 7 to 21 7 which is significantly lower than that at other locations the changes in the water velocity and the hrt due to weir construction are reduced in all sections as shown in fig 3 and appendix e annual average velocity reduction rate is greater than 40 0 in the five upstream sections from r1 r5 these results indicate that the effect of weir construction on water velocity and residence time may be greater upstream than downstream of the nakdong river 3 3 the effect of weirs construction on algal blooms fig 4 shows the model calculation results of annual average and seasonal chl a concentrations for scenarios bpbw and bpaw and appendix f shows the seasonal mean values and changes in chl a concentration in each section the solid line in appendix f indicates bpbw before weir construction and the dotted line indicates bpaw after weir construction the shaded area represents the decrease in chl a concentration after the weir construction in fig 5 and appendix f and i the changes in the annual average chl a concentration for the two scenarios are analyzed differently based on section r5 in the upstream area of r5 the construction of the weirs increases algal blooms but decreases it in the downstream area in addition changes in chl a concentration due to the construction of the weirs show different seasonal characteristics in spring summer and autumn the chl a concentration increases upstream and decreases downstream after the weirs were constructed however unlike the other seasons chl a concentration increases over the entire area in winter after the weirs were constructed based on the scenario analysis results the algal growth limiting factors were analyzed to investigate the effect of weir construction on algal growth in this study three algal growth limiting factors such as nutrient limiting factor f1 n light limiting factor f2 l and temperature limiting factor for algae growth f3 t were used figs 5 6 and 7 show the changes in f1 n f2 l and f3 t due to weir construction respectively these algal growth limiting factors range from 0 to 1 if this value is closer to 1 there is no restriction on the growth of algae and if closer to 0 the greater the restriction which is detrimental to the growth of algae 3 3 1 the nutrients limiting factor for algal growth f1 n the limiting factors of nutrients for algal growth are related to din and dip see eq 4 however according to bae and seo 2018 the limiting nutrient for algal growth in the entire nakdong river was considered to be phosphorus therefore this study also considered the relationship between phosphorus and algal growth fig 5 shows the annual and seasonal changes in dip and nutrient limiting factors due to weir construction after the weir construction bpaw in the entire nakdong river the dip and f1 n decreases somewhat in the absence of weirs bpbw however the change in f1 n due to weir construction is not significant 3 3 2 the light limiting factor for algal growth f2 l the light limiting factor of algal growth is determined as a function of depth and light extinction coefficient see eq 5 as shown in fig 6 f2 l decreases with the increase in water depth in the whole section owing to the construction of the weirs which is a disadvantage for algal growth in addition the increase in the water depth due to the weir construction is smaller downstream and the decrease in the f2 l value downstream is smaller than that upstream 3 3 3 the temperature limiting factor for algal growth f3 t the algal growth limiting factor for water temperature is a factor related to the optimum growth temperature of algae species and is closely related to the species composition of algae algal growth limiting factors for algal species were analyzed for three algal species because cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae were included in the water quality model in this study the optimum growth temperature of cyanobacteria is set from 26 c 30 c diatoms from 10 c 14 c and green algae from 22 c 25 c see table 5 fig 7 shows the changes in water temperature due to weir construction and the changes in algal growth limiting factors with respect to water temperature change in each algal species in appendix j the water temperature decreases after weir construction in spring and summer when the temperature is relatively high and the water temperature increases after weir construction in the autumn and winter when the temperature is relatively low 11 ρ c t t k 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 2 t z 2 s h where t is water temperature t is time cd is specific heat ρ is density k is the thermal conductivity and sh is the heat source per unit volume according to eq 11 the water volume increase leads to water temperature t decreases because the water temperature t and the volume of water are inversely proportional to each other in same heat source construction of the weirs increases the volume of the water due to impoundment and this effect will be stronger for dry seasons winter and spring for the study site that is under the monsoon weather effect therefore water temperature can be higher in winter after weir construction than before however the average temperature limiting factor f3 t values of the three species of algae are almost identical after weir construction although the patterns of seasonal f3 t changes are different the f3 t of cyanobacteria increases in spring and summer when the water temperature decreases and increases in autumn and winter when the water temperature increases compared to before weir construction the value of f3 t is highest in the summer which is favorable for growth and lowest in winter which is disadvantageous for growth when the water temperature decreases during spring and summer the f3 t values of diatoms increases and when the water temperature increases during fall and winter the values decrease the difference between cyanobacteria and diatoms occurs because the optimum growth temperature is different construction of the weirs decreases the water temperature below the optimum growth temperature of cyanobacteria during spring making the weirs a disadvantage for cyanobacteria as shown by the decrease in its f3 t values however the growth of diatoms which grow well at low temperatures becomes disadvantageous in autumn when the water temperature increases above its optimum temperature after weir construction the f3 t value of the green algae with the optimum growth temperature ranging between 22 c and 25 c is similar to that of cyanobacteria as it decreases in spring when the water temperature decreases after weir construction the changes in f3 t values are analyzed differently according to season and species after weir construction but the change in mean f3 t value of all algae species is not significant in the results of this study algae growth limiting factors such as f1 n f2 l and f3 t are also changed as the environmental factors are changed however f1 n which is the algae growth limiting factor for nutrients is not greatly affected by the construction of the weirs and f2 l the algae growth limiting factor for light is affected the most by the construction of the weirs the changes in f3 t due to changes in water temperature varies by season but the mean values of the three species do not change significantly in other words the impact of the construction of the weirs on the change in algal growth factors for each algal species may be large but the influence on the total algae production is not significant 3 4 algal blooms and weirs in the nakdong river according to the results of this study the construction of the weirs in the river can greatly affect the occurrence of river algae in three aspects 1 the increase in residence time decrease in flow rate 2 the decrease in light energy increase in water depth and 3 changes in water temperature due to an increase in water volume in particular the changes in the f2 l value due to the change in the residence time and the depth of water is the main cause of the changes in the occurrence of algal blooms after the construction of weirs that is the increase in hrt favorably affects the growth of the algae and the decrease in the light energy due to the increase in the depth of water has a negative effect on algal growth the results as in fig 8 show that the seasonal impact of the construction of the weirs on the algal blooms in the nakdong river is a composite reaction of the above two factors i e f2 l and the hrt fig 8 shows the rate of change in f2 l and residence time the changes in algal blooms in the spring season can be divided into sections from r1 r5 and from r6 r8 the f2 l decreases after the weirs had been constructed in all sections but in the r1 r5 sections the occurrence of algae increases because the rate of increase in residence time is high however in the r6 r8 section the rate of increase in residence time is relatively low and the effect of decreasing f2 l value due to the increase in water depth is greater thus reducing the occurrence of algae in addition the geumho river see fig 1 which is introduced at the beginning of r6 may be one of the main factors affecting the change in residence time for each section the geumho river is the largest tributary of the nakdong river and it is considered that the increase in residence time has decreased due to the influx of the geumho river into the nakdong river in summer and autumn the effect of weir construction on algae growth is similar to that of spring however the occurrence of algae increases in the r1 r4 sections and decreases in r5 r8 after the weir construction because the increase in the residence time in summer and autumn is smaller than that in spring in winter the occurrence of algae increases in all the sections after weir construction because the effect of increasing the residence time is much higher than the f2 l reduction effect due to the increase in water depth 4 discussion 4 1 the nutrient limitation effect on algal blooms nutrients are the principal factor for algal blooms in freshwater systems paerl 2006 shen et al 2012 andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 redfield 1958 reported that the most significant nutrients for algal synthesis were c n and p with an average molecular ratio c n p of 106 16 1 in water in general an n p mass ratio above 17 indicates p limiting conditions and a ratio below 10 indicates n limiting conditions forsberg and ryding 1980 bae and seo 2018 reported that phosphorus is the principal limiting factor for algal growth in the nakdong river where the average n p ratio is higher than 17 although the algal growth rate increases at higher nutrient concentrations the algae growth rate may slow down if sufficient nutrients are supplied villar argaiz and sterner 2002 it has also been shown that nutrients may not be the limiting factor for algal growth in river water systems abonyi et al 2018 larroude et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in the nakdong river the greatest pollution source seems to be the geumho river that delivers municipal and industrial wastewaters from daegu areas the third largest city in the country the chl a concentration or algal blooms is observed to be clearly higher after the introduction of this tributary nier 2020 in the nakdong river basin the nutrient concentrations in the upper stream areas r1 r4 in fig 1 were relatively low tp 0 025 mg l however the midstream and lower regions became mesotrophic and eutrophic tp 0 025 mg l and showed serious algal blooms due to the influence of the geumho river r6 r8 in fig 1 hilton et al 2006 and sivapragasam et al 2010 suggested 0 03 mg l is the boundary tp concentration of limitation for algal blooms this indicated that tp concentration became sufficient for algal growth after the introduction of the geumho river at the mouth of r6 therefore other environmental factors e g water depth velocities solar radiation etc could also be important factors in controlling algal growth bowes et al 2012 chen et al 2014 kirkwood et al 2007 lewis and mccutchan 2010 yang et al 2011 yin et al 2017 han 2014 reported that dominant algae groups could differ by location and season due to differences in growth conditions including the optimum temperature seo et al 2012 suggested that the nakdong river basins could be divided into the following three regions based on tp concentration and water temperature in the previous studies 1 the upper stream area having less contaminants and the occurrence of algal blooms at high water temperature upstream area corresponding to r1 in this study 2 the midstream area containing various algal species and sufficient nutrients for algal growth r2 r5 in this study and 3 the hyper eutrophic and slow moving downstream area r6 r8 in this study water quality concentrations in rivers are the combined results of physical processes and biogeochemical reactions thus chl a being used as an indicator of algal blooms also reflects the results of all environmental phenomena associated with algal growth in this regard the effect of hydraulic conditions on algal blooms depends on principal factors such as nutrients and water temperature seasons this is described in section 4 2 4 2 hrt and light limitation effect on algal blooms weir construction in the river will increase the depth and thus the volume of water inside the structure the hydraulic residence time hrt increased owing to the volume increase given the same flow rate and average solar energy decreased due to increased depth the effects of weir construction and operation on algal blooms can be closely associated with the alteration of hrt and solar energy availability kim et al 2021a longer hrts that will allow more time for algal growth but smaller average solar energy will reduce photosynthetic activity fig 4 shows that the chl a concentration decreased after the introduction of the geumho river with weir construction bae and seo 2018 found that the trophic level determined by the phosphorus changed from mesotrophic to eutrophic after the introduction of the geumho river into the nakdong river in the region after the introduction of the geumho river the weir construction effects could be higher due to increased hrt while nutrients were sufficient for algae growth therefore physical environmental factors changed by weir construction such as increases in water depth and hrt can be more important factors for the changes in algal blooms in the lower stream areas however it is important to analyze comprehensively the factors affecting algal growth when researching algal growth effects on hydrological changes in large rivers weir construction has both negative and positive effects on algal blooms and fig 4 a shows the sum of these responses while r1 the upper stream area shows a minimum increase of approximately 1 mg chl a m3 or 25 in annual average areas between r2 and r4 show an increase of 9 15 mg chl a m3 or 50 140 due to weir construction this effect decreased to 6 mg chl a m3 or 30 in r5 where the guemho river was introduced then this tendency was reversed for r6 r8 by 2 4 mg chl a m3 or 6 10 this tendency was identical to the results that seo et al 2012 reported that hrt increase ratios for the upper stream area r1 r4 were 6 6 14 8 while they were 3 7 6 6 for r6 r8 these results confirmed that the weir construction could increase algal bloom in the upper stream area between r1 and r5 or before the geumho river introduction and could decrease in the lower stream area r6 r8 respectively fig 4 b e show the change in seasonal average chl a concentration after weir construction in detail weir construction effects on algal growth seem more pronounced for spring and winter a relatively dry season for korea that is influenced by monsoon weather effects jones et al 2009 in korea 2 3 of the annual rainfall is concentrated during the summer and drainage becomes the most important for rivers in this period fall in korea is usually influenced by typhoons which also affect the growth of algae in rivers therefore fig 4 must be analyzed with weather change effects at the study site in general algal growth increased in the upper stream area r1 r5 and decreased in the lower stream area r6 r8 except in winter during winter changes in hrt become the greatest and this effect seems to be stronger for the lower stream area however winter algal blooms in the study area were dominated by diatoms that prefer low temperatures for growth jeong et al 2007 reported that hydrological regulation in the nakdong river would affect algal growth as microcystis aeruginosa and stephanodiscus hantzschii during summer june august and winter december february respectively and dominated each season by over 80 5 conclusion this study analyzed factors affecting algal growth due to serious hydrologic and hydrodynamic changes by eight weir constructions in a 207 km section of the nakdong river a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model the efdc was intensively calibrated and verified using three years of field data from 2006 2008 and 2013 2015 respectively for the analysis nutrient water temperature light intensity and hrt were examined both spatially and temporally in the upstream areas the increased rate of the residence time was greater than that in the downstream areas due to weir construction for seasons the increase in the residence time was much larger in spring and winter than in summer and fall due to the monsoon weather effect of the study site compared with the other seasons the flow rate and water velocity were smaller and slower respectively in winter the effects of hydrodynamic changes on algal blooms showed significantly different patterns depending on the trophic level in the respective regions in the first weir r1 changes in algal bloom were not significant because the nutrient level in r1 was lower than in other locations although the annual average hrt increased approximately seven times on the other hand as the nutrient concentration increased in the middle stream area r2 r5 due to augmented nutrients for algal growth algal bloom increases significantly however hypereutrophic downstream area locations r6 r8 showed opposite results showing an overall reduction in algal growth after weir construction including the summer season this seems to be caused by an increase in water depth which is followed by a fall in average solar energy availability for sufficient nutrients despite a significantly higher annual average hrt greater than at least 3 7 times the impact of weir construction on the occurrence of algae can be summarized in the nakdong river as follows 1 as hydraulic residence time increased the occurrence of algae increased if nutrients were sufficient this is observed in the upper stream area r1 r5 of the study site 2 when nutrients were more than sufficient average light availability became the dominant factor for algal growth due to an increase in depth by weir constructions this effect was observed in the lower stream area r6 r8 3 temperature effect was not a significant algal growth limiting factor for hydrodynamic changes in the river but determining multiple effects among environmental factors on algal blooms by seasons in conclusion factors affecting algal bloom were different due to hydrodynamic changes by weir constructions in the nakdong river depending on location

24605,this study aims to analyze the factors affecting algal growth due to hydrologic and hydrodynamic changes resulting from eight weir constructions along a length of 207 km on the nakdong river nutrients for algal growth light intensity water temperature and hydrodynamic conditions were examined to study their relationships with algal blooms a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was calibrated based on data from 2006 to 2008 and verified against data from 2013 to 2015 four statistics i e r2 me pbias and cf were used for the model performance assessment changes in algal bloom were not significant in the upper stream area because the nutrient level for algal growth was insufficient compared to that at other locations on the other hand as the nutrient concentration increased in the middle stream area algal blooms increased significantly the upper and middle streams showed increases in algal growth after the construction of weirs however hypereutrophic downstream area locations showed contrasting results showing an overall reduction in algal growth after the construction of weirs except for winter which showed the largest increase in hydraulic residence time these results seem to have positive and negative effects on algal blooms due to the construction of weirs the negative effects seem to be greater in hypereutrophic areas because of the decreased average light effect as a result of increased water depth created through the weir constructions playing a dominant role over the level of nutrients the impacts of the construction of weirs on the occurrence of algae in the nakdong river were as follows 1 as the hydraulic residence time increased the algal bloom increased where the nutrients were sufficient 2 when the nutrients were more than sufficient the average light availability became the dominant factor for algal growth 3 the temperature effect was not a significant algal growth limiting factor for hydrodynamic changes in the river however these results have limitations in terms of the model and data accuracy in order to use them for water resource management additional field experiments are required for confirmation and verification keywords harmful algal blooms algal growth limiting factors hydrodynamic and water quality model weir construction eutrophication water quality management 1 introduction eutrophication is a condition in which there is overenrichment of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen in water paerl 2006 shen et al 2012 since the 20th century industrialization and urbanization across the world have rapidly accelerated the production of contaminants by human activities and as a result the eutrophication of streams and lakes has intensified the nutrients that flow into the water play an important role in forming the ecosystem where an oversupply of nutrients causes a rapid increase in the growth of algae in the water andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 phytoplankton plays an important role in the structure of aquatic systems turning the light energy gained from photosynthesis into carbohydrates and becoming food for the parent ecosystem borowitzka 1997 brown and hohmann 2002 however when certain types of blue green algae occur in large quantities they can cause odor and toxins spoiling the taste of tap water causing discomfort and threatening the health of ecosystems and humans these algae have been categorized as harmful and the importance of managing harmful algae has been emphasized worldwide it is known that the main causes of algal blooms are water temperature solar radiation nutrients heisler et al 2008 and hydrological stability romo et al 2013 elliott 2010 the nakdong river the second largest river in south korea is the source of water supply for major cities such as busan daegu and ulsan the nakdong river is also subject to eutrophication and algal blooms urbanization and industrialization of its basin area since the 1960s has vastly increased pollutant loading to the river causing the water quality to deteriorate significantly andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 an estuarine dam was constructed at the mouth of the river in 1987 to reclaim land and provide fresh water to adjacent farming areas however serious algal blooms have repeatedly occurred inside the dam because of high nutrient concentrations and extended residence times while there have been continuous efforts to reduce incoming pollutants to the river from the basins algal blooms have persisted particularly in downstream areas where nutrient levels are higher and water velocity is slower during 2007 and 2011 eight weirs were built while the total number of weirs was 16 for the four major rivers in korea the eight weirs of the nakdong river may provide more favorable conditions for the growth of algae by increasing the residence time of the river however the increase in water depth by dredging and weir construction can interfere with the supply of solar radiation which is a prerequisite for algal growth and can provide negative conditions for algal growth seo et al 2012 bae and seo 2018 therefore those two aspects should be considered in analyzing the impact of weir construction on algal blooms in a comprehensive manner few studies have explained the relationship between hydraulic conditions and algal blooms owing to changes in hydrological regulation due to construction on major rivers in korea cha et al 2017 reported that water temperature and residence time are important for predicting cyanobacteria in regulated rivers in korea sin and lee 2020 analyzed changes in hydrology water quality and algal blooms in a freshwater system impounded with engineered structures in the youngsan river estuary kim et al 2021a analyzed the factors affecting the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in the geum river with regulated hydrology they reported that the availability of po4 p was the most important factor in response to hydraulic residence time kim et al 2021b reported that tp is a major stressor for chl a in the nakdong river xia et al 2019 tried to explain algal blooms in large rivers by analyzing the relationships among nutrient hydrological and climatic elements through literature reviews although the above studies have tried to explain the main causes of algal bloom occurrences it seems that each river system has a unique condition this paper aims to study the characteristics of algal blooms considering the impact of weir construction on a large river to assist in the development of alternatives for water quality management in this study the complex effects of environmental factors on the changes in algal blooms were analyzed in different regions of the river with different eutrophic statuses 2 material and method 2 1 the study area this study was conducted on 207 3 km of the main stream of the nakdong river which included eight weirs installed as part of the four major river restoration projects the height of the eight weirs was in the range of 9 5 11 8 m and the total storage was 512 billion tons more detailed information and weir resources are provided in fig 1 and table 1 respectively 2 2 mathematical model 2 2 1 water quality model the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hamrick 1992 was used for hydrodynamic and water quality modeling and scenario analysis of the impact of weir construction on algal blooms in the river the efdc model is a multifunctional surface water modeling system that includes hydrodynamics sediment transport toxic contaminant transport and water quality components fig 2 shows the efdc model structure and water quality sub model schematic diagram hamrick and wu 1997 park et al 1995 tetra tech 2007a 2007b hydrodynamics and water quality modules were used in this study over the past two decades it has become one of the most widely used models and has been applied to many water bodies for environmental assessment and management huang et al 2017 jeong et al 2010 ji et al 2001 kim and park 2012 kuo et al 1996 moustafa and hamrick 2000 park et al 2005 shen et al 1999 shen et al 2012 tetra tech 1999 wang et al 2013 xie et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 the efdc has also been used to simulate chl a in the prediction of algal blooms and eutrophication in various aquatic systems bae and seo 2018 he et al 2011 jia et al 2010 kim et al 2017 li et al 2011 park et al 1995 park et al 2005 seo and song 2015 tetra tech 1999 2005 wang et al 2014 wu and xu 2011 zeng et al 2015 zhao et al 2013 zouiten et al 2013 the water quality module of the efdc is functionally equivalent to the corps of engineers integrated compartment water quality model ce qual icm cerco and cole 1993 and integrated into the model by park et al 1995 it solves mass balance equations for 21 state variables which include three algal groups blue green algae diatoms and green algae various components of carbon nitrogen phosphorus silica cycles dissolved oxygen and fecal coliform bacteria bae and seo 2018 hamrick and wu 1997 tetra tech 2007b wu and xu 2011 2 2 2 model theories the efdc model uses the mass balance equation as shown in eq 1 to consider both the physical transport and kinetic transformation of the water quality variable c 1 c t u c x v c y w c z k x 2 c x 2 k y 2 c y 2 k z 2 c z 2 s i n k s o u r

where pm indicates the maximum growth rate day 1 when the algae have optimal environmental conditions for growth and f1 n f2 l and f3 t are the limiting factors of algae growth by nutrients solar radiation and water temperature respectively the limiting factors of algal growth were expressed as values between 0 and 1 the closer to 1 the less influence on the growth of algae and the closer it is to 0 the higher the restriction on algae growth the f1 n f2 l and f3 t can be estimated by eqs 4 6 4 f 1 n din khn din dip khp dip dsa khs dsa where khn khp and khs are the half saturation

is when the water temperature is higher than tm2 if the water temperature satisfies the optimum water temperature between tm1 and tm2 for algal growth it is assumed that there is no water temperature limitation for algal growth and is calculated as f3 t 1 2 3 model input development 2 3 1 grid development the computational domain setting is an important factor for minimizing the error in any numerical model the curvilinear orthogonal coordinate method in the efdc model was used to develop 6715 horizontal grids with three vertical layers the completed grid system is shown in appendix a average orthogonal deviation od was 8 43 with a maximum value of 15 58 in general an od of less than 25 is regarded as acceptable although it is desirable to be as small as possible the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition courant et al 1967 for the developed horizontal grid system was 0 37 with a maximum value of 0 54 the cfl number is often required to be less than unity as a stability criterion the grid system was selected using the trial and error method to keep the two above indices as small as possible 2 3 2 model input data collection environmental monitoring data were collected through the national database of water environment information system nier 2020 water resources management information system hrfco 2020 and korea meteorological administration kma 2020 the collected data included weekly water quality hourly weather and daily hydrological data for a total of six years 2006 2008 2013 2015 fig 1 shows the monitoring stations for environmental data collection the initial parameters and constants for interactions among water quality variables were initially obtained from studies such as bowie et al 1985 and were further calibrated using the trial and error method the final calibrated parameters and constants are listed in table 4 detailed information about the selected grid system and model boundary conditions is given in appendix a 2 4 evaluation methods of model prediction accuracy model prediction accuracy was assessed by comparing the differences in model predictions to field observations the following four statistics and rating levels see table 2 were used to evaluate model accuracy as suggested by allen et al 2007 holt et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 and ostojski et al 2016 see allen et al 2007 for a more detailed explanation of these statistics table 2 lists the performance ratings of the four statistics for the model performance assessment the coefficient of determination r 2 indicates the percentage of variability in

out to analyze the effects of eight weirs constructed in the nakdong river on algal blooms table 3 lists the scenarios developed in this study the scenario bpbw before pollution and before weir indicates the actual situation from 2006 2008 when the weirs were not constructed yet and served as a control in this study the scenario bpaw before pollution and after weir indicates a hypothetical situation in which the weirs were constructed for the period from 2006 2008 the same boundary conditions were applied in both the cases the scenario apaw after pollution and after weir draws from the real situation from 2013 2015 when the construction of the weirs was completed the differences between bpaw and apaw are the pollutant input loading rates reflecting each representing period as shown in table 3 while bpbw can be regarded as a model calibration result apaw can be viewed as a validation of the model as well 3 results 3 1 model calibration and verification the calibration and verification of the model were performed for the years 2006 2008 and 2013 2015 these were evaluated based on the performance rating levels as shown in table 2 of the four statistical values r2 nse pbias and cf 3 1 1 water level and temperature the water levels were calibrated and verified at 10 water level monitoring stations in the study area as shown in appendix b and table 4 the performance ratings of the model calibration are evaluated as being very good for all statistical methods as shown in table 4 the model was verified by comparing the simulation results from 2013 2015 the performance ratings of all statistical methods for water level verification are evaluated as being very good as shown in table 4 the model was calibrated and verified for water temperatures at 18 stations in the study area appendix c and table 4 show the results of calibration and verification and performance ratings for four statistical values that were evaluated as being very good 3 1 2 water quality model calibration and verification were performed for seven water quality variables including chlorophyll a chl a dissolved oxygen do toc total organic carbon tn total nitrogen din dissolved inorganic nitrogen tp total phosphorus and dip dissolved inorganic phosphorus in 18 water quality monitoring stations the parameters used to calibrate the water quality model are listed in table 5 appendix d shows the calibration and verification results for chl a in the water quality model the left side shows the model calibration results and the right side shows the model verification results in the graph on the left the model calculation values represent the trends of the observed data for the chl a calibration r2 is evaluated as good with 0 51 nse is satisfactory with 0 48 pbias is very good with 2 52 and cf is very good with 0 5 in addition in the chl a verification r2 is evaluated as satisfactory with 0 38 nse is good with 0 52 pbias is very good with 16 43 and cf is very good with 0 3 the six other water quality variables including do toc tn din tp and dip are also calibrated and verified in the same manner as chl a in table 5 all variables are rated at or above the satisfactory level in the evaluation of the four statistical values the performance rating level of the four statistical values r2 nse pbias and cf for all water quality variables is also evaluated as above the satisfactory level so it is concluded that the model reflects the observations well 3 2 the effect of weirs construction from 2006 2008 fig 3 shows the changes in the hydraulic residence time hrt and average water velocity inside each weir location for the bpbw and bpaw scenarios fig 3 a shows the annual average changes and fig 3 b through fig 3 e indicate seasonal changes similar to figs 3 and 4 a shows the annual average change and fig 4 b e indicate seasonal changes in water velocity and residence time for each section according to fig 3 a the annual cumulative residence time in bpaw 102 8 d increases by about 1 8 times than that of bpbw 57 4 d for a distance of 207 3 km from headwater to r8 see fig 1 the increase in residence time by weir construction is the largest in winter and the smallest in summer as shown in fig 3 and table 4 as shown in fig 4 the rate of the residence time change after r5 rapidly decreases from 152 3 per year to 51 3 the increase rate of the residence time from r6 r8 sections in summer ranges from 7 7 to 21 7 which is significantly lower than that at other locations the changes in the water velocity and the hrt due to weir construction are reduced in all sections as shown in fig 3 and appendix e annual average velocity reduction rate is greater than 40 0 in the five upstream sections from r1 r5 these results indicate that the effect of weir construction on water velocity and residence time may be greater upstream than downstream of the nakdong river 3 3 the effect of weirs construction on algal blooms fig 4 shows the model calculation results of annual average and seasonal chl a concentrations for scenarios bpbw and bpaw and appendix f shows the seasonal mean values and changes in chl a concentration in each section the solid line in appendix f indicates bpbw before weir construction and the dotted line indicates bpaw after weir construction the shaded area represents the decrease in chl a concentration after the weir construction in fig 5 and appendix f and i the changes in the annual average chl a concentration for the two scenarios are analyzed differently based on section r5 in the upstream area of r5 the construction of the weirs increases algal blooms but decreases it in the downstream area in addition changes in chl a concentration due to the construction of the weirs show different seasonal characteristics in spring summer and autumn the chl a concentration increases upstream and decreases downstream after the weirs were constructed however unlike the other seasons chl a concentration increases over the entire area in winter after the weirs were constructed based on the scenario analysis results the algal growth limiting factors were analyzed to investigate the effect of weir construction on algal growth in this study three algal growth limiting factors such as nutrient limiting factor f1 n light limiting factor f2 l and temperature limiting factor for algae growth f3 t were used figs 5 6 and 7 show the changes in f1 n f2 l and f3 t due to weir construction respectively these algal growth limiting factors range from 0 to 1 if this value is closer to 1 there is no restriction on the growth of algae and if closer to 0 the greater the restriction which is detrimental to the growth of algae 3 3 1 the nutrients limiting factor for algal growth f1 n the limiting factors of nutrients for algal growth are related to din and dip see eq 4 however according to bae and seo 2018 the limiting nutrient for algal growth in the entire nakdong river was considered to be phosphorus therefore this study also considered the relationship between phosphorus and algal growth fig 5 shows the annual and seasonal changes in dip and nutrient limiting factors due to weir construction after the weir construction bpaw in the entire nakdong river the dip and f1 n decreases somewhat in the absence of weirs bpbw however the change in f1 n due to weir construction is not significant 3 3 2 the light limiting factor for algal growth f2 l the light limiting factor of algal growth is determined as a function of depth and light extinction coefficient see eq 5 as shown in fig 6 f2 l decreases with the increase in water depth in the whole section owing to the construction of the weirs which is a disadvantage for algal growth in addition the increase in the water depth due to the weir construction is smaller downstream and the decrease in the f2 l value downstream is smaller than that upstream 3 3 3 the temperature limiting factor for algal growth f3 t the algal growth limiting factor for water temperature is a factor related to the optimum growth temperature of algae species and is closely related to the species composition of algae algal growth limiting factors for algal species were analyzed for three algal species because cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae were included in the water quality model in this study the optimum growth temperature of cyanobacteria is set from 26 c 30 c diatoms from 10 c 14 c and green algae from 22 c 25 c see table 5 fig 7 shows the changes in water temperature due to weir construction and the changes in algal growth limiting factors with respect to water temperature change in each algal species in appendix j the water temperature decreases after weir construction in spring and summer when the temperature is relatively high and the water temperature increases after weir construction in the autumn and winter when the temperature is relatively low 11 ρ c t t k 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 2 t z 2 s h where t is water temperature t is time cd is specific heat ρ is density k is the thermal conductivity and sh is the heat source per unit volume according to eq 11 the water volume increase leads to water temperature t decreases because the water temperature t and the volume of water are inversely proportional to each other in same heat source construction of the weirs increases the volume of the water due to impoundment and this effect will be stronger for dry seasons winter and spring for the study site that is under the monsoon weather effect therefore water temperature can be higher in winter after weir construction than before however the average temperature limiting factor f3 t values of the three species of algae are almost identical after weir construction although the patterns of seasonal f3 t changes are different the f3 t of cyanobacteria increases in spring and summer when the water temperature decreases and increases in autumn and winter when the water temperature increases compared to before weir construction the value of f3 t is highest in the summer which is favorable for growth and lowest in winter which is disadvantageous for growth when the water temperature decreases during spring and summer the f3 t values of diatoms increases and when the water temperature increases during fall and winter the values decrease the difference between cyanobacteria and diatoms occurs because the optimum growth temperature is different construction of the weirs decreases the water temperature below the optimum growth temperature of cyanobacteria during spring making the weirs a disadvantage for cyanobacteria as shown by the decrease in its f3 t values however the growth of diatoms which grow well at low temperatures becomes disadvantageous in autumn when the water temperature increases above its optimum temperature after weir construction the f3 t value of the green algae with the optimum growth temperature ranging between 22 c and 25 c is similar to that of cyanobacteria as it decreases in spring when the water temperature decreases after weir construction the changes in f3 t values are analyzed differently according to season and species after weir construction but the change in mean f3 t value of all algae species is not significant in the results of this study algae growth limiting factors such as f1 n f2 l and f3 t are also changed as the environmental factors are changed however f1 n which is the algae growth limiting factor for nutrients is not greatly affected by the construction of the weirs and f2 l the algae growth limiting factor for light is affected the most by the construction of the weirs the changes in f3 t due to changes in water temperature varies by season but the mean values of the three species do not change significantly in other words the impact of the construction of the weirs on the change in algal growth factors for each algal species may be large but the influence on the total algae production is not significant 3 4 algal blooms and weirs in the nakdong river according to the results of this study the construction of the weirs in the river can greatly affect the occurrence of river algae in three aspects 1 the increase in residence time decrease in flow rate 2 the decrease in light energy increase in water depth and 3 changes in water temperature due to an increase in water volume in particular the changes in the f2 l value due to the change in the residence time and the depth of water is the main cause of the changes in the occurrence of algal blooms after the construction of weirs that is the increase in hrt favorably affects the growth of the algae and the decrease in the light energy due to the increase in the depth of water has a negative effect on algal growth the results as in fig 8 show that the seasonal impact of the construction of the weirs on the algal blooms in the nakdong river is a composite reaction of the above two factors i e f2 l and the hrt fig 8 shows the rate of change in f2 l and residence time the changes in algal blooms in the spring season can be divided into sections from r1 r5 and from r6 r8 the f2 l decreases after the weirs had been constructed in all sections but in the r1 r5 sections the occurrence of algae increases because the rate of increase in residence time is high however in the r6 r8 section the rate of increase in residence time is relatively low and the effect of decreasing f2 l value due to the increase in water depth is greater thus reducing the occurrence of algae in addition the geumho river see fig 1 which is introduced at the beginning of r6 may be one of the main factors affecting the change in residence time for each section the geumho river is the largest tributary of the nakdong river and it is considered that the increase in residence time has decreased due to the influx of the geumho river into the nakdong river in summer and autumn the effect of weir construction on algae growth is similar to that of spring however the occurrence of algae increases in the r1 r4 sections and decreases in r5 r8 after the weir construction because the increase in the residence time in summer and autumn is smaller than that in spring in winter the occurrence of algae increases in all the sections after weir construction because the effect of increasing the residence time is much higher than the f2 l reduction effect due to the increase in water depth 4 discussion 4 1 the nutrient limitation effect on algal blooms nutrients are the principal factor for algal blooms in freshwater systems paerl 2006 shen et al 2012 andersen et al 2006 chen et al 2016 hudnell 2010 lewitus et al 2012 redfield 1958 reported that the most significant nutrients for algal synthesis were c n and p with an average molecular ratio c n p of 106 16 1 in water in general an n p mass ratio above 17 indicates p limiting conditions and a ratio below 10 indicates n limiting conditions forsberg and ryding 1980 bae and seo 2018 reported that phosphorus is the principal limiting factor for algal growth in the nakdong river where the average n p ratio is higher than 17 although the algal growth rate increases at higher nutrient concentrations the algae growth rate may slow down if sufficient nutrients are supplied villar argaiz and sterner 2002 it has also been shown that nutrients may not be the limiting factor for algal growth in river water systems abonyi et al 2018 larroude et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 in the nakdong river the greatest pollution source seems to be the geumho river that delivers municipal and industrial wastewaters from daegu areas the third largest city in the country the chl a concentration or algal blooms is observed to be clearly higher after the introduction of this tributary nier 2020 in the nakdong river basin the nutrient concentrations in the upper stream areas r1 r4 in fig 1 were relatively low tp 0 025 mg l however the midstream and lower regions became mesotrophic and eutrophic tp 0 025 mg l and showed serious algal blooms due to the influence of the geumho river r6 r8 in fig 1 hilton et al 2006 and sivapragasam et al 2010 suggested 0 03 mg l is the boundary tp concentration of limitation for algal blooms this indicated that tp concentration became sufficient for algal growth after the introduction of the geumho river at the mouth of r6 therefore other environmental factors e g water depth velocities solar radiation etc could also be important factors in controlling algal growth bowes et al 2012 chen et al 2014 kirkwood et al 2007 lewis and mccutchan 2010 yang et al 2011 yin et al 2017 han 2014 reported that dominant algae groups could differ by location and season due to differences in growth conditions including the optimum temperature seo et al 2012 suggested that the nakdong river basins could be divided into the following three regions based on tp concentration and water temperature in the previous studies 1 the upper stream area having less contaminants and the occurrence of algal blooms at high water temperature upstream area corresponding to r1 in this study 2 the midstream area containing various algal species and sufficient nutrients for algal growth r2 r5 in this study and 3 the hyper eutrophic and slow moving downstream area r6 r8 in this study water quality concentrations in rivers are the combined results of physical processes and biogeochemical reactions thus chl a being used as an indicator of algal blooms also reflects the results of all environmental phenomena associated with algal growth in this regard the effect of hydraulic conditions on algal blooms depends on principal factors such as nutrients and water temperature seasons this is described in section 4 2 4 2 hrt and light limitation effect on algal blooms weir construction in the river will increase the depth and thus the volume of water inside the structure the hydraulic residence time hrt increased owing to the volume increase given the same flow rate and average solar energy decreased due to increased depth the effects of weir construction and operation on algal blooms can be closely associated with the alteration of hrt and solar energy availability kim et al 2021a longer hrts that will allow more time for algal growth but smaller average solar energy will reduce photosynthetic activity fig 4 shows that the chl a concentration decreased after the introduction of the geumho river with weir construction bae and seo 2018 found that the trophic level determined by the phosphorus changed from mesotrophic to eutrophic after the introduction of the geumho river into the nakdong river in the region after the introduction of the geumho river the weir construction effects could be higher due to increased hrt while nutrients were sufficient for algae growth therefore physical environmental factors changed by weir construction such as increases in water depth and hrt can be more important factors for the changes in algal blooms in the lower stream areas however it is important to analyze comprehensively the factors affecting algal growth when researching algal growth effects on hydrological changes in large rivers weir construction has both negative and positive effects on algal blooms and fig 4 a shows the sum of these responses while r1 the upper stream area shows a minimum increase of approximately 1 mg chl a m3 or 25 in annual average areas between r2 and r4 show an increase of 9 15 mg chl a m3 or 50 140 due to weir construction this effect decreased to 6 mg chl a m3 or 30 in r5 where the guemho river was introduced then this tendency was reversed for r6 r8 by 2 4 mg chl a m3 or 6 10 this tendency was identical to the results that seo et al 2012 reported that hrt increase ratios for the upper stream area r1 r4 were 6 6 14 8 while they were 3 7 6 6 for r6 r8 these results confirmed that the weir construction could increase algal bloom in the upper stream area between r1 and r5 or before the geumho river introduction and could decrease in the lower stream area r6 r8 respectively fig 4 b e show the change in seasonal average chl a concentration after weir construction in detail weir construction effects on algal growth seem more pronounced for spring and winter a relatively dry season for korea that is influenced by monsoon weather effects jones et al 2009 in korea 2 3 of the annual rainfall is concentrated during the summer and drainage becomes the most important for rivers in this period fall in korea is usually influenced by typhoons which also affect the growth of algae in rivers therefore fig 4 must be analyzed with weather change effects at the study site in general algal growth increased in the upper stream area r1 r5 and decreased in the lower stream area r6 r8 except in winter during winter changes in hrt become the greatest and this effect seems to be stronger for the lower stream area however winter algal blooms in the study area were dominated by diatoms that prefer low temperatures for growth jeong et al 2007 reported that hydrological regulation in the nakdong river would affect algal growth as microcystis aeruginosa and stephanodiscus hantzschii during summer june august and winter december february respectively and dominated each season by over 80 5 conclusion this study analyzed factors affecting algal growth due to serious hydrologic and hydrodynamic changes by eight weir constructions in a 207 km section of the nakdong river a three dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model the efdc was intensively calibrated and verified using three years of field data from 2006 2008 and 2013 2015 respectively for the analysis nutrient water temperature light intensity and hrt were examined both spatially and temporally in the upstream areas the increased rate of the residence time was greater than that in the downstream areas due to weir construction for seasons the increase in the residence time was much larger in spring and winter than in summer and fall due to the monsoon weather effect of the study site compared with the other seasons the flow rate and water velocity were smaller and slower respectively in winter the effects of hydrodynamic changes on algal blooms showed significantly different patterns depending on the trophic level in the respective regions in the first weir r1 changes in algal bloom were not significant because the nutrient level in r1 was lower than in other locations although the annual average hrt increased approximately seven times on the other hand as the nutrient concentration increased in the middle stream area r2 r5 due to augmented nutrients for algal growth algal bloom increases significantly however hypereutrophic downstream area locations r6 r8 showed opposite results showing an overall reduction in algal growth after weir construction including the summer season this seems to be caused by an increase in water depth which is followed by a fall in average solar energy availability for sufficient nutrients despite a significantly higher annual average hrt greater than at least 3 7 times the impact of weir construction on the occurrence of algae can be summarized in the nakdong river as follows 1 as hydraulic residence time increased the occurrence of algae increased if nutrients were sufficient this is observed in the upper stream area r1 r5 of the study site 2 when nutrients were more than sufficient average light availability became the dominant factor for algal growth due to an increase in depth by weir constructions this effect was observed in the lower stream area r6 r8 3 temperature effect was not a significant algal growth limiting factor for hydrodynamic changes in the river but determining multiple effects among environmental factors on algal blooms by seasons in conclusion factors affecting algal bloom were different due to hydrodynamic changes by weir constructions in the nakdong river depending on location

24606,extinction rates are increasing globally and direct exploitation is an important driver many pathways have been proposed to explain how exploitation can lead to extinction one of these proposed but understudied multispecies pathways is opportunistic exploitation which occurs when a highly valuable but rare species is encountered and targeted during exploitation of a less valuable but more common target species using individual based simulations of exploiters in a two species spatial model we contribute evidence which supports that opportunistic exploitation increases depletion when compared to single species exploitation and is as detrimental to the more valuable rare species as the anthropogenic allee effect where price increases with rarity and the allee effect where population growth declines at low abundance the most important factors affecting the impact of opportunistic exploitation are gross revenue and abundance of the more common less valuable species while ease of capture and growth rate of the more common less valuable species are less important thus valuable but rare species are most at risk when harvested alongside low value abundant species this information is relevant for managers focused on protection of rare species in multispecies systems keywords extinction depensation over harvesting opportunistic exploitation conservation threatened 1 introduction although extinction itself may ultimately be inevitable the rate at which it is occurring has been exacerbated by human activity bascompte 2003 compelling evidence shows that earth s biota is amid its sixth mass extinction and recent extinction rates are both unparalleled in human history and highly unusual in earth s history baillie et al 2004 ceballos et al 2015 many major processes driving an increase in extinction rates are anthropogenic including direct human exploitation habitat loss climate change and introduced species diamond et al 1989 ichii et al 2019 keith et al 2008 purvis et al 2000 thomas et al 2004 the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services identifies direct exploitation as the second most important driver of change in the global state of nature ichii et al 2019 and biological resource use is listed as a threat for all 189 species listed as extinct or extinct in the wild on the iucn red list iucn 2020 when exploitation is directly targeted on a single species extinction is expected to be relatively uncommon e g grafton et al 2007 this is because as population size decreases search costs nearly always begin to outweigh revenue except in obvious cases where species are extraordinarily valuable or can be easily exploited e g dodos nevertheless extinction and serious depletion have been reported for many exploited species resulting in a variety of hypotheses that provide explanations for high extinction risks under single species exploitation including tragedy of the commons feeny et al 1990 1996 hardin 1968 ostrom 1999 ostrom et al 1999 economics of overexploitation clark 1973 grafton et al 2007 the allee effect allee 1931 stephens et al 1999 and the anthropogenic allee effect courchamp et al 2006 intrinsic biological factors that decrease mean individual fitness at low population sizes can also increase extinction risk collectively termed the allee effect allee 1931 stephens et al 1999 reproduction and survival can be diminished in small populations through numerous mechanisms which include mate shortage lack of cooperation and genetic allee effects such as inbreeding depression in such cases species can suffer reproductive failure at low densities resulting in rapid extinction once the population falls below a minimum population size this phenomenon has been blamed for the demise of passenger pigeons e g stephens and sutherland 1999 an allied hypothesis is the anthropogenic allee effect where instead of lower survival at low numbers income from exploitation increases markedly at low numbers courchamp et al 2006 the classic case is when rare products such as beluga sturgeon caviar become disproportionately valuable because of their rarity allowing for profitable overexploitation examples of species experiencing anthropogenic allee effects include spectacular butterflies sought by collectors goat antelopes family caprinae sought by trophy hunters geckos goniurosaurus luii captured to be exotic pets large game birds tetrao urogallus impacted by ecotourism and the chinese bahaba exploited for its perceived medicinal value courchamp et al 2006 holden and mcdonald madden 2017 in short sometimes people are prepared to pay exorbitant prices to hunt collect or own specimens of the rarest species all preceding explanations assume single species exploitation but when exploitation directly targets more than one species the number of extinction pathways expands for example when many species are exploited together e g through fisheries trawling gear attempting to maximize overall revenue causes some species to decline to low levels e g hilborn et al 2012 ricker 1958 three modes of exploitation can be distinguished depending on the relative value of the various species accidental exploitation where there is accidental by catch while targeting a species with economic value hall et al 2000 rasmussen et al 2011 incidental exploitation in which a less desirable species with lower economic value is exploited while pursuing a higher value target species megalofonou 2005 and opportunistic exploitation where a rare species with high monetary value is stumbled upon during targeted exploitation of a more abundant less valuable target species branch et al 2013 opportunistic exploitation allows for valuable yet scarce species hereafter rare species to be exploited while profitably targeting another more common species because there are reduced or zero search costs associated with exploitation of the rare species thus in multispecies exploitation scenarios there is a continuum of extinction pathways from accidental exploitation to incidental exploitation to opportunistic exploitation as value of the vulnerable species increases relative to other targeted species of these three pathways opportunistic exploitation is most problematic since this mode involves the greatest economic incentive to continue exploitation of the species most at risk branch et al 2013 consider the case where black rhinoceroses diceros bicornis were hunted to extinction in the luangwa valley zambia even though illegally poaching rhino alone was not profitable due to their rarity milner gulland and leader williams 1992 hypotheses assuming only single species systems cannot fully explain this extinction event in this case illegal poaching was profitable when elephants and rhinos were hunted together and as rhinos became rare elephants became the main target milner gulland and leader williams 1992 thus opportunistic exploitation contributed to the extinction of black rhinoceros in zambia in the 1990s chomba and matandiko 2011 while hypotheses based on both single species and multispecies exploitation pathways have been proposed to explain extinctions none develop a firm mathematical foundation for a general understanding of extinction risks that includes single species and multispecies pathways although opportunistic exploitation is likely the most destructive pathway to extinction it is also least understood to fill this gap we developed models to examine the effect of key biological and economic factors that influence extinction risk and assess both single species and multispecies modes of extinction we used individual based models to replicate conditions that can lead to extinction from human exploitation finding that opportunistic exploitation in multispecies systems increases extinction risk of the more valuable rare species and surprisingly also increases risk to the common less valuable species compared to exploitation of a single target species 2 methods we developed models to evaluate factors that we thought were likely to influence extinction risk of exploited species 1 patchiness distribution and movement of species 2 catchability which combines detectability of the species and search effort of the exploiter 3 population dynamics governing how abundance varies over time 4 exploiter knowledge of species distribution and 5 net revenue from exploitation we simulated the population of three types of entities exploiters and two types of harvestable species the agents of these two harvestable species inhabited a grid of g 2 discrete sites where each site has a specified habitat quality for each species at the beginning of each time step the population size of each harvestable species changed according to discrete time logistic growth equation with poisson process error after the population size was calculated individuals of both harvestable species moved throughout the grid according to habitat quality once individuals moved exploitation occurred exploiter agents had the opportunity to enter the grid sequentially from a single entry point on the outside of the grid once per time step and their cost to harvest increased with distance travelled exploiters did not learn over the course of the simulations so there was no change over time in how well they were able to predict locations of individual animals each exploiter could capture either zero or one individual per time step exploiters were assumed to be identical in knowledge costs and search abilities values used for parameters can be found in table 1 and a general simulation framework can be found in fig 1 these simulations were completed in r r core team 2013 and source code is available at github com sthurner11 a detailed model description which follows the odd overview design concept details protocol for describing individual based models grimm et al 2010 2020 is available in the supplementary material appendix s1 2 1 generating habitat grids habitat quality values h s i were assigned to every cell in the g g grids 10 10 by default for each species s denoting habitat quality for that species at each grid cell i 1 g 2 grid cells are referred to hereafter as sites habitat quality grids were generated using random fields as implemented in r package randomfields schlather et al 2015 2020 where covariance changes between sites as a matérn function of distance thorson et al 2015 the resulting values were log habitat quality with low values representing areas of poor quality and high values representing areas of good quality we generated habitat grids along a gradient from random to patchy by changing parameter m which governs the smoothness of the matérn function and ranges from zero we used 0 0001 to avoid numerical issues for completely random habitat quality to 0 8 for highly patchy habitat quality fig 2 for the simulations we generated 40 200 pairs of habitat quality grids where grids were paired for each of two species with each grid having a randomly selected value of m u 0 0001 0 8 this ensured enough pairs were generated for the procedure outlined below grid pairs were sorted by the randomly emerging correlations between abundance in sites across species binned into five equal bins with correlations that ranged from 0 5 to 0 5 and then 100 pairs were randomly chosen from each bin each of the resulting 500 grid pairs was used as a habitat quality grid for one of n 500 simulations for each scenario 2 2 distributing starting population the starting population size we assumed the population starts at carrying capacity ks for each species s was distributed into the relevant grid in proportion to habitat quality the number of individuals for species s and site i at time period t 0 n s i t 0 was obtained by drawing ks individuals from a multinomial distribution with probabilities pi derived from the g habitat quality values for each site i 1 p i exp h s i j g exp h s j 2 n s i t 0 multinomial k s p i 2 3 population dynamics at the beginning of each time step the population of each species changed according to the discrete time logistic growth equation with poisson process error after population growth individuals were allowed to move and then exploitation occurred there was no exploitation in year 0 the sum of individuals across all i sites denoted by for species s at time t is given by n s t thus 3 n s t 0 k s 4 θ s t 1 n s t c s t r s n s t c s t 1 n s t c s t k s 5 n s t 1 pois θ s t 1 intrinsic growth rates rs and carrying capacities k s were pre specified for each species and c s t shows the total amount of individuals removed in year t after calculating n s t 1 we applied movement redistributing individuals proportional to habitat quality using the same process applied to distribute individuals at t 1 eqs 1 and 2 2 4 cost the cost for an exploiter to harvest one individual depends on a variable cost v multiplied by distance a fixed cost per trip f that combined gear labor and opportunity cost i e foregone revenue from alternatives to species exploitation and a capture cost α that is zero if no individual is captured capture cost is the cost of gear e g ammunition and labor needed to capture an individual exploiters entered the grid at location 0 0 and moved to the center of a site the bottom left site is centered on 0 5 0 5 we calculated distance as a straight line distance from the origin 0 0 to the center of each site creating a matrix of distances to each site d the total cost c of visiting and capturing an individual in each site was 6 c i v d i f a 2 5 effort expected gross revenue and net revenue the number of exploiters e is expected to increase when more gross revenue is available such that average gross revenue per exploiter is constant as predicted by the ideal free distribution fretwell 1972 1969 at the start of each simulation gross revenue available per exploiter re t 0 is total gross revenue divided by number of exploiters 7 r e t 0 r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 e here r 1 and r 2 are the gross revenues obtained from exploiting one individual of each species because we assumed that each exploiter would receive equal gross revenue across simulation scenarios the number of exploiters in each scenario was determined as a function of re t 0 8 e r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 r e t 0 exploiters entered the grid sequentially and have no knowledge of which sites they or other exploiters have visited we assumed that each exploiter could only capture one individual in a given time step to implement this we first calculated the probability of encountering at least one individual of species s at a given site and time p s i t 9 p s i t 1 1 q s n s i t where q s is catchability the probability of encountering one individual of species s at a site given presence and n s i t is the number of individuals of species s in each site we assumed that an encountered individual can be caught using this we then calculated the potential gross revenue matrix ρ i t which is the expected gross revenue from successfully exploiting species 1 plus the expected gross revenue from successfully exploiting species 2 if you did not exploit species 1 in each site we assume that if both species are encountered in a given cell the more valuable species will always be exploited 10 ρ i t r 1 p 1 i t r 2 p 2 i t 1 p 1 i t of key importance in most scenarios we run and as reflected in eq 10 species 1 will be the rarer and more valuable species and species 2 the more common and less valuable species to mimic the kinds of scenarios that lead to opportunistic exploitation after calculating potential gross revenue we calculated potential net revenue for each site as 11 π i t ρ i t c i to relax the assumption of perfect knowledge we included observation error in the net revenue grid this converts the potential net revenue grid to a perceived net revenue grid which is the observed net revenue grid on which the exploiters act and accounts for their imperfect knowledge we assumed that the coefficient of variation cve of this observation error was the same for all exploiters and all time steps observation error o t was calculated for every site where 12 o i t n 0 s d c v e i n 1 i 0 r 1 n 2 i 0 r 2 g 2 therefore the perceived net revenue grid for the exploiter was 13 π i t ρ i t c i o i t using the exploiter s net revenue we calculated the probability b of this individual exploiter going to each site i using fleet dynamics equations from hilborn et al 2006 14 b i t exp d 1 π i t π max t where d is the concentration coefficient of exploiters and takes values between 0 and 3 high values of d result in more concentrated effort in sites with higher expected net revenue we then calculated b i t as 15 b i t b i t i b i t exploiters were assigned to each site using a multinomial draw with probability b i t of being in site i if the site they were assigned to had negative estimated net revenue π i t 0 exploiters did not venture forth once an exploiter was assigned a site to visit we conducted separate binomial draws for each species to determine if one of the individuals present in the site was encountered with probability of success p s i t if only one species was encountered they were taken unless the gross revenue of the individual was less than the capture cost a if the exploiter encountered individuals of both species the more valuable species was taken or if both species had the same gross revenue there was a 50 chance of taking each steps were repeated for each exploiter in every time step total removals in year t are shown in eq 5 since exploiters were assumed to be identical in all respects multiple exploiters taking single trips is functionally equivalent to a single exploiter taking multiple trips at the end of time step t the total number of individuals remaining in the population is the number that were there at the start minus the total number caught c s t 2 6 metrics at the end of the final time step t we calculated depletion as the proportion of the initial population that was remaining for each species n s t t c s t t k s in each simulation we computed the median and 95 intervals of these depletion values across all 500 simulations for a given scenario where each scenario refers to a structural or parametric change to the model and the 500 simulations within a scenario are associated with each of the 500 habitat quality grids pairs described in section 2 1 these metrics allow us to compare depletion levels between species and among scenarios in addition we calculated extinction risk for both species as the proportion of simulations where the species goes extinct 2 7 scenarios we developed a single species base case and compared this to single species scenarios with allee effects and with anthropogenic allee effects next we developed a multispecies base case which modeled opportunistic exploitation to examine the comparative effect of adding a second species lastly we examined the effects of changing species value population growth population size catchability exploiter knowledge gross revenue per exploiter the concentration coefficient of exploiters and cost levels on the intensity of opportunistic exploitation 2 7 1 exploitation scenarios 2 7 1 1 single species base case the single species base case explored the scenario where only one species is exploited as would occur if rhinos were the only targeted species and elephants had no value we chose parameter values which resulted in the population size of the rare exploited species declining on average by about60 at the end of the simulation period 300 years table 1 these parameter values were retained for other scenarios except for adjustments to test hypotheses in this case species 2 is twice as numerous 2000 vs 1000 and has no value gross revenue 0 vs 2000 but is otherwise identical to species 1 the less common but more valuable target species 2 7 1 2 allee effect in populations affected by the allee effect as population size decreases per capita rate of increase declines courchamp et al 1999a instead of increasing as would be expected under negative density dependence i e eq 4 we implemented the allee effect depensation using a modified version of hilborn et al 2014 where population growth rate declines by 50 when population size is n 50 16 n s t 1 n s t c s t t r s n s t c s t t 1 n s t c s t t k s 1 0 5 n s t c s t t n 50 we specified n 50 0 25 k s which has the effect of reducing population growth by 29 at 40 of carrying capacity and by 86 at 5 of carrying capacity for the base parameter values the gross revenue of species 2 was set to zero as in the single species base case 2 7 1 3 anthropogenic allee effect under the anthropogenic allee effect the value of products increases considerably at low abundance we assumed the revenue abundance relationship in holden and mcdonald madden 2017 for gross revenue 17 r s t m s b s n s t z s here m s is the minimum value per individual harvested when the species is abundant and m s b s is the price paid when there is a single individual left n s t 1 when z s is greater than 0 gross revenue is highest when the species is rare and as z s increases gross revenue increases more steeply with rarity holden and mcdonald madden 2017 using this equation we recalculated the gross revenue for the rare species rhinos at the beginning of each time step using the values m 1 r 1 2000 and assumed that gross revenue doubled at the lowest abundance hence b 1 2000 we chose a moderate value of z 1 0 5 for the rate of price increase the gross revenue of species 2 was set to zero 2 7 1 4 multispecies base case for opportunistic exploitation opportunistic exploitation arises when a common species has non zero value the two species case branch et al 2013 predict that opportunistic exploitation will occur when a more common but less valuable species is also exploited in this scenario the more common species was half as valuable as the rare species r 1 2000 r 2 1000 and had twice as many individuals at t 1 k 2 2000 but in all other respects was identical to the rare species and all other parameters were the same as in the single species base case table 1 2 7 2 impact of model attributes on opportunistic exploitation the remaining scenarios all use the same parameters as the multispecies base case for opportunistic exploitation except for changes to specific parameters mentioned below 2 7 2 1 gross revenue per species opportunistic exploitation is predicted to be more severe as gross revenue increases for the rare species r 1 or the more common species r 2 or as the ratio of the two r 2 r 1 increases in the first scenario we varied gross revenue for the rare species between 1000 dollars and 10 000 dollars so that r 2 r 1 ranged from 1 to 1 10 in the second scenario we varied gross revenue for the more common species between 0 dollars and 2000 dollars so that r 2 r 1 ranged from 0 to 1 2 7 2 2 growth rates we examined the sensitivity of our results to intrinsic growth rates r of each species in two ways first we held growth rates of both species equal r 1 r 2 and looked at the impact of a range of growth rates between 0 and 0 4 then we examined the impact of unequal growth rates by setting the growth rate of one species to the multispecies base case value of 0 1 and changing the growth rate of the other species between 0 and 0 4 we repeated this for both species 2 7 2 3 population size depletion of the rare species will be dependent on abundance of the rare species in the system greater abundance results in more available gross revenue in this scenario we examined a range of values for abundance at time 0 of the rare species from 100 to 2000 opportunistic exploitation is predicted to be more problematic when the common species is more abundant because the common species will allow for a longer period of profitable exploitation in this scenario we examined a range of values for abundance at time 0 of the common species from 1000 to 50 000 2 7 2 4 ease of capturing species catchability we investigated the sensitivity of our results to catchability q 1 and q 2 of each species in two ways first both species had equal catchability q 1 q 2 and this ranged from 0 to 0 5 next we set catchability of one species to the base value of 0 04 and changed catchability of the other species from 0 to 0 5 we repeated this for both species 2 7 2 5 imperfect exploiter knowledge we examined the effect of imperfect exploiter knowledge of expected net revenue in each site by allowing the coefficient of variation of process error cve eq 12 to range from the multispecies base case value of 0 perfect knowledge to 0 15 2 7 2 6 number of exploiters available gross revenue per exploiter altering the initial gross revenue per exploiter re changes the maximum number of exploiters in the system since number of exploiters is inversely related to re we allowed re to range from 5000 to 45 000 the multispecies base case value is 25 000 2 7 2 7 concentration coefficient of fleet dynamics equations the concentration coefficient d in the fleet dynamics equation eqs 14 15 determines the degree to which exploiters concentrate their effort in the best places in the multispecies base case d 2 and we examined the influence of values of d from 0 to 3 2 7 2 8 costs when costs fixed and variable increase we expect fewer individuals to be exploited since it will be less profitable to take them additionally as costs increase individuals farthest from the entry point should experience less exploitation since they will be most expensive to harvest for the first cost scenario fixed cost f ranged between 0 and 1500 base case value was 600 for the second cost scenario variable cost v ranged from 0 to 250 base case value was 100 3 results 3 1 exploitation scenarios 3 1 1 single species base case this scenario serves as a point of comparison to quantify the impact on depletion for each additional scenario parameters were selected so that across all 500 simulations in the single species base case median abundance of the target species was 38 of initial abundance in year 300 fig 3 fig 4 and no simulations resulted in extinction in all scenarios spatial distribution of individuals played an important role because habitat grids were randomly generated there was variability in mean distance of individuals from the point where exploiters entered 0 0 and the nearer the rare species was to the entry point on average the more depleted it was at the end of the simulations fig 5 3 1 2 allee effect with an allee effect target species abundance declined further than in the single species base case stabilizing at 32 of initial population size and 95 confidence intervals changed from 9 68 in the single species base case to 0 64 for the allee effect fig 4 in addition 5 of simulations resulted in extinction 3 1 2 1 anthropogenic allee effect for the anthropogenic allee effect the target species also stabilized at a lower population size than the single species base case 32 vs 38 fig 4 but unlike the allee effect scenario no simulations resulted in extinction 3 1 2 2 multispecies base case for opportunistic exploitation when a second species was added to the single species base case median depletion of the rare species decreased from 38 to 32 and the percent of simulations in which the rare species went extinct increased from 0 to 1 declines were greater when starting population grids were more correlated between the two species fig 6 fig 3 demonstrates this outcome there was relatively little effect of adding a second species if the correlation between the distribution of both species was strongly negative top row fig 3 whereas opportunistic exploitation occurs more often and the rare species declines to extinction when there is strong positive correlation bottom row fig 3 3 2 impact of model attributes on opportunistic exploitation we compared the extent of population depletion at the end of 300 year simulations for 15 different scenarios each investigating the impact of different parameter changes or model scenarios on opportunistic depletion fig 7 3 2 1 gross revenue per species as gross revenue of the rare species increased the rare species was further depleted fig 7a relative to the multispecies base case the impact on the common species was more complicated it was most depleted when the rare species gross revenue was 1 38 times larger than common species gross revenue and was least depleted when the common species had no value as gross revenue of the common species increased the impact of opportunistic exploitation on the rare species increased somewhat and was greatest when the gross revenue of the common species was at 73 of the rare species fig 7b above this point the common species itself was almost as valuable as the rare species and the rare species was relieved of some exploitation pressure across the range of values examined median final abundance of the rare species was 28 38 of initial abundance 3 2 2 growth rates as population growth rate of the rare species increased the rare species was less depleted fig 7c when growth rate of the common species increased the common species was much more resilient to exploitation which allowed continued opportunistic exploitation to occur on the rare species resulting in it becoming slightly more depleted fig 7d when growth rates for both species were allowed to increase at the same time they both became more resilient to exploitation and had higher terminal abundance fig 7e thus growth rate of the rare species was the most influential factor in determining its extinction risk 3 2 3 population size when the carrying capacity of the rare species was higher it ended up more depleted as a ratio of initial size because there was more gross revenue in the system which encouraged more exploiters to join the system fig 7f increasing the carrying capacity of the common species also greatly increased the median depletion of the rare species which declined from 35 to 4 of initial abundance fig 7g 3 2 4 ease of capturing species catchability as the probability of capturing one individual increased for the rare species its abundance declined rapidly to extinction and this was true whether the catchability for the common species remained the same fig 7h or increased fig 7j if the probability of successfully capturing the common species alone increased however this did not have a large impact on the depletion of the rare species fig 7i and demonstrated a small but interesting effect at intermediate catchability of the common species the rare species was more depleted but at high catchability the common species declined and it was no longer profitable to continue exploitation resulting in the rare species recovering slightly 3 2 5 imperfect exploiter knowledge with slightly imperfect knowledge cve 0 0092 exploiters explored more of the sites resulting in the rare species becoming more depleted down to 9 of initial abundance but as sigma increased further the rare species actually recovered to levels well above the multispecies base case in which knowledge was perfect fig 7k 3 2 6 number of exploiters available gross revenue per exploiter the available gross revenue per exploiter and in turn the number of exploiters in the system had very little impact on the final depletion of the common species fig 7l however when there were fewer exploiters it took longer to reach the equilibrium level of depletion 3 2 7 concentration coefficient of fleet dynamics equations at high concentration coefficients exploitation effort was more concentrated in sites with higher net revenue and this resulted in primary and common species both being more depleted fig 7m above a certain level of concentration about 1 5 however there was little change in final depletion levels 3 2 8 costs with increases in either variable costs fig 7n or fixed costs fig 7o there was less depletion of both the primary and common species 4 discussion we analyzed four possible extinction pathways single species exploitation the allee effect the anthropogenic allee effect and opportunistic exploitation our analysis demonstrated key factors that influence the exploitation of a species including how exploitation of one species influences depletion of another when compared to our single species base case model the allee effect the anthropogenic allee effect and opportunistic exploitation all increased depletion of the rare species capturing the effects predicted by the original hypotheses while opportunistic exploitation caused the quickest decline in abundance the allee effect the anthropogenic allee effect and opportunistic exploitation resulted in comparable equilibrium depletion levels as predicted by branch et al 2013 under certain circumstances opportunistic exploitation can result in increased depletion or extinction of the rare and more valuable species that would not occur in a single species scenario we identify high gross revenue ease of capture and a high population size of the more common and less valuable species as the main factors that increase the effect of opportunistic exploitation our results suggest that the economic attributes of the system are the most important drivers of opportunistic exploitation in our simulations available gross revenue from the common species drove opportunistic exploitation it must be profitable to continue exploiting the common species even when the higher value species is scarce we found that the rare species was more depleted when the common species had sufficient value to continue exploitation supporting the hypothesis behind opportunistic exploitation unexpectedly as gross revenue of the common species increased towards a level that is equal to that of the rare species we found the rare species was less depleted this occurs because when the common species is only marginally less valuable than the rare species exploiters will target it more heavily resulting in declines and reducing opportunities for encountering the rarer species while exploiting the common species similarly our results suggest that cost of exploitation influences depletion of both species the common species is more impacted by changes in costs and a diminished ability to profitably harvest the common species decreases the intensity of opportunistic exploitation not only do the underlying economics of the system matter but the exploiters perception of the profitability of the system matters as well in our simulations when exploiters have perfect knowledge about expected net revenue of each site they never visit sites with a negative expected net revenue these sites may have individuals of the rare species in them but they are economically extinct when exploiters have slightly imperfect knowledge however there was some probability that they would visit sites they would not have visited given perfect knowledge and thus further deplete the rare species as uncertainty continued to increase though both species became less depleted in such circumstances neither species is targeted but instead both are randomly captured similar to throwing darts blindfolded these results suggest that it is important to understand how decisions are made by exploiters when investigating potential for extinction our models of exploiter behavior are relatively simplistic opening up an avenue for future work to develop better models of human learning and knowledge acquisition the ease of capture of each species was one of the few factors with a close correlation to extinction risk in our analysis our results show that catchability of the rare species has a high direct correlation with extinction risk while the probability of successfully capturing the common species did not have a large impact high correlations between the distributions of the species makes capturing the rare species much easier based on this research the population size of the common species is also influential the larger the common species carrying capacity was the further depleted the rare species became when there were more individuals of the common species increased gross revenue in the system allowed for more encounters of the rare species this can be compared to hyperpredation where a supplemental food source for predators allows them to increase in abundance and drive down particular prey species courchamp et al 1999b such as introduced rabbits subsidizing a cat population which can then deplete native birds courchamp et al 1999b 2000 our results indicate that populations with higher growth rates can sustain higher levels of exploitation when the common species had a higher growth rate than the rare species its population was maintained at a larger size this allowed exploiters to continue profitably searching areas for longer periods of time encountering more of the rare species these findings are consistent with the high threat of overexploitation in high trophic level large bodied slow growing and low fecundity species e g cardillo and bromham 2001 larson and olden 2010 owens and bennett 2000 purvis et al 2000 reynolds 2003 such species could face additional pressure when harvested alongside a faster growing species analogous to pressures faced by multispecies fisheries where less productive stocks are commonly overfished e g hilborn et al 2012 there are additional factors beyond those we examined that are likely to influence extinction risk one is range size of each species we assumed that each species had an equivalent range size and that individuals could move anywhere in our grid we therefore could not draw conclusions about the impact of range size on the effect of opportunistic exploitation it is well recognized in the literature that geographic range size is a strong predictor of extinction vulnerability where species with small range sizes are more at risk e g cardillo et al 2008 cooper et al 2008 jones et al 2003 purvis et al 2000 in some cases it is more advantageous to allocate conservation resources on the basis of small geographic range size than on body size or fecundity jones et al 2003 it is thus reasonable to hypothesize that opportunistic exploitation would have larger effects on species with smaller range sizes further the effect would be largest when the rare species has a small range that completely overlaps with good habitat for the common species as we have shown that high spatial correlation leads to further depletion here we only simulated situations with one or two species that are exploited in reality many ecosystems include more than two exploited species examples in branch et al 2013 include logging of many species of trees resulting in declines in large leaf mahogany and fishing for multiple sea cucumber species causing major declines in the most valuable species we expect the impact of opportunistic exploitation to be magnified when more than two species are harvested since this is analogous to increasing the common species population size and gross revenue or further reducing search costs while the simplicity of our model allows for generalizations it does not include specific ecological attributes of each species or behavioral attributes of the exploiter that could have significant impacts on depletion of each species future work could take advantage of advances in machine learning to allow exploiters to automatically improve their search techniques over time with increased knowledge of species distribution investigate impacts of opportunistic exploitation within metapopulations and build models based on specific attributes of species that are likely to be impacted by opportunistic exploitation another dimension that could be explored in great detail is criminality i e poaching and the impact of punitive costs or perceived enforcement on exploiter behavior our models also assume that each extinction pathway acts in isolation in reality extinction risk will be increased due to interactions between extinction pathways opportunistic exploitation could lead to the rare species passing below an allee effect threshold or a great increase in price due to the anthropogenic allee effect potentially leading to greater depletion than either pathway would cause independently 4 1 conservation implications our results emphasize how sensitive extinction is to factors intrinsic to each species and the exploitation system perhaps most importantly our results support that the multispecies attributes of a scenario are as important if not more important than the attributes of individual species in predicting depletion many factors influence the intensity of opportunistic exploitation but we conclude that the factors most critical to predicting depletion rate are profitability of capturing the common species and abundance of the common species conservation budgets are insufficient to conserve all of the world s biodiversity and there is increasing pressure for triage investment balmford et al 2003 wilson et al 2011 giving resources to the most endangered or charismatic species will not usually maximize the number of species saved balmford et al 2003 however investments in multispecies systems may be effective at maintaining biodiversity when targeted at rare species that are vulnerable due to profitable exploitation of more common species additionally our work highlights the critical importance of tracking emerging markets species that were once safe because exploitation was unprofitable could face new risks if harvest is initiated on common species in the same area this occurred when the bottom trawl fishery off india s coromandel coast commercialized formerly discarded bycatch species allowing the continued harvest of rare species beyond the former point of unprofitability lobo et al 2010 as climate changes distributions of many species will shift in latitude elevation and size carroll et al 2003 chen et al 2011 kelly and goulden 2008 parmesan and yohe 2003 resulting in sympatry of species that were formerly separated we show that spatially correlated distributions among species greatly increases depletion risk to rare species thus as we study the impact of these range shifts it will be important to understand how spatial distributions of harvest will change how local communities will change and where new instances of opportunistic exploitation will emerge we show that single species exploitation models can miss important drivers of depletion because of this we believe more accurate management models can be achieved by accounting for multispecies dynamics in the evaluation of policies until we incorporate multispecies drivers of exploitation into models in which these dynamics are relevant extinction risk will be underestimated as managers and researchers continue to understand which species are most at risk of extinction and how to best spend conservation resources it will be important to protect

24606,extinction rates are increasing globally and direct exploitation is an important driver many pathways have been proposed to explain how exploitation can lead to extinction one of these proposed but understudied multispecies pathways is opportunistic exploitation which occurs when a highly valuable but rare species is encountered and targeted during exploitation of a less valuable but more common target species using individual based simulations of exploiters in a two species spatial model we contribute evidence which supports that opportunistic exploitation increases depletion when compared to single species exploitation and is as detrimental to the more valuable rare species as the anthropogenic allee effect where price increases with rarity and the allee effect where population growth declines at low abundance the most important factors affecting the impact of opportunistic exploitation are gross revenue and abundance of the more common less valuable species while ease of capture and growth rate of the more common less valuable species are less important thus valuable but rare species are most at risk when harvested alongside low value abundant species this information is relevant for managers focused on protection of rare species in multispecies systems keywords extinction depensation over harvesting opportunistic exploitation conservation threatened 1 introduction although extinction itself may ultimately be inevitable the rate at which it is occurring has been exacerbated by human activity bascompte 2003 compelling evidence shows that earth s biota is amid its sixth mass extinction and recent extinction rates are both unparalleled in human history and highly unusual in earth s history baillie et al 2004 ceballos et al 2015 many major processes driving an increase in extinction rates are anthropogenic including direct human exploitation habitat loss climate change and introduced species diamond et al 1989 ichii et al 2019 keith et al 2008 purvis et al 2000 thomas et al 2004 the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services identifies direct exploitation as the second most important driver of change in the global state of nature ichii et al 2019 and biological resource use is listed as a threat for all 189 species listed as extinct or extinct in the wild on the iucn red list iucn 2020 when exploitation is directly targeted on a single species extinction is expected to be relatively uncommon e g grafton et al 2007 this is because as population size decreases search costs nearly always begin to outweigh revenue except in obvious cases where species are extraordinarily valuable or can be easily exploited e g dodos nevertheless extinction and serious depletion have been reported for many exploited species resulting in a variety of hypotheses that provide explanations for high extinction risks under single species exploitation including tragedy of the commons feeny et al 1990 1996 hardin 1968 ostrom 1999 ostrom et al 1999 economics of overexploitation clark 1973 grafton et al 2007 the allee effect allee 1931 stephens et al 1999 and the anthropogenic allee effect courchamp et al 2006 intrinsic biological factors that decrease mean individual fitness at low population sizes can also increase extinction risk collectively termed the allee effect allee 1931 stephens et al 1999 reproduction and survival can be diminished in small populations through numerous mechanisms which include mate shortage lack of cooperation and genetic allee effects such as inbreeding depression in such cases species can suffer reproductive failure at low densities resulting in rapid extinction once the population falls below a minimum population size this phenomenon has been blamed for the demise of passenger pigeons e g stephens and sutherland 1999 an allied hypothesis is the anthropogenic allee effect where instead of lower survival at low numbers income from exploitation increases markedly at low numbers courchamp et al 2006 the classic case is when rare products such as beluga sturgeon caviar become disproportionately valuable because of their rarity allowing for profitable overexploitation examples of species experiencing anthropogenic allee effects include spectacular butterflies sought by collectors goat antelopes family caprinae sought by trophy hunters geckos goniurosaurus luii captured to be exotic pets large game birds tetrao urogallus impacted by ecotourism and the chinese bahaba exploited for its perceived medicinal value courchamp et al 2006 holden and mcdonald madden 2017 in short sometimes people are prepared to pay exorbitant prices to hunt collect or own specimens of the rarest species all preceding explanations assume single species exploitation but when exploitation directly targets more than one species the number of extinction pathways expands for example when many species are exploited together e g through fisheries trawling gear attempting to maximize overall revenue causes some species to decline to low levels e g hilborn et al 2012 ricker 1958 three modes of exploitation can be distinguished depending on the relative value of the various species accidental exploitation where there is accidental by catch while targeting a species with economic value hall et al 2000 rasmussen et al 2011 incidental exploitation in which a less desirable species with lower economic value is exploited while pursuing a higher value target species megalofonou 2005 and opportunistic exploitation where a rare species with high monetary value is stumbled upon during targeted exploitation of a more abundant less valuable target species branch et al 2013 opportunistic exploitation allows for valuable yet scarce species hereafter rare species to be exploited while profitably targeting another more common species because there are reduced or zero search costs associated with exploitation of the rare species thus in multispecies exploitation scenarios there is a continuum of extinction pathways from accidental exploitation to incidental exploitation to opportunistic exploitation as value of the vulnerable species increases relative to other targeted species of these three pathways opportunistic exploitation is most problematic since this mode involves the greatest economic incentive to continue exploitation of the species most at risk branch et al 2013 consider the case where black rhinoceroses diceros bicornis were hunted to extinction in the luangwa valley zambia even though illegally poaching rhino alone was not profitable due to their rarity milner gulland and leader williams 1992 hypotheses assuming only single species systems cannot fully explain this extinction event in this case illegal poaching was profitable when elephants and rhinos were hunted together and as rhinos became rare elephants became the main target milner gulland and leader williams 1992 thus opportunistic exploitation contributed to the extinction of black rhinoceros in zambia in the 1990s chomba and matandiko 2011 while hypotheses based on both single species and multispecies exploitation pathways have been proposed to explain extinctions none develop a firm mathematical foundation for a general understanding of extinction risks that includes single species and multispecies pathways although opportunistic exploitation is likely the most destructive pathway to extinction it is also least understood to fill this gap we developed models to examine the effect of key biological and economic factors that influence extinction risk and assess both single species and multispecies modes of extinction we used individual based models to replicate conditions that can lead to extinction from human exploitation finding that opportunistic exploitation in multispecies systems increases extinction risk of the more valuable rare species and surprisingly also increases risk to the common less valuable species compared to exploitation of a single target species 2 methods we developed models to evaluate factors that we thought were likely to influence extinction risk of exploited species 1 patchiness distribution and movement of species 2 catchability which combines detectability of the species and search effort of the exploiter 3 population dynamics governing how abundance varies over time 4 exploiter knowledge of species distribution and 5 net revenue from exploitation we simulated the population of three types of entities exploiters and two types of harvestable species the agents of these two harvestable species inhabited a grid of g 2 discrete sites where each site has a specified habitat quality for each species at the beginning of each time step the population size of each harvestable species changed according to discrete time logistic growth equation with poisson process error after the population size was calculated individuals of both harvestable species moved throughout the grid according to habitat quality once individuals moved exploitation occurred exploiter agents had the opportunity to enter the grid sequentially from a single entry point on the outside of the grid once per time step and their cost to harvest increased with distance travelled exploiters did not learn over the course of the simulations so there was no change over time in how well they were able to predict locations of individual animals each exploiter could capture either zero or one individual per time step exploiters were assumed to be identical in knowledge costs and search abilities values used for parameters can be found in table 1 and a general simulation framework can be found in fig 1 these simulations were completed in r r core team 2013 and source code is available at github com sthurner11 a detailed model description which follows the odd overview design concept details protocol for describing individual based models grimm et al 2010 2020 is available in the supplementary material appendix s1 2 1 generating habitat grids habitat quality values h s i were assigned to every cell in the g g grids 10 10 by default for each species s denoting habitat quality for that species at each grid cell i 1 g 2 grid cells are referred to hereafter as sites habitat quality grids were generated using random fields as implemented in r package randomfields schlather et al 2015 2020 where covariance changes between sites as a matérn function of distance thorson et al 2015 the resulting values were log habitat quality with low values representing areas of poor quality and high values representing areas of good quality we generated habitat grids along a gradient from random to patchy by changing parameter m which governs the smoothness of the matérn function and ranges from zero we used 0 0001 to avoid numerical issues for completely random habitat quality to 0 8 for highly patchy habitat quality fig 2 for the simulations we generated 40 200 pairs of habitat quality grids where grids were paired for each of two species with each grid having a randomly selected value of m u 0 0001 0 8 this ensured enough pairs were generated for the procedure outlined below grid pairs were sorted by the randomly emerging correlations between abundance in sites across species binned into five equal bins with correlations that ranged from 0 5 to 0 5 and then 100 pairs were randomly chosen from each bin each of the resulting 500 grid pairs was used as a habitat quality grid for one of n 500 simulations for each scenario 2 2 distributing starting population the starting population size we assumed the population starts at carrying capacity ks for each species s was distributed into the relevant grid in proportion to habitat quality the number of individuals for species s and site i at time period t 0 n s i t 0 was obtained by drawing ks individuals from a multinomial distribution with probabilities pi derived from the g habitat quality values for each site i 1 p i exp h s i j g exp h s j 2 n s i t 0 multinomial k s p i 2 3 population dynamics at the beginning of each time step the population of each species changed according to the discrete time logistic growth equation with poisson process error after population growth individuals were allowed to move and then exploitation occurred there was no exploitation in year 0 the sum of individuals across all i sites denoted by for species s at time t is given by n s t thus 3 n s t 0 k s 4 θ s t 1 n s t c s t r s n s t c s t 1 n s t c s t k s 5 n s t 1 pois θ s t 1 intrinsic growth rates rs and carrying capacities k s were pre specified for each species and c s t shows the total amount of individuals removed in year t after calculating n s t 1 we applied movement redistributing individuals proportional to habitat quality using the same process applied to distribute individuals at t 1 eqs 1 and 2 2 4 cost the cost for an exploiter to harvest one individual depends on a variable cost v multiplied by distance a fixed cost per trip f that combined gear labor and opportunity cost i e foregone revenue from alternatives to species exploitation and a capture cost α that is zero if no individual is captured capture cost is the cost of gear e g ammunition and labor needed to capture an individual exploiters entered the grid at location 0 0 and moved to the center of a site the bottom left site is centered on 0 5 0 5 we calculated distance as a straight line distance from the origin 0 0 to the center of each site creating a matrix of distances to each site d the total cost c of visiting and capturing an individual in each site was 6 c i v d i f a 2 5 effort expected gross revenue and net revenue the number of exploiters e is expected to increase when more gross revenue is available such that average gross revenue per exploiter is constant as predicted by the ideal free distribution fretwell 1972 1969 at the start of each simulation gross revenue available per exploiter re t 0 is total gross revenue divided by number of exploiters 7 r e t 0 r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 e here r 1 and r 2 are the gross revenues obtained from exploiting one individual of each species because we assumed that each exploiter would receive equal gross revenue across simulation scenarios the number of exploiters in each scenario was determined as a function of re t 0 8 e r 1 k 1 r 2 k 2 r e t 0 exploiters entered the grid sequentially and have no knowledge of which sites they or other exploiters have visited we assumed that each exploiter could only capture one individual in a given time step to implement this we first calculated the probability of encountering at least one individual of species s at a given site and time p s i t 9 p s i t 1 1 q s n s i t where q s is catchability the probability of encountering one individual of species s at a site given presence and n s i t is the number of individuals of species s in each site we assumed that an encountered individual can be caught using this we then calculated the potential gross revenue matrix ρ i t which is the expected gross revenue from successfully exploiting species 1 plus the expected gross revenue from successfully exploiting species 2 if you did not exploit species 1 in each site we assume that if both species are encountered in a given cell the more valuable species will always be exploited 10 ρ i t r 1 p 1 i t r 2 p 2 i t 1 p 1 i t of key importance in most scenarios we run and as reflected in eq 10 species 1 will be the rarer and more valuable species and species 2 the more common and less valuable species to mimic the kinds of scenarios that lead to opportunistic exploitation after calculating potential gross revenue we calculated potential net revenue for each site as 11 π i t ρ i t c i to relax the assumption of perfect knowledge we included observation error in the net revenue grid this converts the potential net revenue grid to a perceived net revenue grid which is the observed net revenue grid on which the exploiters act and accounts for their imperfect knowledge we assumed that the coefficient of variation cve of this observation error was the same for all exploiters and all time steps observation error o t was calculated for every site where 12 o i t n 0 s d c v e i n 1 i 0 r 1 n 2 i 0 r 2 g 2 therefore the perceived net revenue grid for the exploiter was 13 π i t ρ i t c i o i t using the exploiter s net revenue we calculated the probability b of this individual exploiter going to each site i using fleet dynamics equations from hilborn et al 2006 14 b i t exp d 1 π i t π max t where d is the concentration coefficient of exploiters and takes values between 0 and 3 high values of d result in more concentrated effort in sites with higher expected net revenue we then calculated b i t as 15 b i t b i t i b i t exploiters were assigned to each site using a multinomial draw with probability b i t of being in site i if the site they were assigned to had negative estimated net revenue π i t 0 exploiters did not venture forth once an exploiter was assigned a site to visit we conducted separate binomial draws for each species to determine if one of the individuals present in the site was encountered with probability of success p s i t if only one species was encountered they were taken unless the gross revenue of the individual was less than the capture cost a if the exploiter encountered individuals of both species the more valuable species was taken or if both species had the same gross revenue there was a 50 chance of taking each steps were repeated for each exploiter in every time step total removals in year t are shown in eq 5 since exploiters were assumed to be identical in all respects multiple exploiters taking single trips is functionally equivalent to a single exploiter taking multiple trips at the end of time step t the total number of individuals remaining in the population is the number that were there at the start minus the total number caught c s t 2 6 metrics at the end of the final time step t we calculated depletion as the proportion of the initial population that was remaining for each species n s t t c s t t k s in each simulation we computed the median and 95 intervals of these depletion values across all 500 simulations for a given scenario where each scenario refers to a structural or parametric change to the model and the 500 simulations within a scenario are associated with each of the 500 habitat quality grids pairs described in section 2 1 these metrics allow us to compare depletion levels between species and among scenarios in addition we calculated extinction risk for both species as the proportion of simulations where the species goes extinct 2 7 scenarios we developed a single species base case and compared this to single species scenarios with allee effects and with anthropogenic allee effects next we developed a multispecies base case which modeled opportunistic exploitation to examine the comparative effect of adding a second species lastly we examined the effects of changing species value population growth population size catchability exploiter knowledge gross revenue per exploiter the concentration coefficient of exploiters and cost levels on the intensity of opportunistic exploitation 2 7 1 exploitation scenarios 2 7 1 1 single species base case the single species base case explored the scenario where only one species is exploited as would occur if rhinos were the only targeted species and elephants had no value we chose parameter values which resulted in the population size of the rare exploited species declining on average by about60 at the end of the simulation period 300 years table 1 these parameter values were retained for other scenarios except for adjustments to test hypotheses in this case species 2 is twice as numerous 2000 vs 1000 and has no value gross revenue 0 vs 2000 but is otherwise identical to species 1 the less common but more valuable target species 2 7 1 2 allee effect in populations affected by the allee effect as population size decreases per capita rate of increase declines courchamp et al 1999a instead of increasing as would be expected under negative density dependence i e eq 4 we implemented the allee effect depensation using a modified version of hilborn et al 2014 where population growth rate declines by 50 when population size is n 50 16 n s t 1 n s t c s t t r s n s t c s t t 1 n s t c s t t k s 1 0 5 n s t c s t t n 50 we specified n 50 0 25 k s which has the effect of reducing population growth by 29 at 40 of carrying capacity and by 86 at 5 of carrying capacity for the base parameter values the gross revenue of species 2 was set to zero as in the single species base case 2 7 1 3 anthropogenic allee effect under the anthropogenic allee effect the value of products increases considerably at low abundance we assumed the revenue abundance relationship in holden and mcdonald madden 2017 for gross revenue 17 r s t m s b s n s t z s here m s is the minimum value per individual harvested when the species is abundant and m s b s is the price paid when there is a single individual left n s t 1 when z s is greater than 0 gross revenue is highest when the species is rare and as z s increases gross revenue increases more steeply with rarity holden and mcdonald madden 2017 using this equation we recalculated the gross revenue for the rare species rhinos at the beginning of each time step using the values m 1 r 1 2000 and assumed that gross revenue doubled at the lowest abundance hence b 1 2000 we chose a moderate value of z 1 0 5 for the rate of price increase the gross revenue of species 2 was set to zero 2 7 1 4 multispecies base case for opportunistic exploitation opportunistic exploitation arises when a common species has non zero value the two species case branch et al 2013 predict that opportunistic exploitation will occur when a more common but less valuable species is also exploited in this scenario the more common species was half as valuable as the rare species r 1 2000 r 2 1000 and had twice as many individuals at t 1 k 2 2000 but in all other respects was identical to the rare species and all other parameters were the same as in the single species base case table 1 2 7 2 impact of model attributes on opportunistic exploitation the remaining scenarios all use the same parameters as the multispecies base case for opportunistic exploitation except for changes to specific parameters mentioned below 2 7 2 1 gross revenue per species opportunistic exploitation is predicted to be more severe as gross revenue increases for the rare species r 1 or the more common species r 2 or as the ratio of the two r 2 r 1 increases in the first scenario we varied gross revenue for the rare species between 1000 dollars and 10 000 dollars so that r 2 r 1 ranged from 1 to 1 10 in the second scenario we varied gross revenue for the more common species between 0 dollars and 2000 dollars so that r 2 r 1 ranged from 0 to 1 2 7 2 2 growth rates we examined the sensitivity of our results to intrinsic growth rates r of each species in two ways first we held growth rates of both species equal r 1 r 2 and looked at the impact of a range of growth rates between 0 and 0 4 then we examined the impact of unequal growth rates by setting the growth rate of one species to the multispecies base case value of 0 1 and changing the growth rate of the other species between 0 and 0 4 we repeated this for both species 2 7 2 3 population size depletion of the rare species will be dependent on abundance of the rare species in the system greater abundance results in more available gross revenue in this scenario we examined a range of values for abundance at time 0 of the rare species from 100 to 2000 opportunistic exploitation is predicted to be more problematic when the common species is more abundant because the common species will allow for a longer period of profitable exploitation in this scenario we examined a range of values for abundance at time 0 of the common species from 1000 to 50 000 2 7 2 4 ease of capturing species catchability we investigated the sensitivity of our results to catchability q 1 and q 2 of each species in two ways first both species had equal catchability q 1 q 2 and this ranged from 0 to 0 5 next we set catchability of one species to the base value of 0 04 and changed catchability of the other species from 0 to 0 5 we repeated this for both species 2 7 2 5 imperfect exploiter knowledge we examined the effect of imperfect exploiter knowledge of expected net revenue in each site by allowing the coefficient of variation of process error cve eq 12 to range from the multispecies base case value of 0 perfect knowledge to 0 15 2 7 2 6 number of exploiters available gross revenue per exploiter altering the initial gross revenue per exploiter re changes the maximum number of exploiters in the system since number of exploiters is inversely related to re we allowed re to range from 5000 to 45 000 the multispecies base case value is 25 000 2 7 2 7 concentration coefficient of fleet dynamics equations the concentration coefficient d in the fleet dynamics equation eqs 14 15 determines the degree to which exploiters concentrate their effort in the best places in the multispecies base case d 2 and we examined the influence of values of d from 0 to 3 2 7 2 8 costs when costs fixed and variable increase we expect fewer individuals to be exploited since it will be less profitable to take them additionally as costs increase individuals farthest from the entry point should experience less exploitation since they will be most expensive to harvest for the first cost scenario fixed cost f ranged between 0 and 1500 base case value was 600 for the second cost scenario variable cost v ranged from 0 to 250 base case value was 100 3 results 3 1 exploitation scenarios 3 1 1 single species base case this scenario serves as a point of comparison to quantify the impact on depletion for each additional scenario parameters were selected so that across all 500 simulations in the single species base case median abundance of the target species was 38 of initial abundance in year 300 fig 3 fig 4 and no simulations resulted in extinction in all scenarios spatial distribution of individuals played an important role because habitat grids were randomly generated there was variability in mean distance of individuals from the point where exploiters entered 0 0 and the nearer the rare species was to the entry point on average the more depleted it was at the end of the simulations fig 5 3 1 2 allee effect with an allee effect target species abundance declined further than in the single species base case stabilizing at 32 of initial population size and 95 confidence intervals changed from 9 68 in the single species base case to 0 64 for the allee effect fig 4 in addition 5 of simulations resulted in extinction 3 1 2 1 anthropogenic allee effect for the anthropogenic allee effect the target species also stabilized at a lower population size than the single species base case 32 vs 38 fig 4 but unlike the allee effect scenario no simulations resulted in extinction 3 1 2 2 multispecies base case for opportunistic exploitation when a second species was added to the single species base case median depletion of the rare species decreased from 38 to 32 and the percent of simulations in which the rare species went extinct increased from 0 to 1 declines were greater when starting population grids were more correlated between the two species fig 6 fig 3 demonstrates this outcome there was relatively little effect of adding a second species if the correlation between the distribution of both species was strongly negative top row fig 3 whereas opportunistic exploitation occurs more often and the rare species declines to extinction when there is strong positive correlation bottom row fig 3 3 2 impact of model attributes on opportunistic exploitation we compared the extent of population depletion at the end of 300 year simulations for 15 different scenarios each investigating the impact of different parameter changes or model scenarios on opportunistic depletion fig 7 3 2 1 gross revenue per species as gross revenue of the rare species increased the rare species was further depleted fig 7a relative to the multispecies base case the impact on the common species was more complicated it was most depleted when the rare species gross revenue was 1 38 times larger than common species gross revenue and was least depleted when the common species had no value as gross revenue of the common species increased the impact of opportunistic exploitation on the rare species increased somewhat and was greatest when the gross revenue of the common species was at 73 of the rare species fig 7b above this point the common species itself was almost as valuable as the rare species and the rare species was relieved of some exploitation pressure across the range of values examined median final abundance of the rare species was 28 38 of initial abundance 3 2 2 growth rates as population growth rate of the rare species increased the rare species was less depleted fig 7c when growth rate of the common species increased the common species was much more resilient to exploitation which allowed continued opportunistic exploitation to occur on the rare species resulting in it becoming slightly more depleted fig 7d when growth rates for both species were allowed to increase at the same time they both became more resilient to exploitation and had higher terminal abundance fig 7e thus growth rate of the rare species was the most influential factor in determining its extinction risk 3 2 3 population size when the carrying capacity of the rare species was higher it ended up more depleted as a ratio of initial size because there was more gross revenue in the system which encouraged more exploiters to join the system fig 7f increasing the carrying capacity of the common species also greatly increased the median depletion of the rare species which declined from 35 to 4 of initial abundance fig 7g 3 2 4 ease of capturing species catchability as the probability of capturing one individual increased for the rare species its abundance declined rapidly to extinction and this was true whether the catchability for the common species remained the same fig 7h or increased fig 7j if the probability of successfully capturing the common species alone increased however this did not have a large impact on the depletion of the rare species fig 7i and demonstrated a small but interesting effect at intermediate catchability of the common species the rare species was more depleted but at high catchability the common species declined and it was no longer profitable to continue exploitation resulting in the rare species recovering slightly 3 2 5 imperfect exploiter knowledge with slightly imperfect knowledge cve 0 0092 exploiters explored more of the sites resulting in the rare species becoming more depleted down to 9 of initial abundance but as sigma increased further the rare species actually recovered to levels well above the multispecies base case in which knowledge was perfect fig 7k 3 2 6 number of exploiters available gross revenue per exploiter the available gross revenue per exploiter and in turn the number of exploiters in the system had very little impact on the final depletion of the common species fig 7l however when there were fewer exploiters it took longer to reach the equilibrium level of depletion 3 2 7 concentration coefficient of fleet dynamics equations at high concentration coefficients exploitation effort was more concentrated in sites with higher net revenue and this resulted in primary and common species both being more depleted fig 7m above a certain level of concentration about 1 5 however there was little change in final depletion levels 3 2 8 costs with increases in either variable costs fig 7n or fixed costs fig 7o there was less depletion of both the primary and common species 4 discussion we analyzed four possible extinction pathways single species exploitation the allee effect the anthropogenic allee effect and opportunistic exploitation our analysis demonstrated key factors that influence the exploitation of a species including how exploitation of one species influences depletion of another when compared to our single species base case model the allee effect the anthropogenic allee effect and opportunistic exploitation all increased depletion of the rare species capturing the effects predicted by the original hypotheses while opportunistic exploitation caused the quickest decline in abundance the allee effect the anthropogenic allee effect and opportunistic exploitation resulted in comparable equilibrium depletion levels as predicted by branch et al 2013 under certain circumstances opportunistic exploitation can result in increased depletion or extinction of the rare and more valuable species that would not occur in a single species scenario we identify high gross revenue ease of capture and a high population size of the more common and less valuable species as the main factors that increase the effect of opportunistic exploitation our results suggest that the economic attributes of the system are the most important drivers of opportunistic exploitation in our simulations available gross revenue from the common species drove opportunistic exploitation it must be profitable to continue exploiting the common species even when the higher value species is scarce we found that the rare species was more depleted when the common species had sufficient value to continue exploitation supporting the hypothesis behind opportunistic exploitation unexpectedly as gross revenue of the common species increased towards a level that is equal to that of the rare species we found the rare species was less depleted this occurs because when the common species is only marginally less valuable than the rare species exploiters will target it more heavily resulting in declines and reducing opportunities for encountering the rarer species while exploiting the common species similarly our results suggest that cost of exploitation influences depletion of both species the common species is more impacted by changes in costs and a diminished ability to profitably harvest the common species decreases the intensity of opportunistic exploitation not only do the underlying economics of the system matter but the exploiters perception of the profitability of the system matters as well in our simulations when exploiters have perfect knowledge about expected net revenue of each site they never visit sites with a negative expected net revenue these sites may have individuals of the rare species in them but they are economically extinct when exploiters have slightly imperfect knowledge however there was some probability that they would visit sites they would not have visited given perfect knowledge and thus further deplete the rare species as uncertainty continued to increase though both species became less depleted in such circumstances neither species is targeted but instead both are randomly captured similar to throwing darts blindfolded these results suggest that it is important to understand how decisions are made by exploiters when investigating potential for extinction our models of exploiter behavior are relatively simplistic opening up an avenue for future work to develop better models of human learning and knowledge acquisition the ease of capture of each species was one of the few factors with a close correlation to extinction risk in our analysis our results show that catchability of the rare species has a high direct correlation with extinction risk while the probability of successfully capturing the common species did not have a large impact high correlations between the distributions of the species makes capturing the rare species much easier based on this research the population size of the common species is also influential the larger the common species carrying capacity was the further depleted the rare species became when there were more individuals of the common species increased gross revenue in the system allowed for more encounters of the rare species this can be compared to hyperpredation where a supplemental food source for predators allows them to increase in abundance and drive down particular prey species courchamp et al 1999b such as introduced rabbits subsidizing a cat population which can then deplete native birds courchamp et al 1999b 2000 our results indicate that populations with higher growth rates can sustain higher levels of exploitation when the common species had a higher growth rate than the rare species its population was maintained at a larger size this allowed exploiters to continue profitably searching areas for longer periods of time encountering more of the rare species these findings are consistent with the high threat of overexploitation in high trophic level large bodied slow growing and low fecundity species e g cardillo and bromham 2001 larson and olden 2010 owens and bennett 2000 purvis et al 2000 reynolds 2003 such species could face additional pressure when harvested alongside a faster growing species analogous to pressures faced by multispecies fisheries where less productive stocks are commonly overfished e g hilborn et al 2012 there are additional factors beyond those we examined that are likely to influence extinction risk one is range size of each species we assumed that each species had an equivalent range size and that individuals could move anywhere in our grid we therefore could not draw conclusions about the impact of range size on the effect of opportunistic exploitation it is well recognized in the literature that geographic range size is a strong predictor of extinction vulnerability where species with small range sizes are more at risk e g cardillo et al 2008 cooper et al 2008 jones et al 2003 purvis et al 2000 in some cases it is more advantageous to allocate conservation resources on the basis of small geographic range size than on body size or fecundity jones et al 2003 it is thus reasonable to hypothesize that opportunistic exploitation would have larger effects on species with smaller range sizes further the effect would be largest when the rare species has a small range that completely overlaps with good habitat for the common species as we have shown that high spatial correlation leads to further depletion here we only simulated situations with one or two species that are exploited in reality many ecosystems include more than two exploited species examples in branch et al 2013 include logging of many species of trees resulting in declines in large leaf mahogany and fishing for multiple sea cucumber species causing major declines in the most valuable species we expect the impact of opportunistic exploitation to be magnified when more than two species are harvested since this is analogous to increasing the common species population size and gross revenue or further reducing search costs while the simplicity of our model allows for generalizations it does not include specific ecological attributes of each species or behavioral attributes of the exploiter that could have significant impacts on depletion of each species future work could take advantage of advances in machine learning to allow exploiters to automatically improve their search techniques over time with increased knowledge of species distribution investigate impacts of opportunistic exploitation within metapopulations and build models based on specific attributes of species that are likely to be impacted by opportunistic exploitation another dimension that could be explored in great detail is criminality i e poaching and the impact of punitive costs or perceived enforcement on exploiter behavior our models also assume that each extinction pathway acts in isolation in reality extinction risk will be increased due to interactions between extinction pathways opportunistic exploitation could lead to the rare species passing below an allee effect threshold or a great increase in price due to the anthropogenic allee effect potentially leading to greater depletion than either pathway would cause independently 4 1 conservation implications our results emphasize how sensitive extinction is to factors intrinsic to each species and the exploitation system perhaps most importantly our results support that the multispecies attributes of a scenario are as important if not more important than the attributes of individual species in predicting depletion many factors influence the intensity of opportunistic exploitation but we conclude that the factors most critical to predicting depletion rate are profitability of capturing the common species and abundance of the common species conservation budgets are insufficient to conserve all of the world s biodiversity and there is increasing pressure for triage investment balmford et al 2003 wilson et al 2011 giving resources to the most endangered or charismatic species will not usually maximize the number of species saved balmford et al 2003 however investments in multispecies systems may be effective at maintaining biodiversity when targeted at rare species that are vulnerable due to profitable exploitation of more common species additionally our work highlights the critical importance of tracking emerging markets species that were once safe because exploitation was unprofitable could face new risks if harvest is initiated on common species in the same area this occurred when the bottom trawl fishery off india s coromandel coast commercialized formerly discarded bycatch species allowing the continued harvest of rare species beyond the former point of unprofitability lobo et al 2010 as climate changes distributions of many species will shift in latitude elevation and size carroll et al 2003 chen et al 2011 kelly and goulden 2008 parmesan and yohe 2003 resulting in sympatry of species that were formerly separated we show that spatially correlated distributions among species greatly increases depletion risk to rare species thus as we study the impact of these range shifts it will be important to understand how spatial distributions of harvest will change how local communities will change and where new instances of opportunistic exploitation will emerge we show that single species exploitation models can miss important drivers of depletion because of this we believe more accurate management models can be achieved by accounting for multispecies dynamics in the evaluation of policies until we incorporate multispecies drivers of exploitation into models in which these dynamics are relevant extinction risk will be underestimated as managers and researchers continue to understand which species are most at risk of extinction and how to best spend conservation resources it will be important to protect rare species that are most likely to be the targets of opportunistic exploitation funding the research of tb and sdt was supported by the richard c and lois m worthington endowed professorship in

24607,as a result of anthropogenic pressure three drives are expected to affect brazilian savannas an increase in the dry season more frequent fire events and defaunation these drivers are a trigger for biodiversity loss and undermine the ecosystems services like carbon storage here our goal was to analyze how these drivers can affect the structure and dynamics of the savanna s tree species and how they impact the savanna s total estimating aboveground biomass agb we analysed eight sites that comprise a physiognomic gradient from open savanna to savanna woodland the species were classified by three traits phenological strategies deciduous or evergreen fire resistance resprouting or non resprouting and dispersal syndrome animal or non animal then we modelled agb loss in a dry season in the austral winter a 2 c increase in daily temperature five fire events by decadal series and a defaunation scenario although climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation effects impact agb separately they also have a synergistic effect this effect was observed in functional strategies and also in the total agb of the community in some cases the total agb loss exceeded 70 the negative effects on performance were highest in species which were decidual non resprouting and which employed animal dispersal for their seed if different types of disturbances are not controlled in the near future savanna communities will be dominated by evergreen resprouters and non animal dispersed species representing a steeply decline in the diversity of species and ecosystem functions graphical abtsract image graphical abstract keywords cerrado forest simulations disturbance carbon balance biodiversity loss biodiversity management 1 introduction the savanna is a type of vegetation found mainly in south america africa and australia that has different physiognomies occurring in soils with low fertility and tropical climates with a defined dry season when natural fires occur coutinho 1990 durigan and ratter 2016 solbrig 1996 soil fertility gradients are the primary driver of the physiognomic variation goodland and pollard 1973 lehmann et al 2011 murphy and bowman 2012 the savanna is an important carbon sink and thus climate regulator ratnam et al 2011 solbrig 1996 and it plays a key role in other ecosystem services such as the provision of food to humans and improvement of freshwater and air quality batlle bayer et al 2010 klink and machado 2005 nabout et al 2011 nevertheless ecosystem services provided by the savanna are now at risk of being lost due to anthropic changes such as land conversion abreu et al 2017 cardoso da silva and bates 2002 carvalho et al 2009 the introduction of exotic species aguiar et al 2014 defaunation cavarzere et al 2017 and climate change with consequent change in fire frequency coutinho 1990 kauffman et al 1994 klink et al 1993 torres and marengo 2014 barbosa and fearnside 2005a coutinho 1990 kauffman et al 1994 torres and marengo 2014 all of which increase plant mortality and lead to changes in vegetation structure e g abreu et al 2017 rossatto et al 2012 not all savanna woody species are expected to respond similarly to anthropic changes in the environment for example the seasonal tropical climate where the savanna occurs has acted as a selective pressure on leaf phenology van schaik et al 1993 some species are deciduous and avoid drought by shedding their canopy either entirely or partially and hence not transpiring at significant rates during the dry season franco et al 2005 additionally deciduous species show a decreased demand for belowground water in the dry season eamus 1999 franco et al 2005 lambers et al 2008 this functional strategy provides high water use efficiency but comes at the expense of high vulnerability to cavitation due to the high gradient of water potential between the leaves and the soil santiago et al 2016 another cost of this strategy is the high investment in leaf nitrogen as to maintain high photosynthetic rates during the rainy season donovan et al 2011 edwards et al 2014 rossatto et al 2013 on the other hand other species of savanna communities are evergreen which means they keep their canopy and transpire during the dry season garcía núñez et al 2019 goldstein et al 2008 rossatto et al 2013 in the face decrease of the precipitation resulting in longer dry seasons evergreens are thus expected to show higher mortality than deciduous species leading to deciduous dominated communities engelbrecht and kursar 2003 hasselquist et al 2010 murphy and lugo 1986 santiago et al 2004 fire is an important evolutive pressure on savanna woody species souchie et al 2017 some species reconstitute their aerial parts from the underground system after fire events and are called resprouters moreira et al 2012 ojeda et al 2005 in the savannas the resprouting strategy increases survival relative to the non resprouters clarke et al 2015 de moraes et al 2016 ott et al 2019 pausas et al 2016 salazar and goldstein 2014 because fire can kill seedlings and small individuals de medeiros and miranda 2005 gawryszewski et al 2019 hoffmann and solbrig 2003 but commonly does not damage underground structures pausas et al 2018 2016 overall the increase in fire frequency can result in the predominance of the grassy over the woody layer catry et al 2013 lehmann et al 2014 stevens et al 2017 however some evidence has also shown that some woody species can persist successive fire events while others cannot salazar and goldstein 2014 in a future scenario of increasing fire frequency due to longer and drier periods resprouters can experience an increase in abundance whereas non resprouters are likely to become less abundant hoffmann 1998 ojeda et al 2005 salazar and goldstein 2014 while climate and fire have a direct effect on plant performance ratnam et al 2011 defaunation indirectly impacts vegetation structure through changes in plant animal interactions such as seed dispersal and seed predation the causes of defaunation are many and complex including poaching ferreira et al 2015 2012 modification of natural fire frequency abom et al 2016 langevelde et al 2003 radford et al 2015 animal trafficking souto et al 2017 and habitat fragmentation marine 2001 these factors have an overall stronger negative effect on large animals that act as effective seed dispersers and as top down control of seed predators wright et al 2000 as a result there is a decline in plant recruitment de paula et al 2018 and consequently in the size of local plant populations carvalho et al 2016 rumeu et al 2017 terborgh et al 2008 valiente banuet et al 2015 similarly to other tropical vegetation most woody species of the savannas rely on animals for seed dispersal e g batalha et al 1997 mantovani and martins 1988 meaning that these species are more susceptible to local extinction than those that do not depend on animals as dispersal agents e g de paula et al 2018 it has been shown that climate change bustamante et al 2012 de paula et al 2018 change in fire frequency abreu et al 2017 and defaunation dirzo et al 2014 separately change ecosystem dynamics in the neotropics however factors affecting vegetation dynamics are many and do not act in isolation which leads to a growing interest in understanding how drivers act synergistically brook et al 2008 laurance and useche 2009 midgley et al 2010 i e whether the effects of two or more factors combined are stronger than the effect of each factor acting in isolation for example drought and deforestation acting together in south american rainforests cause an alternative community state staal et al 2015 additionally poaching and fragmentation have a synergistic effect on the population decline of large vertebrates peres 2001 nevertheless we still have little knowledge of how the main drivers of savanna dynamics act synergistically here we evaluated woody species performance by estimating aboveground biomass agb of different plant functional types pfts in brazilian savannas in response to climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation for this we used a process based dynamic vegetation model formind see overview in fig 1 which simulates tree growth based on the carbon balance of individual trees köhler and huth 1998 resulting from basic processes such as competition for water seed dispersal recruitment and mortality fischer et al 2016 we tested the following hypotheses 1 species that are deciduous resprouters and not primarily dispersed by animals are less susceptible to disturbance than evergreen non resprouting and animal dispersed species 2 the synergistic effects of climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation on agb are greater than the isolated effects of each disturbance type we present the first evidence of the synergistic effects of defaunation and changes in climate and fire frequency on changes in agb at a long term scale 1000 years in south american savanna additionally we provide outcomes of the long term anthropic effects on aboveground carbon stock in neotropical savannas 2 methods 2 1 study sites savanna is a vegetation complex composed by a woody layer immersed in a continuous grass layer dominated by c4 species ratnam et al 2011 solbrig 1996 depending on the grass wood ratio and tree height savannas can be classified as savanna grassland open savanna woody savanna and savanna woodland coutinho 1978 in brazil the savanna comprises the core area of the brazilian cerrado and the amazonian disjunction savannas e g huber 1987 salazar et al 2015 our data on savannas included eight sites of open savanna os woody savanna ws and savanna woodland sw coutinho 1978 furley 1999 1992 we defined os as the physiognomy with tree height 7 m and crown cover 10 in the ws trees predominate and reach up to 14 m in height with 40 60 crown cover in the sw trees are taller than 15 m with more than 70 crown cover open savanna os one site located at the northeast portion of the state of roraima northern brazil comprising part of the rio branco rupununi complex of brazil venezuela and the republic of guyana barbosa and fearnside 2004 in roraima the os is popularly known as campos do rio branco or lavrado and occupies an area of 40 000 km2 barbosa et al 2007 the climate is awi tropical humid without a cold season under the köppen classification system barbosa et al 2007 woody savanna ws five sites located at different savanna regions three sites are located at the cerrado core area in brazil ws1 ws2 and ws3 and have been surveyed twice in 2009 and 2013 e g silva et al 2019 the aw tropical climate is predominant in these sites with a rainy season between october and march and a dry season lasting from april to september the annual average temperature varies between 19 c and 20 c with annual mean precipitation of 1600 1900 mm alvares et al 2013 the fourth ws site ws4 is located at the state of minas gerais southeastern brazil the climate is highland tropical cwb with annual average temperature between 7 c and 23 c and annual mean precipitation of 700 2000 mm alvares et al 2013 our fifth ws site ws5 is located at the municipality of carolina in the state of maranhão northeastern brazil de medeiros et al 2008 precisely in the transition between the cerrado and the amazon thus having ecotone characteristics the predominant climatic regime is aw savanna woodland sw two sites in southeastern brazil both located at the municipality of bauru in the state of são paulo the cwag climate temperate and moderately rainy with a dry winter is predominant in the region cavassan 2002 1990 in brazil this climate is characterised by an average annual temperature ranging between 17 c and 24 c and average precipitation of 700 2500 mm alvares et al 2013 the minimum temperature can be as low as 13 6 c and an average annual rainfall of 1262 9 mm has been recorded in the bauru region cavassan et al 2015 an overview of the eight study sites is shown in figure 2 2 2 formind model to model the vegetation dynamics we used formind an individual based spatially explicit and process based model designed for simulating species rich vegetation communities fischer et al 2016 to model the community dynamics the species are classified into plant functional types pfts according to their life histories based on characteristics such as seed dispersal and strategies of resource acquisition and use de paula et al 2018 simulations are performed for a minimum area of 1 ha and this area is divided into patches of 20 20 m fischer et al 2016 huth et al 2004 individuals interact with each other within each patch but the patches do not interact with each other fischer et al 2016 huth et al 2004 the tree survival and growth rates depend on environmental factors such as soil water table temperature and disturbance rates e g köhler and huth 2007 the competitive capacity of each pft determines its basal area and aboveground biomass agb accumulation rate therefore species or pfts with greater capacity to acquire and use resources provide a greater contribution to the basal area and agb of the community pagel et al 1991 tree biomass is calculated using allometric equations that include tree height and stem diameter at breast height dbh 2 3 plant functional types pfts classification we classified the woody species trees and shrubs surveyed in our eight study sites into eight pfts which were a combination of leaf phenology deciduous vs evergreen resprouting capacity resprouters vs non resprouters and seed dispersal strategy animal vs non animal our model considered the different competitive strategies among pfts de paula et al 2018 plant growth was limited primarily by water table because plant species with small medium and large seeds that are dispersed by animals of different sizes have been reported to decline progressively and quickly in the savanna harrison et al 2013 we did not discriminate seed size in our models 2 4 baseline and disturbance scenarios for each of the eight study sites we built a baseline model assuming political intervention that would result in the stall of anthropic effects represented by co2 emission poaching and fragmentation c table 1 in this baseline scenario the co2 emission was controlled until 2050 and co2 concentration remained around the current 400 ppm moss et al 2010 poaching and habitat fragmentation were controlled thus reducing defaunation a policy for fire management was implemented and it decreased the risk of big fires events the dry season did not exceed six months with a monthly rainfall average of 10 40 mm the annual precipitation reached up to 1500 mm with a minimum monthly average of 200 mm while the annual temperature remained at an average of 25 c we created three individual disturbance scenarios climate change cc change in fire frequency cf and defaunation de table 1 we assumed that in all of them there would be no effective policies to control anthropic actions e g jarvie and svenning 2018 in our cc scenario the length of the dry season was increased from six to seven months and the average maximum daily temperature was increased from 25 c to 27 c e g torres and marengo 2014 we set out the temperature increase at 2 c because it is expected to cause large fires in the future silva et al 2016 p s silva et al 2019 in the cf scenario fire frequency was increased to five episodes per 10 yr interval in both disturbance scenarios the water table decreased in relation to the c scenario e g gosling and arnell 2016 in the de scenario seed survival of animal dispersed species was decreased from 10 to 5 due to the decrease of suitable sites herrera et al 1994 nathan and muller landau 2000 and post dispersal seed predation of both animal and non animal dispersed species increased from 10 before defaunation to 50 after defaunation wright et al 2000 because our main interest was to understand how the synergistic effects of defaunation and change in climate and fire frequency lead to agb change of savanna communities we ran formind in combinations of disturbances namely climate change and change in fire frequency cc cf climate change and defaunation cc de and climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation cc cf de the effect of the different disturbance scenarios on the vegetation was assessed by the percentage of agb change relative to the c scenario the agb change δagb was calculated as δagb b1 bn b1 where b1 was the agb in the c scenario and bn was the agb in each disturbance scenario very few values of δagb were smaller than 1 or larger than 1 these values were not included in the statistical analysis for standardization e g huang et al 1975 kirst et al 1991 2 5 statistical analysis we compared δagb in the study sites eight sites physiognomies open savanna wood savanna and savanna woodland and functional strategies deciduous vs evergreen resprouters vs non resprouters and animal vs non animal among the different disturbance scenarios we also compared δagb in the same disturbance scenario among study sites physiognomies and functional strategies for this we included in the analysis δagb values ranging from 1 100 decrease to 1 100 increase because the data did not meet the assumptions of the parametric statistics we used games howell test with 5 of significance see ruxton and beauchamp 2008 in order to capture the range of effect sizes we additionally used the confidence intervals ci of δagb in the comparisons among disturbance scenarios colegrave and ruton 2003 the 95 ci around the average δagb was calculated by the bootstrap method with 10 000 resamples streukens and leroi werelds 2016 for each disturbance scenario across the 1000 yr simulation period the procedure was performed using the userfriendlyscience r package peters 2018 we built graphic boxplots representing the minimum first quartile mean third quartile and maximum values of δagb calculated in the disturbance scenarios across the 1000 yr simulation period in the boxplots δagb 0 indicates no change in agb

discussion in the present study we found that climate change cc change in fire frequency cf and defaunation de act synergistically and result in changes in aboveground biomass agb of plant functional types pfts in the brazilian savannas in different ways our study fills the gap of identifying which ecological processes are more sensitive or more resilient to global changes and how they impact ecosystem services gomes et al 2018 we found greater agb loss 35 77 in the synergistic scenario cc cf de as we earlier hypothesized the woody savanna physiognomy as well as deciduous non resprouters and animal dispersed species are the most affected in all disturbance scenarios as suggested changes in savanna vegetation do not result from the occurrence of the dry season alone but rather from the interplay of multiple factors such as the drought avoidance strategies land use land cover inheritance of fire impacts herbivory and inter life form competition sankaran 2019 despite the great variation in changes in agb among our study sites of woody savanna this physiognomy showed the greatest agb loss in all disturbance scenarios the woody savanna and the savanna woodland are dominated by the arboreal component coutinho 1978 furley 1999 1992 where animal seed dispersal is more important than in the shrub component batalha and mantovani 2000 mantovani and martins 1988 pirani et al 2009 that dominates the open savanna coutinho 1978 furley 1999 1992 thus animal dispersal may explain the exacerbated decrease in agb in the woody savanna relative to the open savanna however dispersal strategy does not explain the high agb loss in the woody savanna relative to the savanna woodland we suggest that differences in agb loss between woody physiognomies are driven by abiotic factors pereira et al 2014 in our study precipitation is lower in wood savannas sites central region of brazil than in savanna woodland sites southeast region of brazil the dry matter accumulation is inversely proportional to rainfall in savannas campos et al 2008 cianciaruso et al 2006 matos et al 2017 additionally the longer dry season leads to the accumulation of dry abg and promotes the desiccation of the accumulated organic matter flores et al 2021 all of these factors should contribute to a greater accumulation of combustible in the wood savanna and consequently more intense fires we hypothesize that the combination of both high dependence of animal dispersal and more severe fires make the woody savanna more sensitive to agb loss as a result of disturbances differently from our expectation deciduous species lost more abg than evergreens albeit differences were small our results can be explained by the higher costs of deciduousness namely high vulnerability to cavitation santiago et al 2016 and high investment in leaf nitrogen donovan et al 2011 edwards et al 2014 rossatto et al 2013 apparently these costs are higher than the advantages of high water use efficiency given the disturbance scenarios additionally specific leaf mass slm was one of the contrasting parameters between evergreen higher slm and deciduous species lower slm in our models slm is the main predictor of sclerophylly neves et al 2010 which is advantageous in water limited environments lohbeck et al 2013 because higher slm increases growth rates during favourable seasons eamus 1999 therefore evergreen sclerophyllous savanna species would experience delays in abg loss in our disturbance scenarios relative to deciduous non sclerophyllous species our results support the hypothesis that sclerophylly is a trait that provides savanna species with some adaptation to changing environmental conditions fonseca et al 2018 guerra and scremin dias 2018 lebrija trejos et al 2011 as expected resprouters were more vulnerable to disturbances than non resprouters our results support previous studies that show that changes in natural fire regime are reported to cause changes in plant community structure salazar and goldstein 2014 therefore we recommend fire management in savanna sites to be carefully conducted this implies keeping fire frequency as close as possible to the natural frequency i e in intervals of around four years coutinho 1990 pivello 2011 pivello and coutinho 1992 the scientific knowledge should be combined with traditional knowledge such as indigenous fire use in order to support national fire management policies durigan and ratter 2016 when fire management is not carried out in a prescribed manner the biomass stock accumulates coutinho 1990 durigan and ratter 2006 fidelis et al 2018 resulting in catastrophic wildfires keeley et al 1999 pereira et al 2014 radeloff et al 2005 syphard et al 2007 in brazil fire management policy has advanced in protected areas but most savanna vegetation is located at private properties where regulation on fire management is still lacking durigan and ratter 2016 schmidt and eloy 2020 as fire regime has been changing lately bowman et al 2011 silva et al 2016 white 2019 and brazil is the most affected south america country white 2019 the expansion of national fire management policies to a higher number of both protected and private areas is urgently necessary the functional strategy that resulted in the greatest decrease in agb was animal dispersal relative to non animal dispersal in our models decreases in dispersal result in decreased chances that dispersed seeds arrive at safe sites herrera et al 1994 nathan and muller landau 2000 this triggers an extinction vortex that begins with a reduction in animal dispersers as a result of anthropic disturbances which leads to a decrease in plant species which in turn results in further decrease of dispersers and other animals however one caveat of this study is that the models used do not distinguish between dispersal performed by vertebrates and invertebrates such as ants which are very important seed dispersers in the savanna christianini et al 2012 christianini and mayhé nunes 2012 christianini and oliveira 2010 in addition responses to anthropic disturbances may differ between vertebrates and invertebrates therefore our results may have overestimated the negative impacts of disturbance scenarios especially those including defaunation on the abg of animal dispersed species most carbon in the savanna is stored in the belowground biomass bustamante et al 2012 however agb is estimated to have 50 carbon batlle bayer et al 2010 which indicates it also plays an important role in atmospheric carbon storage paiva et al 2011 roquette 2018 scolforo et al 2015 therefore agb loss in the savanna should increase greenhouse gas emissions our results support previous ones that urge for the stall in temperature warming and other anthropic disturbances such as defaunation controlling temperatures is especially important in the savanna because the risk of extreme fire events is expected to increase if global temperatures increase by 2 c in daily values silva et al 2016 we showed that a 2 c increase in temperature and the increase in fire frequency expected in the course of that event trigger great agb loss therefore we agree that there must be an effort to ensure that the increase in global warming does not reach 2 c by the end of the century silva et al 2019 the impacts of defaunation and changes in climate and fire frequency on the dynamics of the savanna shown here can change the recovery trajectory of the woody component leading to a shift in the composition and structure of communities the woody savanna will be the most impacted physiognomy and therefore management and conservation strategies should consider the different physiognomies and location of communities especially because agb losses greatly varied among our study sites if different types of disturbances are not controlled in the near future savanna communities will be dominated by evergreen resprouters and non animal dispersed species representing a steeply decline in the diversity of species and functions our results should be used to target interventions aimed at the conservation of species and ecosystem services in the savanna

24607,as a result of anthropogenic pressure three drives are expected to affect brazilian savannas an increase in the dry season more frequent fire events and defaunation these drivers are a trigger for biodiversity loss and undermine the ecosystems services like carbon storage here our goal was to analyze how these drivers can affect the structure and dynamics of the savanna s tree species and how they impact the savanna s total estimating aboveground biomass agb we analysed eight sites that comprise a physiognomic gradient from open savanna to savanna woodland the species were classified by three traits phenological strategies deciduous or evergreen fire resistance resprouting or non resprouting and dispersal syndrome animal or non animal then we modelled agb loss in a dry season in the austral winter a 2 c increase in daily temperature five fire events by decadal series and a defaunation scenario although climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation effects impact agb separately they also have a synergistic effect this effect was observed in functional strategies and also in the total agb of the community in some cases the total agb loss exceeded 70 the negative effects on performance were highest in species which were decidual non resprouting and which employed animal dispersal for their seed if different types of disturbances are not controlled in the near future savanna communities will be dominated by evergreen resprouters and non animal dispersed species representing a steeply decline in the diversity of species and ecosystem functions graphical abtsract image graphical abstract keywords cerrado forest simulations disturbance carbon balance biodiversity loss biodiversity management 1 introduction the savanna is a type of vegetation found mainly in south america africa and australia that has different physiognomies occurring in soils with low fertility and tropical climates with a defined dry season when natural fires occur coutinho 1990 durigan and ratter 2016 solbrig 1996 soil fertility gradients are the primary driver of the physiognomic variation goodland and pollard 1973 lehmann et al 2011 murphy and bowman 2012 the savanna is an important carbon sink and thus climate regulator ratnam et al 2011 solbrig 1996 and it plays a key role in other ecosystem services such as the provision of food to humans and improvement of freshwater and air quality batlle bayer et al 2010 klink and machado 2005 nabout et al 2011 nevertheless ecosystem services provided by the savanna are now at risk of being lost due to anthropic changes such as land conversion abreu et al 2017 cardoso da silva and bates 2002 carvalho et al 2009 the introduction of exotic species aguiar et al 2014 defaunation cavarzere et al 2017 and climate change with consequent change in fire frequency coutinho 1990 kauffman et al 1994 klink et al 1993 torres and marengo 2014 barbosa and fearnside 2005a coutinho 1990 kauffman et al 1994 torres and marengo 2014 all of which increase plant mortality and lead to changes in vegetation structure e g abreu et al 2017 rossatto et al 2012 not all savanna woody species are expected to respond similarly to anthropic changes in the environment for example the seasonal tropical climate where the savanna occurs has acted as a selective pressure on leaf phenology van schaik et al 1993 some species are deciduous and avoid drought by shedding their canopy either entirely or partially and hence not transpiring at significant rates during the dry season franco et al 2005 additionally deciduous species show a decreased demand for belowground water in the dry season eamus 1999 franco et al 2005 lambers et al 2008 this functional strategy provides high water use efficiency but comes at the expense of high vulnerability to cavitation due to the high gradient of water potential between the leaves and the soil santiago et al 2016 another cost of this strategy is the high investment in leaf nitrogen as to maintain high photosynthetic rates during the rainy season donovan et al 2011 edwards et al 2014 rossatto et al 2013 on the other hand other species of savanna communities are evergreen which means they keep their canopy and transpire during the dry season garcía núñez et al 2019 goldstein et al 2008 rossatto et al 2013 in the face decrease of the precipitation resulting in longer dry seasons evergreens are thus expected to show higher mortality than deciduous species leading to deciduous dominated communities engelbrecht and kursar 2003 hasselquist et al 2010 murphy and lugo 1986 santiago et al 2004 fire is an important evolutive pressure on savanna woody species souchie et al 2017 some species reconstitute their aerial parts from the underground system after fire events and are called resprouters moreira et al 2012 ojeda et al 2005 in the savannas the resprouting strategy increases survival relative to the non resprouters clarke et al 2015 de moraes et al 2016 ott et al 2019 pausas et al 2016 salazar and goldstein 2014 because fire can kill seedlings and small individuals de medeiros and miranda 2005 gawryszewski et al 2019 hoffmann and solbrig 2003 but commonly does not damage underground structures pausas et al 2018 2016 overall the increase in fire frequency can result in the predominance of the grassy over the woody layer catry et al 2013 lehmann et al 2014 stevens et al 2017 however some evidence has also shown that some woody species can persist successive fire events while others cannot salazar and goldstein 2014 in a future scenario of increasing fire frequency due to longer and drier periods resprouters can experience an increase in abundance whereas non resprouters are likely to become less abundant hoffmann 1998 ojeda et al 2005 salazar and goldstein 2014 while climate and fire have a direct effect on plant performance ratnam et al 2011 defaunation indirectly impacts vegetation structure through changes in plant animal interactions such as seed dispersal and seed predation the causes of defaunation are many and complex including poaching ferreira et al 2015 2012 modification of natural fire frequency abom et al 2016 langevelde et al 2003 radford et al 2015 animal trafficking souto et al 2017 and habitat fragmentation marine 2001 these factors have an overall stronger negative effect on large animals that act as effective seed dispersers and as top down control of seed predators wright et al 2000 as a result there is a decline in plant recruitment de paula et al 2018 and consequently in the size of local plant populations carvalho et al 2016 rumeu et al 2017 terborgh et al 2008 valiente banuet et al 2015 similarly to other tropical vegetation most woody species of the savannas rely on animals for seed dispersal e g batalha et al 1997 mantovani and martins 1988 meaning that these species are more susceptible to local extinction than those that do not depend on animals as dispersal agents e g de paula et al 2018 it has been shown that climate change bustamante et al 2012 de paula et al 2018 change in fire frequency abreu et al 2017 and defaunation dirzo et al 2014 separately change ecosystem dynamics in the neotropics however factors affecting vegetation dynamics are many and do not act in isolation which leads to a growing interest in understanding how drivers act synergistically brook et al 2008 laurance and useche 2009 midgley et al 2010 i e whether the effects of two or more factors combined are stronger than the effect of each factor acting in isolation for example drought and deforestation acting together in south american rainforests cause an alternative community state staal et al 2015 additionally poaching and fragmentation have a synergistic effect on the population decline of large vertebrates peres 2001 nevertheless we still have little knowledge of how the main drivers of savanna dynamics act synergistically here we evaluated woody species performance by estimating aboveground biomass agb of different plant functional types pfts in brazilian savannas in response to climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation for this we used a process based dynamic vegetation model formind see overview in fig 1 which simulates tree growth based on the carbon balance of individual trees köhler and huth 1998 resulting from basic processes such as competition for water seed dispersal recruitment and mortality fischer et al 2016 we tested the following hypotheses 1 species that are deciduous resprouters and not primarily dispersed by animals are less susceptible to disturbance than evergreen non resprouting and animal dispersed species 2 the synergistic effects of climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation on agb are greater than the isolated effects of each disturbance type we present the first evidence of the synergistic effects of defaunation and changes in climate and fire frequency on changes in agb at a long term scale 1000 years in south american savanna additionally we provide outcomes of the long term anthropic effects on aboveground carbon stock in neotropical savannas 2 methods 2 1 study sites savanna is a vegetation complex composed by a woody layer immersed in a continuous grass layer dominated by c4 species ratnam et al 2011 solbrig 1996 depending on the grass wood ratio and tree height savannas can be classified as savanna grassland open savanna woody savanna and savanna woodland coutinho 1978 in brazil the savanna comprises the core area of the brazilian cerrado and the amazonian disjunction savannas e g huber 1987 salazar et al 2015 our data on savannas included eight sites of open savanna os woody savanna ws and savanna woodland sw coutinho 1978 furley 1999 1992 we defined os as the physiognomy with tree height 7 m and crown cover 10 in the ws trees predominate and reach up to 14 m in height with 40 60 crown cover in the sw trees are taller than 15 m with more than 70 crown cover open savanna os one site located at the northeast portion of the state of roraima northern brazil comprising part of the rio branco rupununi complex of brazil venezuela and the republic of guyana barbosa and fearnside 2004 in roraima the os is popularly known as campos do rio branco or lavrado and occupies an area of 40 000 km2 barbosa et al 2007 the climate is awi tropical humid without a cold season under the köppen classification system barbosa et al 2007 woody savanna ws five sites located at different savanna regions three sites are located at the cerrado core area in brazil ws1 ws2 and ws3 and have been surveyed twice in 2009 and 2013 e g silva et al 2019 the aw tropical climate is predominant in these sites with a rainy season between october and march and a dry season lasting from april to september the annual average temperature varies between 19 c and 20 c with annual mean precipitation of 1600 1900 mm alvares et al 2013 the fourth ws site ws4 is located at the state of minas gerais southeastern brazil the climate is highland tropical cwb with annual average temperature between 7 c and 23 c and annual mean precipitation of 700 2000 mm alvares et al 2013 our fifth ws site ws5 is located at the municipality of carolina in the state of maranhão northeastern brazil de medeiros et al 2008 precisely in the transition between the cerrado and the amazon thus having ecotone characteristics the predominant climatic regime is aw savanna woodland sw two sites in southeastern brazil both located at the municipality of bauru in the state of são paulo the cwag climate temperate and moderately rainy with a dry winter is predominant in the region cavassan 2002 1990 in brazil this climate is characterised by an average annual temperature ranging between 17 c and 24 c and average precipitation of 700 2500 mm alvares et al 2013 the minimum temperature can be as low as 13 6 c and an average annual rainfall of 1262 9 mm has been recorded in the bauru region cavassan et al 2015 an overview of the eight study sites is shown in figure 2 2 2 formind model to model the vegetation dynamics we used formind an individual based spatially explicit and process based model designed for simulating species rich vegetation communities fischer et al 2016 to model the community dynamics the species are classified into plant functional types pfts according to their life histories based on characteristics such as seed dispersal and strategies of resource acquisition and use de paula et al 2018 simulations are performed for a minimum area of 1 ha and this area is divided into patches of 20 20 m fischer et al 2016 huth et al 2004 individuals interact with each other within each patch but the patches do not interact with each other fischer et al 2016 huth et al 2004 the tree survival and growth rates depend on environmental factors such as soil water table temperature and disturbance rates e g köhler and huth 2007 the competitive capacity of each pft determines its basal area and aboveground biomass agb accumulation rate therefore species or pfts with greater capacity to acquire and use resources provide a greater contribution to the basal area and agb of the community pagel et al 1991 tree biomass is calculated using allometric equations that include tree height and stem diameter at breast height dbh 2 3 plant functional types pfts classification we classified the woody species trees and shrubs surveyed in our eight study sites into eight pfts which were a combination of leaf phenology deciduous vs evergreen resprouting capacity resprouters vs non resprouters and seed dispersal strategy animal vs non animal our model considered the different competitive strategies among pfts de paula et al 2018 plant growth was limited primarily by water table because plant species with small medium and large seeds that are dispersed by animals of different sizes have been reported to decline progressively and quickly in the savanna harrison et al 2013 we did not discriminate seed size in our models 2 4 baseline and disturbance scenarios for each of the eight study sites we built a baseline model assuming political intervention that would result in the stall of anthropic effects represented by co2 emission poaching and fragmentation c table 1 in this baseline scenario the co2 emission was controlled until 2050 and co2 concentration remained around the current 400 ppm moss et al 2010 poaching and habitat fragmentation were controlled thus reducing defaunation a policy for fire management was implemented and it decreased the risk of big fires events the dry season did not exceed six months with a monthly rainfall average of 10 40 mm the annual precipitation reached up to 1500 mm with a minimum monthly average of 200 mm while the annual temperature remained at an average of 25 c we created three individual disturbance scenarios climate change cc change in fire frequency cf and defaunation de table 1 we assumed that in all of them there would be no effective policies to control anthropic actions e g jarvie and svenning 2018 in our cc scenario the length of the dry season was increased from six to seven months and the average maximum daily temperature was increased from 25 c to 27 c e g torres and marengo 2014 we set out the temperature increase at 2 c because it is expected to cause large fires in the future silva et al 2016 p s silva et al 2019 in the cf scenario fire frequency was increased to five episodes per 10 yr interval in both disturbance scenarios the water table decreased in relation to the c scenario e g gosling and arnell 2016 in the de scenario seed survival of animal dispersed species was decreased from 10 to 5 due to the decrease of suitable sites herrera et al 1994 nathan and muller landau 2000 and post dispersal seed predation of both animal and non animal dispersed species increased from 10 before defaunation to 50 after defaunation wright et al 2000 because our main interest was to understand how the synergistic effects of defaunation and change in climate and fire frequency lead to agb change of savanna communities we ran formind in combinations of disturbances namely climate change and change in fire frequency cc cf climate change and defaunation cc de and climate change change in fire frequency and defaunation cc cf de the effect of the different disturbance scenarios on the vegetation was assessed by the percentage of agb change relative to the c scenario the agb change δagb was calculated as δagb b1 bn b1 where b1 was the agb in the c scenario and bn was the agb in each disturbance scenario very few values of δagb were smaller than 1 or larger than 1 these values were not included in the statistical analysis for standardization e g huang et al 1975 kirst et al 1991 2 5 statistical analysis we compared δagb in the study sites eight sites physiognomies open savanna wood savanna and savanna woodland and functional strategies deciduous vs evergreen resprouters vs non resprouters and animal vs non animal among the different disturbance scenarios we also compared δagb in the same disturbance scenario among study sites physiognomies and functional strategies for this we included in the analysis δagb values ranging from 1 100 decrease to 1 100 increase because the data did not meet the assumptions of the parametric statistics we used games howell test with 5 of significance see ruxton and beauchamp 2008 in order to capture the range of effect sizes we additionally used the confidence intervals ci of δagb in the comparisons among disturbance scenarios colegrave and ruton 2003 the 95 ci around the average δagb was calculated by the bootstrap method with 10 000 resamples streukens and leroi werelds 2016 for each disturbance scenario across the 1000 yr simulation period the procedure was performed using the userfriendlyscience r package peters 2018 we built graphic boxplots representing the minimum first quartile mean third quartile and maximum values of δagb calculated in the disturbance scenarios across the 1000 yr simulation period in the boxplots δagb 0 indicates no change in agb in a given disturbance scenario values above and below zero indicate increased and decreased agb respectively outlier values were omitted from the boxplots we built the boxplots for sites

cc cc de cc cf and cc cf de average δagb also differed between deciduous vs evergreen resprouters vs non resprouters and animal dispersed vs non animal dispersed species in the same disturbance scenario with greater losses in deciduous non resprouters and animal dispersed species comparing all functional strategies the lowest decrease in average agb was observed in evergreen species 5 while the greatest decrease was observed in non resprouters 20 and species dispersed by animals 60 fig 5 table 4 similarly to study sites and physiognomies the dispersion of δagb values was greater in the cc and cc de scenarios than in the cc cf and cc cf de scenarios in all plant functional strategies fig 5 in the cc and cc de scenarios the boxplots revealed that δagb values were concentrated between the mean and the minimum scores indicating agb decrease in almost 50 of the simulated years fig 5a c in the cc cf and cc de cf scenarios agb decreased in 75 of the simulated years for deciduous and

discussion in the present study we found that climate change cc change in fire frequency cf and defaunation de act synergistically and result in changes in aboveground biomass agb of plant functional types pfts in the brazilian savannas in different ways our study fills the gap of identifying which ecological processes are more sensitive or more resilient to global changes and how they impact ecosystem services gomes et al 2018 we found greater agb loss 35 77 in the synergistic scenario cc cf de as we earlier hypothesized the woody savanna physiognomy as well as deciduous non resprouters and animal dispersed species are the most affected in all disturbance scenarios as suggested changes in savanna vegetation do not result from the occurrence of the dry season alone but rather from the interplay of multiple factors such as the drought avoidance strategies land use land cover inheritance of fire impacts herbivory and inter life form competition sankaran 2019 despite the great variation in changes in agb among our study sites of woody savanna this physiognomy showed the greatest agb loss in all disturbance scenarios the woody savanna and the savanna woodland are dominated by the arboreal component coutinho 1978 furley 1999 1992 where animal seed dispersal is more important than in the shrub component batalha and mantovani 2000 mantovani and martins 1988 pirani et al 2009 that dominates the open savanna coutinho 1978 furley 1999 1992 thus animal dispersal may explain the exacerbated decrease in agb in the woody savanna relative to the open savanna however dispersal strategy does not explain the high agb loss in the woody savanna relative to the savanna woodland we suggest that differences in agb loss between woody physiognomies are driven by abiotic factors pereira et al 2014 in our study precipitation is lower in wood savannas sites central region of brazil than in savanna woodland sites southeast region of brazil the dry matter accumulation is inversely proportional to rainfall in savannas campos et al 2008 cianciaruso et al 2006 matos et al 2017 additionally the longer dry season leads to the accumulation of dry abg and promotes the desiccation of the accumulated organic matter flores et al 2021 all of these factors should contribute to a greater accumulation of combustible in the wood savanna and consequently more intense fires we hypothesize that the combination of both high dependence of animal dispersal and more severe fires make the woody savanna more sensitive to agb loss as a result of disturbances differently from our expectation deciduous species lost more abg than evergreens albeit differences were small our results can be explained by the higher costs of deciduousness namely high vulnerability to cavitation santiago et al 2016 and high investment in leaf nitrogen donovan et al 2011 edwards et al 2014 rossatto et al 2013 apparently these costs are higher than the advantages of high water use efficiency given the disturbance scenarios additionally specific leaf mass slm was one of the contrasting parameters between evergreen higher slm and deciduous species lower slm in our models slm is the main predictor of sclerophylly neves et al 2010 which is advantageous in water limited environments lohbeck et al 2013 because higher slm increases growth rates during favourable seasons eamus 1999 therefore evergreen sclerophyllous savanna species would experience delays in abg loss in our disturbance scenarios relative to deciduous non sclerophyllous species our results support the hypothesis that sclerophylly is a trait that provides savanna species with some adaptation to changing environmental conditions fonseca et al 2018 guerra and scremin dias 2018 lebrija trejos et al 2011 as expected resprouters were more vulnerable to disturbances than non resprouters our results support previous studies that show that changes in natural fire regime are reported to cause changes in plant community structure salazar and goldstein 2014 therefore we recommend fire management in savanna sites to be carefully conducted this implies keeping fire frequency as close as possible to the natural frequency i e in intervals of around four years coutinho 1990 pivello 2011 pivello and coutinho 1992 the scientific knowledge should be combined with traditional knowledge such as indigenous fire use in order to support national fire management policies durigan and ratter 2016 when fire management is not carried out in a prescribed manner the biomass stock accumulates coutinho 1990 durigan and ratter 2006 fidelis et al 2018 resulting in catastrophic wildfires keeley et al 1999 pereira et al 2014 radeloff et al 2005 syphard et al 2007 in brazil fire management policy has advanced in protected areas but most savanna vegetation is located at private properties where regulation on fire management is still lacking durigan and ratter 2016 schmidt and eloy 2020 as fire regime has been changing lately bowman et al 2011 silva et al 2016 white 2019 and brazil is the most affected south america country white 2019 the expansion of national fire management policies to a higher number of both protected and private areas is urgently necessary the functional strategy that resulted in the greatest decrease in agb was animal dispersal relative to non animal dispersal in our models decreases in dispersal result in decreased chances that dispersed seeds arrive at safe sites herrera et al 1994 nathan and muller landau 2000 this triggers an extinction vortex that begins with a reduction in animal dispersers as a result of anthropic disturbances which leads to a decrease in plant species which in turn results in further decrease of dispersers and other animals however one caveat of this study is that the models used do not distinguish between dispersal performed by vertebrates and invertebrates such as ants which are very important seed dispersers in the savanna christianini et al 2012 christianini and mayhé nunes 2012 christianini and oliveira 2010 in addition responses to anthropic disturbances may differ between vertebrates and invertebrates therefore our results may have overestimated the negative impacts of disturbance scenarios especially those including defaunation on the abg of animal dispersed species most carbon in the savanna is stored in the belowground biomass bustamante et al 2012 however agb is estimated to have 50 carbon batlle bayer et al 2010 which indicates it also plays an important role in atmospheric carbon storage paiva et al 2011 roquette 2018 scolforo et al 2015 therefore agb loss in the savanna should increase greenhouse gas emissions our results support previous ones that urge for the stall in temperature warming and other anthropic disturbances such as defaunation controlling temperatures is especially important in the savanna because the risk of extreme fire events is expected to increase if global temperatures increase by 2 c in daily values silva et al 2016 we showed that a 2 c increase in temperature and the increase in fire frequency expected in the course of that event trigger great agb loss therefore we agree that there must be an effort to ensure that the increase in global warming does not reach 2 c by the end of the century silva et al 2019 the impacts of defaunation and changes in climate and fire frequency on the dynamics of the savanna shown here can change the recovery trajectory of the woody component leading to a shift in the composition and structure of communities the woody savanna will be the most impacted physiognomy and therefore management and conservation strategies should consider the different physiognomies and location of communities especially because agb losses greatly varied among our study sites if different types of disturbances are not controlled in the near future savanna communities will be dominated by evergreen resprouters and non animal dispersed species representing a steeply decline in the diversity of species and functions our results should be used to target interventions aimed at the conservation of species and ecosystem services in the savanna

24608,freshwater systems are some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world factors contributing to their degradation can be associated with the expansion and intensification of agriculture in the 20th century which has led to habitat degradation and water pollution to mitigate the impacts of agricultural activities and improve stream ecosystem quality government funded conservation programs have promoted the implementation of best management practices bmps during the last three to four decades however these conservation programs have been implemented within agricultural landscapes without evaluating exhaustively their potential side effects on freshwater species at the watershed scale this study aimed to assess the changes in freshwater biodiversity in terms of fish species richness under future climate and potential conservation land management schemes in the kaskaskia river watershed illinois usa fish regression models were integrated to the soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate the responses of total and game fish species richness to four major management practices crop rotation cover cropping reduced tillage modified fertilizer application identified as the most feasible in terms of stakeholder acceptability and environmental soundness under 32 distinct climate projections results showed that fish species in the krw are more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land management practices specifically the most likely percentage changes in fish species revealed a potential decline in richness in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams 5 10 decade 1 due to the progressive increase in the temperatures 0 61 c 0 92 c decade 1 expected in the watershed the long term impacts on fish species richness may be inevitable if the proposed land management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically design to protect aquatic life keywords fish species richness climate change bmps ecohydrology swat 1 introduction freshwater systems play an important role in ecological regulation and biodiversity conservation these ecosystems provide habitat and support for almost 10 of the species including humans and 40 of fish species globally while covering less than 1 of the planet s surface balian et al 2008 fao 2018 tedesco et al 2017 although critical to ecological health freshwater systems represent some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world with declining rates in biodiversity greater than those observed in terrestrial systems in accordance with the living planet index wwf 2018 freshwater species have declined 83 since 1970 in north america for example such declining trends in freshwater species have been estimated at 4 per decade five times the declining trends in terrestrial species dudgeon et al 2006 vaughn 2010 factors contributing to their degradation are directly linked to human activities and include habitat degradation flow modification water pollution and overexploitation in fact most of these factors are associated with the expansion and intensification of agriculture in the 20th century in response to the ever increasing demand for food and other commodities as a result agriculture has become the second largest driver of biodiversity decline and a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions maxwell et al 2016 despite efforts to develop and implement more sustainable agricultural practices the impacts of new land management approaches on freshwater systems are still unknown especially under projected climate change scenarios which have also been identified as one of the potential threats to biodiversity in the decades to come buisson et al 2013 comte et al 2013 lynch et al 2016 therefore a holistic understanding of how anthropogenic disturbances may impact freshwater biodiversity across agricultural landscapes is of great importance to formulate timely and appropriate mitigation plans agricultural systems have been implicated in extensive conversion of native land covers to row crops leading to soil degradation channelization reduction of riparian buffers and wetland drainage helms et al 2009 rowe et al 2009 thus evidence of hydrologic alteration has emerged from these landscape disturbances exposing soils and water bodies to higher runoff and peak flows that worsen erosion and nutrient loss increase flood risk and magnify sedimentation and siltation and lead to impairment of water bodies due to pesticides and pathogens allan 2004 knouft and chu 2015 mateo sagasta et al 2017 moreover several hydro ecologic studies have shown that freshwater biomes are prone to assemblage shifts and loss of species richness under such changes helms et al 2009 maloney and weller 2011 wang et al 2006 while other have drawn attention to the boosting effects that global warming may have on physiological stress buisson et al 2013 2008 buisson and grenouillet 2009 counteracting these affects the implementation of best management practices bmps have been promoted by government funded conservation programs during the last three to four decades to mitigate the impacts of agricultural activities and improve stream ecosystem quality shields et al 2006 among them conservation tillage crop rotation cover cropping and the establishment of wetlands buffers and bioreactors have been the most commonly promoted practices as the impact assessment of bmps on freshwater systems involves multiple environmental factors characterized by landscapes with diverse physiographic and climatic features its execution is laborious and very costly at a larger scale consequently impact assessments documenting the response of freshwater species to these practices have been constrained to short term studies performed in small experimental subcatchments potentially overlooking the synergies present in large complex agro ecosystems additionally simultaneously implemented bmps have shown limited or no environmental benefits on biodiversity conservation at local scales particularly where intrinsic characteristics of the landscape are complex smiley et al 2011 zimmerman et al 2003 despite these findings conservation programs have been implemented within agricultural landscapes without evaluating exhaustively their potential side effects on freshwater species at the watershed scale smiley jr et al 2009 to propose comprehensive management practices for the sustainable use of land and water resources and the conservation of biodiversity there is a critical need to understand the linkage between species assemblages and environmental factors such as climate watershed hydrology and water quality at the watershed scale the main objective of this study was to assess the changes in biodiversity in terms of fish species richness under future climate and potential conservation land management schemes specifically this study was aimed at 1 developing a hydrologic modeling framework to simulate long term patterns of streamflow and water quality at the watershed scale 2 building a regression model that associates fish species richness with potential environmental predictors and 3 quantifying the potential effects of future climate and land management scenarios on the spatio temporal patterns of such species richness the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the hydrologic responses of the kaskaskia river watershed krw in central illinois usa to different management schemes intended to mitigate agricultural intensification the water courses in the krw are controlled by three dam structures along the principal stem of the river the water courses are used for navigation water supply recreation and fishing all of which may be affected by projected climate changes to determine whether the current ecosystem services from streams will be conserved worsened or improved in the krw we developed tools and techniques to evaluate the projected mid and long term states of fish species richness in the watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the krw is located in south central illinois u s a and drains approximately 15 000 km2 to the mississippi river fig 1 this makes it the second largest watershed in the state after the illinois river watershed irw occupying approximately 10 of the state by area between 1980 and 2015 the watershed contained 104 unique species of fishes five year interval mean 64 6 se 7 5 two of which are endangered or threatened within the state illinois endangered species protection board 2015 today land use is devoted primarily to croplands 63 corn and soybean being the predominant commodities while the remaining portion of the watershed is under forest 16 grasslands 9 and built areas 9 usda 2016 fig 1b prior to european settlement in the 1700s the watershed was comprised of tallgrass prairies wetlands and bottomland forest usace 2017 however the fast growing expansion of the agricultural frontier and the development of land and water transport and flood control infrastructure in the 20th century accelerated the fragmentation and degradation of the pre settlement ecosystems southwestern illinois rcandd 2002 crop production has been identified as the dominant source of impairment in some krw tributaries exceeding state water quality standards predominantly for nitrate and phosphorus and in minor proportion for ammonia williard and shrestha 2016 despite significant efforts made by local authorities to counteract this impairment water quality in five of the 13 sampling points designated to monitor such pollutants across the watershed continued to decline during the 2005 2014 period while two did not present any improvement compared to the 1980 2004 records williard and shrestha 2016 2 2 fish assemblage data the fish data utilized in this study was collected at 222 sites across the krw fig 1f by the illinois department of natural resources division of fisheries and provided by the illinois natural history survey with support from the u s fish and wildlife service federal aid project f 69 r to j a stein these sites were sampled on a non continuous basis once every certain number of years from 1952 to 2015 during the may october sampling season using multiple sampling gears and standard deployment methodologies that combine seining with electrofishing zale et al 2013 the dataset comprises records of number of individuals captured per species per sample to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate and bmps on biodiversity and recreation the data was aggregated into annual total and game fish species richness i e number of species an additional spatial aggregation was performed on the data by averaging richness values among sampling sites occurring within a single stream used in the hydrologic model note that game fish species comprise species approved to be caught for pleasure or competition while total fish species comprise both game and non game fish species over the 1980 2015 sampling period the mean annual number of species per sampling point was found to be equal to 18 and 7 for total and game fish respectively indicating wide variability in species diversity among subbasins across the entire krw which has a basin wide richness of 104 species 2 3 hydrologic model we developed a baseline hydrologic model using swat to study the potential impacts of future climate and distinct bmps on the total and game fish species richness across the krw swat has been widely used and tested to be a reliable model for environmental impact assessment at the watershed scale under distinct land management schemes douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman et al 2007 its modeling framework considers further abstractions of human impacts through changes in land cover and land management practices which enables the simulation of long term patterns of streamflow sediment and nutrient loadings crop yields among other processes in complex watersheds consequently its capabilities are suited for heavily cultivated watersheds as the krw during the model set up the spatial heterogeneity of the study area was represented by dividing it into subbasins each of which represent the drainage area of one stream or river segment water flow as well as nutrient and sediment loads are determined by processes occurring at independent hydrologic response units hrus distributed across each subbasin these hrus are unique combinations of soil type slope class and land cover lumping the response of areas with similar characteristics to simplify the hydrologic system the swat model inputs include topographic soil land cover and use and climate data the spatial discretization of the krw employed a 30 m dem usgs 2016 and a minimum drainage area of 50 km2 these enabled the delineation of the smallest tributaries and a configuration of 175 subbasins terrain elevation ranged between 106 m and 261 m fig 1a and hence slopes were mostly uniform and below 5 and were discretized into a single slope class twenty 20 different soil types were identified based on the state soil geographic dataset statsgo soil survey staff n d within the watershed all being predominantly silty with moderate to low infiltration and depths varying from 0 3 to 1 4 m the 1994 2016 nass annual cropland data layers usda 2016 adjusted in accordance with the swat plant growth database arnold et al 2012 were used to describe land cover in the watershed considering dominant corn soybean rotation schemes additionally subsurface tile drains were implemented in swat for all fields under corn soybean rotation upstream of lake shelbyville fig 1b in accordance with harmeson et al 1971 s study and the 2009 potential tile drainage extent map usda nrcs 2009 anhydrous ammonia was applied in swat to corn fields using the heat unit approach and a permissible nitrogen stress of 0 9 rather than fixed application dates to consider the impacts of climate variability on planting and other field operation dates the initial amount of applied fertilizer was 200 kg ha which was then adjusted at the subbasin scale during model calibration a total of 7739 hrus were formed by overlapping the soil land cover and slope layers daily precipitation from 26 gauges and daily temperature from 18 stations were used in the model fig 1a being the closest and more representative to the swat s subbasins the data was collected from the noaa ghcn menne et al 2012 and the illinois warm illinois state water survey 2015 archives for the 1960 2017 period relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed data were simulated using the swat built in weather generator lake shelbyville and carlyle lake were set up in the model using a controlled release scheme with the volume at the joint use pool elevation as the target storage and the volume at the flood control pool elevation and the minimum allowable release as constraints illinois state water survey 1975 usace 2016a 2016b five additional minor reservoirs were set up in the model based on their surface area and volume at maximum capacity due to the lack of more detailed data the simulation period was set from 1 january 1975 to 31 december 2017 43 years from which the first five years were employed to set up the initial conditions of the model the performance of the model was validated against historic records of streamflow at 22 gaging stations and rating curve generated loads of nitrate sediment and oxygen at seven three and ten sampling locations fig 1e respectively model simulations were conducted at a daily time step and the outputs converted into monthly and or annual bases when needed we used the sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 implemented in the swat cup software to identify the best fitting model the statistical criteria used for model performance evaluation were the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 2 4 environmental predictor variables environmental variables such as streamflow q water temperature tw sediment sc and nitrate nc concentrations and dissolved oxygen do were selected as potential predictors of total and game fish species richness in the krw they can serve as signature measures of hydrologic alteration due to natural and anthropogenic stressors and reflect ecological integrity deterioration including instream habitat specifically streamflow determines longitudinal connectivity across the river network and serves as the medium of transport of sediments and nutrients affecting primary production and food webs moreover sediment and nitrate concentrations regulate turbidity and the proliferation of algae which may cause respiratory issues a decrease in dissolved oxygen a shift of species and a potential decrease in pool species water temperature on the other hand is crucial for metabolic and physical processes allan 2004 helms et al 2009 knouft and chu 2015 krause et al 2005 wenger et al 2011 due to the lack of a water temperature monitoring system in the watershed the water temperature was estimated for each of the streams using a second degree polynomial regression between air temperature records and water temperature samples available at two gauges i e 05594100 and 05595000 over the periods 1980 1981 and 2015 2017 respectively figure a 1 the estimated water temperatures and the swat generated values of the remaining variables converted from loads to concentrations for each subbasin were used to describe the fish environment interactions these potential predictors were characterized by the annual mean minimum maximum cumulative value and standard deviation derived from monthly values for time frames ranging from one to three years prior to the sampling year for each sampling site or group of sampling sites the most representative environmental predictors were arranged in multiple combinations as inputs to diverse regression trials that aimed at describing the spatio temporal patterns of fish species richness across the watershed these regression trials comprised of techniques such as diverse multiple linear regression mlr schemes e g polynomial with interaction effect generalized additive model gam and random forest rf alpaydin 2014 fahrmeir et al 2013 hernandez suarez and nejadhashemi 2018 to identify the most representative predictors for mlr and gam we conducted a cross site principal component analysis pca to transform the selected environmental variables into uncorrelated principal components all variables were normalized log10 transformed and scaled before the pca to avoid an ill conditioned system principal components that jointly described at least 90 of the variation in the original variable set were used to build the regression models each regression endeavor was assessed through the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and a residual analysis to select the most reliable model that explained the greatest variation in the richness metrics the optimal predictive models were employed to accurately reflect the state of the fish species richness during the baseline period and to project their future behavior under the integrated climate and land management scenarios the model development and all the statistical analyses were performed using the r 3 6 1 environment for statistical computing and graphics r core team 2019 2 5 climate projections the impacts of future climate on the hydrology of the krw were simulated using the multi model ensemble produced by the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and downscaled by the bureau of reclamation et al 2016 from the localized constructed analogs pierce et al 2014 this ensemble aggregates projections of temperature and precipitation from 32 integrated atmosphere ocean global climate models aogcm for the representative concentration pathways rcp with a radiative forcing equivalent to 4 5 and 8 5 w m 2 at the end of the century the rcp8 5 was employed in this study to upper bound the most unfavorable conditions of future climate for the krw as it depicts the highest greenhouse gas emissions in absence of mitigation policies riahi et al 2011 the dataset covers the continental us territory at a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude 7 km at the equator from 1950 to 2099 at daily time step in accordance with the climate ensemble data the projected mean trend of the total annual precipitation was slightly increasing for the krw although the slope of this trend described a threefold increase in the 2020 2099 period 8 3 mm decade 1 compared to that of the baseline 2 6 mm decade 1 the precipitation was not significantly affected in the future its mean value is expected to be around 1000 mm until 2100 with a maximum up to 1500 mm and a minimum at approximately 750 mm fig 2 a on the contrary the minimum mean and maximum annual temperature presented a marked increasing linear trend at a rate of 0 92 0 61 and 0 79 c per decade respectively for the projection period this represents a rise of approximately 8 82 5 62 and 7 56 c in the minimum mean and maximum annual temperature respectively at the end of the century in comparison with the baseline mean fig 2b d 2 6 land management scenarios the krw may face environmental challenges in the near future due to its highly cultivated landscape and controlled flow regime which can be exacerbated by alterations in the climate system this situation demands the implementation of sustainable bmps that are both technically and socially relevant to balance the conflicts between environmental wellness and agricultural intensification a scenario based analysis was employed to assess the response of the krw to selected management scenarios and future climate based on data collected from recent social studies shipley et al 2020 state conservation program reports idnr 2017 iepa 2015 iepa et al 2019 and expert opinion czapar pers comm december 4 2019 schaefer pers comm april 18 2019 four major management practices were identified as the most feasible in terms of stakeholder acceptability and environmental soundness to ensure a sustainable and resilient agro production in the watershed 1 crop rotation 2 cover crops 3 reduced till 4 and reduced or modified fertilizer application these alternatives were implemented in 13 land management scenarios using random focal areas and different linear transition periods starting in 2020 table 1 each of these land use scenarios was simulated under the 32 climate projections to account for climate driven uncertainties in the hydro ecologic system thus forming a set of 416 integrated climate and land management scenarios we employed the swat lut software moriasi et al 2019 to modify the hrus to represent the percent change of the implementation of management practices based on user defined time stamped land use layers and current soil spatial variability this approach emulates a dynamic land use scheme in swat with the advantage of not disturbing the configuration of the hydrologic system in the model 2 7 analysis of results to analyze the changes in fish total and game species richness under the distinct climate and land management scenarios table 1 the projected annual richness values averaged over decadal frames were used to estimate the percentage of changes from the baseline period for the next five decades after implementation of each scenario specifically we built maps at the stream level to identify spatial change patterns across the watershed under the combined effects of all climate projections where the values represented by colors correspond to the percentage change in fish richness these changes were computed as the relative difference between the mean of a given decade and the baseline mean from the annual values reconstructed and projected by the total and game fish richness models at 100 streams that registered sample records additionally we performed a stream order analysis to evaluate how fish species richness may vary among different watercourse sizes the krw stream network was classified following the strahler s stream ordering methodology strahler 1957 fig 1d for this analysis we built slope plots for each land management scenario based on the most likely decadal percentage changes depicted from empirical probability density functions pdf estimated for all streams of a given order across the krw under the combined effects of all climate projections the most likely percentage changes corresponded to the value with the highest probability described in the pdf for each analyzed decade 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration the performance of swat in simulating the spatio temporal patterns of streamflow and sediment nitrate and oxygen loads at the monthly time step showed satisfactory results in accordance with the asabe guidelines for calibrating hydrologic and water quality models asabe 2017 the nse 0 64 0 89 and pbias 4 3 13 3 across the 22 gaging stations fig 1e indicated a good fit between the observed and simulated streamflow figure a 2 it is important to highlight the outstanding capability of the model to mimic the outflow of the major reservoirs i e lake shelbyville and carlyle lake which attained nse of 0 65 and 0 75 and pbias of 6 3 and 0 5 respectively figs 1e and a 2 gauges 6 and 13 this outcome reinforces swat robustness and appropriateness for modeling complex processes involved in reservoir scheduling and controlled regime watersheds as krw the gauges that reported the lowest nse and highest pbias were found to be those located near urban settlements and minor reservoirs this can be due to the lack of data describing the minor reservoir operation that controls the discharges of the municipal stormwater systems despite these limitations model performance at these gauges were still considered satisfactory nse 0 64 pbias 15 due to the lack of continuous sediment sampling the time series of measured sediment loads were reconstructed using rating curves derived from non continuous sampling data available at three locations across the watershed this technique allowed for the evaluation of monthly nse which resulted in values equal to 0 82 0 58 and 0 53 and the pbias equal to 1 9 3 1 and 31 6 for the gaging stations 9 18 and 20 respectively figs 1e and a 2 overall the model was able to simulate the general trends in sediment load at an acceptable degree in compliance with moriasi et al 2007 s performance rating referenced by asabe due to the uncertainties associated with the scheduling and extent of the fertilizer application which significantly impacts the nitrate load the nse was not used to measure the performance of the model since it involves the evaluation of the timing of the loads which the model cannot replicate the pbias on the other hand measures the difference between the simulated and measured cumulative loads and is a better representative of how the mass of nitrate changed at monthly or larger time steps e g yearly seasonal decadal the pbias described a reasonable goodness of fit being equal to 4 9 6 9 at six of the seven monitoring gauges and reaching a maximum of 19 at the remaining one figs 1e and a 2 gage 9 oxygen loads on the other hand were not calibrated but evaluated to make sure that the magnitude of the simulated values agree with the reconstructed historic records available at ten monitoring gauges figure a 2 the nse values ranged between 0 56 and 0 86 while the pbias varied from 7 0 to 30 9 overall the model was able to simulate the magnitude and timing of the oxygen load patterns across krw with a general tendency to underestimate its magnitude by 23 8 which represents an acceptable degree in compliance with the moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 performance ratings for nutrients referenced by asabe 3 2 fish model results from the regression trials indicated that the 1 year time frame prior to the fish sampling has the most influence on describing the fish environment interactions which also confirmed in similar studies knouft and chu 2015 krause et al 2005 the regression schemes that better fit the total and game fish species richness corresponded to the mlr with interaction effect and gam respectively that considered the statistic metrics for all the predictor variables i e q tw sc nc do however it is essential to note that from the pca the sum of the eigenvalues i e the variance of the first seven principal components described 90 of the variability present in the original variable set consequently only these seven principal components were used to develop the regression models the aforementioned regression models obtained the highest adjusted r2 0 35 0 34 and the lowest rmse 3 94 2 63 moreover the appropriateness of the models was evaluated through an analysis of residuals which represent the difference between the fitted and observed values and must be as close to zero as possible and describe no pattern fig 3 the quasi symmetric bell shaped histograms in figs 3c and 3g indicated that most of the residuals are around zero and follow the normality assumption as required for this kind of models this hypothesis was further verified evaluating the randomness and structure of the residual dispersion and the quantile equivalency using the fitted values vs residuals plots fig 3d and 3h and the normal q q plots of residual deviance fig 3b and 3f the scatterplots of observed and fitted values fig 3a and 3e on the other hand showed a generalized underestimation of total and game fish species richness greater than 24 and 9 respectively it is important to highlight that variation in species richness was better explained for total than for the game fish despite these limitations both models were robust in describing fish metrics subjected to the available data 3 3 spatio temporal impacts on fish species richness preliminary results showed that the spatio temporal response of the fish species to the implementation of the bmps did not show significant differences compared to the response under the current land management scenario 0 table 1 because of this we disaggregated the decadal variation in total and game fish species richness into that induced by land management and that induced by future climate through boxplots depicting the specific quantile distribution for each bmp and climate projection figures a 3 and a 4 in accordance with the quantile distributions the variation in both total and game fish species richness due to the distinct land management practices in terms of the median interquartile range maximum and minimum thresholds and the upper and lower bound of outliers appeared to be minimal compared to that due to the projected climate figures a 3 and a 4 this indicated that the changes in fish species richness signaled by future climate variability were stronger than those induced by the implementation of bmps in other terms fish species in krw may be more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land management practices thus the spatio temporal variation in species richness across the watershed under the distinct land management scenarios was analyzed as a single scenario 3 3 1 total fish species the total fish species richness described a generalized decreasing pattern across the krw over the five decades evaluated fig 4 a however this decreasing pattern was more attenuated in the lower subcatchment while in the middle and central subcatchments it was more pronounced fig 4a the total fish species richness in the upper subcatchment the most cultivated seemed to decrease from 5 10 in the 2020s to 15 20 in the 2060s despite these notable changes the total fish species richness was relatively unchanged from the 2030s to the 2050s besides a couple of small size streams in the eastern part where it decreased from the 2020s at a rate of approximately 5 per decade fig 4a the total fish species richness in the lower subcatchment the least cultivated did not significantly change over time its streams presented a wide range of changes varying from decreases of 5 to 30 the latter bound being more frequent in small size streams it is important to note that by the 2060s four small size streams signaled a recovery with increases in total fish species richness of 15 45 fig 4a the middle subcatchment on the other hand appeared to be the most affected where its northern part described a decrease in total species richness close to 50 in the 2020s a condition that remained relatively constant until the end of the projection period its southern part depicted a progressive decrease at a rate of 10 per decade fig 4a decadal changes for the central catchment were noticed in small size streams as well but at a 7 decrease per decade from the 2020s to the 2050s the 2060s results were similar to the 2050s but with a couple of effluents depicting a recovery in the number of species of approximately 35 compared to the baseline mean fig 4a overall the temporal variations of total fish species richness seemed to be induced by changes in the climate regime primarily driven by increasing temperatures fig 2 with small size streams first and second order being the most affected small size streams tend to be shallower than medium and large size streams providing less protection to aquatic life against abrupt temperature sediment and nutrient changes and hence prone to more variability moreover small size streams are more prone to fragmentation than their medium and large counterparts which translates into reduced longitudinal connectivity branco et al 2012 and more difficulty for fish to migrate to better habitats streams with the greatest declines in total species richness were located in the highly forested areas of the watershed middle and central subcatchments figs 1b and 4 on the surface this may imply that total fish species richness is negatively related to forested land cover however over the 2020 2069 period we noticed a slight reduction up to 7 5 in the mean and maximum dissolved oxygen and a decline in the forest biomass up to 19 3 which is likely influencing total fish species richness overall results were not conclusive as what among the environmental predictors used to project the total fish species richness predominantly controlled modeled changes studies investigating the relationship between environmental predictors and fish species jones et al 1999 krause et al 2005 nislow 2005 roth et al 1996 wang et al 1997 have not reached definite conclusions due to the complex interactions among the factors involved and the fact that fish responses vary among taxonomic groups we believe that the fish species in the streams where high declining patterns were observed may be at greater risk for listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act u s fish and wildlife service 1973 due to the combination of anthropogenic and environmental leading to a predicted decline of 50 or more 3 3 2 game fish species the number of game fish species also declined progressively over time but contrary to the projected changes for the total fish species richness its spatial variation depicted a marked decreasing gradient from north to south the upper subcatchment signaled an increase in game fish species richness of 10 20 in the 2020s a condition that gradually decreased over time to 10 10 in the 2060s fig 4b similarly most of the streams in the middle subcatchment described a 5 20 increase in the number of species compared to the baseline right after the implementation of scenarios these percentages progressively decreased over the projection period with most of the streams reporting changes between 0 and 10 by the 2060s besides a couple of small size streams in the northern part that were down up to 10 fig 4b the southern part on the other hand showed similar changes to those for the central and lower subcatchments which faced the worst impacts across the krw with a decline in game fish species richness between 7 and 16 predominantly in 1st 2nd and 3rd ordered streams fig 4b the spatial changes in the game fish species richness seemed to follow the temperature gradient ranging from at least 1 c and up to 3 5 c from the upper and lower subcatchments although 1 c does not appear to be a significant difference some fish species detect changes in temperature as small as 0 03 c and can develop stress related diseases under abrupt thermal fluctuations elevated temperatures and more frequent heat waves dai and suski 2019 temperature changes were expected in the krw at a major proportion in the water minimum temperature which may imply the migration of certain species to other locations and their disappearance from some streams although game fish species richness depicted positive changes in the upper subcatchment their magnitude gradually decreased as the water temperature increased this likely indicates that the upper subcatchment also registered a decline in the species richness but after the 2060s as the temperature in the watershed is expected to continue rising until the end of the century it is also important to note that small size streams were most negatively impacted for both fish species groups and hence the impacts at the stream order level may be evaluated additionally notice that the range of variation in total fish species 50 fig 4a was more than twice larger compared to that in game fish species 20 fig 4b which indicated that non game fish species may be more prone to be altered than game fish species in the decades to come 3 4 impacts on fish species richness at the stream order level the most likely percentage changes in fish species revealed an increasing loss of species in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams however these losses followed different patterns for the total and game fish species richness these patterns unlike those observed in the spatio temporal analysis revealed four distinctive response trajectories based on the implementation of the land management scenarios this means that although the impacts of the land management schemes were lesser compared to the impacts induced by the future climate variability their effects were stream size dependent 3 4 1 total fish the most likely percentage changes in total fish species were negative over the five projection decades 2020 2069 from the four stream orders identified in the krw fig 1 the second and fourth resembled downward sloping trendlines with decadal declines of approximately 2 0 3 1 and 3 4 4 0 respectively thus the number of total fish species was projected to decrease from 10 and 4 7 in the 2020s to 20 8 and 21 in the 2060s respectively without significant differences 3 among the distinct land management scenarios fig 5 a the first order streams on the other hand reached a fish species loss up to 41 at the last decade of the projection period fig 5a and hence were the most affected under all the land management scenarios besides scenario 4 these streams described a net reduction of 10 3 13 3 compared to the baseline in the course of the first two projection decades however this decline was followed by an overwhelming reduction in the number of species of 17 6 from the 2030s to the 2040s representing a net loss of 31 and almost twice the value projected over the 2020 2039 period through the following 20 years a less pronounced declining trend was observed with an approximate rate of 5 per decade reaching a 41 decrease in total fish species richness in the 2060s fig 5a from all the management alternatives scenario 4 split n application table 1 was the only one that signaled a buffer effect in the declining trends of total fish species this buffer effect translated in a one decade delay in the overwhelming 17 decrease originally observed in the 2040s under the rest of the scenarios fig 5a scenario 4 however this buffer effect was temporary and the number of species decreased to 41 in the 2060s as under the other scenarios the most likely percentage changes in species richness for the total fish in the third order streams signaled three distinct trajectories under the 13 land management scenarios over the projection period the first trajectory under the current management scenario 0 table 1 showed a similar magnitude of decrease in the species richness in the five evaluation decades 17 1 13 6 which translates into no significant changes over time fig 5a scenario 0 unlike the no action scenario scenario 0 all the proposed bmps scenarios 1 12 table 1 seemed to depart from a percentage change close to 0 in the 2020s fig 5a however by the 2030s the total fish richness declined to approximately 17 4 after which the remaining two trajectories became evident under scenarios 1 2 and 10 12 associated with the reductions in the n application rates and reduced tillage table 1 the changes in total fish species signaled a modest upward trend of just 2 per decade over the 2040 2069 period reaching a net reduction of 16 3 13 5 fig 5a the last trajectory under scenarios 3 9 split n application crop rotation and cover cropping table 1 projected a 8 recovery in the number of species between the 2030s and 2040s followed by a slight decline during the last two projection decades until closing at 14 7 in the 2060s as the other scenarios including scenario 0 fig 5a this indicated that despite the ability of some of land management alternatives to signal a recovery in the species richness over certain decades the impact of future climate is more prominent consequently the long term impacts may be inevitable if the proposed land management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically design to protect aquatic life although the use of pcs in the fish models hinders the correlation of the fish metrics with the original environmental predictors we were still able to identify some interactions that may explain the results as the temperature increased the minimum streamflow and the minimum nitrate concentrations decreased across the watershed the latter took place in first and second order streams with changes up to 33 while the prior occurred in all order streams with changes up to 10 although it is well known that in natural systems nitrate is considered harmful to fish species at concentrations higher than 100 mg l francis floyd et al 2009 kroupova et al 2012 petty 2006 low concentrations can also induce chronic health to certain fish species davidson et al 2014 and inhibit the growth of algae and other aquatic plants because common fish prey e g mussels larvae crustaceans worms relies on the availability of algae and aquatic plants certain fish species may be threatened via food web dynamics changes in the minimum streamflow on the other hand are more critical to small size streams as they can fully dry consequently under such conditions fish may be precluded to inhabit these streams 3 4 2 game fish the most likely percentage changes in game fish species depicted a declining trend over the course of the entire projection period with no apparent differences under the distinct management alternatives in all stream of orders except the 4th fig 5b the number of game species in first order streams was projected to linearly decline from 3 2 in the 2020s to 9 5 in the 2060s 1 5 per decade while that in second order streams faced a maximum decrease of approximately 4 1 by the 2040s where they remained relatively constant until the 2060s fig 5b in the third order streams the percentage changes in game fish species richness were positive recovery effect over the five projection decades however a declining trend was still observed in the 2040 2059 period where the percentage change in game fish species passed from 13 6 to 6 5 7 1 difference fig 5b the game fish species richness in the fourth order streams signaled four different response trajectories due to the land management scenarios in scenario 0 current management table 1 the number of game fish species decreased from 6 2 in the 2020s to almost 0 in the 2030s where it remained until the end of the evaluation period fig 5b under scenarios 1 2 and 9 11 reduced n application and non conventional tillage table 1 the game fish species were projected to recover approximately 9 in the 2020s and then to linearly decline to 6 by the 2050s the latter represented a decreasing rate of 5 per decade being similar to that observed in fourth order streams for the total fish species the last decade for this management set showed a recovery in the number of species matching the baseline records i e 0 change fig 5b the third response trajectory was due to scenarios 3 5 8 and 12 split n application crop rotation cover cropping and no till table 1 under these management alternatives the species richness went from 8 2 in the 2020s to below 0 after the 2030s where after reaching the minimum at approximately 4 4 depicted a recovery until reaching 0 as the previous scenario set fig 5b the last trajectory comprised of the system response to scenario 4 described a distinctive behavior compared to the rest of the scenarios as reported for the total fish species as it projected positive percentage changes over the five decades evaluated however notice that it linearly declined over time from 10 in the 2020s to 0 in the 2050s with a slight recovery of 3 2 by the 2060s the projections for the game fish species in the first and second order streams showed similar patterns most affected to those for the total fish species which followed the depletion in the annual minimums for the streamflow in response to the increasing temperatures expected in the watershed in the third order streams however the recovery in the number of species was driven by the maximum nitrate concentrations having the least increase over the projection period from all the stream orders in 11 of the 13 land management scenarios we did not identify a distinctive environmental predictor that induced the game fish responses in the fourth stream orders but we believe this was due to the high variability present in the main stem of the kaskaskia river where most of the recreational fishing takes place specifically recreational fishing in krw is clustered in the shelbyville and carlyle lakes and downstream the latter in the channelized segment of the river which provide better conditions for this activity lastly while we acknowledge that fish stocking may impact long term changes in fish species richness eby et al 2006 incorporating an understanding top down food web effects impacts to nutrient cycles and other biotic abiotic interactions was beyond the scope of this study however effects of management actions such as supplemental stocking are inherently reflected in the fish sampling data used to validate model performance stocking practices may have added additional variability in the model when the number of species peak and may explain its tendency to underestimate species richness greater than nine fig 3 4 conclusions this study integrated swat with fish regression models to simulate the future impacts of environmental predictors on fish species richness under future climate and 13 land management alternatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of agricultural intensification the results showed that the spatio temporal response of total and game fish species to the implementation of the distinct management alternatives did not result in significant differences compared to that under the current land management this indicated that fish species in the krw are more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land management practices specifically the most likely percentage changes in fish species for both total and game fish revealed an increasing loss of species in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams 5 10 decade 1 this decline in the number of species was due to the progressive increase in the temperatures 0 61 c 0 92 c decade 1 expected in the watershed however its spatial distribution differed from one fish group to the other implying that fish responses may vary among taxonomic groups the spatial changes in the game fish species gradually decreased from the upper 10 20 to the lower 7 16 subcatchment following the watershed temperature gradient 1 0 c 3 5 c while for the total fish species the most affected streams decline up to 50 were found in the middle and central subcatchments in the highly forested areas of the watershed the differences in the range of variation between the total 50 and the game fish 20 species suggested that the non game fish species may be more prone to be affected in the future than its game counterpart the framework that we developed in this study facilitated the evaluation of the possible impacts of distinct land management alternatives on the fish species under a set of climate projections and allowed us to estimate the most probable state of their richness several decades after the implementation of changes despite the assumptions that implementing best management practices to improve the quality of stream ecosystems that can benefit biodiversity we found that the impacts of climate change can significantly undermine the effects of these practices the long term impacts on fish species richness may be inevitable if the proposed land management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically designed to protect aquatic life including the adoption of policies that reduce climate change impacts funding this work was supported by the u s department of agriculture usda national institute of food and agriculture nifa 2018 68002 27918 the authors

24608,freshwater systems are some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world factors contributing to their degradation can be associated with the expansion and intensification of agriculture in the 20th century which has led to habitat degradation and water pollution to mitigate the impacts of agricultural activities and improve stream ecosystem quality government funded conservation programs have promoted the implementation of best management practices bmps during the last three to four decades however these conservation programs have been implemented within agricultural landscapes without evaluating exhaustively their potential side effects on freshwater species at the watershed scale this study aimed to assess the changes in freshwater biodiversity in terms of fish species richness under future climate and potential conservation land management schemes in the kaskaskia river watershed illinois usa fish regression models were integrated to the soil and water assessment tool swat to simulate the responses of total and game fish species richness to four major management practices crop rotation cover cropping reduced tillage modified fertilizer application identified as the most feasible in terms of stakeholder acceptability and environmental soundness under 32 distinct climate projections results showed that fish species in the krw are more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land management practices specifically the most likely percentage changes in fish species revealed a potential decline in richness in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams 5 10 decade 1 due to the progressive increase in the temperatures 0 61 c 0 92 c decade 1 expected in the watershed the long term impacts on fish species richness may be inevitable if the proposed land management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically design to protect aquatic life keywords fish species richness climate change bmps ecohydrology swat 1 introduction freshwater systems play an important role in ecological regulation and biodiversity conservation these ecosystems provide habitat and support for almost 10 of the species including humans and 40 of fish species globally while covering less than 1 of the planet s surface balian et al 2008 fao 2018 tedesco et al 2017 although critical to ecological health freshwater systems represent some of the most threatened ecosystems in the world with declining rates in biodiversity greater than those observed in terrestrial systems in accordance with the living planet index wwf 2018 freshwater species have declined 83 since 1970 in north america for example such declining trends in freshwater species have been estimated at 4 per decade five times the declining trends in terrestrial species dudgeon et al 2006 vaughn 2010 factors contributing to their degradation are directly linked to human activities and include habitat degradation flow modification water pollution and overexploitation in fact most of these factors are associated with the expansion and intensification of agriculture in the 20th century in response to the ever increasing demand for food and other commodities as a result agriculture has become the second largest driver of biodiversity decline and a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions maxwell et al 2016 despite efforts to develop and implement more sustainable agricultural practices the impacts of new land management approaches on freshwater systems are still unknown especially under projected climate change scenarios which have also been identified as one of the potential threats to biodiversity in the decades to come buisson et al 2013 comte et al 2013 lynch et al 2016 therefore a holistic understanding of how anthropogenic disturbances may impact freshwater biodiversity across agricultural landscapes is of great importance to formulate timely and appropriate mitigation plans agricultural systems have been implicated in extensive conversion of native land covers to row crops leading to soil degradation channelization reduction of riparian buffers and wetland drainage helms et al 2009 rowe et al 2009 thus evidence of hydrologic alteration has emerged from these landscape disturbances exposing soils and water bodies to higher runoff and peak flows that worsen erosion and nutrient loss increase flood risk and magnify sedimentation and siltation and lead to impairment of water bodies due to pesticides and pathogens allan 2004 knouft and chu 2015 mateo sagasta et al 2017 moreover several hydro ecologic studies have shown that freshwater biomes are prone to assemblage shifts and loss of species richness under such changes helms et al 2009 maloney and weller 2011 wang et al 2006 while other have drawn attention to the boosting effects that global warming may have on physiological stress buisson et al 2013 2008 buisson and grenouillet 2009 counteracting these affects the implementation of best management practices bmps have been promoted by government funded conservation programs during the last three to four decades to mitigate the impacts of agricultural activities and improve stream ecosystem quality shields et al 2006 among them conservation tillage crop rotation cover cropping and the establishment of wetlands buffers and bioreactors have been the most commonly promoted practices as the impact assessment of bmps on freshwater systems involves multiple environmental factors characterized by landscapes with diverse physiographic and climatic features its execution is laborious and very costly at a larger scale consequently impact assessments documenting the response of freshwater species to these practices have been constrained to short term studies performed in small experimental subcatchments potentially overlooking the synergies present in large complex agro ecosystems additionally simultaneously implemented bmps have shown limited or no environmental benefits on biodiversity conservation at local scales particularly where intrinsic characteristics of the landscape are complex smiley et al 2011 zimmerman et al 2003 despite these findings conservation programs have been implemented within agricultural landscapes without evaluating exhaustively their potential side effects on freshwater species at the watershed scale smiley jr et al 2009 to propose comprehensive management practices for the sustainable use of land and water resources and the conservation of biodiversity there is a critical need to understand the linkage between species assemblages and environmental factors such as climate watershed hydrology and water quality at the watershed scale the main objective of this study was to assess the changes in biodiversity in terms of fish species richness under future climate and potential conservation land management schemes specifically this study was aimed at 1 developing a hydrologic modeling framework to simulate long term patterns of streamflow and water quality at the watershed scale 2 building a regression model that associates fish species richness with potential environmental predictors and 3 quantifying the potential effects of future climate and land management scenarios on the spatio temporal patterns of such species richness the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to simulate the hydrologic responses of the kaskaskia river watershed krw in central illinois usa to different management schemes intended to mitigate agricultural intensification the water courses in the krw are controlled by three dam structures along the principal stem of the river the water courses are used for navigation water supply recreation and fishing all of which may be affected by projected climate changes to determine whether the current ecosystem services from streams will be conserved worsened or improved in the krw we developed tools and techniques to evaluate the projected mid and long term states of fish species richness in the watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the krw is located in south central illinois u s a and drains approximately 15 000 km2 to the mississippi river fig 1 this makes it the second largest watershed in the state after the illinois river watershed irw occupying approximately 10 of the state by area between 1980 and 2015 the watershed contained 104 unique species of fishes five year interval mean 64 6 se 7 5 two of which are endangered or threatened within the state illinois endangered species protection board 2015 today land use is devoted primarily to croplands 63 corn and soybean being the predominant commodities while the remaining portion of the watershed is under forest 16 grasslands 9 and built areas 9 usda 2016 fig 1b prior to european settlement in the 1700s the watershed was comprised of tallgrass prairies wetlands and bottomland forest usace 2017 however the fast growing expansion of the agricultural frontier and the development of land and water transport and flood control infrastructure in the 20th century accelerated the fragmentation and degradation of the pre settlement ecosystems southwestern illinois rcandd 2002 crop production has been identified as the dominant source of impairment in some krw tributaries exceeding state water quality standards predominantly for nitrate and phosphorus and in minor proportion for ammonia williard and shrestha 2016 despite significant efforts made by local authorities to counteract this impairment water quality in five of the 13 sampling points designated to monitor such pollutants across the watershed continued to decline during the 2005 2014 period while two did not present any improvement compared to the 1980 2004 records williard and shrestha 2016 2 2 fish assemblage data the fish data utilized in this study was collected at 222 sites across the krw fig 1f by the illinois department of natural resources division of fisheries and provided by the illinois natural history survey with support from the u s fish and wildlife service federal aid project f 69 r to j a stein these sites were sampled on a non continuous basis once every certain number of years from 1952 to 2015 during the may october sampling season using multiple sampling gears and standard deployment methodologies that combine seining with electrofishing zale et al 2013 the dataset comprises records of number of individuals captured per species per sample to evaluate the potential impacts of future climate and bmps on biodiversity and recreation the data was aggregated into annual total and game fish species richness i e number of species an additional spatial aggregation was performed on the data by averaging richness values among sampling sites occurring within a single stream used in the hydrologic model note that game fish species comprise species approved to be caught for pleasure or competition while total fish species comprise both game and non game fish species over the 1980 2015 sampling period the mean annual number of species per sampling point was found to be equal to 18 and 7 for total and game fish respectively indicating wide variability in species diversity among subbasins across the entire krw which has a basin wide richness of 104 species 2 3 hydrologic model we developed a baseline hydrologic model using swat to study the potential impacts of future climate and distinct bmps on the total and game fish species richness across the krw swat has been widely used and tested to be a reliable model for environmental impact assessment at the watershed scale under distinct land management schemes douglas mankin et al 2010 gassman et al 2007 its modeling framework considers further abstractions of human impacts through changes in land cover and land management practices which enables the simulation of long term patterns of streamflow sediment and nutrient loadings crop yields among other processes in complex watersheds consequently its capabilities are suited for heavily cultivated watersheds as the krw during the model set up the spatial heterogeneity of the study area was represented by dividing it into subbasins each of which represent the drainage area of one stream or river segment water flow as well as nutrient and sediment loads are determined by processes occurring at independent hydrologic response units hrus distributed across each subbasin these hrus are unique combinations of soil type slope class and land cover lumping the response of areas with similar characteristics to simplify the hydrologic system the swat model inputs include topographic soil land cover and use and climate data the spatial discretization of the krw employed a 30 m dem usgs 2016 and a minimum drainage area of 50 km2 these enabled the delineation of the smallest tributaries and a configuration of 175 subbasins terrain elevation ranged between 106 m and 261 m fig 1a and hence slopes were mostly uniform and below 5 and were discretized into a single slope class twenty 20 different soil types were identified based on the state soil geographic dataset statsgo soil survey staff n d within the watershed all being predominantly silty with moderate to low infiltration and depths varying from 0 3 to 1 4 m the 1994 2016 nass annual cropland data layers usda 2016 adjusted in accordance with the swat plant growth database arnold et al 2012 were used to describe land cover in the watershed considering dominant corn soybean rotation schemes additionally subsurface tile drains were implemented in swat for all fields under corn soybean rotation upstream of lake shelbyville fig 1b in accordance with harmeson et al 1971 s study and the 2009 potential tile drainage extent map usda nrcs 2009 anhydrous ammonia was applied in swat to corn fields using the heat unit approach and a permissible nitrogen stress of 0 9 rather than fixed application dates to consider the impacts of climate variability on planting and other field operation dates the initial amount of applied fertilizer was 200 kg ha which was then adjusted at the subbasin scale during model calibration a total of 7739 hrus were formed by overlapping the soil land cover and slope layers daily precipitation from 26 gauges and daily temperature from 18 stations were used in the model fig 1a being the closest and more representative to the swat s subbasins the data was collected from the noaa ghcn menne et al 2012 and the illinois warm illinois state water survey 2015 archives for the 1960 2017 period relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed data were simulated using the swat built in weather generator lake shelbyville and carlyle lake were set up in the model using a controlled release scheme with the volume at the joint use pool elevation as the target storage and the volume at the flood control pool elevation and the minimum allowable release as constraints illinois state water survey 1975 usace 2016a 2016b five additional minor reservoirs were set up in the model based on their surface area and volume at maximum capacity due to the lack of more detailed data the simulation period was set from 1 january 1975 to 31 december 2017 43 years from which the first five years were employed to set up the initial conditions of the model the performance of the model was validated against historic records of streamflow at 22 gaging stations and rating curve generated loads of nitrate sediment and oxygen at seven three and ten sampling locations fig 1e respectively model simulations were conducted at a daily time step and the outputs converted into monthly and or annual bases when needed we used the sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour et al 2007 implemented in the swat cup software to identify the best fitting model the statistical criteria used for model performance evaluation were the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 2 4 environmental predictor variables environmental variables such as streamflow q water temperature tw sediment sc and nitrate nc concentrations and dissolved oxygen do were selected as potential predictors of total and game fish species richness in the krw they can serve as signature measures of hydrologic alteration due to natural and anthropogenic stressors and reflect ecological integrity deterioration including instream habitat specifically streamflow determines longitudinal connectivity across the river network and serves as the medium of transport of sediments and nutrients affecting primary production and food webs moreover sediment and nitrate concentrations regulate turbidity and the proliferation of algae which may cause respiratory issues a decrease in dissolved oxygen a shift of species and a potential decrease in pool species water temperature on the other hand is crucial for metabolic and physical processes allan 2004 helms et al 2009 knouft and chu 2015 krause et al 2005 wenger et al 2011 due to the lack of a water temperature monitoring system in the watershed the water temperature was estimated for each of the streams using a second degree polynomial regression between air temperature records and water temperature samples available at two gauges i e 05594100 and 05595000 over the periods 1980 1981 and 2015 2017 respectively figure a 1 the estimated water temperatures and the swat generated values of the remaining variables converted from loads to concentrations for each subbasin were used to describe the fish environment interactions these potential predictors were characterized by the annual mean minimum maximum cumulative value and standard deviation derived from monthly values for time frames ranging from one to three years prior to the sampling year for each sampling site or group of sampling sites the most representative environmental predictors were arranged in multiple combinations as inputs to diverse regression trials that aimed at describing the spatio temporal patterns of fish species richness across the watershed these regression trials comprised of techniques such as diverse multiple linear regression mlr schemes e g polynomial with interaction effect generalized additive model gam and random forest rf alpaydin 2014 fahrmeir et al 2013 hernandez suarez and nejadhashemi 2018 to identify the most representative predictors for mlr and gam we conducted a cross site principal component analysis pca to transform the selected environmental variables into uncorrelated principal components all variables were normalized log10 transformed and scaled before the pca to avoid an ill conditioned system principal components that jointly described at least 90 of the variation in the original variable set were used to build the regression models each regression endeavor was assessed through the adjusted coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and a residual analysis to select the most reliable model that explained the greatest variation in the richness metrics the optimal predictive models were employed to accurately reflect the state of the fish species richness during the baseline period and to project their future behavior under the integrated climate and land management scenarios the model development and all the statistical analyses were performed using the r 3 6 1 environment for statistical computing and graphics r core team 2019 2 5 climate projections the impacts of future climate on the hydrology of the krw were simulated using the multi model ensemble produced by the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 and downscaled by the bureau of reclamation et al 2016 from the localized constructed analogs pierce et al 2014 this ensemble aggregates projections of temperature and precipitation from 32 integrated atmosphere ocean global climate models aogcm for the representative concentration pathways rcp with a radiative forcing equivalent to 4 5 and 8 5 w m 2 at the end of the century the rcp8 5 was employed in this study to upper bound the most unfavorable conditions of future climate for the krw as it depicts the highest greenhouse gas emissions in absence of mitigation policies riahi et al 2011 the dataset covers the continental us territory at a spatial resolution of 1 16 latitude longitude 7 km at the equator from 1950 to 2099 at daily time step in accordance with the climate ensemble data the projected mean trend of the total annual precipitation was slightly increasing for the krw although the slope of this trend described a threefold increase in the 2020 2099 period 8 3 mm decade 1 compared to that of the baseline 2 6 mm decade 1 the precipitation was not significantly affected in the future its mean value is expected to be around 1000 mm until 2100 with a maximum up to 1500 mm and a minimum at approximately 750 mm fig 2 a on the contrary the minimum mean and maximum annual temperature presented a marked increasing linear trend at a rate of 0 92 0 61 and 0 79 c per decade respectively for the projection period this represents a rise of approximately 8 82 5 62 and 7 56 c in the minimum mean and maximum annual temperature respectively at the end of the century in comparison with the baseline mean fig 2b d 2 6 land management scenarios the krw may face environmental challenges in the near future due to its highly cultivated landscape and controlled flow regime which can be exacerbated by alterations in the climate system this situation demands the implementation of sustainable bmps that are both technically and socially relevant to balance the conflicts between environmental wellness and agricultural intensification a scenario based analysis was employed to assess the response of the krw to selected management scenarios and future climate based on data collected from recent social studies shipley et al 2020 state conservation program reports idnr 2017 iepa 2015 iepa et al 2019 and expert opinion czapar pers comm december 4 2019 schaefer pers comm april 18 2019 four major management practices were identified as the most feasible in terms of stakeholder acceptability and environmental soundness to ensure a sustainable and resilient agro production in the watershed 1 crop rotation 2 cover crops 3 reduced till 4 and reduced or modified fertilizer application these alternatives were implemented in 13 land management scenarios using random focal areas and different linear transition periods starting in 2020 table 1 each of these land use scenarios was simulated under the 32 climate projections to account for climate driven uncertainties in the hydro ecologic system thus forming a set of 416 integrated climate and land management scenarios we employed the swat lut software moriasi et al 2019 to modify the hrus to represent the percent change of the implementation of management practices based on user defined time stamped land use layers and current soil spatial variability this approach emulates a dynamic land use scheme in swat with the advantage of not disturbing the configuration of the hydrologic system in the model 2 7 analysis of results to analyze the changes in fish total and game species richness under the distinct climate and land management scenarios table 1 the projected annual richness values averaged over decadal frames were used to estimate the percentage of changes from the baseline period for the next five decades after implementation of each scenario specifically we built maps at the stream level to identify spatial change patterns across the watershed under the combined effects of all climate projections where the values represented by colors correspond to the percentage change in fish richness these changes were computed as the relative difference between the mean of a given decade and the baseline mean from the annual values reconstructed and projected by the total and game fish richness models at 100 streams that registered sample records additionally we performed a stream order analysis to evaluate how fish species richness may vary among different watercourse sizes the krw stream network was classified following the strahler s stream ordering methodology strahler 1957 fig 1d for this analysis we built slope plots for each land management scenario based on the most likely decadal percentage changes depicted from empirical probability density functions pdf estimated for all streams of a given order across the krw under the combined effects of all climate projections the most likely percentage changes corresponded to the value with the highest probability described in the pdf for each analyzed decade 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat calibration the performance of swat in simulating the spatio temporal patterns of streamflow and sediment nitrate and oxygen loads at the monthly time step showed satisfactory results in accordance with the asabe guidelines for calibrating hydrologic and water quality models asabe 2017 the nse 0 64 0 89 and pbias 4 3 13 3 across the 22 gaging stations fig 1e indicated a good fit between the observed and simulated streamflow figure a 2 it is important to highlight the outstanding capability of the model to mimic the outflow of the major reservoirs i e lake shelbyville and carlyle lake which attained nse of 0 65 and 0 75 and pbias of 6 3 and 0 5 respectively figs 1e and a 2 gauges 6 and 13 this outcome reinforces swat robustness and appropriateness for modeling complex processes involved in reservoir scheduling and controlled regime watersheds as krw the gauges that reported the lowest nse and highest pbias were found to be those located near urban settlements and minor reservoirs this can be due to the lack of data describing the minor reservoir operation that controls the discharges of the municipal stormwater systems despite these limitations model performance at these gauges were still considered satisfactory nse 0 64 pbias 15 due to the lack of continuous sediment sampling the time series of measured sediment loads were reconstructed using rating curves derived from non continuous sampling data available at three locations across the watershed this technique allowed for the evaluation of monthly nse which resulted in values equal to 0 82 0 58 and 0 53 and the pbias equal to 1 9 3 1 and 31 6 for the gaging stations 9 18 and 20 respectively figs 1e and a 2 overall the model was able to simulate the general trends in sediment load at an acceptable degree in compliance with moriasi et al 2007 s performance rating referenced by asabe due to the uncertainties associated with the scheduling and extent of the fertilizer application which significantly impacts the nitrate load the nse was not used to measure the performance of the model since it involves the evaluation of the timing of the loads which the model cannot replicate the pbias on the other hand measures the difference between the simulated and measured cumulative loads and is a better representative of how the mass of nitrate changed at monthly or larger time steps e g yearly seasonal decadal the pbias described a reasonable goodness of fit being equal to 4 9 6 9 at six of the seven monitoring gauges and reaching a maximum of 19 at the remaining one figs 1e and a 2 gage 9 oxygen loads on the other hand were not calibrated but evaluated to make sure that the magnitude of the simulated values agree with the reconstructed historic records available at ten monitoring gauges figure a 2 the nse values ranged between 0 56 and 0 86 while the pbias varied from 7 0 to 30 9 overall the model was able to simulate the magnitude and timing of the oxygen load patterns across krw with a general tendency to underestimate its magnitude by 23 8 which represents an acceptable degree in compliance with the moriasi et al 2007 and moriasi et al 2015 performance ratings for nutrients referenced by asabe 3 2 fish model results from the regression trials indicated that the 1 year time frame prior to the fish sampling has the most influence on describing the fish environment interactions which also confirmed in similar studies knouft and chu 2015 krause et al 2005 the regression schemes that better fit the total and game fish species richness corresponded to the mlr with interaction effect and gam respectively that considered the statistic metrics for all the predictor variables i e q tw sc nc do however it is essential to note that from the pca the sum of the eigenvalues i e the variance of the first seven principal components described 90 of the variability present in the original variable set consequently only these seven principal components were used to develop the regression models the aforementioned regression models obtained the highest adjusted r2 0 35 0 34 and the lowest rmse 3 94 2 63 moreover the appropriateness of the models was evaluated through an analysis of residuals which represent the difference between the fitted and observed values and must be as close to zero as possible and describe no pattern fig 3 the quasi symmetric bell shaped histograms in figs 3c and 3g indicated that most of the residuals are around zero and follow the normality assumption as required for this kind of models this hypothesis was further verified evaluating the randomness and structure of the residual dispersion and the quantile equivalency using the fitted values vs residuals plots fig 3d and 3h and the normal q q plots of residual deviance fig 3b and 3f the scatterplots of observed and fitted values fig 3a and 3e on the other hand showed a generalized underestimation of total and game fish species richness greater than 24 and 9 respectively it is important to highlight that variation in species richness was better explained for total than for the game fish despite these limitations both models were robust in describing fish metrics subjected to the available data 3 3 spatio temporal impacts on fish species richness preliminary results showed that the spatio temporal response of the fish species to the implementation of the bmps did not show significant differences compared to the response under the current land management scenario 0 table 1 because of this we disaggregated the decadal variation in total and game fish species richness into that induced by land management and that induced by future climate through boxplots depicting the specific quantile distribution for each bmp and climate projection figures a 3 and a 4 in accordance with the quantile distributions the variation in both total and game fish species richness due to the distinct land management practices in terms of the median interquartile range maximum and minimum thresholds and the upper and lower bound of outliers appeared to be minimal compared to that due to the projected climate figures a 3 and a 4 this indicated that the changes in fish species richness signaled by future climate variability were stronger than those induced by the implementation of bmps in other terms fish species in krw may be more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land management practices thus the spatio temporal variation in species richness across the watershed under the distinct land management scenarios was analyzed as a single scenario 3 3 1 total fish species the total fish species richness described a generalized decreasing pattern across the krw over the five decades evaluated fig 4 a however this decreasing pattern was more attenuated in the lower subcatchment while in the middle and central subcatchments it was more pronounced fig 4a the total fish species richness in the upper subcatchment the most cultivated seemed to decrease from 5 10 in the 2020s to 15 20 in the 2060s despite these notable changes the total fish species richness was relatively unchanged from the 2030s to the 2050s besides a couple of small size streams in the eastern part where it decreased from the 2020s at a rate of approximately 5 per decade fig 4a the total fish species richness in the lower subcatchment the least cultivated did not significantly change over time its streams presented a wide range of changes varying from decreases of 5 to 30 the latter bound being more frequent in small size streams it is important to note that by the 2060s four small size streams signaled a recovery with increases in total fish species richness of 15 45 fig 4a the middle subcatchment on the other hand appeared to be the most affected where its northern part described a decrease in total species richness close to 50 in the 2020s a condition that remained relatively constant until the end of the projection period its southern part depicted a progressive decrease at a rate of 10 per decade fig 4a decadal changes for the central catchment were noticed in small size streams as well but at a 7 decrease per decade from the 2020s to the 2050s the 2060s results were similar to the 2050s but with a couple of effluents depicting a recovery in the number of species of approximately 35 compared to the baseline mean fig 4a overall the temporal variations of total fish species richness seemed to be induced by changes in the climate regime primarily driven by increasing temperatures fig 2 with small size streams first and second order being the most affected small size streams tend to be shallower than medium and large size streams providing less protection to aquatic life against abrupt temperature sediment and nutrient changes and hence prone to more variability moreover small size streams are more prone to fragmentation than their medium and large counterparts which translates into reduced longitudinal connectivity branco et al 2012 and more difficulty for fish to migrate to better habitats streams with the greatest declines in total species richness were located in the highly forested areas of the watershed middle and central subcatchments figs 1b and 4 on the surface this may imply that total fish species richness is negatively related to forested land cover however over the 2020 2069 period we noticed a slight reduction up to 7 5 in the mean and maximum dissolved oxygen and a decline in the forest biomass up to 19 3 which is likely influencing total fish species richness overall results were not conclusive as what among the environmental predictors used to project the total fish species richness predominantly controlled modeled changes studies investigating the relationship between environmental predictors and fish species jones et al 1999 krause et al 2005 nislow 2005 roth et al 1996 wang et al 1997 have not reached definite conclusions due to the complex interactions among the factors involved and the fact that fish responses vary among taxonomic groups we believe that the fish species in the streams where high declining patterns were observed may be at greater risk for listing as threatened or endangered under the endangered species act u s fish and wildlife service 1973 due to the combination of anthropogenic and environmental leading to a predicted decline of 50 or more 3 3 2 game fish species the number of game fish species also declined progressively over time but contrary to the projected changes for the total fish species richness its spatial variation depicted a marked decreasing gradient from north to south the upper subcatchment signaled an increase in game fish species richness of 10 20 in the 2020s a condition that gradually decreased over time to 10 10 in the 2060s fig 4b similarly most of the streams in the middle subcatchment described a 5 20 increase in the number of species compared to the baseline right after the implementation of scenarios these percentages progressively decreased over the projection period with most of the streams reporting changes between 0 and 10 by the 2060s besides a couple of small size streams in the northern part that were down up to 10 fig 4b the southern part on the other hand showed similar changes to those for the central and lower subcatchments which faced the worst impacts across the krw with a decline in game fish species richness between 7 and 16 predominantly in 1st 2nd and 3rd ordered streams fig 4b the spatial changes in the game fish species richness seemed to follow the temperature gradient ranging from at least 1 c and up to 3 5 c from the upper and lower subcatchments although 1 c does not appear to be a significant difference some fish species detect changes in temperature as small as 0 03 c and can develop stress related diseases under abrupt thermal fluctuations elevated temperatures and more frequent heat waves dai and suski 2019 temperature changes were expected in the krw at a major proportion in the water minimum temperature which may imply the migration of certain species to other locations and their disappearance from some streams although game fish species richness depicted positive changes in the upper subcatchment their magnitude gradually decreased as the water temperature increased this likely indicates that the upper subcatchment also registered a decline in the species richness but after the 2060s as the temperature in the watershed is expected to continue rising until the end of the century it is also important to note that small size streams were most negatively impacted for both fish species groups and hence the impacts at the stream order level may be evaluated additionally notice that the range of variation in total fish species 50 fig 4a was more than twice larger compared to that in game fish species 20 fig 4b which indicated that non game fish species may be more prone to be altered than game fish species in the decades to come 3 4 impacts on fish species richness at the stream order level the most likely percentage changes in fish species revealed an increasing loss of species in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams however these losses followed different patterns for the total and game fish species richness these patterns unlike those observed in the spatio temporal analysis revealed four distinctive response trajectories based on the implementation of the land management scenarios this means that although the impacts of the land management schemes were lesser compared to the impacts induced by the future climate variability their effects were stream size dependent 3 4 1 total fish the most likely percentage changes in total fish species were negative over the five projection decades 2020 2069 from the four stream orders identified in the krw fig 1 the second and fourth resembled downward sloping trendlines with decadal declines of approximately 2 0 3 1 and 3 4 4 0 respectively thus the number of total fish species was projected to decrease from 10 and 4 7 in the 2020s to 20 8 and 21 in the 2060s respectively without significant differences 3 among the distinct land management scenarios fig 5 a the first order streams on the other hand reached a fish species loss up to 41 at the last decade of the projection period fig 5a and hence were the most affected under all the land management scenarios besides scenario 4 these streams described a net reduction of 10 3 13 3 compared to the baseline in the course of the first two projection decades however this decline was followed by an overwhelming reduction in the number of species of 17 6 from the 2030s to the 2040s representing a net loss of 31 and almost twice the value projected over the 2020 2039 period through the following 20 years a less pronounced declining trend was observed with an approximate rate of 5 per decade reaching a 41 decrease in total fish species richness in the 2060s fig 5a from all the management alternatives scenario 4 split n application table 1 was the only one that signaled a buffer effect in the declining trends of total fish species this buffer effect translated in a one decade delay in the overwhelming 17 decrease originally observed in the 2040s under the rest of the scenarios fig 5a scenario 4 however this buffer effect was temporary and the number of species decreased to 41 in the 2060s as under the other scenarios the most likely percentage changes in species richness for the total fish in the third order streams signaled three distinct trajectories under the 13 land management scenarios over the projection period the first trajectory under the current management scenario 0 table 1 showed a similar magnitude of decrease in the species richness in the five evaluation decades 17 1 13 6 which translates into no significant changes over time fig 5a scenario 0 unlike the no action scenario scenario 0 all the proposed bmps scenarios 1 12 table 1 seemed to depart from a percentage change close to 0 in the 2020s fig 5a however by the 2030s the total fish richness declined to approximately 17 4 after which the remaining two trajectories became evident under scenarios 1 2 and 10 12 associated with the reductions in the n application rates and reduced tillage table 1 the changes in total fish species signaled a modest upward trend of just 2 per decade over the 2040 2069 period reaching a net reduction of 16 3 13 5 fig 5a the last trajectory under scenarios 3 9 split n application crop rotation and cover cropping table 1 projected a 8 recovery in the number of species between the 2030s and 2040s followed by a slight decline during the last two projection decades until closing at 14 7 in the 2060s as the other scenarios including scenario 0 fig 5a this indicated that despite the ability of some of land management alternatives to signal a recovery in the species richness over certain decades the impact of future climate is more prominent consequently the long term impacts may be inevitable if the proposed land management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically design to protect aquatic life although the use of pcs in the fish models hinders the correlation of the fish metrics with the original environmental predictors we were still able to identify some interactions that may explain the results as the temperature increased the minimum streamflow and the minimum nitrate concentrations decreased across the watershed the latter took place in first and second order streams with changes up to 33 while the prior occurred in all order streams with changes up to 10 although it is well known that in natural systems nitrate is considered harmful to fish species at concentrations higher than 100 mg l francis floyd et al 2009 kroupova et al 2012 petty 2006 low concentrations can also induce chronic health to certain fish species davidson et al 2014 and inhibit the growth of algae and other aquatic plants because common fish prey e g mussels larvae crustaceans worms relies on the availability of algae and aquatic plants certain fish species may be threatened via food web dynamics changes in the minimum streamflow on the other hand are more critical to small size streams as they can fully dry consequently under such conditions fish may be precluded to inhabit these streams 3 4 2 game fish the most likely percentage changes in game fish species depicted a declining trend over the course of the entire projection period with no apparent differences under the distinct management alternatives in all stream of orders except the 4th fig 5b the number of game species in first order streams was projected to linearly decline from 3 2 in the 2020s to 9 5 in the 2060s 1 5 per decade while that in second order streams faced a maximum decrease of approximately 4 1 by the 2040s where they remained relatively constant until the 2060s fig 5b in the third order streams the percentage changes in game fish species richness were positive recovery effect over the five projection decades however a declining trend was still observed in the 2040 2059 period where the percentage change in game fish species passed from 13 6 to 6 5 7 1 difference fig 5b the game fish species richness in the fourth order streams signaled four different response trajectories due to the land management scenarios in scenario 0 current management table 1 the number of game fish species decreased from 6 2 in the 2020s to almost 0 in the 2030s where it remained until the end of the evaluation period fig 5b under scenarios 1 2 and 9 11 reduced n application and non conventional tillage table 1 the game fish species were projected to recover approximately 9 in the 2020s and then to linearly decline to 6 by the 2050s the latter represented a decreasing rate of 5 per decade being similar to that observed in fourth order streams for the total fish species the last decade for this management set showed a recovery in the number of species matching the baseline records i e 0 change fig 5b the third response trajectory was due to scenarios 3 5 8 and 12 split n application crop rotation cover cropping and no till table 1 under these management alternatives the species richness went from 8 2 in the 2020s to below 0 after the 2030s where after reaching the minimum at approximately 4 4 depicted a recovery until reaching 0 as the previous scenario set fig 5b the last trajectory comprised of the system response to scenario 4 described a distinctive behavior compared to the rest of the scenarios as reported for the total fish species as it projected positive percentage changes over the five decades evaluated however notice that it linearly declined over time from 10 in the 2020s to 0 in the 2050s with a slight recovery of 3 2 by the 2060s the projections for the game fish species in the first and second order streams showed similar patterns most affected to those for the total fish species which followed the depletion in the annual minimums for the streamflow in response to the increasing temperatures expected in the watershed in the third order streams however the recovery in the number of species was driven by the maximum nitrate concentrations having the least increase over the projection period from all the stream orders in 11 of the 13 land management scenarios we did not identify a distinctive environmental predictor that induced the game fish responses in the fourth stream orders but we believe this was due to the high variability present in the main stem of the kaskaskia river where most of the recreational fishing takes place specifically recreational fishing in krw is clustered in the shelbyville and carlyle lakes and downstream the latter in the channelized segment of the river which provide better conditions for this activity lastly while we acknowledge that fish stocking may impact long term changes in fish species richness eby et al 2006 incorporating an understanding top down food web effects impacts to nutrient cycles and other biotic abiotic interactions was beyond the scope of this study however effects of management actions such as supplemental stocking are inherently reflected in the fish sampling data used to validate model performance stocking practices may have added additional variability in the model when the number of species peak and may explain its tendency to underestimate species richness greater than nine fig 3 4 conclusions this study integrated swat with fish regression models to simulate the future impacts of environmental predictors on fish species richness under future climate and 13 land management alternatives aimed at mitigating the impacts of agricultural intensification the results showed that the spatio temporal response of total and game fish species to the implementation of the distinct management alternatives did not result in significant differences compared to that under the current land management this indicated that fish species in the krw are more sensitive to changes in the climate regime than to changes in the land management practices specifically the most likely percentage changes in fish species for both total and game fish revealed an increasing loss of species in all stream orders over time with the worst impacts in the first and second order streams 5 10 decade 1 this decline in the number of species was due to the progressive increase in the temperatures 0 61 c 0 92 c decade 1 expected in the watershed however its spatial distribution differed from one fish group to the other implying that fish responses may vary among taxonomic groups the spatial changes in the game fish species gradually decreased from the upper 10 20 to the lower 7 16 subcatchment following the watershed temperature gradient 1 0 c 3 5 c while for the total fish species the most affected streams decline up to 50 were found in the middle and central subcatchments in the highly forested areas of the watershed the differences in the range of variation between the total 50 and the game fish 20 species suggested that the non game fish species may be more prone to be affected in the future than its game counterpart the framework that we developed in this study facilitated the evaluation of the possible impacts of distinct land management alternatives on the fish species under a set of climate projections and allowed us to estimate the most probable state of their richness several decades after the implementation of changes despite the assumptions that implementing best management practices to improve the quality of stream ecosystems that can benefit biodiversity we found that the impacts of climate change can significantly undermine the effects of these practices the long term impacts on fish species richness may be inevitable if the proposed land management alternatives were not accompanied by additional measures specifically designed to protect aquatic life including the adoption of policies that reduce climate change impacts funding this work was supported by the u s department of agriculture usda national institute of food and agriculture nifa 2018 68002 27918 the authors

high impact events and biogeographical variation is imprinted in the soil profile fao 2006 the goal of the paris agreement unfccc 2015 is to keep the global temperature increase well below 2 c e g 1 5 c therefore the fate of the current c stocks in forest ecosystem over the next few decades and the fate of future carbon inputs to soils from the forest is an important agenda for stakeholders in society faced with the complex science of understanding the terrestrial carbon cycle and the soil system attention should be on modeling in the light of the uncertain future environmental changes validation of models that are simplified representations of the real world can be a misleading term depending on the available time series of soil carbon stocks and controlling mechanisms in addition evaluation of models including their sensitivity to multiple unknown and known uncertainties yanai et al 2010 can stimulate reflections about the framing of ecosystem models and provide a communication link between model developers model users and society schuwirth et al 2019 oreskes 1998 furthermore sensitivity analyses based on soil inventory pilot study parameterizations of a soil system can guide the design of full soil surveys by gauging the range of the expected changes and uncertainties of soil carbon stocks from plot to full study area and the effects of parameter uncertainty in box 1 the ecosystem ecology definition of soil carbon balance is described the environmental agenda operates under the short time horizon of the green transition and the currently changing global environment understanding the current soc stocks under forest and their immediate change potential is a different scope than the more uncertain scenario based long term forecasts of c stock changes large increases or decreases in soc at the decadal time scale would require high impact soil environment changes in soil temperature and moisture change drivers could be water table changes on organic soils and inland wetland soils and continuing effects of historical drainage ipcc et al 2006 and less so clear felling of tree stands and land use change such as afforestation or deforestation mayer et al 2020 or increased tree mortality caused by droughts fires or pests anderegg et al 2020 small annual decreases or increases in soc are more likely in stable forest stands on upland undrained soil the stability of existing soc stocks and formation of new soc stocks in the longer term will however be related with the inherent soil properties that have formed and co evolved with the forest ecosystem or other previous landuses for thousands of years it is therefore relevant to study the deciding conditions for the accumulated soc stock in soil profiles including the embodied pedological information it can guide reflections about the potential fate of the existing soc at decadal time scales and the potential changes and constraints to losses or gains of soc decadal disturbance impacts on current soil conditions can be studied by sensitivity analyses of parameters for input and decomposition in a soil carbon model 1 2 current soc stocks in forest soils the soil profile framework fresh organic matter littered by twigs or roots of trees is additions to the soil it will undergo transformations during intermediate decomposition by soil fauna and microbes and may be transported by physical and biogeochemical processes and eventually be lost from the soil profile by the same mechanisms these four soil processes are characteristic for the turnover of organic matter in soil fig 1 soc stocks under forest in the nordic baltic area vary from less than 2 to 15 kg c m 2 on well drained mineral soils e g depending on soil age and bioclimate wet gleyed mineral soils and organic soils hold on average 15 31 kg c m 2 with a wider range upwards depending on thickness of the carbon rich horizons e g peat leayers callesen et al 2003 strand et al 2016 due to the inherent variation the potential short term soc stock changes are depending on the distribution and protection of the organic c within the soil profile and disturbances affecting the major decomposers such as fungi and bacteria 1 3 soil profiles objects of pedogenesis the soil matrix as part of the ecosystem is a complex biogeochemical environment with macrofauna mesofauna mycorrhiza and a huge number of free saprotrophic fungi and bacteria fischer and binkley 2000 they inhabit voids and particle surfaces and carry out transforming functions in the carbon and nutrient cycling of the macronutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p buchkowski et al 2019 llado et al 2017 the decay of the necromass of microorganisms is not characterized by its carbon content or total chemical composition alone soil models therefore separate soc into fractions by their solubility in different chemical solvents that characterize their lability or by the biological origin being necromass of roots fungi bacteria or root exudates and enzymes han et al 2020 zoo necromass etc by size fractions or by more abstract general pool definitions campbell and paustian 2015 some models may also include the vertical distribution of soc in pedogenic soil layers and related effects on the soil environment and processes koven et al 2013 paustian and campbell 2015 soil profiles organized in different horizons capture the impacts from climate organisms relief the parent material and time in short clorpt jenny 1941 the resulting carbon metabolism and traces of historical events such as fires and wind erosion may be manifested by distinct soil horizons soil profiles are thus suitable for modeling the fate of soc stocks and changes in them for some decades ahead due to their properties as growth medium for roots adverse or beneficial the reactivity of the carbon and the distribution of fauna and microbiome is linked with the vertical organization of the profiles furthermore the stabilization of carbon caused by products of pedogenesis iron oxides and their transport is guiding the assigning of soil horizon designations buol et al 2011 mckeague 1967 here we will simulate the soc stock changes in existing forest soil profiles at the time scale of four decades with maximum user control and transparency we are not aware of any soc models see review by campbell and paustian 2015 that adopt this approach of decadal fate based on the soil profile and soil forming processes of addition loss transformation and transport the aim is to explore the short term decadal carbon stock change potential that is composed of 1 the size and the anticipated reactivity and state of stabilization of the existing soc stock and 2 the potential stock increases based on litter input changes and their vertical distribution of root litter in soil horizons the quantitative effect of uncertainties e g climate change effects on inputs and decomposition e g davidson and janssens 2006 or nutrient constraints on microbes forstner et al 2019 may be explored by sensitivity analyses of one or more parameters at the time carried out by the user in summary the main learning objective for the user is to realize that quantification of soc stocks and potential stock changes involve uncertainty around the model construction itself around estimates of measurements data parameter values as well as modeling results the simulated soc stock changes may be linked with 1 the quantity and quality of the existing soc and future inputs 2 soil properties influencing soil microbiota and nutrient availability and vice versa 3 changing c mineralization rates influenced by changing environmental conditions soil aeration soil moisture soil temperature or nutrient constraints and 4 the biogeography and landuse history at a given forest site this paper is a general description of the transparc2u model and a guide to how it may be used in teaching and learning activities e g within forest ecosystem sustainability teaching 2 the transparc2u model 2 1 transparc2u model description the two pool multilayer c simulation model follows the difference equation i a mathematical form similar to the model by kirk and bellamy 2010 using first order kinetics and an average fixed annual decay rate but limited to four decades ahead in time the basic assumption behind the transparc2u simulation model is that an equilibrium soc stock exists in each layer that is determined by the balance between the annual above and belowground litter input lsoil and the mineralization rate of annual c turnover k1 of the recently added litter kirk and bellamy 2010 the steady state c stock c exists for the newer and more active c while the old c fold is just mineralized at a very slow rate for the 40 years of the model run fig 2 there is no transfer from new to old c during the four decades other than the c that is transported from the forest floor to the mineral soil and thus going from a higher to a lower decomposition rate the corresponding steady state input is lsoil and the k1 value for each layer represents the overall decomposition rates of the new c in this 40 year time perspective ct and ct 1 are c stocks in consecutive years t the turnover rates k values in the two pool model are average c mineralization rates for that layer and corresponding soc stock this is done for each of the up to 10 soil layers c changes may thus arise from changes in average above and belowground litter input and changes in the decomposition rates in different layers units c and l kg c m 2 or t c ha 1 the latter a factor 10 both are used t is years f and k are unitless a annu al stock chan ge c t 1 c c new t c e k 1 t c old t e k 2 t t 0 to 40

podzolised spielvogel et al 2008 wiesmeier et al 2019 2 2 soc stock change as a game with the transparc2u model the model is empirical the user being the agent and it needs input parameters by user iteration followed by the immediate inspection of the effects on the soc stock using the model is a game played by the user the goal of the game is to achieve a stable soc stock for the 40 years runtime by iteratively regulating litter inputs of the forest stands turnover rates transport mechanisms and fractions of cold in each horizon equations i a j and fig 2 the next step is to study what would need to change to achieve an increasing or a decreasing soc stock e g taking available nutrients and n deposition into account a group of users can then compare how they achieved this goal and if constraints suggest that the simulation result is feasible in total gain and loss or within horizons thus the concept of using model assumptions and iterations during calibration remains transparent to the user fig 2 site and profile information to help the user in the manual calibration is given in the spreadsheet lines 2 3 fig 2 extractable fe and p in kg m 2 at 0 50 cm soil depth

starting point in the simulation is the actual measured soc stock of any given soil distributed to the o horizon and the mineral soil layers the source of new c is aboveground litter input and as fractions of the aboveground litter in kg c m 2 yr 1 belowground distribution of root litter to each layer eq 1 organic matter turnover rates k1 in each layer are chosen by the user inspired by the biogeography of the site latitude mean annual temperature and precipitation and the stand age and magnitude of the existing o horizon the tree species affecting litter quality the soil p reserve and c

material in bs bhs and bh horizons also loamy a horizons may have a sizeable fold due to clay protection of om basile doelsch et al 2020 vejre et al 2003 the user can choose freely and explore the effect on soc stocks after changing turnover rates the annual litter input is a constant in the model and not accounting for dynamics occurring during the decades of tree stand replacements clearcut until full crown cover is achieved again stand changes can be studied indirectly however a young forest stand or afforested stand may build up c in the organic layer and topsoil and the initial c stock is low or absent a young forest stand may also lose c if the initial c stock is high e g in the event that a thick forest floor of the clearfelled stand is being exposed to higher temperatures and site preparation and less needle litter input after the clear cut the fraction of cold is defined by the user and automatically deducted from the c stock in each layer cold has by default a very low turnover rate e g 0 001 yr 1 that can be varied in sensitivity analysis the output from the simulation model is the soc stock by layer and summed to the forest floor mineral soil profile for a projection period of 40 years including a graph showing the development over time for each layer figs 2 and 3 if the initial c content is lower or higher than the equilibrium c the c stock will approach but probably not reach the steady state level in year 40 therefore the approximation c cold 40 the annual c stock change will be higher if the difference between the current new pool cnew t and the equilibrium pool c is large the substrate of soil organisms is dead organic matter and their growth and related om consumption i e their nutrient requirements and carbon use efficiency affects

be sufficient to support the uptake of the 40 year n deposition these questions cannot be answered by the model but you are alerted about a possible constraint to reflect on if the soc pool is not increasing what will happen to the c n ratio of the soil 2 3 2 model output the summarized results of the chosen parameter values are presented in fig 3 the equilibrium soc stock with the transparc2u example profile lindet is 12 7 kg c m 2 the uncertainty of the measured soc stock with the bulk density based on the pedotransfer function is 1 7 kg c m 2 fig 3 assuming 15 uncertainty around the measured initial c stock estimate see sheet error budget based on rules for variances of sums and products of stochastic independent variables there is ample room for choosing different parameter sets to yield a soc stock that can change inside this standard error interval the user can explore parameter changes one by one or two by two to see changes that dampen or amplify soc changes this is a key learning objective of the model i e to understand the dynamics the long time horizon of soil development the complexity of the system with its many components uncertain parameters and interacting changes that may enforce or negate each other the range in soc stocks for the 23 profiles was 1 4 32 2 kg c m 2 see sheet site data the absolute uncertainty around the measured value is lower for a high stock than for a low stock the error budget of a high soc stock profile was 12 se users can try to manipulate the data to lower c concentrations and watch the effect on the measurement error sheet error budget a24 h30 at 5 kg c m 2 it is around 20 se equally important is the uncertainty of the bulk density for the compound error of the soc stock the different soc estimates can be compared and used for reflection on how the future could look like at this specific site see google earth satellite images and uploaded ground photos in the area following different options for intensification of the forest management being one option or restoration of more natural forest ecosystems as another option 2 4 more process background for sensitivity analysis this section will outline some literature on the soil processes i e additions transformations transport and losses of c that could inspire and motivate user choices in the sensitivity analysis 2 4 1 litter inputs by photosynthesis carbon dioxide is transformed and ultimately a fraction of c is stored in soil the variability of conditions for tree photosynthesis gpp box 1 is given by state factors such as biome and soil quality and often expressed as a site index for tree productivity fischer and binkley 2000 the annual variability in gpp may be increasing over time and more so on sites that already are constrained by a lack of soil aeration moisture or nutrients this is due to the currently changing climate with average temperatures increasing and more extreme precipitation regimes causing unusual stress on forest ecosystems anderegg et al 2020 bastos et al 2020 tree growth npp per area unit is linked with site fertility and climate since trees are able to be taller stand closer and produce more biomass and thus litter fall per area unit at sites with high water and nutrient supply and a long growing season bray and gorham 1964 the crown architecture and light utilization depends on the tree species common beech fagus sylvatica l effectively captures all light with its leaf mosaic which leads to less variation in litterfall across site indices than e g conifers bray and gorham 1964 hansen et al 2009 in an evolving ecosystem on young newly deposited soil parent material soc stocks will gradually increase over time when more n is fixed in the soil and nutrients are released from soil minerals by weathering fischer and binkley 2000 when a forest ecosystem is in steady state npp and litter production will equal each other with no net increase in woody biomass and litter mass npp will equal heterotrophic soil respiration with no net change of soil carbon in the forest ecosystem basile et al 2020 with a climate in transition this may change climate stresses on trees may lead to increased litter inputs aboveground and changed belowground inputs in the short term in the longer term a drier climate could lead to deeper root systems and thus more carbon allocation to deeper soil layers canadell et al 1996 with roots extending deeper in soil more water and with time more soil resources become available for the forest ecosystem as the new rhizosphere soil develops at depth callesen et al 2016 warmer summers and warmer fall seasons may on the other hand cause extra c mineralization i e an increase in heterotrophic soil respiration rhet changing the soc stock turnover time varney et al 2020 and thus changing the overall long term magnitude and vertical distribution of the equilibrium soc stock 2 4 2 transport and transformation by soil fauna earthworms such as lumbricus terrestris l pull leaves from the forest floor into mineral soil horizons and turn them into a mull an effect that is quantitatively important on base rich soils access to calcium is part of the metabolism of the worms the crumbles and the worm casts can be found in macropores and in the top mineral soil müller 1879 and 1884 de wandeler et al 2016 this can be observed as a very fast turnover rate of the litter in the forest floor less than one year for some forest sites müller 1879 vesterdal et al 2008 such observed high turnover rates are not only caused by decomposition and respiration of litter in the organic layer but also by downward transportation of foliar litter to the mineral soil wild boar moles and rodents such as voles can act in a similar way trampling or mixing the forest floor with the top mineral soil when such soils have a ph higher than 4 5 and are well drained the soil may be a suitable habitat for anecic earthworms with a major influence on humification of litter and transport indicated by worm casts on the soil surface lee 1985 the vertical migration of earthworms seeking frost free soil in deep soil layers during winter frost events can translocate om in macropores to more than 1 m depth provided that the soil is not water saturated to the extent that oxygen depletion occurs singh et al 2020 on calcareous soil with a neutral ph 30 of the litter input was subject to soil fauna mediated transfer to the mineral soil while only 4 5 was transferred to the top mineral soil as doc kammer et al 2012 the active transport of litter by earthworms and actions of mammals are thus a mechanism of quantitative importance aiding the formation of deep dark well mixed and humus enriched a horizons ants are transporting needles to ant mounds in the boreal forest causing local accumulation of forest floor material the quantitative effect is not significant for the carbon balance but causes substantial redistribution of c and nutrients risch et al 2005 the distinct morlayers formed in coniferous forest are not impacted by ants 2 4 3 lateral transport of litter a uniform distribution of litterfall to the forest floor is assumed in the model but wind turbulence and uneven distribution of the canopy trees can produce spatially uneven inputs of aboveground litter and root litter furthermore wind turbulence can redistribute litter to accumulate near stems and other objects that affect the lateral air stream staelens et al 2011 water erosion can contribute to lateral redistribution of aboveground litter and fine earth causing uneven inputs to soil such effects contribute to the uncertainty of aboveground inputs table 1 the quantitative impact of litter input uncertainty can be tested by the user by changing the aboveground litter input 2 4 4 transport by the podzolisation process the vertical rate of doc transport from o horizons to b horizons has been investigated in podzols at sites with high surplus precipitation and a sandy soil texture doc fluxes within the soil profile increase with mean annual precipitation michalzik et al 2001 and with soc stock of the topsoil gielen et al 2011 doc percolation is higher in coniferous than in broadleaved forests fröberg et al 2011 flux rates of doc from the o horizon in coniferous temperate forest were measured to 6 9 g c m 2 yr 1 and of this a flux of 0 9 2 8 g c m 2 yr 1 percolated into the b horizon fujii et al 2011 around 30 evans et al 2020 a mature spruce stand kaiser kalbitz 2012 kalbitz kaiser 2008 showed that 2 5 5 kg c m 2 19 50 of soc originated from sorbed and stabilized doc in the b horizon of the soil profile this is not a purely vertical transport lateral transport is very likely especially in sloping terrain since the water follows the easiest path and gravitational forces this represents import that is not included in the model the transport and precipitation of doc depending on the landscape relief may e g have caused high accumulation in the nedstrand profile hensgens et al 2020 examined the contributions from ground flora and found that vaccinium myrtillus litter in particular contributed to doc with amounts corresponding to 4 5 of the aboveground litter fall based on these numbers the accumulation of a spodic horizon holding e g 4 7 kg c m 2 in denmark vejre et al 2003 hypothetically would require an average annual net vertical transport of 2 4 g m 2 doc arriving in the b horizon for 2000 years and assuming very slow or no mineralization after stabilization with iron in the form of more or less crystalline oxides this indicates that the spodic material is very old and that the decomposition rates are extremely low the turnover rate of undisturbed spodic material in the model thus needs to be very low e g 0 001 yr 1 such studies can guide the choice of the fraction of old carbon fold based on pedological characteristics of the soil profile e g a high annual precipitation and large pool of extractable fe range 0 2 to 3 4 kg c m 2 for 23 soil profiles shown in the input sheet and high c concentrations in the b horizon up to 7 c e g site nedstrand and site ulborg with annual inputs of 0 3 kg c m 2 to the forest floor from leaf needle and root litter the accumulation over 40 years would be 0 6 kg c m 2 in the b horizon this is a high accumulation estimate for a short time period but it represents stabilized carbon rich soil that has been accumulated over long time spans with an unknown upper limit perhaps it will be less stable when fe as weathering product becomes obsolete i e saturated with doc or experiences reductive dissolution and lateral transport in anaerobic water saturated soil environment patzner et al 2020 it is of high importance to the simulated soc stock change in the input sheet fig 2 that spodic material in bh and bhs horizons is to a large degree cold with a low mineralization rate in the model no doc is lost during the transport to the subsoil horizon line 9 but will eventually mineralize at a much slower rate in the b horizon the data for the 23 nordic and baltic forest soils are described in the paper by callesen et al 2019 and the release data for fe and p by dilute 0 1 m nitric acid originate from that study the range in soc stocks is 1 4 32 2 kg c m 2 in fe release is 0 2 to 3 4 kg c m 2 and the p release pool is 20 3937 kg ha 1 for the soil depth 0 50 cm in 23 profiles indicating a very variable stabilization potential for soc in the dataset used in the transparc2u model sheet fe and c concentrations in e b and c horizons are correlated with each other and with the nutrients p k ca and mg release by 0 1 m dilute nitric acid showing why humus c is important for soil quality this range indicates the highly variable age and mineralogy of the soil parent materials and different stages of pedological development concurrent high fe and p release capability can indicate c stabilization and not necessarily bioavailability of p for growth 2 5 external input values for parameters in the application of the model more background 2 5 1 soil horizons skeletal content and bulk density the soil profile is loaded by the user after which the soil horizons and their magnitudes appear initial soc stocks are automatically calculated in the spreadsheet from the input of the carbon concentrations horizon thickness skeletal content of gravel and stones and bulk density in forest floor and mineral soil layers eq 1 the model calculates bulk densities bd of mineral soil layers from a pedotransfer ptf function based on carbon content and master soil horizons equation i i vejre et al 2003 callesen et al 2015 the model user can change the ptf and bd s according to own preferences in the sheet calculation column d the bulk density is assumed constant over time despite of simulated soc changes we used a square root function in which bulk density decreases with increasing c concentration in a non linear manner this means that carbon concentration changes will still result in carbon stock changes in the simulation 2 5 2 aboveground litter input in this application the aboveground litter input of leaves needles was based on a model by berg 1999 based on degree of latitude eq i d and table 1 it was backed up by measurements of litterfall values reported from danish icp forest monitoring sites and from icp forest international co operative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests level ii sites neumann et al 2018 and the delilah database by berg et al 1999 and berg and meentemeyer 2011 in three danish tree species trial plots in a ca 30 year old stands of coniferous and broadleaved tree species the measured mean aboveground annual inputs of c ranged from 0 13 to 0 17 kg m 2 yr 1 and total aboveground dry matter inputs ranged from 3 to 4 t ha 1 hansen et al 2009 in a similar 30 year old tree species trial even aged broadleaf stands had foliar litter inputs of 0 10 to 0 19 kg c m 2 yr 1 vesterdal et al 2008 the range of aboveground litter inputs predicted by latitude for 23 sites by using berg et al 1999 was 0 07 0 19 kg c m 2 yr 1 table 1 users can thus choose values from this range but since transfer functions may overestimate low values and underestimate higher values also higher or lower values can be chosen according to the study questions 2 5 3 root litter input root exudates and microbial decay the root litter input and root exudates to rhizosphere soil lblg were distributed vertically according to a discrete root litter distribution function entered as percentage values of the aboveground input eq i conifers can have large shares of their roots in o horizons for direct mycorrhiza mediated nutrient cycling shallow root systems can be a tree species specific trait or can be caused by root restricting layers e g dense cemented layers or a high water table in the growing season root counts on soil profile walls were made in three tree species at icp forest monitoring sites hansen 2003 effective root depth including more than 95 of visible roots was 60 90 cm depending on site and tree species but can be much deeper in dry climates if there are no impediments to root growth in deeper soil layers callesen et al 2016 the root litter input distribution is by default assumed to be 100 of aboveground litter input but can be smaller or larger than 100 as entered by the user fine root production is estimated to 0 15 kg c m 2 yr 1 and the turnover rate is often 0 7 to 1 3 yr 1 kriiska et al 2019 yuan and chen 2010 in the same range as aboveground input solly et al 2018 examined different methods and found turnover rates of 0 5 1 4 yr 1 for fine roots in boreal forest high discrepancies in age determinations of fine roots indicated that a smaller fraction of the roots is much older maybe around 10 years this means that our suggested turnover rates for litter input to mineral soil of 0 01 0 1 yr 1 for cnew include carbon that is more recalcitrant than the labile parts of fine root litter observed turnover rates fitted by automated iteration on repeated measures in the topsoil steady state one pool model developed for the united

analysis sensitivity analyses can be carried out by the user to address the questions in box 2 the idea of iterative changes and observation of instant effects on soc should give the user a feeling of

decay function 4 discussion 4 1 why is the game of getting stable c stock over 40 years relevant the aim of the paper was to communicate a generic simulation tool for forest soil organic carbon stock changes with example data from forest sites in the nordic baltic area and to introduce gamification the idea is to stimulate the understanding of why we use models what the limitations are when using models and to encourage a transparent approach to interpretation of model results herman et al 2019 oreskes 2003 yildirim 2017 the user with his or her knowledge and interactions is a part of the model fig 1 this should motivate student learning through getting hands on immediately in an intuitive way the exploration of important influences on soc storage the input the initial c stock and turnover rates can serve as reflections on soc change measurements or a comparison with results from other more complex model results emphasis was on the organization and boundaries of the model system the soil profile on c pools and processes and on assumptions made for inputs and litter distributions the vertical redistribution of soc between layers and decomposition rates is an important mechanism to communicate by using the soil profile as a frame and introducing soil forming processes of addition losses translocation and transformation of organic matter soil formation based on soil processes involving organic c comes alive assumptions included aboveground litter input root litter distribution linked to aboveground litter input the definition of a fixed fraction of old more stable and less active c of the total initial soc stock and the corresponding decomposition rates of new and old c 4 2 what parameter sets are correct the cases chosen represent everything from arenosols in dry and cold climate with limited soc accumulation and soil development to a humic podzol in cool and wet climate callesen et al 2019 statistical fitting of so many parameters and soil layers would require a large number of observation sites and well designed process studies of the various processes across many ecotones such data are not easy to bring about the important message is that in a 40 year time frame finding the correct parameter set is not so important since the model is an abstraction of something more complex most changes are slow and measurements are also uncertain the recognition of root nutrient and climatic constraints on soc stock changes are learning objectives for the user and should lead to reflections on soc changes and causes of soc stock change the model is limited by assumptions about constant litter input and root distribution in a 40 year time frame it cannot capture age dynamics of the tree stands caused by thinning defoliation changing light environment and nutrient redistributions between the soil and the tree stand understory vegetation may partly compensate for the lack of litter inputs in open young stands the model can address biogeographic site differences and soil quality differences affecting the current and future distribution of soc within the soil profile by changing litter input and decomposition rates for example when changing from an agricultural site to a forest the user can watch an o horizon build up depending on the turnover rate chosen of the new tree litter deposited on the soil surface and on the belowground root distribution as the aim was a pedagogical illustration of some of the complexity involved in the soil c cycling in forest stands the approach was user iteration trial and error and letting the user interpret soil site and pedology information i e soil horizon designations and summarized climate data the purpose was to test the sensitivity of the assumptions and not to make any correct model or model parameterization but to find out what parameterization would make the initial soc stock stable this to see if the current vegetation and its effect on soil c is matching the prevailing measured soc stocks next step would be the adjustment of parameters to reflect the absorption of the n deposition taking also possible p or moisture constraints into account to realize the fertilizing effect of n it could be done by studying the effect on soc stocks when changing important parameters such as litter input rate and c n ratio of litter if data on soc stock change measurements at two points in time are available they can be used for comparison with the simulated changes and also for guiding the parameterization for comparison with data from repeatedly measured sites it is an advantage if the within site variation is controlled by composite sampling with an adequate number of subsamples to get lower variance on the measurement this should be considered in sampling design the user gains experience with what magnitudes of soc stock change rates to expect in response to changes in aboveground litter and root litter input as well as in organic matter turnover rates k values particularly belowground inputs and heterotrophic soil respiration are very difficult to quantify and thus leading to inverse approaches and use of models for quantification of soc stocks varney 2020 here a model can be helpful and the model presents an estimate of heterotrophic respiration for evaluation e g at contrasting sites or model parameterizations within the same site future soc losses due to increased turnover rates will be speculative in the longer term not least due to the expected and ongoing climate changes affecting the length of the growing and c mineralization in fall as well as water saturation caused by fluctuating water tables this topic is at present a very active area of research smith et al 2020 soc losses and c pool changes may happen in the case of decreased water tables in organic soils the change from anaerobic to aerobic conditions can speed up decomposition of accumulated som in organic soil and subsidence of the soil surface and cause losses of 0 0 26 kg c m 2 yr 1 in boreal and temperate forest ipcc 2006 2014 improved aeration and net release of nutrients in the mineralizing om can also lead to increased litter inputs due to higher tree growth 4 3 structural uncertainty structural uncertainty involves the model construction itself the functioning of the microbial community is only indirectly present through the choice of turnover rates guided by the soil classification the need for long term resampling datasets for calibration of decomposition rates is obvious the total number of variables that can be changed and processes that can be involved also indicate that no unique set of values or that no unique model exists even if changes are constrained by physico chemical soil properties the user may realize from their own simulation experiences that different sets of variables may yield the same total soc stock possibly redistributed within horizons even small uncertainties in parameters e g aboveground litter input or organic matter turnover rates may cause large changes in predictions of c stock even at the 40 year timescale used this is the background for experimental research attempts to determine the stability of soil c to environmental and climatic changes that can be further explored in models other models than transparc2u are more suited for estimating effects of forest management on c stocks of short to medium term changes in organic matter inputs following e g intensification of harvest schemes or final felling and replanting changes in mass and functionality of fungal and bacterial c pools can t be simulated in the transparc2u more advanced but less user friendly models may be more suitable e g the susi model for organic soils lauren et al 2021 or other vertically resolved models such as icbm andrén and kätterer 1997 transparc2u does however account for different soc pools by using the soil profile and soil horizon organization for the separation of different c pools binding mechanisms and conditions for c release it is assumed that subsoil carbon is more stable without any assumptions on the chemistry or processes involved 4 4 upscaling to national forest area upscaling a c stock change from 1 m2 or 1 ha to e g national scale may give the user some perspectives take a glance at the national forest areas denmark 6 28 105 ha norway 1 22 107 ha sweden 2 80 107 ha finland 2 24 107 ha estonia 2 44 106 ha latvia 3 41 106 ha fao 2020 this means that a 1 t c ha 1 increase or loss in forest soc stock will represent numerically similar soc stock change at the national scale in tonnes c e g 0 6 mt for denmark and 28 mt for sweden such magnitudes are significant in the national ghg budgets even on a decadal time scale quantification of soc stocks and soc stock changes as accurate and precise as possible is important 4 5 climate dependency not built into the model how to assess it then the transparc2u model assumes no explicit climate dependency of the input variables one exception is the podzolisation process that requires a precipitation surplus to promote the doc leaching process and indicated by the presence of bh and bhs horizons in the soil profile since there was no aim to model possible uncertain climate effects on the 40 year soc balances climate impacts can be indirectly investigated by the user through any anticipated influences on observed litter inputs root litter input distribution pattern and higher lower turnover rates no such direct links or assumptions have been made but sensitivity analyses can quantify what magnitude such effects might have by changing the input values and observing the effects on soc stocks and soc stock changes 5 conclusion the transparc2u model represents a simulation tool for interpretation of static soil data with respect to soc stock changes the element and water cycles of the forest ecosystem are highly complex and only few pools of carbon have been quantified by measurements for that reason the model was kept very simple to fit the aim of the study to demonstrate the dynamic nature of soc stocks for communication and teaching purposes the gaming approach save the carbon can help to demonstrate and improve the understanding of the soil formation in forest soils with its impacts on vertical soc distribution it was demonstrated how litter inputs root litter distribution vertical translocation and transformation processes as well as decomposition rates interact to influence the overall soc stock balance even small input or turnover rate changes can cause large soc stock changes especially in carbon rich soils and especially in the longer term future turnover rates are uncertain however the sensitivities of major components of the soc balance can be studied which can guide future measurement activities in designing surveys that are functional in detecting expected effect sizes users of the transparc2u model can reflect on the sensitivities of these components of the forest soil carbon balance in an interactive manner funding funding was obtained from the danish innovation fund and facce eragas project invent 2017 2020 i reference 7108

24609,the dynamic character of forest soil organic carbon soc stocks is demonstrated in the simulation model transparc2u the model has up to 10 layers each with two pools with first order kinetics running for 40 years the model is aimed at teaching soil science to a broad audience in academia extension services secondary schools and public life the learning objective of the model is to bring about an understanding of soc dynamics over time uncertainty and the complexity of the soil profile with its pedogenesis represented by soil horizons the user works in an illustrated spreadsheet calculator with options for instant and interactive exploration of the multiple uncertainties and constraints on forest soc stocks the user divides the initial soc stock in each horizon into two pools cnew with faster mineralization and cold with very slow mineralization based on their knowledge of horizon designations and stabilization mechanisms data from 23 soil nordic and baltic forest soil profiles with horizons characterized by chemical and physical properties are available site information to the user intended for reflections on choosing parameter values includes soil classification tree species climate stand age soil nutrient status and properties that govern physical or chemical protection of soil c extractable phosphorus p total nitrogen n subsoil clay content and extractable iron fe other changeable inputs are the average annual aboveground litter fall root litter allocation to individual soil horizons as a fraction of aboveground input and decomposition rates of each pool the game played aims for preservation of the initial c stock by manual calibration by the user the sensitivity of the potential c change dc is tested by changing the parameter values and watching the effects on model results i e c stocks in each horizon over time the sensitivity analysis can involve the uncertainty of the input the initial c content in each horizon the fraction of cold and the turnover rates that represent heterotrophic respiration the processes representing c input to deeper horizons roots and exudates bioturbation by macrofauna as well as podzolisation provide optional transfer of c between the forest floor and mineral soil layers when judged appropriate by the user based on the site and stand information the user may interpret results of the simulation by examining the outputs of total c stock change over 40 years by inspecting total n and p requirements for new litter inputs against potentially available current and future n and p stocks in the soil and the capacity of c binding by subsoil clay and fe oxides it highlights the physical and chemical soil properties required to justify the simulated fate of new and old soc and the sensitivity of controlling parameters on a decadal timescale to the user keywords sustainability teaching gamification uncertainty soil carbon stock change pedology user reflection 1 background 1 1 soil carbon stock change in forest a time perspective soil organic carbon soc is a large dynamic pool included in the kyoto reporting of greenhouse gas exchange to the unfccc under the agriculture forestry and other landuse afolu sector ipcc 2006 estimation of soc stocks and soc stock changes are a complex task both to measure and to model it often includes the use of dynamic models with a sophisticated or more simplified abstract representation of the numerous processes involved smith et al 2020 in a soil pit on the other hand some information may be retrieved from the archive represented as a vertical 2d representation of soil horizons fig 1 the time perspective of past current and future soil development resulting from biogeochemical soil processes the historical and current forest management single high impact events and biogeographical variation is imprinted in the soil profile fao 2006 the goal of the paris agreement unfccc 2015 is to keep the global temperature increase well below 2 c e g 1 5 c therefore the fate of the current c stocks in forest ecosystem over the next few decades and the fate of future carbon inputs to soils from the forest is an important agenda for stakeholders in society faced with the complex science of understanding the terrestrial carbon cycle and the soil system attention should be on modeling in the light of the uncertain future environmental changes validation of models that are simplified representations of the real world can be a misleading term depending on the available time series of soil carbon stocks and controlling mechanisms in addition evaluation of models including their sensitivity to multiple unknown and known uncertainties yanai et al 2010 can stimulate reflections about the framing of ecosystem models and provide a communication link between model developers model users and society schuwirth et al 2019 oreskes 1998 furthermore sensitivity analyses based on soil inventory pilot study parameterizations of a soil system can guide the design of full soil surveys by gauging the range of the expected changes and uncertainties of soil carbon stocks from plot to full study area and the effects of parameter uncertainty in box 1 the ecosystem ecology definition of soil carbon balance is described the environmental agenda operates under the short time horizon of the green transition and the currently changing global environment understanding the current soc stocks under forest and their immediate change potential is a different scope than the more uncertain scenario based long term forecasts of c stock changes large increases or decreases in soc at the decadal time scale would require high impact soil environment changes in soil temperature and moisture change drivers could be water table changes on organic soils and inland wetland soils and continuing effects of historical drainage ipcc et al 2006 and less so clear felling of tree stands and land use change such as afforestation or deforestation mayer et al 2020 or increased tree mortality caused by droughts fires or pests anderegg et al 2020 small annual decreases or increases in soc are more likely in stable forest stands on upland undrained soil the stability of existing soc stocks and formation of new soc stocks in the longer term will however be related with the inherent soil properties that have formed and co evolved with the forest ecosystem or other previous landuses for thousands of years it is therefore relevant to study the deciding conditions for the accumulated soc stock in soil profiles including the embodied pedological information it can guide reflections about the potential fate of the existing soc at decadal time scales and the potential changes and constraints to losses or gains of soc decadal disturbance impacts on current soil conditions can be studied by sensitivity analyses of parameters for input and decomposition in a soil carbon model 1 2 current soc stocks in forest soils the soil profile framework fresh organic matter littered by twigs or roots of trees is additions to the soil it will undergo transformations during intermediate decomposition by soil fauna and microbes and may be transported by physical and biogeochemical processes and eventually be lost from the soil profile by the same mechanisms these four soil processes are characteristic for the turnover of organic matter in soil fig 1 soc stocks under forest in the nordic baltic area vary from less than 2 to 15 kg c m 2 on well drained mineral soils e g depending on soil age and bioclimate wet gleyed mineral soils and organic soils hold on average 15 31 kg c m 2 with a wider range upwards depending on thickness of the carbon rich horizons e g peat leayers callesen et al 2003 strand et al 2016 due to the inherent variation the potential short term soc stock changes are depending on the distribution and protection of the organic c within the soil profile and disturbances affecting the major decomposers such as fungi and bacteria 1 3 soil profiles objects of pedogenesis the soil matrix as part of the ecosystem is a complex biogeochemical environment with macrofauna mesofauna mycorrhiza and a huge number of free saprotrophic fungi and bacteria fischer and binkley 2000 they inhabit voids and particle surfaces and carry out transforming functions in the carbon and nutrient cycling of the macronutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p buchkowski et al 2019 llado et al 2017 the decay of the necromass of microorganisms is not characterized by its carbon content or total chemical composition alone soil models therefore separate soc into fractions by their solubility in different chemical solvents that characterize their lability or by the biological origin being necromass of roots fungi bacteria or root exudates and enzymes han et al 2020 zoo necromass etc by size fractions or by more abstract general pool definitions campbell and paustian 2015 some models may also include the vertical distribution of soc in pedogenic soil layers and related effects on the soil environment and processes koven et al 2013 paustian and campbell 2015 soil profiles organized in different horizons capture the impacts from climate organisms relief the parent material and time in short clorpt jenny 1941 the resulting carbon metabolism and traces of historical events such as fires and wind erosion may be manifested by distinct soil horizons soil profiles are thus suitable for modeling the fate of soc stocks and changes in them for some decades ahead due to their properties as growth medium for roots adverse or beneficial the reactivity of the carbon and the distribution of fauna and microbiome is linked with the vertical organization of the profiles furthermore the stabilization of carbon caused by products of pedogenesis iron oxides and their transport is guiding the assigning of soil horizon designations buol et al 2011 mckeague 1967 here we will simulate the soc stock changes in existing forest soil profiles at the time scale of four decades with maximum user control and transparency we are not aware of any soc models see review by campbell and paustian 2015 that adopt this approach of decadal fate based on the soil profile and soil forming processes of addition loss transformation and transport the aim is to explore the short term decadal carbon stock change potential that is composed of 1 the size and the anticipated reactivity and state of stabilization of the existing soc stock and 2 the potential stock increases based on litter input changes and their vertical distribution of root litter in soil horizons the quantitative effect of uncertainties e g climate change effects on inputs and decomposition e g davidson and janssens 2006 or nutrient constraints on microbes forstner et al 2019 may be explored by sensitivity analyses of one or more parameters at the time carried out by the user in summary the main learning objective for the user is to realize that quantification of soc stocks and potential stock changes involve uncertainty around the model construction itself around estimates of measurements data parameter values as well as modeling results the simulated soc stock changes may be linked with 1 the quantity and quality of the existing soc and future inputs 2 soil properties influencing soil microbiota and nutrient availability and vice versa 3 changing c mineralization rates influenced by changing environmental conditions soil aeration soil moisture soil temperature or nutrient

activities e g within forest ecosystem sustainability teaching 2 the transparc2u model 2 1 transparc2u model description the two pool multilayer c simulation model follows the difference equation i a mathematical form similar to the model by kirk and bellamy 2010 using first order kinetics and an average fixed annual decay rate but limited to four decades ahead in time the basic assumption behind the transparc2u simulation model is that an equilibrium soc stock exists in each layer that is determined by the balance between the annual above and belowground litter input lsoil and the mineralization rate of annual c turnover k1 of the recently added litter kirk and bellamy 2010 the steady state c stock c exists for the newer and more active c while the old c fold is just mineralized at a very slow rate for the 40 years of the model run fig 2 there is no transfer from new to old c during the four decades other than the c that is transported from the forest floor to the mineral soil and thus going from a higher to a lower decomposition rate the corresponding steady state input is lsoil and the k1 value for each layer represents the overall decomposition rates of the new c in this 40 year time perspective ct and ct 1 are c stocks in consecutive years t the turnover rates k values in the two pool model are average c mineralization rates for that layer and corresponding soc stock this is done for each of the up to 10 soil layers c changes may thus arise from changes in average above and belowground litter input and changes in the decomposition rates in

podzolised spielvogel et al 2008 wiesmeier et al 2019 2 2 soc stock change as a game with the transparc2u model the model is empirical the user being the agent and it needs input parameters by user iteration followed by the immediate inspection of the effects on the soc stock using the model is a game played by the user the goal of the game is to achieve a stable soc stock for the 40 years runtime by iteratively regulating litter inputs of the forest stands turnover rates transport mechanisms and fractions of cold in each horizon equations i a j and fig 2 the next step is to study what would need to change to achieve an increasing or a decreasing soc stock e g taking available nutrients and n deposition into account a group of users can then compare how they achieved this goal and if constraints suggest that the simulation result is feasible in total gain and loss or within horizons thus the concept of using model assumptions and iterations during calibration remains transparent to the user fig 2 site and profile information to help the user in the manual calibration is given in the spreadsheet lines 2 3 fig 2 extractable fe and p in kg m 2 at 0 50 cm soil depth

effect on soc stocks after changing turnover rates the annual litter input is a constant in the model and not accounting for dynamics occurring during the decades of tree stand replacements clearcut until full crown cover is achieved again stand changes can be studied indirectly however a young forest stand or afforested stand may build up c in the organic layer and topsoil and the initial c stock is low or absent a young forest stand may also lose c if the initial c stock is high e g in the event that a thick forest floor of the clearfelled stand is being exposed to higher temperatures and site preparation and less needle litter input after the clear cut the fraction of cold is defined by the user and automatically deducted from the c stock in each layer cold has by default a very low turnover rate e g 0 001 yr 1 that can be varied in sensitivity analysis the output from the simulation model is the soc stock by layer and summed to the forest floor mineral soil profile for a projection period of 40 years including a graph showing the development over time for each layer figs 2 and 3 if the initial c content is lower or higher than the equilibrium c the c stock will approach but probably not reach the steady state level in year 40 therefore the approximation c cold 40 the annual c stock change will be higher if the difference between the current new pool cnew t

measured initial c stock estimate see sheet error budget based on rules for variances of sums and products of stochastic independent variables there is ample room for choosing different parameter sets to yield a soc stock that can change inside this standard error interval the user can explore parameter changes one by one or two by two to see changes that dampen or amplify soc changes this is a key learning objective of the model i e to understand the dynamics the long time horizon of soil development the complexity of the system with its many components uncertain parameters and interacting changes that may enforce or negate each other the range in soc stocks for the 23 profiles was 1 4 32 2 kg c m 2 see sheet site data the absolute uncertainty around the measured value is lower for a high stock than for a low stock the error budget of a high soc stock profile was 12 se users can try to manipulate the data to lower c concentrations and watch the effect on the measurement error sheet error budget a24 h30 at 5 kg c m 2 it is around 20 se equally important is the uncertainty of the bulk density for the compound error of the soc stock the different soc estimates can be compared and used for reflection on how the future could look like at this specific site see google earth satellite images and uploaded ground photos in the area following different options for intensification of the forest management being one option or restoration of more natural forest ecosystems as another option 2 4 more process background for sensitivity analysis this section will outline some literature on the soil processes i e additions transformations transport and losses of c that could inspire and motivate user choices in the sensitivity analysis 2 4 1 litter inputs by photosynthesis carbon dioxide is transformed and ultimately a fraction of c is stored in soil the variability of conditions for tree photosynthesis gpp box 1 is given by state factors such as biome and soil quality and often expressed as a site index for tree productivity fischer and binkley 2000 the annual variability in gpp may be increasing over time and more so on sites that already are constrained by a lack of soil aeration moisture or nutrients this is due to the currently changing climate with average temperatures increasing and more extreme precipitation regimes causing unusual stress on forest ecosystems anderegg et al 2020 bastos et al 2020 tree growth npp per area unit is linked with site fertility and climate since trees are able to be taller stand closer and produce more biomass and thus litter fall per area unit at sites with high water and nutrient supply and a long growing season bray and gorham 1964 the crown architecture and light utilization depends on the tree species common beech fagus sylvatica l effectively captures all light with its leaf mosaic which leads to less variation in litterfall across site indices than e g conifers bray and gorham 1964 hansen et al 2009 in an evolving ecosystem on young newly deposited soil parent material soc stocks will gradually increase over time when more n is fixed in the soil and nutrients are released from soil minerals by weathering fischer and binkley 2000 when a forest ecosystem is in steady state npp and litter production will equal each other with no net increase in woody biomass and litter mass npp will equal heterotrophic soil respiration with no net change of soil carbon in the forest ecosystem basile et al 2020 with a climate in transition this may change climate stresses on trees may lead to increased litter inputs aboveground and changed belowground inputs in the short term in the longer term a drier climate could lead to deeper root systems and thus more carbon allocation to deeper soil layers canadell et al 1996 with roots extending deeper in soil more water and with time more soil resources become available for the forest ecosystem as the new rhizosphere soil develops at depth callesen et al 2016 warmer summers and warmer fall seasons may on the other hand cause extra c mineralization i e an increase in heterotrophic soil respiration rhet changing the soc stock turnover time varney et al 2020 and thus changing the overall long term magnitude and vertical distribution of the equilibrium soc stock 2 4 2 transport and transformation by soil fauna earthworms such as lumbricus terrestris l pull leaves from the forest floor into mineral soil horizons and turn them into a mull an effect that is quantitatively important on base rich soils access to calcium is part of the metabolism of the worms the crumbles and the worm casts can be found in macropores and in the top mineral soil müller 1879 and 1884 de wandeler et al 2016 this can be observed as a very fast turnover rate of the litter in the forest floor less than one year for some forest sites müller 1879 vesterdal et al 2008 such observed high turnover rates are not only caused by decomposition and respiration of litter in the organic layer but also by downward transportation of foliar litter to the mineral soil wild boar moles and rodents such as voles can act in a similar way trampling or mixing the forest floor with the top mineral soil when such soils have a ph higher than 4 5 and are well drained the soil may be a suitable habitat for anecic earthworms with a major influence on humification of litter and transport indicated by worm casts on the soil surface lee 1985 the vertical migration of earthworms seeking frost free soil in deep soil layers during winter frost events can translocate om in macropores to more than 1 m depth provided that the soil is not water saturated to the extent that oxygen depletion occurs singh et al 2020 on calcareous soil with a neutral ph 30 of the litter input was subject to soil fauna mediated transfer to the mineral soil while only 4 5 was transferred to the top mineral soil as doc kammer et al 2012 the active transport of litter by earthworms and actions of mammals are thus a mechanism of quantitative importance aiding the formation of deep dark well mixed and humus enriched a horizons ants are transporting needles to ant mounds in the boreal forest causing local accumulation of forest floor material the quantitative effect is not significant for the carbon balance but causes substantial redistribution of c and nutrients risch et al 2005 the distinct morlayers formed in coniferous forest are not impacted by ants 2 4 3 lateral transport of litter a uniform distribution of litterfall to the forest floor is assumed in the model but wind turbulence and uneven distribution of the canopy trees can produce spatially uneven inputs of aboveground litter and root litter furthermore wind turbulence can redistribute litter to accumulate near stems and other objects that affect the lateral air stream staelens et al 2011 water erosion can contribute to lateral redistribution of aboveground litter and fine earth causing uneven inputs to soil such effects contribute to the uncertainty of aboveground inputs table 1 the quantitative impact of litter input uncertainty can be tested by the user by changing the aboveground litter input 2 4 4 transport by the podzolisation process the vertical rate of doc transport from o horizons to b horizons has been investigated in podzols at sites with high surplus precipitation and a sandy soil texture doc fluxes within the soil profile increase with mean annual precipitation michalzik et al 2001 and with soc stock of the topsoil gielen et al 2011 doc percolation is higher in coniferous than in broadleaved forests fröberg et al 2011 flux rates of doc from the o horizon in coniferous temperate forest were measured to 6 9 g c m 2 yr 1 and of this a flux of 0 9 2 8 g c m 2 yr 1 percolated into the b horizon fujii et al 2011 around 30 evans et al 2020 a mature spruce stand kaiser kalbitz 2012 kalbitz kaiser 2008 showed that 2 5 5 kg c m 2 19 50 of soc originated from sorbed and stabilized doc in the b horizon of the soil profile this is not a purely vertical transport lateral transport is very likely especially in sloping terrain since the water follows the easiest path and gravitational forces this represents import that is not included in the model the transport and precipitation of doc depending on the landscape relief may e g have caused high accumulation in the nedstrand profile hensgens et al 2020 examined the contributions from ground flora and found that vaccinium myrtillus litter in particular contributed to doc with amounts corresponding to 4 5 of the aboveground litter fall based on these numbers the accumulation of a spodic horizon holding e g 4 7 kg c m 2 in denmark vejre et al 2003 hypothetically would require an average annual net vertical transport of 2 4 g m 2 doc arriving in the b horizon for 2000 years and assuming very slow or no mineralization after stabilization with iron in the form of more or less crystalline oxides this indicates that the spodic material is very old and that the decomposition rates are extremely low the turnover rate of undisturbed spodic material in the model thus needs to be very low e g 0 001 yr 1 such studies can guide the choice of the fraction of old carbon fold based on pedological characteristics of the soil profile e g a high annual precipitation and large pool of extractable fe range 0 2 to 3 4 kg c m 2 for 23 soil profiles shown in the input sheet and high c concentrations in the b horizon up to 7 c e g site nedstrand and site ulborg with annual inputs of 0 3 kg c m 2 to the forest floor from leaf needle and root litter the accumulation over 40 years would be 0 6 kg c m 2 in the b horizon this is a high accumulation estimate for a short time period but it represents stabilized carbon rich soil that has been accumulated over long time spans with an unknown upper limit perhaps it will be less stable when fe as weathering product becomes obsolete i e saturated with doc or experiences reductive dissolution and lateral transport in anaerobic water saturated soil environment patzner et al 2020 it is of high importance to the simulated soc stock change in the input sheet fig 2 that spodic material in bh and bhs horizons is to a large degree cold with a low mineralization rate in the model no doc is lost during the transport to the subsoil horizon line 9 but will eventually mineralize at a much slower rate in the b horizon the data for the 23 nordic and baltic forest soils are described in the paper by callesen et al 2019 and the release data for fe and p by dilute 0 1 m nitric acid originate from that study the range in soc stocks is 1 4 32 2 kg c m 2 in fe release is 0 2 to 3 4 kg c m 2 and the p release pool is 20 3937 kg ha 1 for the soil depth 0 50 cm in 23 profiles indicating a very variable stabilization potential for soc in the dataset used in the transparc2u model sheet fe and c concentrations in e b and c horizons are correlated with each other and with the nutrients p k ca and mg release by 0 1 m dilute nitric acid showing why humus c is important for soil quality this range indicates the highly variable age and mineralogy of the soil parent materials and different stages of pedological development concurrent high fe and p release capability can indicate c stabilization and not necessarily bioavailability of p for growth 2 5 external input values for parameters in the application of the model more background 2 5 1 soil horizons skeletal content and bulk density the soil profile is loaded by the user after which the soil horizons and their magnitudes appear initial soc stocks are automatically calculated in the spreadsheet from the input of the carbon concentrations horizon thickness skeletal content of gravel and stones and bulk density in forest floor and mineral soil layers eq 1 the model calculates bulk densities bd of mineral soil layers from a pedotransfer ptf function based on carbon content and master soil horizons equation i i vejre et al 2003 callesen et al 2015 the model user can change the ptf and bd s according to own preferences in the sheet calculation column d the bulk density is assumed constant over time despite of simulated soc changes we used a square root function in which bulk density decreases with increasing c concentration in a non linear manner this means that carbon concentration changes will still result in carbon stock changes in the simulation 2 5 2 aboveground litter input in this application the aboveground litter input of leaves needles was based on a model by berg 1999 based on degree of latitude eq i d and table 1 it was backed up by measurements of litterfall values reported from danish icp forest monitoring sites and from icp forest international co operative programme on assessment and monitoring of air pollution effects on forests level ii sites neumann et al 2018 and the delilah database by berg et al 1999 and berg and meentemeyer 2011 in three danish tree species trial plots in a ca 30 year old stands of coniferous and broadleaved tree species the measured mean aboveground annual inputs of c ranged from 0 13 to 0 17 kg m 2 yr 1 and total aboveground dry matter inputs ranged from 3 to 4 t ha 1 hansen et al 2009 in a similar 30 year old tree species trial even aged broadleaf stands had foliar litter inputs of 0 10 to 0 19 kg c m 2 yr 1 vesterdal et al 2008 the range of aboveground litter inputs predicted by latitude for 23 sites by using berg et al 1999 was 0 07 0 19 kg c m 2 yr 1 table 1 users can thus choose values from this range but since transfer functions may overestimate low values and underestimate higher values also higher or lower values can be chosen according to the study questions 2 5 3 root litter input root exudates and microbial decay the root litter input and root exudates to rhizosphere soil lblg were distributed vertically according to a discrete root litter distribution function entered as percentage values of the aboveground input eq i conifers can have large shares of their roots in o horizons for direct mycorrhiza mediated nutrient cycling shallow root systems can be a tree species specific trait or can be caused by root restricting layers e g dense cemented layers or a high water table in the growing season root counts on soil profile walls were made in three tree species at icp forest monitoring sites hansen 2003 effective root depth including more than 95 of visible roots was 60 90 cm depending on site and tree species but can be much deeper in dry climates if there are no impediments to root growth in deeper soil layers callesen et al 2016 the root litter input distribution is by default assumed to be 100 of aboveground litter input but can be smaller or larger than 100 as entered by the user fine root production is estimated to 0 15 kg c m 2 yr 1 and the turnover rate is often 0 7 to 1 3 yr 1 kriiska et al 2019 yuan and chen 2010 in the same range as aboveground input solly et al 2018 examined different methods and found turnover rates of 0 5 1 4 yr 1 for fine roots in boreal forest high discrepancies in age determinations of fine roots indicated that a smaller fraction of the roots is much older maybe around 10 years this means that our suggested turnover rates for litter input to mineral soil of 0 01 0 1 yr 1 for cnew include carbon that is more recalcitrant than the labile parts of fine root litter observed turnover rates fitted by automated iteration on repeated measures in the topsoil steady state one pool model developed for the united kingdom kirk bellamy 2010 were in the range 0 02 0 06 yr 1 depending on current and former land use we therefore suggest a wider range of turnover rates due to the soil profile structure with two pools enabling decreasing turnover rates with depth root exudates may amount to 2 5 of npp yin et al 2014 and they are important in nutrient acquisition to trees by mycorrhiza and as substrate for bacteria lynch and whipps 1990 llado et al 2017 their role is an investment by the tree e g to nurture symbiosis and to get access to soil nutrients the incomplete decomposition of organic matter

analysis sensitivity analyses can be carried out by the user to address the questions in box 2 the idea of iterative changes and observation of instant effects on soc should give the user a feeling of control after balancing the soc stock what would it actually require to generate an increase in soc stocks over 40 years with the current vegetation dead wood is not included but could be added if harvest schemes are in question e g studying the effect of having or not having a one time deadwood stock in year 0 with a suitable turnover rate for deadwood 20 50 years or 0 05 0 02 yr 1 in a linear decay function 4 discussion 4 1 why is the game of getting stable c stock over 40 years relevant the aim of the paper was to communicate a generic simulation tool for forest soil organic carbon stock changes with example data from forest sites in the nordic baltic area and to introduce gamification the idea is to stimulate the understanding of why we use models what the limitations are when using models and to encourage a transparent approach to interpretation of model results herman et al 2019 oreskes 2003 yildirim 2017 the user with his or her knowledge and interactions is a part of the model fig 1 this should motivate student learning through getting hands on immediately in an intuitive way the exploration of important influences on soc storage the input the initial c stock and turnover rates can serve as reflections on soc change measurements or a comparison with results from other more complex model results emphasis was on the organization and boundaries of the model system the soil profile on c pools and processes and on assumptions made for inputs and litter distributions the vertical redistribution of soc between layers and decomposition rates is an important mechanism to communicate by using the soil profile as a frame and introducing soil forming processes of addition losses translocation and transformation of organic matter soil formation based on soil processes involving organic c comes alive assumptions included aboveground litter input root litter distribution linked to aboveground litter input the definition of a fixed fraction of old more stable and less active c of the total initial soc stock and the corresponding decomposition rates of new and old c 4 2 what parameter sets are correct the cases chosen represent everything from arenosols in dry and cold climate with limited soc accumulation and soil development to a humic podzol in cool and wet climate callesen et al 2019 statistical fitting of so many parameters and soil layers would require a large number of observation sites and well designed process studies of the various processes across many ecotones such data are not easy to bring about the important message is that in a 40 year time frame finding the correct parameter set is not so important since the model is an abstraction of something more complex most changes are slow and measurements are also uncertain the recognition of root nutrient and climatic constraints on soc stock changes are learning objectives for the user and should lead to reflections on soc changes and causes of soc stock change the model is limited by assumptions about constant litter input and root distribution in a 40 year time frame it cannot capture age dynamics of the tree stands caused by thinning defoliation changing light environment and nutrient redistributions between the soil and the tree stand understory vegetation may partly compensate for the lack of litter inputs in open young stands the model can address biogeographic site differences and soil quality differences affecting the current and future distribution of soc within the soil profile by changing litter input and decomposition rates for example when changing from an agricultural site to a forest the user can watch an o horizon build up depending on the turnover rate chosen of the new tree litter deposited on the soil surface and on the belowground root distribution as the aim was a pedagogical illustration of some of the complexity involved in the soil c cycling in forest stands the approach was user iteration trial and error and letting the user interpret soil site and pedology information i e soil horizon designations and summarized climate data the purpose was to test the sensitivity of the assumptions and not to make any correct model or model parameterization but to find out what parameterization would make the initial soc stock stable this to see if the current vegetation and its effect on soil c is matching the prevailing measured soc stocks next step would be the adjustment of parameters to reflect the absorption of the n deposition taking also possible p or moisture constraints into account to realize the fertilizing effect of n it could be done by studying the effect on soc stocks when changing important parameters such as litter input rate and c n ratio of litter if data on soc stock change measurements at two points in time are available they can be used for comparison with the simulated changes and also for guiding the parameterization for comparison with data from repeatedly measured sites it is an advantage if the within site variation is controlled by composite sampling with an adequate number of subsamples to get lower variance on the measurement this should be considered in sampling design the user gains experience with what magnitudes of soc stock change rates to expect in response to changes in aboveground litter and root litter input as well as in organic matter turnover rates k values particularly belowground inputs and heterotrophic soil respiration are very difficult to quantify and thus leading to inverse approaches and use of models for quantification of soc stocks varney 2020 here a model can be helpful and the model presents an estimate of heterotrophic respiration for evaluation e g at contrasting sites or model parameterizations within the same site future soc losses due to increased turnover rates will be speculative in the longer term not least due to the expected and ongoing climate changes affecting the length of the growing and c mineralization in fall as well as water saturation caused by fluctuating water tables this topic is at present a very active area of research smith et al 2020 soc losses and c pool changes may happen in the case of decreased water tables in organic soils the change from anaerobic to aerobic conditions can speed up decomposition of accumulated som in organic soil and subsidence of the soil surface and cause losses of 0 0 26 kg c m 2 yr 1 in boreal and temperate forest ipcc 2006 2014 improved aeration and net release of nutrients in the mineralizing om can also lead to increased litter inputs due to higher tree growth 4 3 structural uncertainty structural uncertainty involves the model construction itself the functioning of the microbial community is only indirectly present through the choice of turnover rates guided by the soil classification the need for long term resampling datasets for calibration of decomposition rates is obvious the total number of variables that can be changed and processes that can be involved also indicate that no unique set of values or that no unique model exists even if changes are constrained by physico chemical soil properties the user may realize from their own simulation experiences that different sets of variables may yield the same total soc stock possibly redistributed within horizons even small uncertainties in parameters e g aboveground litter input or organic matter turnover rates may cause large changes in predictions of c stock even at the 40 year timescale used this is the background for experimental research attempts to determine the stability of soil c to environmental and climatic changes that can be further explored in models other models than transparc2u are more suited for estimating effects of forest management on c stocks of short to medium term changes in organic matter inputs following e g intensification of harvest schemes or final felling and replanting changes in mass and functionality of fungal and bacterial c pools can t be simulated in the transparc2u more advanced but less user friendly models may be more suitable e g the susi model for organic soils lauren et al 2021 or other vertically resolved models such as icbm andrén and kätterer 1997 transparc2u does however account for different soc pools by using the soil profile and soil horizon organization for the separation of different c pools binding mechanisms and conditions for c release it is assumed that subsoil carbon is more stable without any assumptions on the chemistry or processes involved 4 4 upscaling to national forest area upscaling a c stock change from 1 m2 or 1 ha to e g national scale may give the user some perspectives take a glance at the national forest areas denmark 6 28 105 ha norway 1 22 107 ha sweden 2 80 107 ha finland 2 24 107 ha estonia 2 44 106 ha latvia 3 41 106 ha fao 2020 this means that a 1 t c ha 1 increase or loss in forest soc stock will represent numerically similar soc stock change at the national scale in tonnes c e g 0 6 mt for denmark and 28 mt for sweden such magnitudes are significant in the national ghg budgets even on a decadal time scale quantification of soc stocks and soc stock changes as accurate and precise as possible is important 4 5 climate dependency not built into the model how to assess it then the transparc2u model assumes no explicit climate dependency of the input variables one exception is the podzolisation process that requires a precipitation surplus to promote the doc leaching process and indicated by the presence of bh and bhs horizons in the soil profile since there was no aim to model possible uncertain climate effects on the 40 year soc balances climate impacts can be indirectly investigated by the user through any anticipated influences on observed litter inputs root litter input distribution pattern and higher lower turnover rates no such direct links or assumptions have been made but sensitivity analyses can quantify what magnitude such effects might have by changing the input values and observing the effects on soc stocks and soc stock changes 5 conclusion the transparc2u model represents a simulation tool for interpretation of static soil data with respect to soc stock changes the element and water cycles of the forest ecosystem are highly complex and only few pools of carbon have been quantified by measurements for that reason the model was kept very simple to fit the aim of the study to demonstrate the dynamic nature of soc stocks for communication and teaching purposes the gaming approach save the carbon can help to demonstrate and improve the understanding of the soil formation in forest soils with its impacts on vertical soc distribution it was demonstrated how litter inputs root litter distribution vertical translocation and transformation processes as well as decomposition rates interact to influence the overall soc stock balance even small input or turnover rate changes can cause large soc stock changes especially in carbon rich soils and especially in the longer term future turnover rates are uncertain however the sensitivities of major components of the soc balance can be studied which can guide future measurement activities in designing surveys that are functional in detecting expected effect sizes users of the transparc2u model can reflect on the sensitivities of these components of the forest soil carbon balance in an interactive manner funding funding was obtained from the danish innovation fund and facce eragas project invent 2017 2020 i reference 7108
