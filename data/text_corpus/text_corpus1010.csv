5050,plant transpiration accounts for 60 of evapotranspiration and is affected by drought in various ways seasonal droughts are frequent in humid region and co occur with increasing atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd and decreasing soil moisture independent effects of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply on transpiration are still unclear in this study plant transpiration and environmental factors were monitored from april 2012 through december 2017 in a subtropical coniferous plantation where low precipitation and high temperature occurred in summer and autumn our results confirmed the nonlinear relationship between atmospheric vpd and soil moisture and transpiration a multiplicative model of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on plant transpiration was developed to quantify their relative contributions to plant transpiration the response of plant transpiration to atmospheric vpd or soil moisture followed an exponential function when they neither factor was limiting throughout the study period atmospheric vpd and soil moisture explained on average 90 8 and 9 2 of the limitation on plant transpiration respectively while seasonal drought occurred during july to october monthly mean contribution of soil moisture limitation to plant transpiration was 17 8 6 7 with a maximum daily contribution of 86 8 our results showed that transpiration in this subtropical coniferous plantation would be further limited by soil moisture in conditions of future climate change keywords transpiration seasonal drought humid region soil water supply atmospheric water demand 1 introduction plant transpiration accounts for 60 of evapotranspiration et and returns about 39 of precipitation to the atmosphere at global scale good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 lian et al 2018 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 plant transpiration is the process of water movement from roots to aerial plant parts transpiration is driven by atmospheric water demand while the main source of water for plant transpiration is soil water transpiration which is limited by insufficient soil water can profoundly affect vegetation productivity and threaten vegetation survival during periods of hydrologic stress adams et al 2017 mcdowell and allen 2015 peng et al 2011 phillips et al 2009 subtropical drylands are projected to expand due to climate change and deep soil layers will be increasingly dry during the growing seasons huang et al 2015 schlaepfer et al 2017 yao et al 2020 seasonal drought in humid region will directly result in decreasing soil water supply and increasing atmospheric water demand novick et al 2016 ungar et al 2013 the responses of transpiration to soil water supply and atmospheric water demand are often confounded in forest ecosystems subjected to seasonal droughts sulman et al 2016 novick et al 2016 novick et al 2016 reported that atmospheric water demand limited surface conductance gs and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture at 38 ameriflux sites including forests grasslands shrubs and croplands ecosystems jung et al 2010 reported that the declining global land et was driven primarily by limiting soil water supply in the southern hemisphere quantitative description of the trade off between water supply and demand will lead to accurate projections of transpiration responses to future climate conditions previous studies mostly focused on the response of et or transpiration to drought and dealt mainly with atmospheric water demand novick et al 2016 restaino et al 2016 wu et al 2019 to determine the effects of atmospheric water demand climate indicators including net radiation rn photosynthetically active radiation par air temperature ta atmospheric relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd and potential evapotranspiration pet were adopted as independent variables li et al 2016 ma et al 2018 park williams et al 2012 zha et al 2017 et plant transpiration gs and gpp were selected as dependent variables li et al 2016 novick et al 2016 oren et al 1999 park williams et al 2012 restaino et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 however the integrated indicators such as pet and gs are related to the actual transpiration measurement and result in autocorrelation problems among pet gs and plant transpiration granier et al 2000 novick et al 2016 she et al 2013 according to the big leaf model fick s law and darcy s law ecosystem transpiration depends on water vapor pressure difference between inside and outside the stomata and stomatal conductance dai et al 2004 dickinson et al 1998 mcdowell and allen 2015 therefore vpd is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants and a critical variable for determining plant transpiration and photosynthesis novick et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 soil water content swc relative extractable soil water rew and soil water potential chang et al 2014 li et al 2016 sulman et al 2016 are used for determining the effects of soil water supply on plant transpiration sulman et al 2016 found that individual effects of soil moisture and interactive effects between soil moisture and atmospheric vpd substantially contributed to the variability in transpiration and gpp soil moisture was also shown to be the most important factor among potential drivers par ta vpd and swc controlling carbon fluxes in alpine meadows of the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 actually both atmospheric water demand and soil water supply have significant effects on transpiration and they often interacted jiao et al 2019 rigden et al 2020 whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 rigden et al 2020 observed that the combined influence of soil moisture and atmospheric vpd increased accuracy of prediction of maize growth furthermore quantitative evaluation of the response of plant transpiration to soil water supply and atmospheric water demand is critical for predicting potential transpiration responses jasechko 2018 models evaluating independent and combined effects of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply on plant transpiration can be roughly divided into grouping based and multiplication models jiao et al 2019 li et al 2016 novick et al 2016 whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 xu et al 2017 a grouping based model is usually based on a main variable and several variables used for grouping and a multiplication model is based on several equally important variables for grouping based models multiple functions including piecewise linear and non linear functions are fitted to describe the relationships between the dependent and independent variables novick et al 2016 she et al 2013 for example she et al 2013 used piecewise and linear functions to fit the relationships between rew and gs of caragana korshinskii in the loess plateau li et al 2016 used an exponential function to describe the relationships between soil moisture and corresponding maximum transpiration in a semi arid pure larch plantation grouping based models performed well when predicting the response of gs and transpiration to the corresponding independent variables multiplication models were derived from the penman monteith model and a modified jarvis stewart model whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 multiplication models can be easily revised and widely applied because they are capable of incorporating optional independent variables for specific research goals whitley et al 2009 found that both the penman monteith and the modified jarvis stewart model explained 87 and 86 of the variance respectively of hourly and daily transpiration calculated from sap flow measurements in an evergreen forest in australia however grouping based and multiplication models were unable to quantify individual contributions of the limitations of independent variables subtropical forests in the humid east asian monsoon region have a high carbon sequestration capacity it is comparable to those of north american and european temperate forests yu et al 2014 young stand ages and high nitrogen deposition contribute to the high uptake rates of carbon dioxide gao et al 2019 yu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 in subtropical region asynchronous low precipitation and high heat during summer and autumn induced seasonal drought which limited vegetation growth and even caused tree mortality tang et al 2014a wen et al 2010 a comparison of the results of eddy flux measurements in a subtropical coniferous plantation in an exceptionally dry year 2003 with those in years of 2004 2011 showed that deep soil water can limit et tang et al 2014b the contributions of soil water supply and atmospheric water demand to transpiration were still unclear in subtropical coniferous plantations subjected to seasonal drought in this study we measured sap flow from april 2012 through december 2017 of dominant trees in a subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to seasonal drought our objectives were to 1 determine the response of plant transpiration to both the atmospheric water demand and soil water supply and 2 develop and verify a multiplicative model to quantify the relative contributions of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply to plant transpiration at daily to yearly scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at qianyanzhou qyz site 26 44 52 n 115 39 47 e 102 m

according to surveys in october 2011 and december 2018 the mean dbh of masson pine slash pine chinese fir and broad leaf trees increased by 0 34 0 18 0 22 and 0 62 cm yr 1 respectively based on the distribution of dbh we chose 18 dominant trees at different dbh classes table s1 for sap flow measurements the flgs tdp xm1000 system tdp 30 mm dynamax inc usa was used to measure sap flow density of the sample trees tdp probes were installed on the shady side of the stem at 1 3 m above ground level in april 9 2012 monitoring frequency was set to 10 s with the mean value recorded every 10 min with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific usa ancillary meteorological variables in atmosphere and soil were measured wen et al 2006 wen et al 2010 in short net radiation was measured with a four component net radiometer cnr 1 kipp zonen inc the netherlands air temperature and relative humidity sensors hmp45c campbell scientific inc usa and wind speed sensors a100r vector inc usa were installed at 23 6 m above ground level net radiation air temperature and relative humid raw data were sampled at 10 hz and the 30 min mean fluxes were calculated and stored by a cr5000 datalogger campbell scientific inc usa precipitation was monitored and recorded every 30 min with a rain gauge 52203 rm young inc usa soil volumetric water contents were measured at the depths of 5 20 and 50 cm using three tdr probes cs615 l campbell scientific inc usa precipitation and soil moisture data were collected every 30 min by cr10x dataloggers campbell scientific inc usa relative soil water content rswc was calculated by standardizing swc according to the maximum swc 0 42 m3 m 3 and minimum swc 0 23 m3 m 3 during study period xu et al 2017 where swc was the volumetrically weighted mean of swc cm3 cm 3 at depths of 5 20 and 50 cm swc5 swc20 and swc50 2 3 transpiration calculation at ecosystem level transpiration rate ft mm h 1 at the individual plant level was calculated depending on sap flow density sfd cm3 cm 2 h 1 of each sample tree and corresponding sapwood a cm2 the sfd was calculated by calibration with different species using an eq 1 established by granier 1987 and verified and widely used in coniferous and broad leaf forests granier et al 2000 lu et al 2004 peters et al 2018 for an individual tree k was expressed as eq 2 granier 1987 granier et al 1996 1 sfd 3600 0 0119 k 1 231 2 k dt m d t dt where k is a dimensionless flow index depending on temperature differences dt between two tdp probes and dtm is maximum dt at nighttime representing zero flow condition the a for each individual tree was calculated according to the relationships between a and dbh determined for our site by xu 2011 transpiration rate ft mm h 1 at the ecosystem level was calculated based on accumulation of sfd of each species n 4 with eq 3 as follows 3 f t 10 1 4 sfd a a a a g where sfda is mean sap flow density of sample trees per species aa is the total sapwood area of each species in the sample plot cm2 ag is the plot area 108 cm2 to eliminate the deviation among tdp sensors of all sample trees dt was corrected each day according to following procedure first dt data were checked normality according to the instrument status and a pauta criterion then the confidence interval of dt was set from 0 to 10 and dts were excluded when the differences between two adjacent dts exceeded 0 8 data for k 1 were also removed and those for k 0 were modified to zero lu et al 2004 peters et al 2018 missing data following this quality control procedures were retained the half hourly sfd was calculated based on the average of the remaining sfd at 10 min scale we assumed that trees grew at a constant rates and calculated the corresponding aa based on linear fitted dbh at daily scales days with 30 missing data were elected as effective for calculation of daily transpiration rates fig s1 transpiration of living masson pine slash pine chinese fir and broadleaf trees accounted for 51 02 38 81 3 16 and 7 00 of the daily average ecosystem transpiration during the study period at our site the number and proportion of effective half hourly and daily transpiration rate data in each year are given in table s2 we analyzed the relationships between transpiration and environmental factors at half hourly daily monthly and yearly scales using matlab 2018b mathworks inc usa first half hourly daily monthly and yearly transpiration and environmental factors were used pet was calculated at daily monthly and yearly scales and rswc factors for rainy drought and non growing seasons rswcs1 rswcs2 and rswcs3 were calculated at half hourly daily and monthly scales data for non rainy days daily precipitation zero only were selected for correlation analysis and subsequent model calculation correlation between atmospheric vpd and rswc was also analyzed at half hourly daily monthly and yearly scales 2 4 multiplicative model for transpiration using atmospheric vpd and soil moisture according to the jarvis stewart model jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 stewart 1988 a multiplicative model eq 4 of atmospheric vpd and rswc at daily scale was developed to describe the combined effects of soil water supply and atmosphere water demand on transpiration mm d 1 similar functions have been widely used and exhibited good fit whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 xu et al 2017 4 f t t max 1 e k 1 v p d k 2 1 e k 3 r s w c where tmax is the maximum daily transpiration rate during the study period mm d 1 the parameters k1 k2 and k3 are fitting parameters describing sensitivity of transpiration to rswc and vpd limitation respectively vpd is calculated based on temperature and relative humidity howell and dusek 1995 the effects of rswc and atmospheric vpd may interfere with each other so we chose the boundary relationship between rswc and transpiration to describe rswc limitation with eq 5 jiao et al 2019 li et al 2016 and selected data for well watered conditions to calculate atmospheric vpd limitation with eq 6 5 f t t vpd 1 e k 3 r s w c 6 t vpd t max 1 e k 1 v p d k 2 where tvpd is the reference transpiration mm d 1 in well watered conditions in a certain vpd bin the parameters k1 k2 and k3 were determined by nonlinear regression of eq 5 and eq 6 to evaluate model fit we calculated correlation coefficient r2 sum of squared errors sse root mean square deviation rmse f test and p value using matlab 2018b mathworks inc usa rainy days and days with atmospheric vpd 0 2 kpa were excluded from model simulation kumagai et al 2008 peters et al 2018 for comparison ft vpd and rswc were sorted into bins evenly specifically vpd is sorted from 0 2 kpa at an interval of 0 2 kpa rswc is sorted from 0 to 0 6 at an interval of 0 1 and ft is sorted at an interval of 0 5 mm d 1 individual contributions of the effects of atmospheric vpd and rswc to transpiration were also calculated using the multiplicative model the control factor of rswc on transpiration was α e k 3 r s w c and the control factor of vpd on transpiration was β e k 1 v p d k 2 based on eq 4 therefore both α and β had a threshold value between 0 and 1 the thresholds of rswc and vpd were inversely calculated according to the assumption that the individual contributions were 1 α 0 01 and β 0 01 stocker et al 2018 individual contribution of each variable was calculated using αratio α α β and βratio β α β 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics and seasonal drought occurrence the asynchronous precipitation and temperature from july to october induced a seasonal drought in this subtropical coniferous plantation annually due to the western pacific subtropical high precipitation significantly decreased during the dry season july to october while the temperature peaked at 29 08 1 09 with daily maximum 33 98 fig 1 a four outlier ais of january 2012 november 2015 december 2015 and january 2016 were 10 43 10 79 11 88 and 8 14 respectively ai of dry season during 2002 to 2018 was significantly less than that of any other season p 0 01 fig 1b specifically mean dry seasonal ai during the study period was 0 93 0 52 with a range from 0 13 to 1 85 in seasonal drought conditions mean rswc sharply decreased and rapidly responded to precipitation while mean atmospheric vpd was relatively high fig 1c ranges of monthly mean rswc during rainy drought and non growing seasons were 0 63 0 71 0 36 0 51 and 0 50 0 55 respectively fig 1c this indicated that there was an insufficient soil water supply and a high atmospheric water demand when plantation was subjected to seasonal drought 3 2 correlations between transpiration and meteorological variables correlation analyses between transpiration and environmental factors at half hourly daily monthly and yearly scales were conducted table 1 transpiration was significantly and positively correlated with atmospheric evaporative demand indicators rn t vpd and pet at half hourly daily and monthly scales p 0 01 and negatively correlated with rh at half hourly p 0 01 daily p 0 01 and monthly p 0 05 scales in comparison transpiration showed a weak correlation with soil water supply indicators swc5 swc20 swc50 rswc deep soil water content swc50 was significantly and positively correlated with transpiration at half hourly scales p 0 01 but significantly and negatively correlated with transpiration at daily scales p 0 01 half hourly and daily transpiration was not significantly correlated with rswcs1 during the rainy season p 0 05 but was significantly and positively correlated with rswcs2 during drought season p 0 01 and significantly and negatively correlated with rswcs3 during non growing season p 0 01 in addition atmospheric vpd was significantly and negatively correlated with rswc at half hourly r 0 20 daily r 0 30 and monthly r 0 36 scales p 0 01 but not correlated at yearly scales r 0 79 p 0 05 atmospheric vpd was significantly and positively correlated with rn at half hourly r 0 50 daily r 0 72 and monthly r 0 89 scales p 0 01 but not at yearly scale r 0 54 p 0 05 3 3 effects of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on transpiration first we investigated the relationship between daily atmospheric vpd and rswc under plant transpiration rates grouped into 0 5 mm d 1 intervals fig 2 generally transpiration was positively correlated with rswc and negatively correlated with atmospheric vpd in each transpiration interval table s3 atmospheric vpd and rswc were significantly and negatively correlated as shown by pearson correlations and linear regressions in each transpiration interval table s3 this negative correlation may confound the independent effects of atmospheric vpd and rswc on transpiration second we investigated the relationships between daily rswc and plant transpiration rate in 0 2 kpa intervals of atmospheric vpd fig 3 the relationship between rswc and transpiration fitted well to an exponential function eq 5 within each vpd interval table s4 especially in the upper ranges ft 4 31 1 exp 9 28 rswc r2 0 82 rmse 0 33 mm d 1 p 0 001 the tvpd in eq 5 increased with the increase in atmospheric vpd and reached a maximum tmax in eq 6 in upper ranges with data reaching the vpd group of 1 3 kpa further the soil moisture threshold inversely calculated from the boundary function was rswc 0 50 and a well watered soil condition existed when rswc was 0 50 finally the relationship between daily atmospheric vpd and plant transpiration rate was investigated under rswc intervals of 0 2 fig 4 the relationship between atmospheric vpd and transpiration fitted well to an exponential function eq 6 in each rswc interval table s5 atmospheric vpd and transpiration within each rswc interval were significantly and positively correlated rswc had a significant effect on transpiration vpd relationship when rswc 0 50 p 0 01 but the effect was not significant when rswc 0 50 p 0 05 contribution of atmospheric vpd to transpiration when rswc 0 50 was fitted with eq 6 tvpd 4 31 1 exp 1 04 vpd 0 13 r2 0 70 rmse 0 57 mm d 1 p 0 001 at the 99 boundary of the maximum transpiration the atmospheric vpd thresholds were inversely calculated from eq 6 to be 4 55 kpa and the intersection of the fitted curve with vpd was 0 13 kpa representing the transpiration rate of zero therefore this function could be used to calculate the independent contribution of atmospheric vpd to transpiration without considering soil moisture furthermore based on the rswc threshold of 0 50 ecosystem transpiration data were divided into two parts fig 2 rswc data below the threshold represented insufficient soil water supply condition and rswc data above the threshold represented well watered soil conditions the number of data points below the threshold accounted for 55 79 of the total numbers indicating that 55 79 of the days during the study period soil moisture was limiting for plant transpiration all daily atmospheric vpd data in this subtropical plantation were lower than the threshold of 4 55 kpa 3 4 simulations of the effects of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on transpiration our multiplicative model eq 4 for the response of transpiration to vpd and rswc was ft 4 31 1 exp 9 28 rswc 1 exp 1 04 vpd 0 13 the linear regression of our multiplicative model result with measured transpiration was fitted transpiration 0 94 measured transpiration r2 0 69 rmse 0 55 mm d 1 p 0 001 when the intercept t was zero fig s2 the multiplicative model overestimated transpiration for actual transpiration values of 0 5 mm day 1 mainly during non growing season november to march fig s1 a both rswc and atmospheric vpd had significant effects on transpiration but their contributions varied greatly at daily fig 5 a and monthly fig 5b scales at a daily timescale contributions of rswc αratio and atmospheric vpd βratio to transpiration ranged from 0 to 86 8 and 13 3 to 100 respectively at a monthly scale αratio and βratio ranged from 0 2 to 39 2 and 60 8 to 99 8 respectively table s6 during the growing season αratio increased from 0 7 in early growing season mar to june to 17 8 in late growing season july to october specifically monthly mean αratio increased sharply from july 10 0 to october 24 9 during non growing seasons november to february αratio and βratio were 4 6 and 95 4 respectively during the whole study period average αratio and βratio were 9 2 and 90 8 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture limitation on plant transpiration response to atmospheric vpd using the aridity thresholds characterized by abrupt decrease in plant productivity ai 0 54 soil fertility ai 0 7 and plant cover and richness ai 0 8 berdugo et al 2020 we determined that monthly aridity indexes in the subtropical coniferous plantation in this study exceeded those thresholds account for 13 89 16 67 and 18 06 respectively from april 2012 through december 2017 this indicated that extreme seasonal droughts may be harmful to this plantation it is expected that climate change will increase the area of subtropical drylands in the 21st century huang et al 2015 schlaepfer et al 2017 such changes may aggravate regional and seasonal droughts at globle scale limiting both canopy transpiration and photosynthetic rates due to stomatal closure schlaepfer et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 at our site atmospheric vpd was generally lower than the threshold and served as a driver of ecosystem transpiration but the driving effect diminished with increasing atmospheric vpd fig 4 one reason for this diminishing effect may be stomatal closure several models have shown a negative correlation between atmospheric vpd and gs granier et al 2000 novick et al 2016 oren et al 1999 another reason may be shortage of soil water supply soil moisture controls water supply for plant transpiration in the soil plant atmosphere continuum the imbalances of water supply and demand may directly limit plant transpiration in addition soil moisture often decreases with increasing atmospheric vpd and a considerable soil moisture limitation to plant transpiration can develop han et al 2019 schlaepfer et al 2017 our results showed that daily and monthly soil moisture limitations respectively contributed up to 86 8 and 39 2 to transpiration in our study plantation during the drought season these results indicate that soil moisture had substantial effects on limiting plant transpiration in this subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to drought at daily scale soil moisture and transpiration showed a weak correlation during the whole study period but were significantly and positively related during the drought season table 1 this was mainly due to the asynchronous change of soil moisture and transpiration at half hourly and daily scales and the highly nonlinear relationship between them she et al 2013 in this study increasing vpd did not limit transpiration during drought but instead enhanced transpiration further both transpiration and evaporation in conditions of high vpd rapidly consumed soil water and exacerbated soil drought in drought season the negative correlation between vpd and soil moisture also confirmed this process table 1 therefore the imbalance of water demand and supply may have detrimental effects on tree physiology the effect of soil moisture on transpiration exhibits high variability depending on the degree of drought and vegetation characteristics ewers et al 2002 moshelion et al 2014 for example transpiration in young forests is more prone to be limited by soil moisture due to lower root volume in the soil than in old forests bretfeld et al 2018 isohydric and anisohydric plants also have different responses to water stress moshelion et al 2014 when soil water supply is insufficient it is often accompanied by high atmospheric vpd in which isohydric plants can close their stomata to prevent excessive water loss and anisohydric plants can reduce leaf water content to maintain relative large stomatal aperture konings et al 2017 mcadam and brodribb 2012 mcadam and brodribb 2015 moshelion et al 2014 moshelion et al 2014 concluded that isohydric plants were more easily affected by water stress but had a larger safety margin higher embolism resistance than anisohydric plants konings et al 2017 found that productivity of an anisohydric ecosystem was over three times more sensitive to atmospheric vpd than that of an isohydric ecosystem in the united states grasslands therefore anisohydric behavior of the coniferous forests indicated an aggressive growth strategy mcadam and brodribb 2015 when soil moisture was highly insufficient over long periods anisohydric plants were more vulnerable to mortality than isohydric plants due to irreversible plant xylem embolism and subsequent hydraulic imbalance moshelion et al 2014 restaino et al 2016 because the conifers in our subtropical plantation were anisohydric insufficient soil water supply with a mean αratio of 17 8 6 7 may result in damage to trees subjected to seasonal drought in the late growing season 4 2 contribution of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture to transpiration a quantitative model for the response of plant transpiration to soil water supply and atmospheric water demand is helpful in predicting potential transpiration responses to future climate change our multiplicative model can assess the independent contributions of atmospheric vpd and rswc to transpiration by restricting the boundary and threshold conditions of one of the two variables to determine the performance of our multiplication model a grouping based model for transpiration was also modified and applied fig s2 jiao et al 2019 li et al 2016 with one modification that of using rswc standardized according to the maximum and minimum swc instead of rew standardized according to field water capacity and wilting point because swc in our study forest was significantly higher than the wilting point 0 10 m3 m 3 in all measured soil layers p 0 01 the result of grouping based model was ft 0 0056 pet2 0 4087 pet 1 exp 9 28 rswc the linear regression between the simulated and measured transpiration was fitted transpiration 0 94 measured transpiration r2 0 64 rmse 0 58 mm d 1 p 0 001 fig s2 the performance of grouping based model in our subtropical coniferous plantation was better than that in a black locust plantation of the loess plateau jiao et al 2019 but inferior to our multiplicative model more importantly grouping based model could not quantify the relative contributions of the independent variables limiting transpiration restricting the ability to disentangle the independent effects of various drivers on ecosystem transpiration jiao et al 2019 novick et al 2016 our model mainly focused on water supply and demand relationships in plant transpiration in the soil plant atmosphere continuum but did not consider other environment factors like radiation ta and rh for example the effect of radiation on the negative correlation between gs and vpd had been confirmed granier et al 2000 and photosynthetic net radiation also had a negative effect on the lag time between atmospheric vpd and transpiration zhang et al 2018 the consumption of available radiation energy as sensible heat flux raises temperature and atmospheric vpd therefore we used atmospheric vpd as a comprehensive index of atmospheric water demand further revision and applicable analyses are critical when using a multiplicative model for other plants this is due to the different water consumption strategies of isohydric and anisohydric plants moshelion et al 2014 for example she et al 2012 used a linear equation to describe the relationships between transpiration in c korshinskii and relative extractable soil water in the loess plateau chang et al 2014 found that the relationship between transpiration and soil moisture exhibited a logistic type for picea crassifolia in the heihe river basin of china hence fitting by species is helpful for improving the accuracy of a multiplicative model in mixed species forest forrester et al 2016 however

seasonal drought and the response of plant transpiration to atmospheric water demand and soil water supply was investigated our results showed that soil moisture had a significant effect on the response of transpiration to atmospheric vpd in this subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to seasonal drought our multiplicative model performed well and quantified the independent effects of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on transpiration the response of transpiration to vpd or soil moisture was best described by exponential functions monthly mean soil moisture contributed 17 8 6 7 of the effects on maximum transpiration with a maximum daily contribution of 86 8 when seasonal drought occurred during july to october our results suggest that the effects of soil moisture on

5050,plant transpiration accounts for 60 of evapotranspiration and is affected by drought in various ways seasonal droughts are frequent in humid region and co occur with increasing atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd and decreasing soil moisture independent effects of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply on transpiration are still unclear in this study plant transpiration and environmental factors were monitored from april 2012 through december 2017 in a subtropical coniferous plantation where low precipitation and high temperature occurred in summer and autumn our results confirmed the nonlinear relationship between atmospheric vpd and soil moisture and transpiration a multiplicative model of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on plant transpiration was developed to quantify their relative contributions to plant transpiration the response of plant transpiration to atmospheric vpd or soil moisture followed an exponential function when they neither factor was limiting throughout the study period atmospheric vpd and soil moisture explained on average 90 8 and 9 2 of the limitation on plant transpiration respectively while seasonal drought occurred during july to october monthly mean contribution of soil moisture limitation to plant transpiration was 17 8 6 7 with a maximum daily contribution of 86 8 our results showed that transpiration in this

lian et al 2018 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 plant transpiration is the process of water movement from roots to aerial plant parts transpiration is driven by atmospheric water demand while the main source of water for plant transpiration is soil water transpiration which is limited by insufficient soil water can profoundly affect vegetation productivity and threaten vegetation survival during periods of hydrologic stress adams et al 2017 mcdowell and allen 2015 peng et al 2011 phillips et al 2009 subtropical drylands are projected to expand due to climate change and deep soil layers will be increasingly dry during the growing seasons huang et al 2015 schlaepfer et al 2017 yao et al 2020 seasonal drought in humid region will directly result in decreasing soil water supply and increasing atmospheric water demand novick et al 2016 ungar et al 2013 the responses of transpiration to soil water supply and atmospheric water demand are often confounded in forest ecosystems subjected to seasonal droughts sulman et al 2016 novick et al 2016 novick et al 2016 reported that atmospheric water demand limited surface conductance gs and evapotranspiration to a greater extent than soil moisture at 38 ameriflux sites including forests grasslands shrubs and croplands ecosystems jung et al 2010 reported that the declining global land et was driven primarily by limiting soil water supply in the southern hemisphere quantitative description of the trade off between water supply and demand will lead to accurate projections of transpiration responses to future climate conditions previous studies mostly focused on the response of et or transpiration to drought and dealt mainly with atmospheric water demand novick et al 2016 restaino et al 2016 wu et al 2019 to determine the effects of atmospheric water demand climate indicators including net radiation rn photosynthetically active radiation par air temperature ta atmospheric relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd and potential evapotranspiration pet were adopted as independent variables li et al 2016 ma et al 2018 park williams et al 2012 zha et al 2017 et plant transpiration gs and gpp were selected as dependent variables li et al 2016 novick et al 2016 oren et al 1999 park williams et al 2012 restaino et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 however the integrated indicators such as pet and gs are related to the actual transpiration measurement and result in autocorrelation problems among pet gs and plant transpiration granier et al 2000 novick et al 2016 she et al 2013 according to the big leaf model fick s law and darcy s law ecosystem transpiration depends on water vapor pressure difference between inside and outside the stomata and stomatal conductance dai et al 2004 dickinson et al 1998 mcdowell and allen 2015 therefore vpd is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants and a critical variable for determining plant transpiration and photosynthesis novick et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 soil water content swc relative extractable soil water rew and soil water potential chang et al 2014 li et al 2016 sulman et al 2016 are used for determining the effects of soil water supply on plant transpiration sulman et al 2016 found that individual effects of soil moisture and interactive effects between soil moisture and atmospheric vpd substantially contributed to the

plateau zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 actually both atmospheric water demand and soil water supply have significant effects on transpiration and they often interacted jiao et al 2019 rigden et al 2020 whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 rigden et al 2020 observed that the combined influence of soil moisture and atmospheric vpd increased accuracy of prediction of maize growth furthermore quantitative evaluation of the response of plant transpiration to soil water supply and atmospheric water demand is critical for predicting potential transpiration responses jasechko 2018 models evaluating independent and combined effects of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply on plant transpiration can be roughly divided into grouping based and multiplication models jiao et al 2019 li et al 2016 novick et al 2016 whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 xu et al 2017 a grouping based model is usually based on a main variable and several variables used for grouping and a multiplication model is based on several equally important variables for grouping based models multiple functions including piecewise linear and non linear functions are fitted to describe the relationships between the dependent and independent variables novick et al 2016 she et al 2013 for example she et al 2013 used piecewise and linear functions to fit the relationships between rew and gs of caragana korshinskii in the loess plateau li et al 2016 used an exponential function to describe the relationships between soil moisture and corresponding maximum transpiration in a semi arid pure larch plantation grouping based models performed well when predicting the response of gs and transpiration to the corresponding independent variables multiplication models were derived from the penman monteith model and a modified jarvis stewart model whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 multiplication models can be easily revised and widely applied because they are capable of incorporating optional independent variables for specific research goals whitley et al 2009 found that both the penman monteith and the modified jarvis stewart model explained 87 and 86 of the variance respectively of hourly and daily transpiration calculated from sap flow measurements in an evergreen forest in australia however grouping based and multiplication models were unable to quantify individual contributions of the limitations of independent variables subtropical forests in the humid east asian monsoon region have a high carbon sequestration capacity it is comparable to those of north american and european temperate forests yu et al 2014 young stand ages and high nitrogen deposition contribute to the high uptake rates of carbon dioxide gao et al 2019 yu et al 2014 yu et al 2016 in subtropical region asynchronous low precipitation and high heat during summer and autumn induced seasonal drought which limited vegetation growth and even caused tree mortality tang et al 2014a wen et al 2010 a comparison of the results of eddy flux measurements in a subtropical coniferous plantation in an exceptionally dry year 2003 with those in years of 2004 2011 showed that deep soil water can limit et tang et al 2014b the contributions of soil water supply and atmospheric water demand to transpiration were still unclear in subtropical coniferous plantations subjected to seasonal drought in this study we measured sap flow from april 2012 through december 2017 of dominant trees in a subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to seasonal drought our objectives were to 1 determine the response of plant transpiration to both the atmospheric water demand and soil water supply and 2 develop and verify a multiplicative model to quantify the relative contributions of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply to plant transpiration at daily to yearly scales 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was conducted at qianyanzhou qyz site 26 44 52 n 115 39 47 e 102 m

according to surveys in october 2011 and december 2018 the mean dbh of masson pine slash pine chinese fir and broad leaf trees increased by 0 34 0 18 0 22 and 0 62 cm yr 1 respectively based on the distribution of dbh we chose 18 dominant trees at different dbh classes table s1 for sap flow measurements the flgs tdp xm1000 system tdp 30 mm dynamax inc usa was used to measure sap flow density of the sample trees tdp probes were installed on the shady side of the stem at 1 3 m above ground level in april 9 2012 monitoring frequency was set to 10 s with the mean value recorded every 10 min with a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific usa ancillary meteorological variables in atmosphere and soil were measured wen et al 2006 wen et al 2010 in short net radiation was measured with a four component net radiometer cnr 1 kipp zonen inc the netherlands air temperature and relative humidity sensors hmp45c campbell scientific inc usa and wind speed sensors a100r vector inc usa were installed at 23 6 m above ground level net radiation air temperature and relative humid raw data were sampled at 10 hz and the 30 min mean fluxes were calculated and stored by a cr5000 datalogger campbell scientific inc usa precipitation was monitored and recorded every 30 min with a rain gauge 52203 rm young inc usa soil volumetric water contents were measured at the depths of 5 20 and 50 cm using three tdr probes cs615 l campbell scientific inc usa precipitation and soil moisture data were collected every 30 min by cr10x dataloggers campbell scientific inc usa relative soil water content rswc was calculated by standardizing swc according to the maximum swc 0 42 m3 m 3 and minimum swc 0 23 m3 m 3 during study period xu et al 2017 where swc was the volumetrically weighted mean of swc cm3 cm 3 at depths of 5 20 and 50 cm swc5 swc20 and swc50 2 3 transpiration calculation at ecosystem level transpiration rate ft mm h 1 at the individual plant level was calculated depending on sap flow density sfd cm3 cm 2 h 1 of each sample tree and corresponding sapwood a cm2 the sfd was calculated by calibration with different species using an eq 1 established by granier 1987 and verified and widely used in coniferous and broad leaf forests granier et al 2000 lu et al 2004 peters et al 2018 for an individual tree k was expressed as eq 2 granier 1987 granier et al 1996 1 sfd 3600 0 0119 k 1 231 2 k dt m d t dt where k is a dimensionless flow index depending on temperature differences dt between two tdp probes and dtm is maximum dt at nighttime representing zero flow condition the a for each individual tree was calculated according to the relationships between a and dbh determined for our site by xu 2011 transpiration rate ft mm h 1 at the ecosystem level was calculated based on accumulation of sfd of each species n 4 with eq 3 as follows 3 f t 10 1 4 sfd a a a a g where sfda is mean sap flow density of sample trees per species aa is the total sapwood area of each species in the sample plot cm2 ag is the plot area 108 cm2 to eliminate the deviation among tdp sensors of all sample trees dt was corrected each day according to following procedure first dt data were checked normality according to the instrument status and a pauta criterion then the confidence interval of dt was set from 0 to 10 and dts were excluded when the differences between two adjacent dts exceeded 0 8 data for k 1 were also removed and those for k 0 were modified to zero lu et al 2004 peters et al 2018 missing data following this quality control procedures were retained the half hourly sfd was calculated based on the average of the remaining sfd at 10 min scale we assumed that trees grew at a constant rates and calculated the corresponding aa based on linear fitted dbh at daily scales days with 30 missing data were elected as effective for calculation of daily transpiration rates fig s1 transpiration of living masson pine slash pine chinese fir and broadleaf trees accounted for 51 02 38 81 3 16 and 7 00 of the daily average ecosystem transpiration during the study period at our site the number and proportion of effective half hourly and daily transpiration rate data in each year are given in table s2 we analyzed the relationships between transpiration and environmental factors at half hourly daily monthly and yearly scales using matlab 2018b mathworks inc usa first half hourly daily monthly and yearly transpiration and environmental factors were used pet was calculated at daily monthly and yearly scales and rswc factors for rainy drought and non growing seasons rswcs1 rswcs2 and rswcs3 were calculated at half hourly daily and monthly scales data for non rainy days daily precipitation zero only were selected for correlation analysis and subsequent model calculation correlation between atmospheric vpd and rswc was also analyzed at half hourly daily monthly and yearly scales 2 4 multiplicative model for transpiration using atmospheric vpd and soil moisture according to the jarvis stewart model jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 stewart 1988 a multiplicative model eq 4 of atmospheric vpd and rswc at daily scale was developed to describe the combined effects of soil water supply and atmosphere water demand on transpiration mm d 1 similar functions have been widely used and exhibited good fit whitley et al 2009 whitley et al 2008 xu et al 2017 4 f t t max 1 e k 1 v p d k 2 1 e k 3 r s w c where tmax is the maximum daily transpiration rate during the study period mm d 1 the parameters k1 k2 and k3 are fitting parameters describing sensitivity of transpiration to rswc and vpd limitation respectively vpd is calculated based on temperature and relative humidity howell and dusek 1995 the effects of rswc and atmospheric vpd may interfere with each other so we chose the boundary relationship between rswc and transpiration to describe rswc limitation with eq 5 jiao et al 2019 li et al 2016 and selected data for well watered conditions to calculate atmospheric vpd limitation with eq 6 5 f t t vpd 1 e k 3 r s w c 6 t vpd t max 1 e k 1 v p d k 2 where tvpd is the reference transpiration mm d 1 in well watered conditions in a certain vpd bin the parameters k1 k2 and k3 were determined by nonlinear regression of eq 5 and eq 6 to evaluate model fit we calculated correlation coefficient r2 sum of squared errors sse root mean square deviation rmse f test and p value using matlab 2018b mathworks inc usa rainy days and days with atmospheric vpd 0 2 kpa were excluded from model simulation kumagai et al 2008 peters et al 2018 for comparison ft vpd and rswc were sorted into bins evenly specifically vpd is sorted from 0 2 kpa at an interval of 0 2 kpa rswc is sorted from 0 to 0 6 at an interval of 0 1 and ft is sorted at an interval of 0 5 mm d 1 individual contributions of the effects of atmospheric vpd and rswc to transpiration were also calculated using the multiplicative model the control factor of rswc on transpiration was α e k 3 r s w c and the control factor of vpd on transpiration was β e k 1 v p d k 2 based on eq 4 therefore both α and β had a threshold value between 0 and 1 the thresholds of rswc and vpd were inversely calculated according to the assumption that the individual contributions were 1 α 0 01 and β 0 01 stocker et al 2018 individual contribution of each variable was calculated using αratio α α β and βratio β α β 3 results 3 1 meteorological characteristics and seasonal drought occurrence the asynchronous precipitation and temperature from july to october induced a seasonal drought in this subtropical coniferous plantation annually due to the western pacific subtropical high precipitation significantly decreased during the dry season july to october while the temperature peaked at 29 08 1 09 with daily maximum 33 98 fig 1 a four outlier ais of january 2012 november 2015 december 2015 and january 2016 were 10 43 10 79 11 88 and 8 14 respectively ai of dry season during 2002 to 2018 was significantly less than that of any other season p 0 01 fig 1b specifically mean dry seasonal ai during the study period was 0 93 0 52 with a range from 0 13 to 1 85 in seasonal drought conditions mean rswc sharply decreased and rapidly responded to precipitation while mean atmospheric vpd was relatively high fig 1c ranges of monthly mean rswc during rainy drought and non growing seasons were 0 63 0 71 0 36 0 51 and 0 50 0 55 respectively fig 1c this indicated that there was an insufficient soil water supply and a high atmospheric water demand when plantation was subjected to seasonal drought 3 2 correlations between transpiration and meteorological variables correlation analyses between transpiration and environmental factors at half hourly daily monthly and yearly scales were conducted table 1 transpiration was significantly and positively correlated with atmospheric evaporative demand indicators rn t vpd and pet at half hourly daily and monthly scales p 0 01 and negatively correlated with rh at half hourly p 0 01 daily p 0 01 and monthly p 0 05 scales in comparison transpiration showed a weak correlation with soil water supply indicators swc5 swc20 swc50 rswc deep soil water content swc50 was significantly and positively correlated with transpiration at half hourly scales p 0 01 but significantly and negatively correlated with transpiration at daily scales p 0 01 half hourly and daily transpiration was not significantly correlated with rswcs1 during the rainy season p 0 05 but was significantly and positively correlated with rswcs2 during drought season p 0 01 and significantly and negatively correlated with rswcs3 during non growing season p 0 01 in addition atmospheric vpd was significantly and negatively correlated with rswc at half hourly r 0 20 daily r 0 30 and monthly r 0 36 scales p 0 01 but not correlated at yearly scales r 0 79 p 0 05 atmospheric vpd was significantly and positively correlated with rn at half hourly r 0 50 daily r 0 72 and monthly r 0 89 scales p 0 01 but not at yearly scale r 0 54 p 0 05 3 3 effects of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on transpiration first we investigated the relationship between daily atmospheric vpd and rswc under plant transpiration rates grouped into 0 5 mm d 1 intervals fig 2 generally transpiration was positively correlated with rswc and negatively correlated with atmospheric vpd in each transpiration interval table s3 atmospheric vpd and rswc were significantly and negatively correlated as shown by pearson correlations and linear regressions in each transpiration interval table s3 this negative correlation may confound the independent effects of atmospheric vpd and rswc on transpiration second we investigated the relationships between daily rswc and plant transpiration rate in 0 2 kpa intervals of atmospheric vpd fig 3 the relationship between rswc and transpiration fitted well to an exponential function eq 5 within each vpd interval table s4 especially in the upper ranges ft 4 31 1 exp 9 28 rswc r2 0 82 rmse 0 33 mm d 1 p 0 001 the tvpd in eq 5 increased with the increase in atmospheric vpd and reached a maximum tmax in eq 6 in upper ranges with data reaching the vpd group of 1 3 kpa further the soil moisture threshold inversely calculated from the boundary function was rswc 0 50 and a well watered soil condition existed when rswc was 0 50 finally the relationship between daily atmospheric vpd and plant transpiration rate was investigated under rswc intervals of 0 2 fig 4 the relationship between atmospheric vpd and transpiration fitted well to an exponential function eq 6 in each rswc interval table s5 atmospheric vpd and transpiration within each rswc interval were significantly and positively correlated rswc had a significant effect on transpiration vpd relationship when rswc 0 50 p 0 01 but the effect was not significant when rswc 0 50 p 0 05 contribution of atmospheric vpd to transpiration when rswc 0 50 was fitted with eq 6 tvpd 4 31 1 exp 1 04 vpd 0 13 r2 0 70 rmse 0 57 mm d 1 p 0 001 at the 99 boundary of the maximum transpiration the atmospheric vpd thresholds were inversely calculated from eq 6 to be 4 55 kpa and the intersection of the fitted curve with vpd was 0 13 kpa representing the transpiration rate of zero therefore this function could be used to calculate the independent contribution of atmospheric vpd to transpiration without considering soil moisture furthermore based on the rswc threshold of 0 50 ecosystem transpiration data were divided into two parts fig 2 rswc data below the threshold represented insufficient soil water supply condition and rswc data above the threshold represented well watered soil conditions the number of data points below the threshold accounted for 55 79 of the total numbers indicating that 55 79 of the days during the study period soil moisture was limiting for plant transpiration all daily atmospheric vpd data in this subtropical plantation were lower than the threshold of 4 55 kpa 3 4 simulations of the effects of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on transpiration our multiplicative model eq 4 for the response of transpiration to vpd and rswc was ft 4 31 1 exp 9 28 rswc 1 exp 1 04 vpd 0 13 the linear regression of our multiplicative model result with measured transpiration was fitted transpiration 0 94 measured transpiration r2 0 69 rmse 0 55 mm d 1 p 0 001 when the intercept t was zero fig s2 the multiplicative model overestimated transpiration for actual transpiration values of 0 5 mm day 1 mainly during non growing season november to march fig s1 a both rswc and atmospheric vpd had significant effects on transpiration but their contributions varied greatly at daily fig 5 a and monthly fig 5b scales at a daily timescale contributions of rswc αratio and atmospheric vpd βratio to transpiration ranged from 0 to 86 8 and 13 3 to 100 respectively at a monthly scale αratio and βratio ranged from 0 2 to 39 2 and 60 8 to 99 8 respectively table s6 during the growing season αratio increased from 0 7 in early growing season mar to june to 17 8 in late growing season july to october specifically monthly mean αratio increased sharply from july 10 0 to october 24 9 during non growing seasons november to february αratio and βratio were 4 6 and 95 4 respectively during the whole study period average αratio and βratio were 9 2 and 90 8 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 soil moisture limitation on plant transpiration response to atmospheric vpd using the aridity thresholds characterized by abrupt decrease in plant productivity ai 0 54 soil fertility ai 0 7 and plant cover and richness ai 0 8 berdugo et al 2020 we determined that monthly aridity indexes in the subtropical coniferous plantation in this study exceeded those thresholds account for 13 89 16 67 and 18 06 respectively from april 2012 through december 2017 this indicated that extreme seasonal droughts may be harmful to this plantation it is expected that climate change will increase the area of subtropical drylands in the 21st century huang et al 2015 schlaepfer et al 2017 such changes may aggravate regional and seasonal droughts at globle scale limiting both canopy transpiration and photosynthetic rates due to stomatal closure schlaepfer et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 at our site atmospheric vpd was generally lower than the threshold and served as a driver of ecosystem transpiration but the driving effect diminished with increasing atmospheric vpd fig 4 one reason for this diminishing effect may be stomatal closure several models have shown a negative correlation between atmospheric vpd and gs granier et al 2000 novick et al 2016 oren et al 1999 another reason may be shortage of soil water supply soil moisture controls water supply for plant transpiration in the soil plant atmosphere continuum the imbalances of water supply and demand may directly limit plant transpiration in addition soil moisture often decreases with increasing atmospheric vpd and a considerable soil moisture limitation to plant transpiration can develop han et al 2019 schlaepfer et al 2017 our results showed that daily and monthly soil moisture limitations respectively contributed up to 86 8 and 39 2 to transpiration in our study plantation during the drought season these results indicate that soil moisture had substantial effects on limiting plant transpiration in this subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to drought at daily scale soil moisture and transpiration showed a weak correlation during the whole study period but were significantly and positively related during the drought season table 1 this was mainly due to the asynchronous change of soil moisture and transpiration at half hourly and daily scales and the highly nonlinear relationship between them she et al 2013 in this study increasing vpd did not limit transpiration during drought but instead enhanced transpiration further both transpiration and evaporation in conditions of high vpd rapidly consumed soil water and exacerbated soil drought in drought season the negative correlation between vpd and soil moisture also confirmed this process table 1 therefore the imbalance of water demand and supply may have detrimental effects on tree physiology the effect of soil moisture on transpiration exhibits high variability depending on the degree of drought and vegetation characteristics ewers et al 2002 moshelion et al 2014 for example transpiration in young forests is more prone to be limited by soil moisture due to lower root volume in the soil than in old forests bretfeld et al 2018 isohydric and anisohydric plants also have different responses to water stress moshelion et al 2014 when soil water supply is insufficient it is often accompanied by high atmospheric vpd in which isohydric plants can close their stomata to prevent excessive water loss and anisohydric plants can reduce leaf water content to maintain relative large stomatal aperture konings et al 2017 mcadam and brodribb 2012 mcadam and brodribb 2015 moshelion et al 2014 moshelion et al 2014 concluded that isohydric plants were more easily affected by water stress but had a larger safety margin higher embolism resistance than anisohydric plants konings et al 2017 found that productivity of an anisohydric ecosystem was over three times more sensitive to atmospheric vpd than that of an isohydric ecosystem in the united states grasslands therefore anisohydric behavior of the coniferous forests indicated an aggressive growth strategy mcadam and brodribb 2015 when soil moisture was highly insufficient over long periods anisohydric plants were more vulnerable to mortality than isohydric plants due to irreversible plant xylem embolism and subsequent hydraulic imbalance moshelion et al 2014 restaino et al 2016 because the conifers in our subtropical plantation were anisohydric insufficient soil water supply with a mean αratio of 17 8 6 7 may result in damage to trees subjected to seasonal drought in the late growing season 4 2 contribution of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture to transpiration a quantitative model for the response of plant transpiration to soil water supply and atmospheric water demand is helpful in predicting potential transpiration responses to future climate change our multiplicative model can assess the independent contributions of atmospheric vpd and rswc to transpiration by restricting the boundary and threshold conditions of one of the two variables to determine the performance of our multiplication model a grouping based model for transpiration was also modified and applied fig s2 jiao et al 2019 li et al 2016 with one modification that of using rswc standardized according to the maximum and minimum swc instead of rew standardized according to field water capacity and wilting point because swc in our study forest was significantly higher than the wilting point 0 10 m3 m 3 in all measured soil layers p 0 01 the result of grouping based model was ft 0 0056 pet2 0 4087 pet 1 exp 9 28 rswc the linear regression between the simulated and measured transpiration was fitted transpiration 0 94 measured transpiration r2 0 64 rmse 0 58 mm d 1 p 0 001 fig s2 the performance of grouping based model in our subtropical coniferous plantation was better than that in a black locust plantation of the loess plateau jiao et al 2019 but inferior to our multiplicative model more importantly grouping based model could not quantify the relative contributions of the independent variables limiting transpiration restricting the ability to disentangle the independent effects of various drivers on ecosystem transpiration jiao et al 2019 novick et al 2016 our model mainly focused on water supply and demand relationships in plant transpiration in the soil plant atmosphere continuum but did not consider other environment factors like radiation ta and rh for example the effect of radiation on the negative correlation between gs and vpd had been confirmed granier et al 2000 and photosynthetic net radiation also had a negative effect on the lag time between atmospheric vpd and transpiration zhang et al 2018 the consumption of available radiation energy as sensible heat flux raises temperature and atmospheric vpd therefore we used atmospheric vpd as a comprehensive index of atmospheric water demand further revision and applicable analyses are critical when using a multiplicative model for other plants this is due to the different water consumption strategies of isohydric and anisohydric plants moshelion et al 2014 for example she et al 2012 used a linear equation to describe the relationships between transpiration in c korshinskii and relative extractable soil water in the loess plateau chang et al 2014 found that the relationship between transpiration and soil moisture exhibited a logistic type for picea crassifolia in the heihe river basin of china hence fitting by species is helpful for improving the accuracy of a multiplicative model in mixed species forest forrester et al 2016 however excluding plant growing characteristics will result in the increasing uncertainty in this study the multiplicative model notably overestimated transpiration for its values 0 5 mm d 1 which mainly occurred in non growing seasons figs s1 and s2 additional plants characteristics including stomatal conductance mcadam and brodribb 2012 leaf water potential feng et al 2017 leaf hydraulic conductance kleaf moshelion et al 2014 leaf area index lai igarashi et al 2015 lin et al 2018 and root water permeability maurel et al 2010 yu et al 2018 may need to be incorporated into the multiplicative model to further increasing accuracy 5 conclusions in this study sap flow of dominant tree species was measured from april 2012 through december 2017 in a subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to seasonal drought and the response of plant transpiration to atmospheric water demand and soil water supply was investigated our results showed that soil moisture had a significant effect on the response of transpiration to atmospheric vpd in this subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to seasonal drought our multiplicative model performed well and quantified the independent effects of atmospheric vpd and soil moisture on transpiration the response of transpiration to vpd or soil moisture was best described by exponential functions monthly mean soil moisture contributed 17 8 6 7 of the effects on maximum transpiration with a maximum daily contribution of 86 8 when seasonal drought occurred during july to october our results suggest that the effects of soil moisture on transpiration will increase for subtropical coniferous plantation subjected to intensified seasonal drought with global climate change credit authorship contribution statement xianwei song

5051,the phospholipid fatty acids plfa and dissolved organic matter dom 3d fluorescent signatures were appointed to elaborate arsenic as mobilization mechanism in groundwater from the datong basin groundwater samples were collected along the groundwater flow path from recharge zones to discharge zones according to redox sensitive parameters variations of eh no3 and so4 2 manifested the redox condition shifted from a weakly oxidative environment to highly reductive environment in recharge zones some aerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species such as thiothrix s oxidizing bacteria sob gallionella fe oxidizing bacteria feob and fluviicola characterized by 16 1ω7 16 0 and 18 1ω7 plfas the biogeochemical processes were mainly governed by aerobic bacteria exploiting protein like dom as electron donors to maintain metabolism together with depleting of o2 and no3 electron acceptors which restricted the reduction of as while in discharge zones the anaerobic microbes played a predominant role such as desulfosporosinus sulfate reducing bacteria srb and clostridia fe reducing bacteria ferb indicated by cy17 0 cy19 0 and 18 1ω9 plfas srb and ferb mainly utilized protein like dom as energy sources for respiratory action simultaneously biogenic reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 resulted in geogenic immobilized as reductive desorption into aquifers the positive linear correlations between humic substances and fe as suggested that as fe dom complexation can enhance the transport of as and fe in aqueous environments the negative relationships between srb ferb and as fe concentrations demonstrated that the hs could react with fe ii and as iii to form secondary fe ii sulfides or as bearing sulfides which subsequently sequestered as from groundwater via sorption or coprecipitation in conclusion the utilization of biodegradable protein like dom by srb ferb being associated with reductive dissolution of as bearing fe hydr oxides minerals and as fe dom complexation promoted as mobility in groundwater aquifers keywords arsenic phospholipid fatty acids plfa 3d fluorescence microbial communities dissolved organic matter 1 introduction high concentrations of arsenic as in groundwater has become a public issue that cannot be ignored worldwide which has attracted global attention and extensive research in recent years fendorf et al 2010 he and charlet 2013 guo et al 2014 ghosh et al 2015b datong basin typically enriched with geogenic inorganic as has brought about acute endemic as poisoning and vascular diseases of local residents due to long term ingestion of high as groundwater xie et al 2014 the concentration of dissolved as that has been detected in the groundwater at datong is up to 1820 μg l xie et al 2008 in this arid and semi arid region the groundwater is the main source of drinking water hence to mitigate the as risk and ensure a safe groundwater supply it is essential to understand the processes that cause the as enrichment in groundwater from datong arsenic in minerals and rocks is generally poorly mobile whereas under the biotic and abiotic processes as may be affected to convert into dissolved phase and enter the groundwater notably numerous studies have revealed that microbial activities play a crucial role in release and transport of as mainly affecting the courses of as adsorption and desorption as well as redox reactions mirza et al 2014 gorny et al 2015 guo et al 2015 xie et al 2018 until now microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides driven by the availability of labile organic carbon has been widely accepted as the dominant control on as mobilization in reducing aquifers from bangladesh cambodia west bengal india vietnam and north china pederick et al 2007 ohtsuka et al 2013 deng et al 2018 dissolved organic matter dom provides electron donors impacting redox conditions and mobilization of nutrients or diffusion of microbial exo enzymes into the surrounding environment ghosh et al 2015a consequently variations in dom composition have an effect on sub surface biogeochemical processes by governing the dynamics of phylogenetically diverse microbial communities judd et al 2006 for the sake of quantitatively measuring the dom composition 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems and fluorescence regional integration fri technique have been widely used due to its simplicity and sensitivity marhuenda egea et al 2007 kulkarni et al 2017 the phospholipid fatty acids plfas forming a major part of the bacterial cell membranes are regarded to be indicators of living bacterial communities on account of their rapid degradation after cell death plfas can provide a quantitative measure of the viable biomass and biological diversity of microbial communities frostegård et al 1993 lanekoff and karlsson 2010 specific plfas biomarkers and plfas structural patterns like fingerprints to identify the microbial groups and diversity under different conditions within an immediate functioning ecosystem without the bias associated with cultivation willers et al 2015a in past several years methods based on nucleic acid extraction and analyses have been preferred to plfa analysis for studying microbial communities somenahally et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 however plfa still holds some advantages above other methods and may even be more sensitive in probing shifts in the microbial community structure when compared to nucleic acid methods ramsey et al 2006 willers et al 2015a in the present study we determined the plfas biomarkers dom components and hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater from the datong basin to elaborate the following objectives 1 ascertaining the structures of microbial communities and dom ascribed to as mobilization in different redox zones 2 illuminating the effects of biogeochemical processes on as behavior in aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area datong basin is situated in an arid and semi arid region of shanxi province northwestern china fig 1 with an area of approximately 60000 km2 the area has a mean annual rainfall of 300 400 mm and a very high mean evaporation rate of about 2000 mm per year almost 80 of rainfall appears from july to august xie et al 2015 owing to extensive evaporation and high groundwater table saline soil is widely distributed in this region ephemeral sanggan river and its tributaries are the prime surface water bodies the basin is surrounded by hengshan mountains guancen mountains and hongshou mountains in the southeast west and northwest respectively bedrock around the basin originates from archean to the cretaceous gneiss of archean shuanggan group and limestone of sinian period outcrop in the north of the basin while gneiss and basalt of the hengshan segment of wutai group of archean in the south guo and wang 2005 in the western margin of the basin the quaternary aquifer is overlaid with cambrian and ordovician limestone and younger sedimentary strata while the fractured archaean metamorphic rocks in the east margin xie et al 2013b pliocene to pleistocene unconsolidated sediments with thickness of 2000 m have accumulated in the basin normally the grain size of the sediment decreases from the margins to the basin center the sediment types beneath the central part of the basin are mainly lacustrine and alluvial lacustrine sandy loam silt silty clay and clay abundant in organic carbon guo and wang 2005 the groundwater flow systems have low permeability and less hydraulic gradient alluvial fluvial gravel and coarse sand form the riverbanks and occur beneath the basin margins wang et al 2009 in general the datong quaternary aquifer systems can be basically divided into two major groundwater systems one is the shallow flow system composed by coarse sand and gravel whose upper and lower boundaries range from 5 m to 60 m below the land surface the other one is semi confined deep aquifer consisting of sand and sandy gravel which prominently occur at the depths of 60 150 m xie et al 2009 moreover two flow regimes can be observed at datong basin 1 flow from margins of mountain front areas to the basin center 2 flow inside the basin along the direction of the river from southwest to northeast zhang et al 2017 groundwater is mainly recharged by vertically infiltrating meteoric water laterally penetrating fracture water in bedrock along the basin margins li et al 2014a and by leakage from non perennial rivers as well as irrigation return flow wang et al 2009 discharge occurs mainly via evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction 2 2 sampling and field procedures according to the recharge and discharge zones groundwater samples were collected for hydrochemical dissolved organic matter dom and phospholipid fatty acids plfas analyses from the datong basin the spatial distribution of sampling sites is displayed in fig 1 groundwater in each well was purged for 5 10 min with a peristaltic pump before collecting the physical and chemical parameters including ph electrical conductivity ec redox potential eh and temperature were measured in the field with the multi parameter portable meter hach hq40d calibrated before use redox sensitive parameters such as fe ii hs and nh4 concentrations were tested on site using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr2800 alkalinity was determined using gran titration within 24 h the samples for cations and anions analysis were filtered on site using 0 45 μm mixed cellulose esters millipore filters and stored in pre cleaned 50 ml polypropylene bottles acidified to ph 2 with 6 mol l ultra pure hno3 for cations measurement one bottle of each sample was left unacidified for anion determination samples for as analysis were also filtered acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure 12 mol l hcl samples for dom analysis were collected in 20 ml amber glass bottles after being filtered samples for plfa analysis were collected in 4 l amber glass bottles all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark before transferring to laboratory 2 3 laboratory measurements 2 3 1 hydrochemical analysis the major cations k ca na mg concentrations in the groundwater samples were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo elemental anions including cl so4 2 no3 concentrations were analyzed by ion chromatography ic dx 120 dionex the trace metal fe concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkin elmer elan drc e the total dissolved as was determined by hg afs afs 9130 titan random duplicates of all the cation and anion analyses were below 5 and the field and laboratory blanks were below detection limits for all the species 2 3 2 3d fluorescence analysis before fluorescence analysis was performed the dissolved organic carbon doc contents of all groundwater samples were determined using a high temperature catalytic combustion method with a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu producing data with a standard deviation of 2 fluorescene excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems was performed on each sample using a luminescence spectrometer f 4500 hitachi at room temperature 25 c filtered water samples were scanned from 200 to 500 nm excitation at 5 nm intervals and from 300 to 600 nm emission at 2 nm intervals following the method described by stedmon et al 2003 the slit widths were set at 10 nm for both excitation and emission monochromators and the scan speed was set at 1200 nm min fluorescence regional integration fri technique has the usage of quantitatively analyzing eems and ascertaining the configuration and heterogeneity of dom he et al 2011 before integrating regions of the eems that contained limited information low fluorescence were removed simultaneously the first and second order rayleigh and raman scattering should be modified using interpolation bahram et al 2006 the fri technique was developed to integrate the area beneath eems the eems of dom were divided into five consecutive regions i e i ii iii iv and v were 200 250 300 330 nm 200 250 330 380 200 250 380 600 250 500 300 380 and 250 500 380 600 nm respectively the volume beneath region i φ i was calculated with φ i ex em i λ ex λ em δ λ ex δ λ em i i v φ i was the volume of region i i λex λem was the fluorescence intensity at the excitation wavelength λex and emission wavelength λem λex and λem were the excitation wavelength increment and emission wavelength increment respectively the percentage of the volume of region i was calculated as follows φ i n m f i φ i φ t n i 1 5 φ i n p i n φ i n φ t n 100 mfi was a multiplication factor for each region equal to the inverse of the fractional projected excitation emission area in order to normalize φ i to relative regional areas chen et al 2003 φ t n was the sum of the volume of all five regions and pi n was the percentage of the volume of region i tables s2 s3 2 3 3 plfas assay the determination of phospholipid fatty acid concentrations in groundwater samples was performed using the modified bligh dyer method willers et al 2015a specific steps were as follows 1 extraction lipids were extracted with chloroform chcl3 on separating funnels which can separate mixed phases the filter organic phase was dried down with n2 and stored at 20 c 2 fractionation the lipid extract was resuspended in chloroform and transferred to a silica gel column spe c18 3 ml previously dehydrated and activated with chcl3 then neutral lipids glycolipids and phospholipid fatty acids were eluted with chloroform acetone and methanol respectively the phospholipid fraction was collected in a clean tube purged with nitrogen and stored at 20 c 3 methyl esterification the solvent was resuspended in a mixture of toluene methanol 1 1 v v and added methylated koh then we rotated the mixture for 30 s incubating at 37 c for 15 min methyl esterification reaction after the sample returned to room temperature ice cold acetic acid was added to adjust the ph to neutral then an equal volume of n hexane and deionized water were added the sample was rotated for 30 s centrifuged for 5 min and the organic phase was transferred to another clean tube the upper aqueous phase was extracted twice with n hexane finally the solvent was dried down with n2 and stored at 20 c 4 the sample were dissolved with n hexane and transferred to the gc vial for analysis the external standard was bacterial acid methyl esters mixture sigma catalog no 47080 u additionally the analytical error was within 5 and the blank sample was mostly below the detection limit or the value was rejected in the results plfas were quantified in a gas chromatography and mass spectrometry gc ms 7000gcms us1702u402 with a nonpolar capillary column hp 5 ms 15 m 250 μm 0 25 μm the initial column temperature was maintained at 80 c for 2 min then ramped to 150 c at a rate of 50 c min and then raised to 195 c at 2 5 c min which remained constant for 3 min before increasing to 215 c the identification quantification and nomenclature of plfas were in accordance with the method proposed by macnaughton et al 1999 plfas including 11 0 12 0 13 0 14 0 15 0 16 0 17 0 18 0 19 0 and 20 0 were used as an indicator of general bacteria while 18 2ω9 was used as indicator of fungi willers et al 2015b as for gram negative gram bacteria 16 1ω9c cy17 0 cy19 0 and 18 1ω9 were biomarkers li et al 2010 breulmann et al 2014 plfas specific for gram positive gram bacteria included i15 0 a15 0 i16 0 and i17 0 igalavithana et al 2017 2 4 statistical analyses spatial mapping of sampling sites was conducted using arcgis 10 5 software environmental systems research institute ca statistical analyses including correlation analysis t tests fluorescence regional integration fri analysis and principal components analysis pca were performed on the origin 2016 software microcal software inc northampton ma the canonical correspondence analysis cca was established using matlab r2015b mathworks inc us differences were deemed statistically significant when the level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 general hydrochemistry the physiochemical parameters of groundwater samples are exhibited in table 1 na was the major cation in the study area with ranges between 10 5 and 374 mg l average 126 mg l while the ranges of ca2 and mg2 concentrations were from 5 60 to 111 mg l average 40 8 mg l and from 18 3 to 63 1 mg l average 35 0 mg l respectively anions were dominated by hco3 130 325 mg l followed by so4 2 3 38 249 mg l and cl 9 74 138 mg l along the groundwater flow paths redox potentials eh decreased gradually varying from 118 to 181 mv indicating the groundwater shifted from oxidizing to reducing environment in discharge zones no3 concentrations were almost below the detection limit while relatively higher in recharge zones average 12 5 mg l similar to so4 2 concentrations additionally nh4 and hs concentrations normally increased from piedmont plain 0 12 0 60 mg l 13 0 27 0 μg l to the center of the basin 0 50 1 70 mg l 15 0 74 0 μg l the total dissolved concentrations of as increased apparently ranging from 0 03 to 1080 μg l notably in discharge zones the as concentrations in samples average 424 μg l exceeded the who guideline limit value 10 μg l for drinking water pi et al 2015 the as concentrations in recharge zones were usually low with the average value of 2 88 μg l the correlation of as concentrations with those of ph eh nitrate and sulfate is shown in fig 2 it can be seen that ph of all groundwater samples were near neutral to alkalescent 7 97 8 66 whereas eh values were commonly low in the discharge zone average 110 mv moreover as concentrations increased with the decrease in nitrate and sulfate suggesting that as enrichment occurred in reducing conditions of the aquifer systems 3 2 characteristics of dom fluorescence in discharge zones doc concentrations ranged from 3 28 to 5 93 mg l average 4 77 mg l higher than recharge zones average 1 53 mg l maximum 1 85 mg l in this study eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize dom in groundwater figs s1 s2 eem peaks are associated with tyrosine like type i tryptophan like type ii and soluble microbial by product like type iv originated from protein like dom and phenolic compounds fulvic acid like type iii and humic acid like type v belong to humic substances he et al 2013 the distribution of fluorescence intensities from discharge zones were similar showing one peak in type iii moreover the fluorescence intensities of type iii and v were higher than other types compared with basin center groundwater samples of recharge zones revealed more peaks in type i ii and iv therefore the results demonstrated that more humic substances were present in high as groundwater the five dom components identified by the fri analysis are presented in fig 3 obviously the percentages of type i ii and iv in recharge zones were higher than discharge zones ranged between 29 7 and 79 3 average 55 2 meantime the relative contents of type iii and v had a range from 59 7 to 67 6 average 64 3 in discharge zones constituting the main dom components the above results also revealed that from recharge zones to discharge zones the percentage of protein like dom reduced whereas humic substances enhanced indicating the concentration of humic substances were high in the central part of the basin liu et al 2020 3 3 profiles of plfas extracted from groundwater in the current study 20 plfas were identified as microbial based plfas and applied to characterize the microbial communities in each groundwater sample table 2 it is evident that all of the 20 plfas were found in recharge zone and discharge zone among the four microbial communities general bacteria and gram negative bacteria were dominant groups whereas the ratios of gram positive bacteria and fungi were less the profiles of plfas were determined by principle component analysis pca pc1 and pc2 accounted for 78 91 and 17 25 of the variance respectively fig 4 factor loading values were the projection of plfas on the corresponding ordination axis the values demonstrated that 16 0 and 18 0 had a strong positive relationship with pc1 which showed general bacteria were positive to pc1 these general fatty acids may be used as a criterion for the examination of biofilm production salomonová et al 2003 the 16 1ω9 and cy17 0 had good correlation with pc2 which manifested gram negative bacteria were positive to pc2 there were some specific plfas as well indicating the presence of specific organisms cyclopropyl saturated fatty acids cy17 0 and cy19 0 were typical for sulfate reducing bacteria srb desulfosporosinus and anaerobic bacteria fang et al 2006 zhou et al 2009 srb are often found in anaerobic aquifers using so4 2 as a terminal electron acceptor oleic acid 18 1ω9 was a plfa marker of clostridia which represented fe reducing bacteria park et al 2001 akai et al 2008 clostridia were gram positive endospore formers obligatory anaerobes in spite of a wide o2 tolerance ferb can utilize iron oxides as electron acceptors and lead to the reduction of ferric hydr oxides and release of as iii to the aqueous phase under anoxic conditions tufano and fendorf 2008 li et al 2015 polyunsaturated fatty acid 18 2ω9 was identified to represent fungal populations willers et al 2015b 4 discussion it has been widely accepted that the main driver for as mobilization is the decomposition of labile dissolved organic matter doc pi et al 2015 majumder et al 2016 schittich et al 2018 the correlation between doc and hco3 is quite positive p 0 01 r 0 68 fig 5 a the high doc concentrations were mainly derived from natural organic matter nom rich in the sediments pi et al 2015 based on the evidence from carbon isotope biogenic carbon was the most important contributor to the dissolved inorganic carbon in the groundwater xie et al 2013a the process of biodegradation of dom generated co2 which stimulated the dissolution of carbonate minerals to increase the hco3 concentrations meanwhile bacterial respiration could also produce co2 moreover doc and as concentrations obviously increased from the recharge zones to the discharge zones they were in good correlation as well p 0 001 r 0 75 fig 5b which may attribute to the impact of microbes majumder et al 2016 sedimentary nom from peat layers and surface derived organic carbon could act as a autochthonous energy source for the metabolism of microbes which caused reducing conditions in the aquifer and subsequently promoted the dissolution of as bearing fe hydr oxides to release as into groundwater cozzarelli et al 2016 besides arsenic oxyanions might be desorbed into groundwater under the competitive sorption effect of hco3 xie et al 2008 4 1 biogeochemical processes in recharge zones the recharge zones are adjacent to the piedmont plain mainly phreatic aquifers where the thickness of the aquifers is larger than the central part of the basin the piedmont sediments are mostly alluvial fluvial gravel and coarse sand wang et al 2009 xie et al 2013b as a result more atmospheric oxygen can diffuse into aqueous phase easily via the air filled pore spaces furthermore the velocity of groundwater movements is relatively faster giving rise to a rapid exchange rate of o2 xie et al 2009 the average value of ph eh and as were 8 13 94 74 mv and 2 88 μg l respectively forming a weakly alkaline and oxidative environment hence some aerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species in this area such as thiothrix gallionella and fluviicola zhang et al 2017 the 16 1ω7 16 0 and 18 1ω7 fas were the major cell membrane fatty acids of these species jacq et al 1989 sahl et al 2008 which need to consume o2 to assist their growth in aquifers microbes utilized organic carbon as electron donors to metabolize and dissolved inorganic carbon accumulated slowly along aquifer flow paths wang et al 2019 the available electron acceptors were consumed sequentially in the order o2 no3 fe iii so4 2 co2 chapelle 2000 the effects of selected environmental variables on the biomass of microorganisms across the recharge zones were summarized through canonical correspondence analysis cca fig 6 a bacterial biomass was positively correlated to protein like dom while negatively correlated to no3 concentrations the arrow length of no3 was longer than so4 2 from fig 6b no3 concentrations showed a downward trend with protein like dom if the sample in the dashed ellipse was excluded a good negative linear correlation p 0 01 r 0 84 can be obtained the excluded sample w5 was located in runoff areas with far higher abundance of humic substances 70 3 not only that aerobic bacteria abundance was also higher than other sites implying that bacteria might use some biodegradable humic like dom after oxidizing protein like dom nevertheless from the whole trend it can be seen that aerobic bacteria mainly consumed no3 to act as an electron acceptor and protein like dom were served as electron donors so as to maintain the metabolism of bacteria in recharge zones the thiothrix and gallionella belong to s oxidizing bacteria sob and fe oxidizing bacteria feob respectively lerm et al 2011 which generally deplete no3 as an electron acceptor in respiratory action additionally feob could oxidize fe ii and reduce no3 in a redox reaction where fe ii was regarded as an electron donor after feob oxidized fe ii bacteriogenic fe oxides precipitated in aqueous phase and over time the precipitation might attenuate as from surrounding groundwater in a weakly alkaline and oxidative environment the primary biogeochemical process was aerobic bacteria exploited protein like dom as electron donors together with depleting of o2 and no3 electron acceptors this would limit the reduction of fe iii and as v thereby inhibiting as mobilization in groundwater the reactions are as follows 1 ch3coo o2 h 2hco3 2 5ch3coo 8no3 3h 4n2 4h2o 10hco3 4 2 biogeochemical processes in discharge zones the discharge zones are located in the central part of the datong basin as a result of arid semi arid climate stagnant hydrogeological setting and closed semi closed geochemical environment in the basin center aquifers were in anoxic condition with highest concentrations of as guo et al 2003 the eh value ranged from 181 to 4 90 mv with average of 55 38 mv indicating a reducing environment the groundwater reduction stage can roughly be divided into oxic post oxic sulfidic and methanogenic environment berner 1981 in oxic condition o2 and no3 are predominant in aquifers when it converts to reduction the reduction of o2 no3 first occurs followed by the reduction of as v and fe iii li et al 2014b with the diminution of redox potential so4 2 would be reduced at last co2 would be reduced to ch4 jia et al 2014 albeit redox processes strongly influenced the mobilization and enrichment of as the effect of microbial communities cannot be neglected which was closely related to these redox processes paul et al 2015 because of the alteration of redox conditions the microbial communities in groundwater were likely to change furthermore the increment of doc concentrations might also cause the alterations in microbial processing of dom and the structure of bacterial communities in discharge zones therefore some anerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species in this region such as desulfosporosinus srb clostridia ferb and acinetobacter the relative abundance of ferb ranged from 8 11 to 22 14 with average of 13 07 higher than srb 5 04 10 11 the cy17 0 cy19 0 and 18 1ω9 fas were indicative of these species which mainly capitalized on fe iii as v and so4 2 as electron acceptors to produce fe ii as iii and hs wang et al 2017b fan et al 2018 in bangladesh the clostridium plfa 18 1ω9c has been also observed in as rich region and the presence of clostridia could mediate fe reduction akai et al 2008 similarly the predominant phospholipids composition contained 18 1ω9 in bengal delta plain aquifers which indicated the microbes participated in fe reduction reactions correlated to as biogeochemical cycling ghosh et al 2017 ghosh et al 2018 the cy17 0 and cy19 0 fas showed high relative abundance in arsenic treated samples from miasteczko śląskie transect in poland azarbad et al 2016 notably the plfa marker was a posteriori method indicating there was cy17 0 because there was srb not a posteriori method suggesting there was srb because there was cy17 0 as with other plfa markers akai et al 2008 the relative contents of plfas present in the groundwater appeared discrepancies indicating the variation in the lipid contributing communities microbial reduction activities required a supply of dissolved organic carbon when the biological oxygen demand from the degradation of organic carbon exceeded the rate of oxygen infusion anaerobic metabolism prevailed and following nitrate reduction led to microbially mediated reduction of fe iii to fe ii as v to as iii as well as so4 2 to hs polizzotto et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 4 2 1 controls of dom on as mobility the effects of selected hydrochemical parameters on the biomass of four microbial communities across discharge zones were summarized via cca fig 7 the results indicated that protein like dom positively affected the dominant anaerobic microbes srb ferb biomass and proportion fig 8 a and arrow directions of humic substances and as were similar in general protein like dom with low molecular weight 1000 da were labile bioactive and readily utilized for microbial metabolism brailsford et al 2017 thereby catalyzing microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 the reactions are as follows 3 ch3coo 8fe oh 3 15h 8fe2 20h2o 2hco3 4 ch3coo 4aso4 3 4aso3 3 2hco3 h 5 ch3coo so4 2 hs 2hco3 humic substances hs with high molecular weight 1000 da maybe recalcitrant to microbial breakdown kujawinski 2011 along the groundwater flow path the relative concentrations of hs obviously increased the nonbiodegradable hs released from peat in sediments or other dispersed sedimentary organic matter in the aquifer has accumulated under the sluggish groundwater flow in basin center xie et al 2012 however high proportion of hs may interact and enhance the transport of as and fe in aqueous environments fig 8b in the discharge zones as and fe concentrations increased with hs proportion humic and fulvic acids are unique anionic polyelectrolyte at neutral ph they may exist as soluble and absorbable patterns in aquatic environments often coated on mineral surfaces ko et al 2004 on account of its high content of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxylic phenolic enolic and alcholic groups hs were capable of complexing with metals fe and metalloids as to form ternary complexes as fe hs or binary complexes as hs in absence of fe kulkarni 2016 li et al 2019 these complexes were freely soluble in neutral and weakly alkaline liquid affecting the fate and transport of as additionally with negatively charged functional groups hs might produce a higher adsorption affinity for fe oxides causing as to desorb from iron minerals and preventing as from adsorbing onto humic coated fe oxides liu et al 2011 schittich et al 2018 besides dissolved hs were capable of shuttling electrons from a wide range of microorganism to electron acceptors such as fe iii accelerating the mobilization of as in aquifers chen et al 2017 kulkarni et al 2018 4 2 2 roles of srb ferb in as transport the sulfate reducing bacteria srb can apply multiple electron acceptors for energy preservation comprised of as v fe iii and so4 2 oremland and stolz 2005 deng et al 2018 on the grounds of redox sequence srb would initially transform as v to as iii fan et al 2018 followed by the reduction of reactive fe iii in the amorphous iron hydr oxide minerals finally the consumption of so4 2 under the interference of srb and dom the reductive dissolution of as bonding fe iii hydr oxides might contribute to the release of structurally coprecipitated or surface adsorbed as into aquatic phase in discharge zones simultaneously biogenic sulfides the reduzate of so4 2 had potential to stimulate the reduction of as v to as iii rochette et al 2000 wang et al 2017a if reactive fe iii minerals such as ferrihydrite were present free sulfides also reductively reacted with them abiotically which generated fe ii and zero valent sulfur probably existed lesser quantity of thiosulfate sun et al 2016 the equations eqs are as follows 6 hs aso4 3 h s0 aso3 3 h2o 7 hs 2fe oh 3 5h 2fe2 s0 6h2o moreover sulfide induced as thiolation in groundwater was capable of producing thioarsenic species stable under anoxic environments pi et al 2018 which promoted the solubility and mobility of as due to their weaker adsorptive affinity of fe minerals than arsenate and arsenite in discharge zones fe reducing bacteria ferb might also serve as the agents catalyzing the reduction of fe hydr oxides and liberating as into aquifers under anaerobic conditions which mainly utilized protein like dom as electron donors for energy conserving respiratory processes clostridia did not perform dissimilatory so4 2 reduction however fe reducing and as reducing clostridia were known such as clostridium beijerinckii dobbin et al 1999 clostridium butyricum park et al 2001 and clostridium sp strain ohilas stolz et al 2007 the detoxification and energy preserving respiratory might be the major pathways for reducing as v similarly qiao et al 2018 applied pcr analysis to find clostridia played a critical role in fe iii reduction with the addition of biochar to promote as mobility and release from arsenic contaminated paddy soil in bangladesh fe iii as v reduction may not be directly related to electron transport and could be mediated only indirectly with h2 produced via fermentation by clostridia akai et al 2008 it has been also found that ferb accounted for significant proportion of the total microbial communities in jianghan plain where clostridia could reduce soluble fe iii or amorphous fe hydr oxides coupled with the oxidation of doc to simulate the mobilization of as deng et al 2018 therefore the biogenic reductive dissolution of as bearing fe hydr oxides minerals in conjunction with reductive desorption of arsenate would be responsible for high as in discharge zones on the other hand microbial respiration could also indirectly affect the speciation of as and fe via changes in sorption and precipitation equilibria together with solid solution partitioning of metal binding dom thomas et al 2010 which might restrict the mobilization and enrichment of as in the aquifers the palpable negative relationships between srb ferb and as fe concentrations are depicted in fig 9 due to bioactivity of srb and ferb sulfate was reduced to sulfide which could precipitate as as sulfide phases including realgar ass orpiment as2s3 and arsenopyrite feass when their concentrations reached to precipitation equilibria burton et al 2014 these newly formed precipitates would retard as mobility in anoxic environments direct reduction of fe iii by microorganisms might destroy the unstable ternary complexes as fe dom or binary complexes fe dom subsequently lead to as sequestration by sorption or coprecipitation of as onto secondary fe minerals which contained pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes greigite fe3s4 and siderite feco3 through such processes dissolved as would be constrained to release into groundwater even be immobilized under some conditions majumder et al 2014 eqs 8 and 9 described the formation of fesn and as2s3 8 fe2 nhs fesn nh 9 2as3 3hs as2s3 3h it is also worth noticing that the biogeochemical processes of reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides were at a faster rate than the as re sequestration from aquifers by fe as sulfide minerals furthermore as a result of the limited dissolved fe removal of as by precipitation with fe minerals was not significant eventually the enrichment and mobilization of as in groundwater were observed from discharge zones according to the above discussion a conceptual model can be put forward to demonstrate the complex biogeochemical processes on as behavior in aquifers fig 10 in recharge zones aerobic bacteria mainly consumed o2 and no3 as electron acceptors by utilizing protein like dom which inhibited fe iii and as v reduction reaction however in discharge zones the anaerobic microbes might play a dominant role the presence of protein like dom promoting srb and ferb respiration led to as enrichment in aquifers via microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 meanwhile high proportions of humic substances could contribute to the complexation between as fe and dom resulting in as mobility in high as groundwater microbial reduction of sulfate resulted the formation of fesn or as2s3 which subsequently removed as from liquid phase via sorption or coprecipitation 4 3 the stress of as on microbial communities in aquifers it is notable that microbial communities can not only affect as enrichment in aquifers but also be impacted by as stress in discharge zones the ratio of total saturated to total unsaturated plfas sat unsat ratio was utilized as an indicator of nutritional stress in bacterial communities and nutrient availability breulmann et al 2014 the toxic as was regard as an external stress factor for microbial communities vetter et al 2012 igalavithana et al 2017 with the growth of as concentrations sat unsat ratios was increasing ranged from 1 73 to 4 62 fig 11 the changes resulted in decrease in membrane fluidity and permeability which enhanced the stability and rigidity of membranes it was recognized that the membrane fluidity could be regulated by saturated unsaturated and branched plfas variations in response to environmental stress it could diminish the proton channels and other transporter proteins binding the membrane ghosh et al 2018 a high degree of saturation decreased the susceptibility of fatty acids to free radicals markowicz et al 2010 moreover the conversion of monounsaturated to cyclopropane fatty acids may protect cells from chemical destruction at the site of unsaturation in consequence the improvement of fatty acids saturation in membranes exposed to as could be symbolized as bacterial cell defense geared towards reducing the damage induced by oxidative radicals produced from as in summary the sat unsat ratio of plfas can be exerted to characterize microbial adaptative mechanisms on heavy metals or metalloids 5 conclusion at the basin scale hydrochemical evolution gradually changed from the margin areas recharge zones to the center of the basin discharge zones as and doc concentrations increased with the decrease in eh nitrate and sulfate concentrations indicating more reducing aquifers occurred in discharge zones in recharge zones some aerobic bacteria such as thiothrix gallionella and fluviicola were the dominant species utilizing protein like dom as electron donors for metabolism simultaneously o2 and no3 were consumed as the major electron acceptors as for discharge zones anerobic bacteria may serve as the preponderant species such as desulfosporosinus srb and clostridia ferb low molecular weight protein like dom could also act as energy sources for the respiration of anaerobic bacteria promoting microbially mediated reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 high proportions of humic substances can complex with as and fe enhancing as mobility the production hs was a reducing agent for fe oxides hydroxides abiotically expediting the release of the bound arsenic to the groundwater on the other hand as would be incorporated with fe ii sulfides which more possibly appeared in the elevation of as in aqueous phase without doubt microbial communities and as can influence each other in aquifers this study gained insights into the mechanisms that different microbial communities and dom components affected the mobility and enrichment of as in shallow groundwater to the best of our knowledge this is the first report using plfas analysis coupled with dom 3d fluorescence to elucidate the complex biogeochemical processes in the datong basin northwestern china credit authorship contribution statement lu yan conceptualization investigation

5051,the phospholipid fatty acids plfa and dissolved organic matter dom 3d fluorescent signatures were appointed to elaborate arsenic as mobilization mechanism in groundwater from the datong basin groundwater samples were collected along the groundwater flow path from recharge zones to discharge zones according to redox sensitive parameters variations of eh no3 and so4 2 manifested the redox condition shifted from a weakly oxidative environment to highly reductive environment in recharge zones some aerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species such as thiothrix s oxidizing bacteria sob gallionella fe oxidizing bacteria feob and fluviicola characterized by 16 1ω7 16 0 and 18 1ω7 plfas the biogeochemical processes were mainly governed by aerobic bacteria exploiting protein like dom as electron donors to maintain metabolism together with depleting of o2 and no3 electron acceptors which restricted the reduction of as while in discharge zones the anaerobic microbes played a predominant role such as desulfosporosinus sulfate reducing bacteria srb and clostridia fe reducing bacteria ferb indicated by cy17 0 cy19 0 and 18 1ω9 plfas srb and ferb mainly utilized protein like dom as energy sources for respiratory action simultaneously biogenic reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 resulted in geogenic immobilized as reductive desorption into aquifers the positive linear correlations between humic substances and fe as suggested that as fe dom complexation can enhance the transport of as and fe in aqueous environments the negative relationships between srb ferb and as fe concentrations demonstrated that the hs could react with fe ii and as iii to form secondary fe ii sulfides or as bearing sulfides which subsequently sequestered as from groundwater via sorption or coprecipitation in conclusion the utilization of biodegradable protein like dom by srb ferb being associated with reductive dissolution of as bearing fe hydr oxides minerals and as fe dom complexation promoted as mobility in groundwater aquifers keywords arsenic phospholipid fatty acids plfa 3d fluorescence microbial communities dissolved organic matter 1 introduction high concentrations of arsenic as in groundwater has become a public issue that cannot be ignored worldwide which has attracted global attention and extensive research in recent years fendorf et al 2010 he and charlet 2013 guo et al 2014 ghosh et al 2015b datong basin typically enriched with geogenic inorganic as has brought about acute endemic as poisoning and vascular diseases of local residents due to long term ingestion of high as groundwater xie et al 2014 the concentration of dissolved as that has been detected in the groundwater at datong is up to 1820 μg l xie et al 2008 in this arid and semi arid region the groundwater is the main source of drinking water hence to mitigate the as risk and ensure a safe groundwater supply it is essential to understand the processes that cause the as enrichment in groundwater from datong arsenic in minerals and rocks is generally poorly mobile whereas under the biotic and abiotic processes as may be affected to convert into dissolved phase and enter the groundwater notably numerous studies have revealed that microbial activities play a crucial role in release and transport of as mainly affecting the courses of as adsorption and desorption as well as redox reactions mirza et al 2014 gorny et al 2015 guo et al 2015 xie et al 2018 until now microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides driven by the availability of labile organic carbon has been widely accepted as the dominant control on as mobilization in reducing aquifers from bangladesh cambodia west bengal india vietnam and north china pederick et al 2007 ohtsuka et al 2013 deng et al 2018 dissolved organic matter dom provides electron donors impacting redox conditions and mobilization of nutrients or diffusion of microbial exo enzymes into the surrounding environment ghosh et al 2015a consequently variations in dom composition have an effect on sub surface biogeochemical processes by governing the dynamics of phylogenetically diverse microbial communities judd et al 2006 for the sake of quantitatively measuring the dom composition 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems and fluorescence regional integration fri technique have been widely used due to its simplicity and sensitivity marhuenda egea et al 2007 kulkarni et al 2017 the phospholipid fatty acids plfas forming a major part of the bacterial cell membranes are regarded to be indicators of living bacterial communities on account of their rapid degradation after cell death plfas can provide a quantitative measure of the viable biomass and biological diversity of microbial communities frostegård et al 1993 lanekoff and karlsson 2010 specific plfas biomarkers and plfas structural patterns like fingerprints to identify the microbial groups and diversity under different conditions within an immediate functioning ecosystem without the bias associated with cultivation willers et al 2015a in past several years methods based on nucleic acid extraction and analyses have been preferred to plfa analysis for studying microbial communities somenahally et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 however plfa still holds some advantages above other methods and may even be more sensitive in probing shifts in the microbial community structure when compared to nucleic acid methods ramsey et al 2006 willers et al 2015a in the present study we determined the plfas biomarkers dom components and hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater from the datong basin to elaborate the following objectives 1 ascertaining the structures of microbial communities and dom ascribed to as mobilization in different redox zones 2 illuminating the effects of biogeochemical processes on as behavior in aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area datong basin is situated in an arid and semi arid region of shanxi province northwestern china fig 1 with an area of approximately 60000 km2 the area has a mean annual rainfall of 300 400 mm and a very high mean evaporation rate of about 2000 mm per year almost 80 of rainfall appears from july to august xie et al 2015 owing to extensive evaporation and high groundwater table saline soil is widely distributed in this region ephemeral sanggan river and its tributaries are the prime surface water bodies the basin is surrounded by hengshan mountains guancen mountains and hongshou mountains in the southeast west and northwest respectively bedrock around the basin originates from archean to the cretaceous gneiss of archean shuanggan group and limestone of sinian period outcrop in the north of the basin while gneiss and basalt of the hengshan segment of wutai group of archean in the south guo and wang 2005 in the western margin of the basin the quaternary aquifer is overlaid with cambrian and ordovician limestone and younger sedimentary strata while the fractured archaean metamorphic rocks in the east margin xie et al 2013b pliocene to pleistocene unconsolidated sediments with thickness of 2000 m have accumulated in the basin normally the grain size of the sediment decreases from the margins to the basin center the sediment types beneath the central part of the basin are mainly lacustrine and alluvial lacustrine sandy loam silt silty clay and clay abundant in organic carbon guo and wang 2005 the groundwater flow systems have low permeability and less hydraulic gradient alluvial fluvial gravel and coarse sand form the riverbanks and occur beneath the basin margins wang et al 2009 in general the datong quaternary aquifer systems can be basically divided into two major groundwater systems one is the shallow flow system composed by coarse sand and gravel whose upper and lower boundaries range from 5 m to 60 m below the land surface the other one is semi confined deep aquifer consisting of sand and sandy gravel which prominently occur at the depths of 60 150 m xie et al 2009 moreover two flow regimes can be observed at datong basin 1 flow from margins of mountain front areas to the basin center 2 flow inside the basin along the direction of the river from southwest to northeast zhang et al 2017 groundwater is mainly recharged by vertically infiltrating meteoric water laterally penetrating fracture water in bedrock along the basin margins li et al 2014a and by leakage from non perennial rivers as well as irrigation return flow wang et al 2009 discharge occurs mainly via evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction 2 2 sampling and field procedures according to the recharge and discharge zones groundwater samples were collected for hydrochemical dissolved organic matter dom and phospholipid fatty acids plfas analyses from the datong basin the spatial distribution of sampling sites is displayed in fig 1 groundwater in each well was purged for 5 10 min with a peristaltic pump before collecting the physical and chemical parameters including ph electrical conductivity ec redox potential eh and temperature were measured in the field with the multi parameter portable meter hach hq40d calibrated before use redox sensitive parameters such as fe ii hs and nh4 concentrations were tested on site using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr2800 alkalinity was determined using gran titration within 24 h the samples for cations and anions analysis were filtered on site using 0 45 μm mixed cellulose esters millipore filters and stored in pre cleaned 50 ml polypropylene bottles acidified to ph 2 with 6 mol l ultra pure hno3 for cations measurement one bottle of each sample was left unacidified for anion determination samples for as analysis were also filtered acidified to ph 2 with ultra pure 12 mol l hcl samples for dom analysis were collected in 20 ml amber glass bottles after being filtered samples for plfa analysis were collected in 4 l amber glass bottles all samples were stored at 4 c in the dark before transferring to laboratory 2 3 laboratory measurements 2 3 1 hydrochemical

laboratory blanks were below detection limits for all the species 2 3 2 3d fluorescence analysis before fluorescence analysis was performed the dissolved organic carbon doc contents of all groundwater samples were determined using a high temperature catalytic combustion method with a toc analyzer toc v shimadzu producing data with a standard deviation of 2 fluorescene excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eems was performed on each sample using a luminescence spectrometer f 4500 hitachi at room temperature 25 c filtered water samples were scanned from 200 to 500 nm excitation at 5 nm intervals and from 300 to 600 nm emission at 2 nm intervals following the method described by stedmon et al 2003 the slit widths were set at 10 nm for both excitation and emission monochromators and the scan speed was set at 1200 nm min fluorescence regional integration fri technique has the usage of quantitatively analyzing eems and ascertaining the configuration and heterogeneity of dom he et al 2011 before integrating regions of the eems that contained limited information low fluorescence were removed simultaneously the first and second order rayleigh and raman scattering should be modified using interpolation bahram et al 2006 the fri technique was developed to integrate the area beneath eems the eems of dom were divided into five consecutive regions i e i ii iii iv and v were 200 250 300 330 nm 200 250 330 380 200 250 380 600 250 500 300 380 and 250 500 380 600 nm respectively the volume beneath region i φ i was calculated with φ i ex em i λ ex λ em δ λ ex δ λ em i i v φ i was the volume of region i i λex λem was the fluorescence intensity at the excitation wavelength λex and emission wavelength λem λex and λem were the excitation wavelength increment and emission wavelength increment respectively the percentage of the volume of region i was calculated as follows φ i n m f i φ i φ t n i 1 5 φ i n p i n φ i n φ t n 100 mfi was a multiplication factor for each region equal to the inverse of the fractional projected excitation emission area in order to normalize φ i to relative regional areas chen et al 2003 φ t n was the sum of the volume of all five regions and pi n was the percentage of the volume of region i tables s2 s3 2 3 3 plfas assay the determination of phospholipid fatty acid concentrations in groundwater samples was performed using the modified bligh dyer method willers et al 2015a specific steps were as follows 1 extraction lipids were extracted with chloroform chcl3 on separating funnels which can separate mixed phases the filter organic phase was dried down with n2 and stored at 20 c 2 fractionation the lipid extract was resuspended in chloroform and transferred to a silica gel column spe c18 3 ml previously dehydrated and activated with chcl3 then neutral lipids glycolipids and phospholipid fatty acids were eluted with chloroform acetone and methanol respectively the phospholipid fraction was collected in a clean tube purged with nitrogen and stored at 20 c 3 methyl esterification the solvent was resuspended in a mixture of toluene methanol 1 1 v v and added methylated koh then we rotated the mixture for 30 s incubating at 37 c for 15 min methyl esterification reaction after the sample returned to room temperature ice cold acetic acid was added to adjust the ph to neutral then an equal volume of n hexane and deionized water were added the sample was rotated for 30 s centrifuged for 5 min and the organic phase was transferred to another clean tube the upper aqueous phase was extracted twice with n hexane finally the solvent was dried down with n2 and stored at 20 c 4 the sample were dissolved with n hexane and transferred to the gc vial for analysis the external standard was bacterial acid methyl esters mixture sigma catalog no 47080 u additionally the analytical error was within 5 and the blank sample was mostly below the detection limit or the value was rejected in the results plfas were quantified in a gas chromatography and mass spectrometry gc ms 7000gcms us1702u402 with a nonpolar capillary column hp 5 ms 15 m 250 μm 0 25 μm the initial column temperature was maintained at 80 c for 2 min then ramped to 150 c at a rate of 50 c min and then raised to 195 c at 2 5 c min which remained constant for 3 min before increasing to 215 c the identification quantification and nomenclature of plfas were in accordance with the method proposed by macnaughton et al 1999 plfas including 11 0 12 0 13 0 14 0 15 0 16 0 17 0 18 0 19 0 and 20 0 were used as an indicator of general bacteria while 18 2ω9 was used as indicator of fungi willers et al 2015b as for gram negative gram bacteria 16 1ω9c cy17 0 cy19 0 and 18 1ω9 were biomarkers li et al 2010 breulmann et al 2014 plfas specific for gram positive gram bacteria included i15 0 a15 0 i16 0 and i17 0 igalavithana et al 2017 2 4 statistical analyses spatial mapping of sampling sites was conducted using arcgis 10 5 software environmental systems research institute ca statistical analyses including correlation analysis t tests fluorescence regional integration fri analysis and principal components analysis pca were performed on the origin 2016 software microcal software inc northampton ma the canonical correspondence analysis cca was established using matlab r2015b mathworks inc us differences were deemed statistically significant when the level of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 general hydrochemistry the physiochemical parameters of groundwater samples are exhibited in table 1 na was the major cation in the study area with ranges between 10 5 and 374 mg l average 126 mg l while the ranges of ca2 and mg2 concentrations were from 5 60 to 111 mg l average 40 8 mg l and from 18 3 to 63 1 mg l average 35 0 mg l respectively anions were dominated by hco3 130 325 mg l followed by so4 2 3 38 249 mg l and cl 9 74 138 mg l along the groundwater flow paths redox potentials eh decreased gradually varying from 118 to 181 mv indicating the groundwater shifted from oxidizing to reducing environment in discharge zones no3 concentrations were almost below the detection limit while relatively higher in recharge zones average 12 5 mg l similar to so4 2 concentrations additionally nh4 and hs concentrations normally increased from piedmont plain 0 12 0 60 mg l 13 0 27 0 μg l to the center of the basin 0 50 1 70 mg l 15 0 74 0 μg l the total dissolved concentrations of as increased apparently ranging from 0 03 to 1080 μg l notably in discharge zones the as concentrations in samples average 424 μg l exceeded the who guideline limit value 10 μg l for drinking water pi et al 2015 the as concentrations in recharge zones were usually low with the average value of 2 88 μg l the correlation of as concentrations with those of ph eh nitrate and sulfate is shown in fig 2 it can be seen that ph of all groundwater samples were near neutral to alkalescent 7 97 8 66 whereas eh values were commonly low in the discharge zone average 110 mv moreover as concentrations increased with the decrease in nitrate and sulfate suggesting that as enrichment occurred in reducing conditions of the aquifer systems 3 2 characteristics of dom fluorescence in discharge zones doc concentrations ranged from 3 28 to 5 93 mg l average 4 77 mg l higher than recharge zones average 1 53 mg l maximum 1 85 mg l in this study eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize dom in groundwater figs s1 s2 eem peaks are associated with tyrosine like type i tryptophan like type ii and soluble microbial by product like type iv originated from protein like dom and phenolic compounds fulvic acid like type iii and humic acid like type v belong to humic substances he et al 2013 the distribution of fluorescence intensities from discharge zones were similar showing one peak in type iii moreover the fluorescence intensities of type iii and v were higher than other types compared with basin center groundwater samples of recharge zones revealed more peaks in type i ii and iv therefore the results demonstrated that more humic substances were present in high as groundwater the five dom components identified by the fri analysis are presented in fig 3 obviously the percentages of type i ii and iv in recharge zones were higher than discharge zones ranged between 29 7 and 79 3 average 55 2 meantime the relative contents of type iii and v had a range from 59 7 to 67 6 average 64 3 in discharge zones constituting the main dom components the above results also revealed that from recharge zones to discharge zones the percentage of protein like dom reduced whereas humic substances enhanced indicating the concentration of humic substances were high in the central part of the basin liu et al 2020 3 3 profiles of plfas extracted from groundwater in the current study 20 plfas were identified as microbial based plfas and applied to characterize the microbial communities in each groundwater sample table 2 it is evident that all of the 20 plfas were found in recharge zone and discharge zone among the four microbial communities general bacteria and gram negative bacteria were dominant groups whereas the ratios of gram positive bacteria and fungi were less the profiles of plfas were determined by principle component analysis pca pc1 and pc2 accounted for 78 91 and 17 25 of the variance respectively fig 4 factor loading values were the projection of plfas on the corresponding ordination axis the values demonstrated that 16 0 and 18 0 had a strong positive relationship with pc1 which showed general bacteria were positive to pc1 these general fatty acids may be used as a criterion for the examination of biofilm production salomonová et al 2003 the 16 1ω9 and cy17 0 had good correlation with pc2 which manifested gram negative bacteria were positive to pc2 there were some specific plfas as well indicating the presence of specific organisms cyclopropyl saturated fatty acids cy17 0 and cy19 0 were typical for sulfate reducing bacteria srb desulfosporosinus and anaerobic bacteria fang et al 2006 zhou et al 2009 srb are often found in anaerobic aquifers using so4 2 as a terminal electron acceptor oleic acid 18 1ω9 was a plfa marker of clostridia which represented fe reducing bacteria park et al 2001 akai et al 2008 clostridia were gram positive endospore formers obligatory anaerobes in spite of a wide o2 tolerance ferb can utilize iron oxides as electron acceptors and lead to the reduction of ferric hydr oxides and release of as iii to the aqueous phase under anoxic conditions tufano and fendorf 2008 li et al 2015 polyunsaturated fatty acid 18 2ω9 was identified to represent fungal populations willers et al 2015b 4 discussion it has been widely accepted that the main driver for as mobilization is the decomposition of labile dissolved organic matter doc pi et al 2015 majumder et al 2016 schittich et al 2018 the correlation between doc and hco3 is quite positive p 0 01 r 0 68 fig 5 a the high doc concentrations were mainly derived from natural organic matter nom rich in the sediments pi et al 2015 based on the evidence from carbon isotope biogenic carbon was the most important contributor to the dissolved inorganic carbon in the groundwater xie et al 2013a the process of biodegradation of dom generated co2 which stimulated the dissolution of carbonate minerals to increase the hco3 concentrations meanwhile bacterial respiration could also produce co2 moreover doc and as concentrations obviously increased from the recharge zones to the discharge zones they were in good correlation as well p 0 001 r 0 75 fig 5b which may attribute to the impact of microbes majumder et al 2016 sedimentary nom from peat layers and surface derived organic carbon could act as a autochthonous energy source for the metabolism of microbes which caused reducing conditions in the aquifer and subsequently promoted the dissolution of as bearing fe hydr oxides to release as into groundwater cozzarelli et al 2016 besides arsenic oxyanions might be desorbed into groundwater under the competitive sorption effect of hco3 xie et al 2008 4 1 biogeochemical processes in recharge zones the recharge zones are adjacent to the piedmont plain mainly phreatic aquifers where the thickness of the aquifers is larger than the central part of the basin the piedmont sediments are mostly alluvial fluvial gravel and coarse sand wang et al 2009 xie et al 2013b as a result more atmospheric oxygen can diffuse into aqueous phase easily via the air filled pore spaces furthermore the velocity of groundwater movements is relatively faster giving rise to a rapid exchange rate of o2 xie et al 2009 the average value of ph eh and as were 8 13 94 74 mv and 2 88 μg l respectively forming a weakly alkaline and oxidative environment hence some aerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species in this area such as thiothrix gallionella and fluviicola zhang et al 2017 the 16 1ω7 16 0 and 18 1ω7 fas were the major cell membrane fatty acids of these species jacq et al 1989 sahl et al 2008 which need to consume o2 to assist their growth in aquifers microbes utilized organic carbon as electron donors to metabolize and dissolved inorganic carbon accumulated slowly along aquifer flow paths wang et al 2019 the available electron acceptors were consumed sequentially in the order o2 no3 fe iii so4 2 co2 chapelle 2000 the effects of selected environmental variables on the biomass of microorganisms across the recharge zones were summarized through canonical correspondence analysis cca fig 6 a bacterial biomass was positively correlated to protein like dom while negatively correlated to no3 concentrations the arrow length of no3 was longer than so4 2 from fig 6b no3 concentrations showed a downward trend with protein like dom if the sample in the dashed ellipse was excluded a good negative linear correlation p 0 01 r 0 84 can be obtained the excluded sample w5 was located in runoff areas with far higher abundance of humic substances 70 3 not only that aerobic bacteria abundance was also higher than other sites implying that bacteria might use some biodegradable humic like dom after oxidizing protein like dom nevertheless from the whole trend it can be seen that aerobic bacteria mainly consumed no3 to act as an electron acceptor and protein like dom were served as electron donors so as to maintain the metabolism of bacteria in recharge zones the thiothrix and gallionella belong to s oxidizing bacteria sob and fe oxidizing bacteria feob respectively lerm et al 2011 which generally deplete no3 as an electron acceptor in respiratory action additionally feob could oxidize fe ii and reduce no3 in a redox reaction where fe ii was regarded as an electron donor after feob oxidized fe ii bacteriogenic fe oxides precipitated in aqueous phase and over time the precipitation might attenuate as from surrounding groundwater in a weakly alkaline and oxidative environment the primary biogeochemical process was aerobic bacteria exploited protein like dom as electron donors together with depleting of o2 and no3 electron acceptors this would limit the reduction of fe iii and as v thereby inhibiting as mobilization in groundwater the reactions are as follows 1 ch3coo o2 h 2hco3 2 5ch3coo 8no3 3h 4n2 4h2o 10hco3 4 2 biogeochemical processes in discharge zones the discharge zones are located in the central part of the datong basin as a result of arid semi arid climate stagnant hydrogeological setting and closed semi closed geochemical environment in the basin center aquifers were in anoxic condition with highest concentrations of as guo et al 2003 the eh value ranged from 181 to 4 90 mv with average of 55 38 mv indicating a reducing environment the groundwater reduction stage can roughly be divided into oxic post oxic sulfidic and methanogenic environment berner 1981 in oxic condition o2 and no3 are predominant in aquifers when it converts to reduction the reduction of o2 no3 first occurs followed by the reduction of as v and fe iii li et al 2014b with the diminution of redox potential so4 2 would be reduced at last co2 would be reduced to ch4 jia et al 2014 albeit redox processes strongly influenced the mobilization and enrichment of as the effect of microbial communities cannot be neglected which was closely related to these redox processes paul et al 2015 because of the alteration of redox conditions the microbial communities in groundwater were likely to change furthermore the increment of doc concentrations might also cause the alterations in microbial processing of dom and the structure of bacterial communities in discharge zones therefore some anerobic bacteria may serve as the dominant species in this region such as desulfosporosinus srb clostridia ferb and acinetobacter the relative abundance of ferb ranged from 8 11 to 22 14 with average of 13 07 higher than srb 5 04 10 11 the cy17 0 cy19 0 and 18 1ω9 fas were indicative of these species which mainly capitalized on fe iii as v and so4 2 as electron acceptors to produce fe ii as iii and hs wang et al 2017b fan et al 2018 in bangladesh the clostridium plfa 18 1ω9c has been also observed in as rich region and the presence of clostridia could mediate fe reduction akai et al 2008 similarly the predominant phospholipids composition contained 18 1ω9 in bengal delta plain aquifers which indicated the microbes participated in fe reduction reactions correlated to as biogeochemical cycling ghosh et al 2017 ghosh et al 2018 the cy17 0 and cy19 0 fas showed high relative abundance in arsenic treated samples from miasteczko śląskie transect in poland azarbad et al 2016 notably the plfa marker was a posteriori method indicating there was cy17 0 because there was srb not a posteriori method suggesting there was srb because there was cy17 0 as with other plfa markers akai et al 2008 the relative contents of plfas present in the groundwater appeared discrepancies indicating the variation in the lipid contributing communities microbial reduction activities required a supply of dissolved organic carbon when the biological oxygen demand from the degradation of organic carbon exceeded the rate of oxygen infusion anaerobic metabolism prevailed and following nitrate reduction led to microbially mediated reduction of fe iii to fe ii as v to as iii as well as so4 2 to hs polizzotto et al 2008 fendorf et al 2010 4 2 1 controls of dom on as mobility the effects of selected hydrochemical parameters on the biomass of four microbial communities across discharge zones were summarized via cca fig 7 the results indicated that protein like dom positively affected the dominant anaerobic microbes srb ferb biomass and proportion fig 8 a and arrow directions of humic substances and as were similar in general protein like dom with low molecular weight 1000 da were labile bioactive and readily utilized for microbial metabolism brailsford et al 2017 thereby catalyzing microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 the reactions are as follows 3 ch3coo 8fe oh 3 15h 8fe2 20h2o 2hco3 4 ch3coo 4aso4 3 4aso3 3 2hco3 h 5 ch3coo so4 2 hs 2hco3 humic substances hs with high molecular weight 1000 da maybe recalcitrant to microbial breakdown kujawinski 2011 along the groundwater flow path the relative concentrations of hs obviously increased the nonbiodegradable hs released from peat in sediments or other dispersed sedimentary organic matter in the aquifer has accumulated under the sluggish groundwater flow in basin center xie et al 2012 however high proportion of hs may interact and enhance the transport of as and fe in aqueous environments fig 8b in the discharge zones as and fe concentrations increased with hs proportion humic and fulvic acids are unique anionic polyelectrolyte at neutral ph they may exist as soluble and absorbable patterns in aquatic environments often coated on mineral surfaces ko et al 2004 on account of its high content of oxygen containing functional groups including carboxylic phenolic enolic and alcholic groups hs were capable of complexing with metals fe and metalloids as to form ternary complexes as fe hs or binary complexes as hs in absence of fe kulkarni 2016 li et al 2019 these complexes were freely soluble in neutral and weakly alkaline liquid affecting the fate and transport of as additionally with negatively charged functional groups hs might produce a higher adsorption affinity for fe oxides causing as to desorb from iron minerals and preventing as from adsorbing onto humic coated fe oxides liu et al 2011 schittich et al 2018 besides dissolved hs were capable of shuttling electrons from a wide range of microorganism to electron acceptors such as fe iii accelerating the mobilization of as in aquifers chen et al 2017 kulkarni et al 2018 4 2 2 roles of srb ferb in as transport the sulfate reducing bacteria srb can apply multiple electron acceptors for energy preservation comprised of as v fe iii and so4 2 oremland and stolz 2005 deng et al 2018 on the grounds of redox sequence srb would initially transform as v to as iii fan et al 2018 followed by the reduction of reactive fe iii in the amorphous iron hydr oxide minerals finally the consumption of so4 2 under the interference of srb and dom the reductive dissolution of as bonding fe iii hydr oxides might contribute to the release of structurally coprecipitated or surface adsorbed as into aquatic phase in discharge zones simultaneously biogenic sulfides the reduzate of so4 2 had potential to stimulate the reduction of as v to as iii rochette et al 2000 wang et al 2017a if reactive fe iii minerals such as ferrihydrite were present free sulfides also reductively reacted with them abiotically which generated fe ii and zero valent sulfur probably existed lesser quantity of thiosulfate sun et al 2016 the equations eqs are as follows 6 hs aso4 3 h s0 aso3 3 h2o 7 hs 2fe oh 3 5h 2fe2 s0 6h2o moreover sulfide induced as thiolation in groundwater was capable of producing thioarsenic species stable under anoxic environments pi et al 2018 which promoted the solubility and mobility of as due to their weaker adsorptive affinity of fe minerals than arsenate and arsenite in discharge zones fe reducing bacteria ferb might also serve as the agents catalyzing the reduction of fe hydr oxides and liberating as into aquifers under anaerobic conditions which mainly utilized protein like dom as electron donors for energy conserving respiratory processes clostridia did not perform dissimilatory so4 2 reduction however fe reducing and as reducing clostridia were known such as clostridium beijerinckii dobbin et al 1999 clostridium butyricum park et al 2001 and clostridium sp strain ohilas stolz et al 2007 the detoxification and energy preserving respiratory might be the major pathways for reducing as v similarly qiao et al 2018 applied pcr analysis to find clostridia played a critical role in fe iii reduction with the addition of biochar to promote as mobility and release from arsenic contaminated paddy soil in bangladesh fe iii as v reduction may not be directly related to electron transport and could be mediated only indirectly with h2 produced via fermentation by clostridia akai et al 2008 it has been also found that ferb accounted for significant proportion of the total microbial communities in jianghan plain where clostridia could reduce soluble fe iii or amorphous fe hydr oxides coupled with the oxidation of doc to simulate the mobilization of as deng et al 2018 therefore the biogenic reductive dissolution of as bearing fe hydr oxides minerals in conjunction with reductive desorption of arsenate would be responsible for high as in discharge zones on the other hand microbial respiration could also indirectly affect the speciation of as and fe via changes in sorption and precipitation equilibria together with solid solution partitioning of metal binding dom thomas et al 2010 which might restrict the mobilization and enrichment of as in the aquifers the palpable negative relationships between srb ferb and as fe concentrations are depicted in fig 9 due to bioactivity of srb and ferb sulfate was reduced to sulfide which could precipitate as as sulfide phases including realgar ass orpiment as2s3 and arsenopyrite feass when their concentrations reached to precipitation equilibria burton et al 2014 these newly formed precipitates would retard as mobility in anoxic environments direct reduction of fe iii by microorganisms might destroy the unstable ternary complexes as fe dom or binary complexes fe dom subsequently lead to as sequestration by sorption or coprecipitation of as onto secondary fe minerals which contained pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes greigite fe3s4 and siderite feco3 through such processes dissolved as would be constrained to release into groundwater even be immobilized under some conditions majumder et al 2014 eqs 8 and 9 described the formation of fesn and as2s3 8 fe2 nhs fesn nh 9 2as3 3hs as2s3 3h it is also worth noticing that the biogeochemical processes of reductive dissolution of fe hydr oxides were at a faster rate than the as re sequestration from aquifers by fe as sulfide minerals furthermore as a result of the limited dissolved fe removal of as by precipitation with fe minerals was not significant eventually the enrichment and mobilization of as in groundwater were observed from discharge zones according to the above discussion a conceptual model can be put forward to demonstrate the complex biogeochemical processes on as behavior in aquifers fig 10 in recharge zones aerobic bacteria mainly consumed o2 and no3 as electron acceptors by utilizing protein like dom which inhibited fe iii and as v reduction reaction however in discharge zones the anaerobic microbes might play a dominant role the presence of protein like dom promoting srb and ferb respiration led to as enrichment in aquifers via microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 meanwhile high proportions of humic substances could contribute to the complexation between as fe and dom resulting in as mobility in high as groundwater microbial reduction of sulfate resulted the formation of fesn or as2s3 which subsequently removed as from liquid phase via sorption or coprecipitation 4 3 the stress of as on microbial communities in aquifers it is notable that microbial communities can not only affect as enrichment in aquifers but also be impacted by as stress in discharge zones the ratio of total saturated to total unsaturated plfas sat unsat ratio was utilized as an indicator of nutritional stress in bacterial communities and nutrient availability breulmann et al 2014 the toxic as was regard as an external stress factor for microbial communities vetter et al 2012 igalavithana et al 2017 with the growth of as concentrations sat unsat ratios was increasing ranged from 1 73 to 4 62 fig 11 the changes resulted in decrease in membrane fluidity and permeability which enhanced the stability and rigidity of membranes it was recognized that the membrane fluidity could be regulated by saturated unsaturated and branched plfas variations in response to environmental stress it could diminish the proton channels and other transporter proteins binding the membrane ghosh et al 2018 a high degree of saturation decreased the susceptibility of fatty acids to free radicals markowicz et al 2010 moreover the conversion of monounsaturated to cyclopropane fatty acids may protect cells from chemical destruction at the site of unsaturation in consequence the improvement of fatty acids saturation in membranes exposed to as could be symbolized as bacterial cell defense geared towards reducing the damage induced by oxidative radicals produced from as in summary the sat unsat ratio of plfas can be exerted to characterize microbial adaptative mechanisms on heavy metals or metalloids 5 conclusion at the basin scale hydrochemical evolution gradually changed from the margin areas recharge zones to the center of the basin discharge zones as and doc concentrations increased with the decrease in eh nitrate and sulfate concentrations indicating more reducing aquifers occurred in discharge zones in recharge zones some aerobic bacteria such as thiothrix gallionella and fluviicola were the dominant species utilizing protein like dom as electron donors for metabolism simultaneously o2 and no3 were consumed as the major electron acceptors as for discharge zones anerobic bacteria may serve as the preponderant species such as desulfosporosinus srb and clostridia ferb low molecular weight protein like dom could also act as energy sources for the respiration of anaerobic bacteria promoting microbially mediated reductive dissolution of as bearing fe iii hydr oxides and reduction of as v so4 2 high proportions of humic substances can complex with as and fe enhancing as mobility the production hs was a reducing agent for fe oxides hydroxides abiotically expediting the release of the bound arsenic to the groundwater on the other hand as would be incorporated with fe ii sulfides which more possibly appeared in the elevation of as in aqueous phase without doubt microbial communities and as can influence each other in aquifers this study gained insights into the mechanisms that different microbial communities and dom components affected the mobility and enrichment of as in shallow groundwater to the best of our knowledge this is the first report using plfas analysis coupled with dom 3d fluorescence to elucidate the complex biogeochemical processes in the datong basin northwestern china credit authorship contribution statement lu yan conceptualization investigation

shifts towards enriched δ18o and δd values of 8 59 and 12 2 v smow respectively were observed in the case of 11 springs these shifts were attributed to the interaction of water with clay minerals and

decades mineral water has become a commodity of growing importance and its consumption has spread worldwide however no general consensus on how mineral water is defined has currently been reached and different definitions have been proposed by various authors and institutions reflecting different hydrochemical features health effects or microbiological purity the definitions may also be based on different criteria from country to country codex stan 108 1981 fao in the common perception of romanian consumers mineral waters are generally seen as co2 rich natural waters with specific contents of dissolved minerals collected from the source springs or dug drilled wells this is also the meaning of the term mineral water that we will use within the present contribution thus separating them from the common non mineral waters the hydrogeochemical investigation of mineral waters may provide information about the origin and quality of the water water gas rock interactions exposure to external conditions and vulnerability to pollution which is useful for the sustainable exploitation of the aquifers and in more general terms for establishing a suitable groundwater management brenčič et al

carpathians along the neogene to quaternary volcanic chain host important natural resources of mineral waters berszán et al 2009 most of these are in the form of co2 rich natural springs of different types associated with co2 gas emissions vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 the existence of these resources has boosted the development of the mineral water bottling industry about 45 of the bottled mineral waters from romania are provided by companies of this region feru 2012 consuming raw mineral water directly from the source is very popular in the area it is appreciated that thousands of people from the eastern carpathians consume non bottled mineral water on a daily basis using local mineral springs and wells as their main source of drinking water as an alternative to tap water berszán et al 2009 feru 2012 the mineral waters are associated with medical balneological services as well spas and medical treatment centres e g at borsec sângeorz băi băile homorod băile harghita băile tușnad covasna have been developed in the eastern carpathians all of them dependent on the regional water resource and its quality the first inventory of these springs dates back to the 18th century when the first monographic descriptions mentioned the importance of these resources later on several investigations focusing on the therapeutic value and geological setting of these springs have been carried out bányai 1934 molnár amărăscu 1961 pricăjan 1972 pricăjan and airinei 1979 kisgyörgy and kristó 1978 recent studies on general aspects of fluid geochemistry kis et al 2013 kis and

costinel et al 2009 magdaș et al 2009 fórizs et al 2011 ionete et al 2015 make the present day state of knowledge but the origin of the mineral waters and related geochemical processes and the potential exposure to environmental risks is still poorly constrained starting from the evidence that waters with very different features discharge in the same area this paper focuses on the western side of the eastern carpathians and its boundary with the transylvanian basin we provide detailed geochemical and statistical investigations on 121 mineral water springs wells fig 1 with the aim to better constrain the origin of waters and the natural processes responsible for the observed physical chemical features and to check the exposure and vulnerability of the hydrogeological system to both possible pollutants and environmental change 2 geological setting in romania the mountain range of the eastern carpathians covers an area of 33 500 km2 bounded in the north by the border with ukraine and the prahova valley in the south our research area covers the western sector of the carpathian mountain range from rodnei and bârgăului mountains in the north towards the călimani gurghiu harghita volcanic chain and perșani mountains in the south a 200 km long transect between the someșul mare and the olt river at the transylvanian basin boundary fig 1 the elevation ranges between 2000 and 2100 m a s l for the highest massifs rodnei and călimani mts to 1300 1900 m a s l in the case of middle altitude massifs bârgăului gurghiu and harghita mts and 700 800 m a s l for the lowest units perșani mts the elevation in the eastern transylvanian basin varies between 290 and 700 m a s l the climate conditions represent the transition from a basin type to a mountain type climate the amount of rainfall range from 800 mm year from basin margins to 1400 mm year on the mountain tops with differences depending on geographical orientation pop 2006 the alpine tectonic activity in the carpathian pannonian region initiated during the cretaceous with the closure of the tethys ocean the intensification of the compressional forces during the neogene led to the south west oriented subduction of a small oceanic basin beneath the continental microplates tisa dacia after the collision of these small tisa dacia microplates with the eurasian plate magma generation and magmatic activity began rădulescu and dumitrescu 1982 seghedi et al 1995 seghedi and downes 2011 the carpathian volcanic arc was developed along the inner part of the carpathian orogenic belt behind the carpathian accretionary prism rădulescu and săndulescu 1973 rădulescu and dumitrescu 1982 royden 1993 szakács and seghedi 1995b mason et al 1998 pécskay et al 1995 pécskay et al 2006 within this volcanic chain three major segments can be distinguished from north to south oaș gutâi mountains țibleș rodna bârgău and the călimani gurghiu harghita volcanic range the first and the third are connected with intensive volcanic activity the second differs especially in the evolution of magmas and their surface manifestations consisting of magmatic intrusions băncilă 1958 rădulescu and dumitrescu 1982 the țibleș rodna bârgău area is characterized by neogene magmatic bodies intruded into different types of rocks the magmatic rocks have been described as andesites dacites and rhyolites although there is no evidence of volcanic activity peltz et al 1974 rădulescu and dumitrescu 1982 the calc alkaline intrusions lacolyths dykes piles sills etc pierced into the crystalline units of the rodna mountains and the sedimentary paleogene deposits of bârgăului mountains have an age between 8 3 and 11 9 ma and consist of rhyolites rhyodacites dacites andesites and microdiorites pécskay et al 1995 ureche 1999 the rodna mountains represent the continental metamorphic basement formed by precambrian and cambrian metamorphic rocks and a mesozoic sedimentary cover bucovinian and subbucovinian nappes the metamorphic units are represented by the rebra and bretila series medium grade metamorphic rocks locally affected by thermal metasomatism and hydrothermal alteration the magmatic intrusions are mainly lacolyths sills and dykes composed of rhyolites andesites and microdiorites mosonyi 1998 ureche 1999 the călimani gurghiu harghita cgh is the southernmost and the longest 160 km continuous volcanic chain located between the carpathian fold and thrust belt and the transylvanian basin the cgh range is naturally subdivided into four distinct geographical segments călimani gurghiu north harghita and south harghita created by a row of adjacent composite volcanoes and their peripheral volcaniclastic aprons szakács and seghedi 1995a 1995b volcanic activity in the

seghedi et al 1987 seghedi et al 1995 seghedi et al 1998 seghedi et al 2006 the southern part of the volcanic edifices developed on the early cretaceous clastic flysch sedimentary units of the eastern carpathians which formed several nappes the carpathian flysch units consist of alternations of sandstone calcareous sandstone limestone and clay marl from the sinaia formation of the ceahlău nappe and the bodoc flysch reaching a thickness up to 2500 m băncilă 1958 nicolăescu 1973 grasu et al 1996 widespread volcaniclastic aprons up to 650 m thick have developed around the volcanic cones extending

made up of alternations of marls silty clays and sandstones volcanic tuff and middle badenian salt deposits in the transylvanian basin halite deposits cover an area of 16 000 km2 with average thickness of 250 m in the centre but up to 1000 3000 m in the diapiric folds zone on the margins of the basin păucă 1967 krézsek and filipescu 2005 krézsek and bally 2006 the nacl content of the halite is between 94 and 99 associated with small amounts of anhydrite gypsum calcite and clay minerals clay minerals occur in the salt deposits either as clayey interbeds or as fine clay material disseminated in the salt mass their mineralogical composition consists of 65 75 illite 20 30 kaolinite 5 10 chlorite diagenesis may have transformed montmorillonite into illite kaolinite is mainly the result of weathering processes as saline environments are not favourable to its formation so it is usually found in the volcanic units neacșu and urcan 1978 the post salt badenian and sarmatian successions are composed of deep marine siliciclastic deposits shallow marine shelf and delta deposits conglomerates sandstones and shales in the central parts of the basin bituminous shales were deposited in an anoxic environment forming the possible source rock for the biogenic gas accumulations the deposits orientation is nw se with a thickness from hundreds of m to 2000 m being gently folded and cut by reverse faults due to the compressional stress krézsek and filipescu 2005 the tectonic structure of the area is marked in the north by a ne sw oriented fault system along the someș valley next to the metamorphic units of rodnei mountains săndulescu 1984 in the southern part the anticlines containing methane reservoirs and dome shaped diapire structures of the halite a nw se overthrust fold system and a wnw ese and nne ssw oriented fault system are the characteristic features of this tectonic setting săndulescu 1984 krézsek et al 2010 3 mineral water springs from the study area in the eastern carpathians several thousand co2 rich mineral water springs are estimated according to the studies of bányai 1934 pricăjan and airinei 1979 and airinei and pricăjan 1974 the proximity of the volcanic range favours active co2 degassing vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 the mineral waters are co2 rich and sparkling occurring in the form of bubbling pools natural springs and wells fig 2 the location of the springs is often marked by fe hydroxide and travertine deposits bányai 1934 pricăjan 1972 berszán et al 2009 the circulation of fluids is enhanced by the disruptive tectonics in the area which provides the main upwelling paths for co2 and mineral waters bányai 1934 airinei and pricăjan 1974 an important contribution to the released fluids is also given by the methane reservoirs of the transylvanian basin methane emissions that often occur as dissolved or free gases bányai 1934 molnár amărăscu and pricăjan 1961 vaselli et al 2002 baciu et al 2018 ionescu et al 2017 kis et al 2017 are related to natural gas fields of the transylvanian basin gas reservoirs are located in dome shaped anticlines at the level of middle upper miocene detrital sequences followed by thick halite horizons krézsek et al 2010 mud volcanoes and dry methane gas seeps are often associated with gas reservoirs small mud volcanoes and dry gas seeps were identified on the eastern margin of the basin at odorheiu secuiesc praid corund and homorod baciu et al 2007 etiope et al 2011 localities that were included in our analysis the waters associated to these formations can be sampled from springs as well as dug and drilled wells they may contain dissolved co2 ch4 and even h2s at various extents and high pressure vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 and have high mineralization also including high br and i contents similar to oil field brines gheorghiu et al 1962 at several locations with bubbling springs travertine deposits occur while halite precipitation was observed at the highly mineralized wells and springs fischer 1887 bányai 1934 molnár amărăscu 1961 4 material and methods 4 1 sampling and analytical methods a total of 121 sites including natural springs bathing places and wells were considered for water samples collection during the spring season in 2013 2018 since the investigated area is large and scarce information on the precise geographical position of the water sources was available the sampling locations were determined from literature descriptions maps or following the guidance of local people sampling was carried out during several field expeditions the chemical features of the mineral waters were assessed by field and laboratory measurements at babeș bolyai university and sapientia hungarian university of transylvania in cluj napoca at the sampling sites the temperature t c acidity ph redox potential orp and specific electric conductivity λ were measured using a portable multimeter ph cond 3320 wtw germany for the analysis of the major anions 1 l samples were taken in polyethylene bottles which were sealed by removing air bubbles and stored at 4 c in the dark the water was filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate filters during sampling the major anions were determined by titration hco3 cl and by turbidimetric methods so4 2 the manual titration method for the quantification of the hco3 and the potentiometric titration method for the quantification of the cl titroline alpha schott instruments gmbh germany were used the titrants for the cl and for the hco3 were a 0 01 n agno3 solution and a 0 01 n hcl solution respectively the so4 2 was determined in the form of baso4 precipitate in an acidic solution by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm on a spectrophotometer jenway 6400 usa in order to determine the major cations na k mg2 ca2 and some trace inorganic components fe2 li rb 50 ml water was filtered and sampled into a polyethylene vial and 1 ml 65 hno3 merck suprapur was added the elemental analysis was carried out using the mp aes technique mp aes 4210 spectrometer agilent usa this technique is based on the atomization and excitation of the elements in a nitrogen plasma at 4500 k temperature this analytical method enables the determination of the total iron content fe2 and fe3 but as the samples come from springs characterised by reduced and slightly acidic to neutral waters we can assume that they contain the iron exclusively in the fe2 form a 1 g l 1 cs solution prepared from cscl salt of analytical grade merck emsure was used as an ionization suppressor and matrix modifier three replicate samples of two certified reference materials tmda 70 2 canada erm ca011c uk were used for the quality assurance of the method table 3 supplementary material the ph

organic compounds with significant concentrations have also been reported in the mineral waters ibf 1961 but were not quantified in our study the δd and δ18o water isotopic measurements were performed by using a cavity enhanced absorption spectrometry analyser lgr isotope analyser los gatos research inc at the institute for geological and geochemical research in budapest and at the isotope climatology and environmental research centre institute for nuclear research in debrecen the isotopic ratios are expressed as per mil deviation with respect to the v smow standard vienna standard mean ocean water using the conventional δ18o and δd notation δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r represents the 18o 16o or d 1h isotopic ratio mckinney et al 1950 analytical precision for δ18o and δd is better than 0 1 and 0 6 respectively the study workflow is illustrated in the flowchart fig 1 3 included in the supplementary material 4 2 data analysis the springs were divided into 5 groups representative for the geological background of the investigated area these groups are 1 metamorphic units neogene magmatic intrusions 2 transcarpathian flysch neogene magmatic intrusions 3 transylvanian basin sediments 4 volcanic pyroclasts transylvanian basin sediments 5 volcanic pyroclasts carpathian flysch sediments statistical analyses were carried out relying on a data matrix that consisted of 121 rows representing the mineral water springs and 17 columns 16 numerical variables physico chemical and chemical parameters and a factor variable representing the geological properties of the sites the r software was used r core team 2016 version 3 6 2 released on 2019 12 12 basic statistical data were calculated we chose the median and the median absolute deviation mad for describing the variables because of the presence of some large values in almost all subgroups these statistical parameters are not sensible to the outliers non parametric methods were used for data processing since some variables did not follow the normal distribution spearman s rho rank correlation parameter was chosen for describing the correlation between the variables as well as for testing the significance of the correlation in order to reveal spatial patterns in the data distribution principal component analysis pca was used as an ordination method the importance of the principal components was evaluated according to the eigenvalues the components with eigenvalues higher than 1 were used in the data representations the outliers were easily identified on the scatter plots and discussed separately in the text the classification and regression tree cart algorithm was used as supervised learning method breiman et al 1984 this method requires no prior assumptions about the dataset it is robust and easily interpretable for computation and representation of cart the rpart and rpart plot packages were used the nodes of the tree were created relying on the gini index information gain as splitting criteria the model performance was evaluated by the accuracy and kappa values the closer these values are to unity the better the performance of the model we tested the model by creating a random subsample of the dataset taking 30 of the objects the confusionmatrix function of the caret package provided the confident interval of the accuracy for this subsample 5 results the results of the field measurements together with the location wgs84 geographic coordinates of the sampling sites are listed in table 1 and marked on fig 1 detailed information on the locations are found in figs 1 1 and 1 2 from the supplementary material the analytical results of both chemical major ions and isotopic composition δ18o and δd are listed in table 2 the detailed basic statistical data are given in the supplementary material table 4 the physico chemical parameters measured in the field show wide spatial variability temperatures range from 3 to 25 0 c ph between 4 91 and 8 49 redox potential between 106 6 and 152 6 mv and electrical conductivity ec between 0 166 and 248 ms cm 5 1 water chemistry the wide range of electrical conductivity is the result of a variety of geochemical features of the sampled waters depending on the specific features of the sampling area the ionic composition of waters may vary within an extended range among the major ions na and cl may reach the highest abundance displaying concentrations between 2 69 and 181 500 mg l and between 1 52 and 209 700 mg l respectively the concentrations of the other major ions vary between the following limits ca2 6 75 3 794 mg l k 0 15 3 684 mg l mg2 1 14 1 738 mg l so4 2 0 4 228 mg l and hco3 63 7 540 mg l the hydrogeochemical facies of the 121 investigated samples were evaluated by using the piper and langelier ludwig diagrams figs 3 and 4 more detailed versions of the plots indicating the sample id of each point are included in the supplementary material fig 4 1 the distribution of the collected samples on the piper plot suggests the existence of three major hydrochemical types ca na mg hco3 ca na mg na ca mg hco3 cl so4 and na cl waters a ca na mg hco3 waters predominantly consisting of samples from group 5 emerging from flysch units covered by neogene volcanic pyroclasts few samples from groups 1 2 and 4 also fall within this field the dominant anion is hco3 90 while ca2 mg2 generally exceed 50 b ca na mg na ca mg hco3 cl so4 waters the majority of the studied waters belong to this hydrogeochemical type it contains mainly samples from groups 1 2 and 4 but some samples from group 5 and 3 also plot here these waters are mainly associated with the metamorphic and transcarpathian flysch units from the northern area pierced by neogene intrusions groups 1 and 2 and with the transylvanian basin sediments covered by volcanic pyroclasts group 4 the so4 2 anion is generally absent its occurrence is specific for few samples from groups 1 2 4 and 5 that are included in the ca na mg hco3 cl so4 field c na cl waters contains the highly saline waters from group 3 and 4 from the sedimentary units of the transylvanian basin often intersecting volcanic pyroclasts it is interesting to note that waters from group 4 show the largest variability and are well represented within all 3 hydrochemical types 5 2 multivariate statistics according to the values obtained from the spearman s rho correlation coefficient we found strong positive correlation between cl na ca2 mg2 k and the electrical conductivity as well as between δd and δ18o there was a strong negative correlation between the ph and the redox potential and between the ph and fe2 fig 5 the detailed results including the significance of the paired correlations are given in the supplementary material table 5 a pca analysis based on the chemical and the isotope data was carried out and is shown in fig 6 the first three principal components pcs fig 6 presented eigenvalues higher than unity altogether these pcs explained 77 9 of the variance the δ18o δd and k had the highest contributions to pc1 0 75 0 77 and 0 61 the li ca2 and rb had the highest loadings on pc2 0 38 0 35 and 0 35 and fe2 had the highest loading on pc3 0 58 in the planes of the pc pairs eight outliers were identified 45 47 48 59 65 89 95 105 a classification tree cart model fig 7 was built based on all 16 variables the variables with the most discriminative power were cl hco3 fe2 ph δ18o li and temperature the overall accuracy of the model was of 0 835 with a confidence interval ci of 0 7563 0 896 at 0 05 significance level the kappa value of the model was 0 782 when testing the model with a 30 randomly selected subsample an accuracy of 0 842 with a confidence interval of ci 0 6875 0 9398 was found nevertheless the specificity of the model was higher than 90 for all groups exhibiting the highest levels for the 1st 98 and the 3rd 99 groups according to the classification tree cart model the studied waters could be separated into two major divisions 1 highly saline waters and 2 low salinity waters the first division is composed mainly of the samples from the 3rd group 85 of the total samples from this group and the 4th group 32 of this group and it also contained the sample 21 from the 2nd group further the highly saline waters could be separated into high and low hco3 content waters we found that almost all highly saline waters from the 3rd group had relatively low concentrations of hco3 1068 mg l on the other hand highly saline waters from the 4th group were considerably richer in hco3 the low salinity waters were primarily distinct in the fe2 content the samples from the 4th and the 5th groups exhibited higher fe2 concentrations 2 6 mg l while the samples from the 1st and 2nd groups contained less iron regarding the 4th and 5th group the samples differed mainly in the acidity the 5th group samples being more acidic ph 5 9 than the 4th ones some samples showed unique chemical composition for example the 21 sample from the 2nd group was the only one having cl content higher than 2 g l although the sample 88 from the 4th group was highly saline it contained less hco3 than the other saline waters five samples from the 3rd group had low nacl content from them two 35 and 55 were poorer and three 58 60 61 were richer in fe2 the sample 16 from the 1st group exhibited an unexpectedly high fe2 concentration 4 3 mg l 5 3 stable isotopic composition the δd δ18o diagram fig 8 shows the distribution of the samples with respect to the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 2013 and the local rainwater isotope composition local meteoric water line lmwl of bodoc after ionete et al 2015 the isotopic composition of the sampled waters shows δ18o values ranging between 12 01 and 8 59 v smow with δd between 87 98 and 12 20 v smow thus most of the springs lie close to the lmwl and gmwl 6 discussion as already noted the water samples were collected along a 200 km transect in the eastern carpathians that has intersected volcanic metamorphic and sedimentary formations including evaporites fig 1 table 1 this geological variety assumes different processes affecting the dissolved chemical components of the groundwater proven also by the large variability recorded in the physical and chemical composition of the collected waters table 2 to gain insight into the main possible processes that affect the mineral water springs in the study area we investigated the possible origin of the major solutes and the origin of water by their stable isotopic composition 6 1 origin of the major solutes evidence from multivariate statistics based on the evaluation of the chemical composition of the investigated waters showed their grouping according to their geological origin salinity proved to be the main differentiating factor besides other components like ph isotopic composition and specific ions hco3 li rb fe2 thus the most saline waters of group 3 and 4 originating from sedimentary units were separated from the rest of the sites both on the pca diagrams fig 6 and cart model fig 7 the wide range of mineralization exhibited by the springs is consistent with water rock interactions and mixing between different hydrogeochemical types figs 3 and 4 the contrasting hydrogeochemical facies within the study area is mainly due to the cl na k mg2 and ca2 contents which show the most positive correlation with the electrical conductivity fig 5 thus they are the main ions responsible for the salinity of waters considering the widespread presence of evaporitic formations the main na source is likely to be the halite dissolution there are large salt deposits in the transylvanian basin which outcrop at some areas e g bistrița praid homorod while in other places they are close to the surface below the volcaniclastic layers e g vlăhiţa and odorheiu secuiesc bányai 1929 1934 1942 molnár amărăscu and pricăjan 1961 ticleanu et al 1980 due to the high halite solubility the na and cl content of the springs from the transylvanian basin is also high leading to elevated electrical conductivity values and explaining the outstanding representation of saline waters in the group 3 85 and group 4 32 in the cart model fig 7 if halite dissolution is the only source for na and cl content of the waters the cl content in this case should be in stoichiometric equivalent mass ratio with na from halite or similar to the original seawater na cl ratio 1 or 0 88 respectively ghabayen et al 2006 the na cl ratio for the whole dataset ranges between 0 45 sample 110 and 14 15 sample 112 table 2 fig 9 suggesting different sources for these elements ratios equal or close to unity are in agreement with halite dissolution and are represented by highly mineralized na cl type waters of the transylvanian basin 3rd group fig 9 na cl ratios below unity 0 4 0 6 suggest that besides halite dissolution other water rock interaction processes may also occur these water rock interaction processes modify the original composition of the brines the reactions that may occur are 1 base exchange reaction in saline environments with clay minerals which decrease the na and increase the ca2 and mg2 content of the solution vengosh et al 1999 ghabayen et al 2006 cartwright et al 2002 and or 2 evaporation of the original brine followed by halite and carbonate precipitation ghabayen et al 2006 interaction and ion exchange with clays in the transylvanian basin may be possible due to the presence of clay minerals like illites kaolinites and montmorillonites within the sediments and also in the halite gheorghiu et al 1962 neacșu and urcan 1978 trace elements like li and rb are concentrated and incorporated in the crystal structure of clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite horstman 1957 interaction and weathering processes could increase the li and rb concentration of the solution such water rock interaction processes are suggested by the elevated li and rb content of some springs from corund samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 also with low na cl ratios evaporation processes are indicated by the halite deposition samples 30 31 32 33 34 36 37 41 57 88 92 95 from group 3 that appear right at the emergence of the springs and wells fig 2 c fischer 1887 and sometimes also carbonate deposition occurs samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 from group 4 due to co2 loss fig 2 d bányai 1934 gheorghiu et al 1962 italiano et al 2017 the elevated na cl ratios up to 14 16 table 2 show the input of na from other sources besides evaporites the volcanic range is characterized by widespread volcaniclastics which were deposited on the sedimentary units of the transylvanian basin szakács and krézsek 2006 interaction with volcanic rocks alteration of feldspars could explain the input of na to the solutions moreover na cl ratios increase from the sedimentary units towards the volcanic range e g sample 112 from group 5 with the highest na cl ratio of 14 16 table 2 fig 9 this sample is located in the volcanic range of harghita mts where water rock interaction affecting the volcanic rocks is enhanced also by the presence of co2 of deep origin dissolved in the groundwater italiano et al 2017 kis et al 2019 the presence of hco3 in the waters is closely connected to co2 dissolution dissolution of gaseous co2 during intense gas water interaction makes the circulating waters more acidic enhancing the weathering processes and increasing the dissolution of minerals from the rocks hem 1985 the upwelling of co2 is ubiquitous all over the volcanic range of the eastern carpathians and the co2 occurs both as free and as dissolved gas airinei and pricăjan 1974 vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 kis et al 2019 these co2 emissions and former hydrothermal solutions contributed to the strong alteration of the volcanic rocks and the formation of clay minerals boboș 1993 the recalculated pco2 table 2 shows values from 0 001 to 8 86 bar in good agreement with the presence of bubbling gas at all the sites with pco2 1 bar fig 10 shows the correlation of pco2 with electric conductivity as a consequence of enhanced gas water and water rock interactions elevated pco2 is mostly observed in the case of group 1 2 and 5 springs emerging from metamorphic and volcanic units the springs from group 5 exhibited also the lowest ph values according to the cart model consistent with the proximity of the youngest volcanic edifices from the eastern carpathian volcanic range and related high co2 output italiano et al 2017 kis et al 2017 kis et al 2019 as a result the springs from this group showed the highest iron content leached from volcanic rocks compared to group 1 and 2 2 6 mg l cart model fig 7 where higher iron contents were measured mostly in the proximity of the intrusive magmatic bodies e g 16 4 3 mg l in most cases the elevated hco3 and pco2 content was related to the presence of the volcanic range exceptions were shown by the springs from group 4 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 that exhibit higher pco2 and hco3 and can be explained by the tectonic fragmentation of the area that is able to enhance deep gas upwelling gheorghiu et al 1962 the tectonic fragmentation also allows mixing between aquifers which may communicate through the fault systems the low salinity and co2 rich groundwater groups 1 2 4 and 5 is fed by meteoric water moving across metamorphic and volcanogenic sediments and is characterized by artesian like discharge while another possible deeper aquifer is hosted in miocene sediments evaporites and clays and contains high salinity waters mixing may occur in different proportions during water ascent towards the surface also enhancing dilution processes with shallow groundwater this can be especially noticed in the case of group 3 where according to the cart model waters with the same hydrogeochemical facies but lower salinity were separated from the rest of the group 35 55 58 60 and 61 mixing between the main hydrogeochemical types is also illustrated by the langelier ludvig diagram fig 4 giving an explanation for the observed differences over the study area water rock interaction processes between the infiltrating waters and the host rocks mixing of aquifers through faults and co2 dissolution along the hydrogeological path are considered the possible processes responsible for the waters final geochemical features 6 2 stable isotopes and the origin of mineral waters the isotopic composition of the mineral waters fig 8 showed that most of the samples are located on the lmwl and gmwl confirming their meteoric origin our data suggest that the isotopic composition of the waters may be slightly altered due to evaporation processes kendall and caldwell 1998 or interaction with co2 italiano et al 2010 karolytė et al 2017 measurements carried out on mineral waters from the eastern slope of harghita mts exhibited the same isotopic shifts due to similar reasons fórizs et al 2011 extreme isotopic shift towards heavier deuterium and oxygen isotope composition e g sample 45 δd 12 98 δ18o 8 49 can be noticed in the case of mineral waters upwelling at several parts of the study area mostly at the southern part at corund odorheiu secuiesc mărtiniș and homorod brașov 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 56 59 93 95 fig 8 table 2 these sites appear as outliers on the pca diagrams fig 6 in which the δ18o and δd had high loadings on pc1 0 75 and 0 77 in the previous section we concluded that the main sources of dissolved constituents were the volcanic rocks of the eastern carpathians and the halite deposits of the transylvanian basin we assume the presence of two components in the investigated waters with different origin and isotopic composition interacting with the rocks one is a meteoric component located on the meteoric lines and the second is a non meteoric component with extreme isotopic shifts extreme isotopic shifts both in δ18o and δd have been observed in high and low temperature systems worldwide attributed to a wide range of processes the isotopic shift may be controlled by many factors such as temperature water rock interaction kinetics of isotopic exchange etc the most common phenomena involved in the isotopic shift are evaporation and condensation evaporation will produce the enrichment in heavy isotopes however brine produced through evaporation of seawater may also be depleted in oxygen and deuterium due to the formation of hydration sheets around ions usually evaporation of a water body has a slope of 4 6 compared to the meteoric water line horita 2005 clark and fritz 2013 in high temperature systems the oxygen isotopic shift was observed in the case of fumarole condensates from volcanoes in kamchatka where the large contrast with respect to meteoric waters was reported and the existence of a distinct andesitic component with values ranging from 40 to 0 for δd and 6 to 12 for δ18o was proposed taran et al 1989 a similar observation was reported by matsubaya 1973 for high chloride thermal waters from japan attributing the observed phenomena to an input of residual magmatic metamorphic or geothermal water the oxygen isotopic shift was discussed in detail by giggenbach 1992 who analysed magmatism associated geothermal springs along convergent plate boundaries pointing to the presence of a common magmatic end member with a narrow range of deuterium values 20 and significant shifts for oxygen reaching positive values giggenbach 1992 concluded that the source of these waters may be recycled seawater which may enter the subduction in the form of trapped porewater water of hydration in clay minerals or accumulated water in marine sediments on the ocean floor and carried with the subducting slab this trapped seawater may be later released due to compaction in the form of submarine or onshore springs or through mud volcanoes together with the recycled seawater other components like co2 n2 and cl were also assumed to be of marine origin giggenbach 1992 clearly defined the term andesitic water for the common end member however this has never been actually demonstrated in low temperature systems we cannot speak about such andesitic water but very similar isotopic values were reported for brines from sedimentary basins clayton et al 1966 graf et al 1965 graf et al 1966 the analysis of oil field brines from different sedimentary basins that include evaporitic sequences illinois michigan alberta and gulf coast showed that most of the highly mineralized formation waters were of meteoric origin different fractionation processes mainly caused the altered isotopic compositions in such cases water interacts with carbonates passing through shales and it is also released from hydrated minerals during compaction similar conclusions were drawn by hitchon and friedman 1969 the observed isotope ratios were attributed to mixing of surface water and diagenetically modified seawater followed by a process which enriches the heavy isotopes including exchange of oxygen with carbonate minerals carbonate minerals have an oxygen isotopic ratio around 20 hoefs 2009 or isotopic fractionation in the case of deuterium when passing through micropores in shales hitchon and friedman 1969 fine grained sediments like shales may contain large amounts of water which are squeezed out during compaction fractionation during membrane filtration through shales and compacted clays will produce pore waters enriched in heavy isotopes and dissolved solids light water molecules pass through a layer of shale under pressure gradients in the subsurface membrane filtration this process leaves 18o and d enriched water and dissolved salts behind when compaction and squeezing out of hydration fluids is involved we may speak about diagenetic waters such waters are usually under high pressure and come to surface along faults or through springs wells they are neither meteoric in origin nor the result of mixing of meteoric water with ocean water kharaka and hanor 2013 boschetti et al 2016 waters with high na cl ratios differing from the local meteoric waters were described in south bavaria stichler 1997 and reported also as diagenetic water the isotopic shift in the case of na cl hco3 type deep waters in the vienna basin and the bohemian massif which are rich in iodide and bromide was explained by the mixing between diagenetic marine and meteoric waters these waters were associated with gas and oil deposits buzek and michalíček 1997 porowski 2006 described waters with similar isotopic composition in the central carpathian synclinorum se poland which were also related to oil fields other na cl hco3 type waters were reported from the california coast range white 1957 as waters of connate and metamorphic origin these waters derived from reaction of ancient ocean waters and marine sediments in the western part of the polish carpathians in the flysch formations highly mineralized waters were investigated by zuber and chowaniec 2009 the isotopic composition showed values of 5 7 δ18o and 20 to 30 δd they concluded that the origin of brines is related to the dehydration of clay minerals during burial diagenesis with molecules of marine water completely replaced by molecules of released bound water reactions involving dissolved and gaseous species can cause isotopic shifts natural co2 rich mineral waters show δ18o deviations from the lmwl with no change in δd oxygen isotope deviations can be caused by equilibrium exchange between co2 and water water rock interaction meaning mineral dissolution and re precipitation isotopic exchange with minerals etc d amore and panichi 1985 karolytė et al 2017 exchange with hydrocarbons and h2s produces isotopic shifting mainly affecting the deuterium however this contribution is not yet clarified and well understood clark and fritz 1998 considering the outlet temperature ranges for the investigated saline waters any water rock interaction at high temperatures that would lead to isotopic fractionation should be excluded instead various type of low temperature processes are likely to be involved the relationships between cl and δ18o fig 11 a and between li and δ18o fig 11b distinguish waters enriched in cl of meteoric origin and waters of similar high salinity but with increased δ18o and δd see samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 56 59 93 95 table 2 most of these na cl type waters are found in the 3rd and 4th groups which are emerging from the sedimentary units of the transylvanian basin and the overlaying volcaniclastics the salinity of these waters is assumed to be due to the direct dissolution of the halite domes however halite dissolution does not produce such isotopic shift instead interactions with clay minerals is suggested to be responsible for the alteration of the chemical composition of these brines see samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 56 59 93 95 and this could be an explanation also for the enrichment in the heavy isotopes for example membrane filtration of water through clays can increase the salinity the ca2 and the trace element content e g li rb of the residual brine released bound water and compaction e g the illitization of montmorillonite could contribute to the increase of the δd and δ18o isotope concentrations kharaka and hanor 2013 zuber and chowaniec 2009 boschetti et al 2016 in our case the existing halite deposits and related hydrocarbon reservoirs in the transylvanian basin see section 2 have led some researchers to state that processes like membrane filtration diagenesis and compaction of clays had an essential role in the formation and existence of connate brines neacșu and urcan 1978 stoica and gherasie 1981 indeed based on our observations and earlier literature data i e berszán et al 2009 we can confirm that these waters have a particular and constant hydrocarbon smell and taste and they are often accompanied by black coloured kerogen like precipitates moreover these waters have also high hco3 content that is related to the co2 degassing gheorghiu et al 1962 italiano et al 2017 czellecz et al 2018 previously it was suggested that deep co2 rich solutions interact with clays marls and carbonates and form large travertine deposits when they reach the surface these are the result of interaction at the proximity of the surface with shales triggered by the presence of deep seated co2 upwelling this hypothesis was checked by drillings at the proximity of the carbonate deposits and no deep carbonates were found meanwhile the rocks showed signs of intense diagenesis including dissolution transportation precipitation processes gheorghiu et al 1962 the groundwater also contained fine particles of clay that are transported to surface as suspensions gheorghiu et al 1962 all these previous findings are in agreement with our interpretation that these highly altered isotopic compositions could be a result of interaction with clays and related diagenesis 7 conclusions we have provided detailed geochemical and statistical investigations on 121 mineral water springs and wells on the western side of the eastern carpathians and its boundary with the transylvanian basin constraining the origin of waters and the natural processes responsible for the observed physico chemical features our investigation including major components and stable isotopic composition showed that the diversity of chemical and isotopic composition can be explained in terms of contemporary occurrence of different phenomena affecting the circulating waters after their infiltration the complex geological structure of the area the alteration of rocks and differences in the solubility of minerals and interaction with co2 determines the hydrogeochemical facies of the investigated waters we identified three major hydrogeochemical types ca na mg hco3 ca na mg na ca mg hco3 cl so4 and na cl waters the variety of the hydrogeochemical types is the result of the different water rock interaction processes and of the geological diversity of the study area further changes in the geochemical features are attributable to mixing between different water types during their ascent enhanced by the tectonic setting of the area most of the mineral waters are of meteoric origin their position versus the gmwl and lmwl is influenced by evaporation and gas water interaction processes extreme shifts in oxygen and deuterium values up to 8 59 and 12 2 v smow respectively were observed in the case of 11 springs we concluded that the water interaction with clay minerals membrane filtration release of bound water and diagenesis is possibly responsible for the observed isotopic shifts of these waters future hydrogeochemical modelling could give a more precise interpretation of these processes all these investigated waters are largely consumed by the local inhabitants and represent a cultural symbol for the inhabitants all around the carpathian chain it is commonly believed that these mineral waters are not affected by any surface contamination considering that most of these waters are of meteoric origin their discharge is dependent on the rainfall and infiltration the mixing of aquifers occurs at different depths sometimes very shallow so that their exposure to contamination is high moreover the environments of some springs are not always kept clean or the edifices around the springs are deteriorated increasing the risk of possible contamination an effective protection of these water resources requires two important knowledge ingredients i future monitoring of both the chemical and microbiological parameters on local and regional scales in order to understand the potential variation of the water quality and its drivers and ii understanding the multiple socio cultural values of these springs for the local communities research from conservation social science bennett et al 2017 demonstrates the crucial importance and potential of participatory approaches in nature resource management in human shaped landscapes our future research will assess both of these components beyond the local consumption the study area is important for the mineral water bottling industry in romania the current contribution allows better understanding of the factors that control the hydrochemical features of the mineral waters the spatial distribution of the different hydrochemical types and nevertheless supports the exploration activity for the identification of new mineral

5052,the eastern carpathians along the neogene to quaternary volcanic chain host important natural resources of mineral waters most of these are in the form of co2 rich natural springs of different

decades mineral water has become a commodity of growing importance and its consumption has spread worldwide however no general consensus on how mineral water is defined has currently been reached and different definitions have been proposed by various authors and institutions reflecting different hydrochemical features health effects or microbiological purity the definitions may also be based on different criteria from country to country codex stan 108 1981 fao in the common perception of romanian consumers mineral waters are generally seen as co2 rich natural waters with specific contents of dissolved minerals collected from the source springs or dug drilled wells this is also the meaning of the term mineral water that we will use within the present contribution thus separating them from the common non mineral waters the hydrogeochemical investigation of mineral waters may provide information about the origin and quality of the water water gas rock interactions exposure to external conditions and vulnerability to pollution which is useful for the sustainable exploitation of the aquifers and in more general terms for establishing a suitable groundwater management brenčič et al

carpathians along the neogene to quaternary volcanic chain host important natural resources of mineral waters berszán et al 2009 most of these are in the form of co2 rich natural springs of different types associated with co2 gas emissions vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 the existence of these resources has boosted the development of the mineral water bottling industry about 45 of the bottled mineral waters from romania are provided by companies of this region feru 2012 consuming raw mineral water directly from the source is very popular in the area it is appreciated that thousands of people from the eastern carpathians consume non bottled mineral water on a daily basis using local mineral springs and wells as their main source of drinking water as an alternative to tap water berszán et al 2009 feru 2012 the mineral waters are associated with medical balneological services as well spas and medical treatment centres e g at borsec sângeorz băi băile homorod băile harghita băile tușnad covasna have been developed in the eastern carpathians all of them dependent on the regional water resource and its quality the first inventory of these springs dates back to the 18th century when the first monographic descriptions mentioned the importance of these resources later on several investigations focusing on the therapeutic value and geological setting of these springs have been carried out bányai 1934 molnár amărăscu 1961 pricăjan 1972 pricăjan and airinei 1979 kisgyörgy and kristó 1978 recent studies on general aspects of fluid geochemistry kis et al 2013 kis and

costinel et al 2009 magdaș et al 2009 fórizs et al 2011 ionete et al 2015 make the present day state of knowledge but the origin of the mineral waters and related geochemical processes and the potential exposure to environmental risks is still poorly constrained starting from the evidence that waters with very different features discharge in the same area this paper focuses on the western side of the eastern carpathians and its boundary with the transylvanian basin we provide detailed geochemical and statistical investigations on 121 mineral water springs wells fig 1 with the aim to better constrain the origin of waters and the natural processes responsible for the observed physical chemical features and to check the exposure and vulnerability of the hydrogeological system to both possible pollutants and environmental change 2 geological setting in romania the mountain range of the eastern carpathians covers an area of 33 500 km2 bounded in the north by the border with ukraine and the prahova valley in the south our research area covers the western sector of the carpathian mountain range from rodnei and bârgăului mountains in the north towards the călimani gurghiu harghita volcanic chain and perșani mountains in the south a 200 km long transect between the someșul mare and the olt river at the transylvanian basin boundary fig 1 the elevation ranges between 2000

perșani mts the elevation in the eastern transylvanian basin varies between 290 and 700 m a s l the climate conditions represent the transition from a basin type to a mountain type climate the amount of rainfall range from 800 mm year from basin margins to 1400 mm year on the mountain tops with differences depending on geographical orientation pop 2006 the alpine tectonic activity in the carpathian pannonian region initiated during the cretaceous with the closure of the tethys ocean the intensification of the compressional forces during the neogene led to the south west oriented subduction of a small oceanic basin beneath the continental microplates tisa dacia after the collision of these small tisa dacia microplates with the eurasian plate magma generation and magmatic activity began rădulescu and dumitrescu 1982 seghedi et al 1995 seghedi and downes 2011 the carpathian volcanic arc was developed along the inner part of the carpathian orogenic belt behind the

study area in the eastern carpathians several thousand co2 rich mineral water springs are estimated according to the studies of bányai 1934 pricăjan and airinei 1979 and airinei and pricăjan 1974 the proximity of the volcanic range favours active co2 degassing vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 the mineral waters are co2 rich and sparkling occurring in the form of bubbling pools natural springs and wells fig 2 the location of the springs is often marked by fe hydroxide and travertine deposits bányai 1934 pricăjan 1972 berszán et al 2009 the circulation of fluids is enhanced by the disruptive tectonics in the area which provides the main upwelling paths for co2 and mineral waters bányai 1934 airinei and pricăjan 1974 an important contribution to the released fluids is also given by the methane reservoirs of the transylvanian basin methane emissions that often occur as dissolved or free gases bányai 1934 molnár amărăscu and pricăjan 1961 vaselli et al 2002 baciu et al 2018 ionescu et al 2017 kis et al 2017 are related to natural gas fields of the transylvanian basin gas reservoirs are located in dome shaped anticlines at the level of middle upper miocene detrital sequences followed by thick halite horizons krézsek et al 2010 mud volcanoes and dry methane gas seeps are often associated with gas reservoirs small mud volcanoes and dry gas seeps were identified on the eastern margin of the basin at odorheiu secuiesc praid corund and homorod baciu et al 2007 etiope et al 2011 localities that were included in our analysis the waters associated to these formations can be sampled from springs as well as dug and drilled wells they may contain dissolved co2 ch4 and even h2s at various extents and high pressure vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 and have high mineralization also including high br and i contents similar to oil field brines gheorghiu et al 1962 at several locations with bubbling springs travertine deposits occur while halite precipitation was observed at the highly mineralized wells and springs fischer 1887 bányai 1934 molnár amărăscu 1961 4 material and methods 4 1 sampling and analytical methods a total of 121 sites including natural springs bathing places and wells were considered for water samples collection during the spring season in 2013 2018 since the investigated area is large and scarce information on the precise geographical position of the water sources was available the sampling locations were determined from literature descriptions maps or following the guidance of local people sampling was carried out during several field expeditions the chemical features of the mineral waters were assessed by field and laboratory measurements at babeș bolyai university and sapientia hungarian university of transylvania in cluj napoca at the sampling sites the temperature t c acidity ph redox potential orp and specific electric conductivity λ were measured using a portable multimeter ph cond 3320 wtw germany for the analysis of the major anions 1 l samples were taken in polyethylene bottles which were sealed by removing air bubbles and stored at 4 c in the dark the water was filtered with 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate filters during sampling the major anions were determined by titration hco3 cl and by turbidimetric methods so4 2 the manual titration method for the quantification of the hco3 and the potentiometric titration method for the quantification of the cl titroline alpha schott instruments gmbh germany were used the titrants for the cl and for the hco3 were a 0 01 n agno3 solution and a 0 01 n hcl solution respectively the so4 2 was determined in the form of baso4 precipitate in an acidic solution by measuring the absorbance at 410 nm on a spectrophotometer jenway 6400 usa in order to determine the major cations na k mg2 ca2 and some trace inorganic components fe2 li rb 50 ml water was filtered and sampled into a polyethylene vial and 1 ml 65 hno3 merck suprapur was added the elemental analysis was carried out using the mp aes technique mp aes 4210 spectrometer agilent usa this technique is based on the atomization and excitation of the elements in a nitrogen plasma at 4500 k temperature this analytical method enables the determination of the total iron content fe2 and fe3 but as the samples come from springs characterised by reduced and slightly acidic to neutral waters we can assume that they contain the iron exclusively in the fe2 form a 1 g l 1 cs solution prepared from cscl salt of analytical grade merck emsure was used as an ionization suppressor and matrix modifier three replicate samples of two certified reference materials tmda 70 2 canada erm ca011c uk were used for the quality assurance of the method table 3 supplementary material the ph values and the hco3 concentrations were used to estimate the pco2 the charge balance error was better than 10 besides the measured ions other components like nh4 mn2 al3 no3 br i trace metals and organic compounds with significant concentrations have also been reported in the mineral waters ibf 1961 but were not quantified in our study the δd and δ18o water isotopic measurements were performed by using a cavity enhanced absorption spectrometry analyser lgr isotope analyser los gatos research inc at the institute for geological and geochemical research in budapest and at the isotope climatology and environmental research centre institute for nuclear research in debrecen the isotopic ratios are expressed as per mil deviation with respect to the v smow standard vienna standard mean ocean water using the conventional δ18o and δd notation δ rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r represents the 18o 16o or d 1h isotopic ratio mckinney et al 1950 analytical precision for δ18o and δd is better than 0 1 and 0 6 respectively the study workflow is illustrated in the flowchart fig 1 3 included in the supplementary material 4 2 data analysis the springs were divided into 5 groups representative for the geological background of the investigated area these groups are 1 metamorphic units neogene magmatic intrusions 2 transcarpathian flysch neogene magmatic intrusions 3 transylvanian basin sediments 4 volcanic pyroclasts transylvanian basin sediments 5 volcanic pyroclasts carpathian flysch sediments statistical analyses were carried out relying on a data matrix that consisted of 121 rows representing the mineral water springs and 17 columns 16 numerical variables physico chemical and chemical parameters and a factor variable representing the geological properties of the sites the r software was used r core team 2016 version 3 6 2 released on 2019 12 12 basic statistical data were calculated we chose the median and the median absolute deviation mad for describing the variables because of the presence of some large values in almost all subgroups these statistical parameters are not sensible to the outliers non parametric methods were used for data processing since some variables did not follow the normal distribution spearman s rho rank correlation parameter was chosen for describing the correlation between the variables as well as for testing the significance of the correlation in order to reveal spatial patterns in the data distribution principal component analysis pca was used as an ordination method the importance of the principal components was evaluated according to the eigenvalues the components with eigenvalues higher than 1 were used in the data representations the outliers were easily identified on the scatter plots and discussed separately in the text the classification and regression tree cart algorithm was used as supervised learning method breiman et al 1984 this method requires no prior assumptions about the dataset it is robust and easily interpretable for computation and representation of cart the rpart and rpart plot packages were used the nodes of the tree were created relying on the gini index information gain as splitting criteria the model performance was evaluated by the accuracy and kappa values the closer these values are to unity the better the performance of the model we tested the model by creating a random subsample of the dataset taking 30 of the objects the confusionmatrix function of the caret package provided the confident interval of the accuracy for this subsample 5 results the results of the field measurements together with the location wgs84 geographic coordinates of the sampling sites are listed in table 1 and marked on fig 1 detailed information on the locations are found in figs 1 1 and 1 2 from the supplementary material the analytical results of both chemical major ions and isotopic composition δ18o and δd are listed in table 2 the detailed basic statistical data are given in the supplementary material table 4 the physico chemical parameters measured in the field show wide spatial variability temperatures range from 3 to 25 0 c ph between 4 91 and 8 49 redox potential between 106 6 and 152 6 mv and electrical conductivity ec between 0 166 and 248 ms cm 5 1 water chemistry the wide range of electrical conductivity is the result of a variety of geochemical features of the sampled waters depending on the specific features of the sampling area the ionic composition of waters may vary within an extended range among the major ions na and cl may reach the highest abundance displaying concentrations between 2 69 and 181 500 mg l and between 1 52 and 209 700 mg l respectively the concentrations of the other major ions vary between the following limits ca2 6 75 3 794 mg l k 0 15 3 684 mg l mg2 1 14 1 738 mg l so4 2 0 4 228 mg l and hco3 63 7 540 mg l the hydrogeochemical facies of the 121 investigated samples were evaluated by using the piper and langelier ludwig diagrams figs 3 and 4 more detailed versions of the plots indicating the sample id of each point are included in the supplementary material fig 4 1 the distribution of the collected samples on the piper plot suggests the existence of three major hydrochemical types ca na mg hco3 ca na mg na ca mg hco3 cl so4 and na cl waters a ca na mg hco3 waters predominantly consisting of samples from group 5 emerging from flysch units covered by neogene volcanic pyroclasts few samples from groups 1 2 and 4 also fall within this field the dominant anion is hco3 90 while ca2 mg2 generally exceed 50 b ca na mg na ca mg hco3 cl so4 waters the majority of the studied waters belong to this hydrogeochemical type it contains mainly samples from groups 1 2 and 4 but some samples from group 5 and 3 also plot here these waters are mainly associated with the metamorphic and transcarpathian flysch units from the northern area pierced by neogene intrusions groups 1 and 2 and with the transylvanian basin sediments covered by volcanic pyroclasts group 4 the so4 2 anion is generally absent its occurrence is specific for few samples from groups 1 2 4 and 5 that are included in the ca na mg hco3 cl so4 field c na cl waters contains the highly saline waters from group 3 and 4 from the sedimentary units of the transylvanian basin often intersecting volcanic pyroclasts it is interesting to note that waters from group 4 show the largest variability and are well represented within all 3 hydrochemical types 5 2 multivariate statistics according to the values obtained from the spearman s rho correlation coefficient we found strong positive correlation between cl na ca2 mg2 k and the electrical conductivity as well as between δd and δ18o there was a strong negative correlation between the ph and the redox potential and between the ph and fe2 fig 5 the detailed results including the significance of the paired correlations are given in the supplementary material table 5 a pca analysis based on the chemical and the isotope data was carried out and is shown in fig 6 the first three principal components pcs fig 6 presented eigenvalues higher than unity altogether these pcs explained 77 9 of the variance the δ18o δd and k had the highest contributions to pc1 0 75 0 77 and 0 61 the li ca2 and rb had the highest loadings on pc2 0 38 0 35 and 0 35 and fe2 had the highest loading on pc3 0 58 in the planes of the pc pairs eight outliers were identified 45 47 48 59 65 89 95 105 a classification tree cart model fig 7 was built based on all 16 variables the variables with the most discriminative power were cl hco3 fe2 ph δ18o li and temperature the overall accuracy of the model was of 0 835 with a confidence interval ci of 0 7563 0 896 at 0 05 significance level the kappa value of the model was 0 782 when testing the model with a 30 randomly selected subsample an accuracy of 0 842 with a confidence interval of ci 0 6875 0 9398 was found nevertheless the specificity of the model was higher than 90 for all groups exhibiting the highest levels for the 1st 98 and the 3rd 99 groups according to the classification tree cart model the studied waters could be separated into two major divisions 1 highly saline waters and 2 low salinity waters the first division is composed mainly of the samples from the 3rd group 85 of the total samples from this group and the 4th group 32 of this group and it also contained the sample 21 from the 2nd group further the highly saline waters could be separated into high and low hco3 content waters we found that almost all highly saline waters from the 3rd group had relatively low concentrations of hco3 1068 mg l on the other hand highly saline waters from the 4th group were considerably richer in hco3 the low salinity waters were primarily distinct in the fe2 content the samples from the 4th and the 5th groups exhibited higher fe2 concentrations 2 6 mg l while the samples from the 1st and 2nd groups contained less iron regarding the 4th and 5th group the samples differed mainly in the acidity the 5th group samples being more acidic ph 5 9 than the 4th ones some samples showed unique chemical composition for example the 21 sample from the 2nd group was the only one having cl content higher than 2 g l although the sample 88 from the 4th group was highly saline it contained less hco3 than the other saline waters five samples from the 3rd group had low nacl content from them two 35 and 55 were poorer and three 58 60 61 were richer in fe2 the sample 16 from the 1st group exhibited an unexpectedly high fe2 concentration 4 3 mg l 5 3 stable isotopic composition the δd δ18o diagram fig 8 shows the distribution of the samples with respect to the global meteoric water line gmwl rozanski et al 2013 and the local rainwater isotope composition local meteoric water line lmwl of bodoc after ionete et al 2015 the isotopic composition of the sampled waters shows δ18o values ranging between 12 01 and 8 59 v smow with δd between 87 98 and 12 20 v smow thus most of the springs lie close to the lmwl and gmwl 6 discussion as already noted the water samples were collected along a 200 km transect in the eastern carpathians that has intersected volcanic metamorphic and sedimentary formations including evaporites fig 1 table 1 this geological variety assumes different processes affecting the dissolved chemical components of the groundwater proven also by the large variability recorded in the physical and chemical composition of the collected waters table 2 to gain insight into the main possible processes that affect the mineral water springs in the study area we investigated the possible origin of the major solutes and the origin of water by their stable isotopic composition 6 1 origin of the major solutes evidence from multivariate statistics based on the evaluation of the chemical composition of the investigated waters showed their grouping according to their geological origin salinity proved to be the main differentiating factor besides other components like ph isotopic composition and specific ions hco3 li rb fe2 thus the most saline waters of group 3 and 4 originating from sedimentary units were separated from the rest of the sites both on the pca diagrams fig 6 and cart model fig 7 the wide range of mineralization exhibited by the springs is consistent with water rock interactions and mixing between different hydrogeochemical types figs 3 and 4 the contrasting hydrogeochemical facies within the study area is mainly due to the cl na k mg2 and ca2 contents which show the most positive correlation with the electrical conductivity fig 5 thus they are the main ions responsible for the salinity of waters considering the widespread presence of evaporitic formations the main na source is likely to be the halite dissolution there are large salt deposits in the transylvanian basin which outcrop at some areas e g bistrița praid homorod while in other places they are close to the surface below the volcaniclastic layers e g vlăhiţa and odorheiu secuiesc bányai 1929 1934 1942 molnár amărăscu and pricăjan 1961 ticleanu et al 1980 due to the high halite solubility the na and cl content of the springs from the transylvanian basin is also high leading to elevated electrical conductivity values and explaining the outstanding representation of saline waters in the group 3 85 and group 4 32 in the cart model fig 7 if halite dissolution is the only source for na and cl content of the waters the cl content in this case should be in stoichiometric equivalent mass ratio with na from halite or similar to the original seawater na cl ratio 1 or 0 88 respectively ghabayen et al 2006 the na cl ratio for the whole dataset ranges between 0 45 sample 110 and 14 15 sample 112 table 2 fig 9 suggesting different sources for these elements ratios equal or close to unity are in agreement with halite dissolution and are represented by highly mineralized na cl type waters of the transylvanian basin 3rd group fig 9 na cl ratios below unity 0 4 0 6 suggest that besides halite dissolution other water rock interaction processes may also occur these water rock interaction processes modify the original composition of the brines the reactions that may occur are 1 base exchange reaction in saline environments with clay minerals which decrease the na and increase the ca2 and mg2 content of the solution vengosh et al 1999 ghabayen et al 2006 cartwright et al 2002 and or 2 evaporation of the original brine followed by halite and carbonate precipitation ghabayen et al 2006 interaction and ion exchange with clays in the transylvanian basin may be possible due to the presence of clay minerals like illites kaolinites and montmorillonites within the sediments and also in the halite gheorghiu et al 1962 neacșu and urcan 1978 trace elements like li and rb are concentrated and incorporated in the crystal structure of clay minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite horstman 1957 interaction and weathering processes could increase the li and rb concentration of the solution such water rock interaction processes are suggested by the elevated li and rb content of some springs from corund samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 also with low na cl ratios evaporation processes are indicated by the halite deposition samples 30 31 32 33 34 36 37 41 57 88 92 95 from group 3 that appear right at the emergence of the springs and wells fig 2 c fischer 1887 and sometimes also carbonate deposition occurs samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 from group 4 due to co2 loss fig 2 d bányai 1934 gheorghiu et al 1962 italiano et al 2017 the elevated na cl ratios up to 14 16 table 2 show the input of na from other sources besides evaporites the volcanic range is characterized by widespread volcaniclastics which were deposited on the sedimentary units of the transylvanian basin szakács and krézsek 2006 interaction with volcanic rocks alteration of feldspars could explain the input of na to the solutions moreover na cl ratios increase from the sedimentary units towards the volcanic range e g sample 112 from group 5 with the highest na cl ratio of 14 16 table 2 fig 9 this sample is located in the volcanic range of harghita mts where water rock interaction affecting the volcanic rocks is enhanced also by the presence of co2 of deep origin dissolved in the groundwater italiano et al 2017 kis et al 2019 the presence of hco3 in the waters is closely connected to co2 dissolution dissolution of gaseous co2 during intense gas water interaction makes the circulating waters more acidic enhancing the weathering processes and increasing the dissolution of minerals from the rocks hem 1985 the upwelling of co2 is ubiquitous all over the volcanic range of the eastern carpathians and the co2 occurs both as free and as dissolved gas airinei and pricăjan 1974 vaselli et al 2002 italiano et al 2017 kis et al 2019 these co2 emissions and former hydrothermal solutions contributed to the strong alteration of the volcanic rocks and the formation of clay minerals boboș 1993 the recalculated pco2 table 2 shows values from 0 001 to 8 86 bar in good agreement with the presence of bubbling gas at all the sites with pco2 1 bar fig 10 shows the correlation of pco2 with electric conductivity as a consequence of enhanced gas water and water rock interactions elevated pco2 is mostly observed in the case of group 1 2 and 5 springs emerging from metamorphic and volcanic units the springs from group 5 exhibited also the lowest ph values according to the cart model consistent with the proximity of the youngest volcanic edifices from the eastern carpathian volcanic range and related high co2 output italiano et al 2017 kis et al 2017 kis et al 2019 as a result the springs from this group showed the highest iron content leached from volcanic rocks compared to group 1 and 2 2 6 mg l cart model fig 7 where higher iron contents were measured mostly in the proximity of the intrusive magmatic bodies e g 16 4 3 mg l in most cases the elevated hco3 and pco2 content was related to the presence of the volcanic range exceptions were shown by the springs from group 4 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 that exhibit higher pco2 and hco3 and can be explained by the tectonic fragmentation of the area that is able to enhance deep gas upwelling gheorghiu et al 1962 the tectonic fragmentation also allows mixing between aquifers which may communicate through the fault systems the low salinity and co2 rich groundwater groups 1 2 4 and 5 is fed by meteoric water moving across metamorphic and volcanogenic sediments and is characterized by artesian like discharge while another possible deeper aquifer is hosted in miocene sediments evaporites and clays and contains high salinity waters mixing may occur in different proportions during water ascent towards the surface also enhancing dilution processes with shallow groundwater this can be especially noticed in the case of group 3 where according to the cart model waters with the same hydrogeochemical facies but lower salinity were separated from the rest of the group 35 55 58 60 and 61 mixing between the main hydrogeochemical types is also illustrated by the langelier ludvig diagram fig 4 giving an explanation for the observed differences over the study area water rock interaction processes between the infiltrating waters and the host rocks mixing of aquifers through faults and co2 dissolution along the hydrogeological path are considered the possible processes responsible for the waters final geochemical features 6 2 stable isotopes and the origin of mineral waters the isotopic composition of the mineral waters fig 8 showed that most of the samples are located on the lmwl and gmwl confirming their meteoric origin our data suggest that the isotopic composition of the waters may be slightly altered due to evaporation processes kendall and caldwell 1998 or interaction with co2 italiano et al 2010 karolytė et al 2017 measurements carried out on mineral waters from the eastern slope of harghita mts exhibited the same isotopic shifts due to similar reasons fórizs et al 2011 extreme isotopic shift towards heavier deuterium and oxygen isotope composition e g sample 45 δd 12 98 δ18o 8 49 can be noticed in the case of mineral waters upwelling at several parts of the study area mostly at the southern part at corund odorheiu secuiesc mărtiniș and homorod brașov 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 56 59 93 95 fig 8 table 2 these sites appear as outliers on the pca diagrams fig 6 in which the δ18o and δd had high loadings on pc1 0 75 and 0 77 in the previous section we concluded that the main sources of dissolved constituents were the volcanic rocks of the eastern carpathians and the halite deposits of the transylvanian basin we assume the presence of two components in the investigated waters with different origin and isotopic composition interacting with the rocks one is a meteoric component located on the meteoric lines and the second is a non meteoric component with extreme isotopic shifts extreme isotopic shifts both in δ18o and δd have been observed in high and low temperature systems worldwide attributed to a wide range of processes the isotopic shift may be controlled by many factors such as temperature water rock interaction kinetics of isotopic exchange etc the most common phenomena involved in the isotopic shift are evaporation and condensation evaporation will produce the enrichment in heavy isotopes however brine produced through evaporation of seawater may also be depleted in oxygen and deuterium due to the formation of hydration sheets around ions usually evaporation of a water body has a slope of 4 6 compared to the meteoric water line horita 2005 clark and fritz 2013 in high temperature systems the oxygen isotopic shift was observed in the case of fumarole condensates from volcanoes in kamchatka where the large contrast with respect to meteoric waters was reported and the existence of a distinct andesitic component with values ranging from 40 to 0 for δd and 6 to 12 for δ18o was proposed taran et al 1989 a similar observation was reported by matsubaya 1973 for high chloride thermal waters from japan attributing the observed phenomena to an input of residual magmatic metamorphic or geothermal water the oxygen isotopic shift was discussed in detail by giggenbach 1992 who analysed magmatism associated geothermal springs along convergent plate boundaries pointing to the presence of a common magmatic end member with a narrow range of deuterium values 20 and significant shifts for oxygen reaching positive values giggenbach 1992 concluded that the source of these waters may be recycled seawater which may enter the subduction in the form of trapped porewater water of hydration in clay minerals or accumulated water in marine sediments on the ocean floor and carried with the subducting slab this trapped seawater may be later released due to compaction in the form of submarine or onshore springs or through mud volcanoes together with the recycled seawater other components like co2 n2 and cl were also assumed to be of marine origin giggenbach 1992 clearly defined the term andesitic water for the common end member however this has never been actually demonstrated in low temperature systems we cannot speak about such andesitic water but very similar isotopic values were reported for brines from sedimentary basins clayton et al 1966 graf et al 1965 graf et al 1966 the analysis of oil field brines from different sedimentary basins that include evaporitic sequences illinois michigan alberta and gulf coast showed that most of the highly mineralized formation waters were of meteoric origin different fractionation processes mainly caused the altered isotopic compositions in such cases water interacts with carbonates passing through shales and it is also released from hydrated minerals during compaction similar conclusions were drawn by hitchon and friedman 1969 the observed isotope ratios were attributed to mixing of surface water and diagenetically modified seawater followed by a process which enriches the heavy isotopes including exchange of oxygen with carbonate minerals carbonate minerals have an oxygen isotopic ratio around 20 hoefs 2009 or isotopic fractionation in the case of deuterium when passing through micropores in shales hitchon and friedman 1969 fine grained sediments like shales may contain large amounts of water which are squeezed out during compaction fractionation during membrane filtration through shales and compacted clays will produce pore waters enriched in heavy isotopes and dissolved solids light water molecules pass through a layer of shale under pressure gradients in the subsurface membrane filtration this process leaves 18o and d enriched water and dissolved salts behind when compaction and squeezing out of hydration fluids is involved we may speak about diagenetic waters such waters are usually under high pressure and come to surface along faults or through springs wells they are neither meteoric in origin nor the result of mixing of meteoric water with ocean water kharaka and hanor 2013 boschetti et al 2016 waters with high na cl ratios differing from the local meteoric waters were described in south bavaria stichler 1997 and reported also as diagenetic water the isotopic shift in the case of na cl hco3 type deep waters in the vienna basin and the bohemian massif which are rich in iodide and bromide was explained by the mixing between diagenetic marine and meteoric waters these waters were associated with gas and oil deposits buzek and michalíček 1997 porowski 2006 described waters with similar isotopic composition in the central carpathian synclinorum se poland which were also related to oil fields other na cl hco3 type waters were reported from the california coast range white 1957 as waters of connate and metamorphic origin these waters derived from reaction of ancient ocean waters and marine sediments in the western part of the polish carpathians in the flysch formations highly mineralized waters were investigated by zuber and chowaniec 2009 the isotopic composition showed values of 5 7 δ18o and 20 to 30 δd they concluded that the origin of brines is related to the dehydration of clay minerals during burial diagenesis with molecules of marine water completely replaced by molecules of released bound water reactions involving dissolved and gaseous species can cause isotopic shifts natural co2 rich mineral waters show δ18o deviations from the lmwl with no change in δd oxygen isotope deviations can be caused by equilibrium exchange between co2 and water water rock interaction meaning mineral dissolution and re precipitation isotopic exchange with minerals etc d amore and panichi 1985 karolytė et al 2017 exchange with hydrocarbons and h2s produces isotopic shifting mainly affecting the deuterium however this contribution is not yet clarified and well understood clark and fritz 1998 considering the outlet temperature ranges for the investigated saline waters any water rock interaction at high temperatures that would lead to isotopic fractionation should be excluded instead various type of low temperature processes are likely to be involved the relationships between cl and δ18o fig 11 a and between li and δ18o fig 11b distinguish waters enriched in cl of meteoric origin and waters of similar high salinity but with increased δ18o and δd see samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 56 59 93 95 table 2 most of these na cl type waters are found in the 3rd and 4th groups which are emerging from the sedimentary units of the transylvanian basin and the overlaying volcaniclastics the salinity of these waters is assumed to be due to the direct dissolution of the halite domes however halite dissolution does not produce such isotopic shift instead interactions with clay minerals is suggested to be responsible for the alteration of the chemical composition of these brines see samples 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 56 59 93 95 and this could be an explanation also for the enrichment in the heavy isotopes for example membrane filtration of water through clays can increase the salinity the ca2 and the trace element content e g li rb of the residual brine released bound water and compaction e g the illitization of montmorillonite could contribute to the increase of the δd and δ18o isotope concentrations kharaka and hanor 2013 zuber and chowaniec 2009 boschetti et al 2016 in our case the existing halite deposits and related hydrocarbon reservoirs in the transylvanian basin see section 2 have led some researchers to state that processes like membrane filtration diagenesis and compaction of clays had an essential role in the formation and existence of connate brines neacșu and urcan 1978 stoica and gherasie 1981 indeed based on our observations and earlier literature data i e berszán et al 2009 we can confirm that these waters have a particular and constant hydrocarbon smell and taste and they are often accompanied by black coloured kerogen like precipitates moreover these waters have also high hco3 content that is related to the co2 degassing gheorghiu et al 1962 italiano et al 2017 czellecz et al 2018 previously it was suggested that deep co2 rich solutions interact with clays marls and carbonates and form large travertine deposits when they reach the surface these are the result of interaction at the proximity of the surface with shales triggered by the presence of deep seated co2 upwelling this hypothesis was checked by drillings at the proximity of the carbonate deposits and no deep carbonates were found meanwhile the rocks showed signs of intense diagenesis including dissolution transportation precipitation processes gheorghiu et al 1962 the groundwater also contained fine particles of clay that are transported to surface as suspensions gheorghiu et al 1962 all these previous findings are in agreement with our interpretation that these highly altered isotopic compositions could be a result of interaction with clays and related diagenesis 7 conclusions we have provided detailed geochemical and statistical investigations on 121 mineral water springs and wells on the western side of the eastern carpathians and its boundary with the transylvanian basin constraining the origin of waters and the natural processes responsible for the observed physico chemical features our investigation including major components and stable isotopic composition showed that the diversity of chemical and isotopic composition can be explained in terms of contemporary occurrence of different phenomena affecting the circulating waters after their infiltration the complex geological structure of the area the alteration of rocks and differences in the solubility of minerals and interaction with co2 determines the hydrogeochemical facies of the investigated waters we identified three major hydrogeochemical types ca na mg hco3 ca na mg na ca mg hco3 cl so4 and na cl waters the variety of the hydrogeochemical types is the result of the different water rock interaction processes and of the geological diversity of the study area further changes in the geochemical features are attributable to mixing between different water types during their ascent enhanced by the tectonic setting of the area most of the mineral waters are of meteoric origin their position versus the gmwl and lmwl is influenced by evaporation and gas water interaction processes extreme shifts in oxygen and deuterium values up to 8 59 and 12 2 v smow respectively were observed in the case of 11 springs we concluded that the water interaction with clay minerals membrane filtration release of bound water and diagenesis is possibly responsible for the observed isotopic shifts of these waters future hydrogeochemical modelling could give a more precise interpretation of these processes all these investigated waters are largely consumed by the local inhabitants and represent a cultural symbol for the inhabitants all around the carpathian chain it is commonly believed that these mineral waters are not affected by any surface contamination considering that most of these waters are of meteoric origin their discharge is dependent on the rainfall and infiltration the mixing of aquifers occurs at different depths sometimes very shallow so that their exposure to contamination is high moreover the environments of some springs are not always kept clean or the edifices around the springs are deteriorated increasing the risk of possible contamination an effective protection of these water resources requires two important knowledge ingredients i future monitoring of both the chemical and microbiological parameters on local and regional scales in order to understand the potential variation of the water quality and its drivers and ii understanding the multiple socio cultural values of these springs for the local communities research from conservation social science bennett et al 2017 demonstrates the crucial importance and potential of participatory approaches in nature resource management in human shaped landscapes our future research will assess both of these components beyond the local consumption the study area is important for the mineral water bottling industry in romania the current contribution allows better understanding of the factors that control the hydrochemical features of the mineral waters the spatial distribution of the different hydrochemical types and nevertheless supports the exploration activity for the identification of new mineral

5053,analyzing river basins as coupled human and hydrological systems is important to advance our understanding of hydrological processes and to provide insights into policy design for water resources management however assessing spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic characteristics of human hydrological interactions remains a challenge and relevant research has been limited by the lack of computationally tractable models that can integrate water management policies human activities and hydrological conditions with sufficient temporal and spatial details in this study we propose a modeling framework that tightly couples 1 an agent based model for farmers decision making on water use influenced by collective water management policies and 2 a distributed hydrological model for simulating integrated groundwater surface water processes with high spatial and temporal resolutions we apply the modeling framework to the heihe river basin a large semi arid river basin with intensive agriculture in china through various policy portfolio analyses the model has identified several unique spatial temporal characteristics of human hydrological interactions these include 1 nonlinear relationships between water policies farmers decisions on water use and hydrological conditions 2 spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policies on farmers conjunctive groundwater and surface water use and 3 location dependent temporal patterns regarding water policies influences on hydrological processes it is found that regional hydrogeological conditions e g depth to water table distance to rivers are key factors to influence human hydrological interactions the modeling results could advance our understanding of the role of human activities in hydrological cycles and yield insights into the design of location based policies for river basin management keywords coupled human and natural systems agent based model policy portfolio analysis gsflow groundwater surface water interactions heihe river basin 1 introduction in recent decades humans have been playing an increasingly active role in hydrological systems the natural hydrological cycles have been converted to coupled human natural systems chns cai et al 2015 cheng and li 2015 li et al 2018a liu et al 2007 reddy and syme 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 in regions with intense agriculture human activities e g crop planting irrigation have noticeably re shaped hydrological systems e g change of stream flow regimes groundwater depletion on the other hand the altered hydrological regimes have in turn affected human activities especially in intensively irrigated areas lawston et al 2017 nie et al 2018 ozdogan et al 2010 for example decades of expansion of irrigation fed agriculture in the republican river basin of the u s have significantly depleted groundwater and reduced stream flow since 1960s causing concerns for sustainable watershed development and conflicts among the three states i e colorado nebraska and kansas that share the river basin scanlon et al 2012 to address this issue the natural resources districts and local water management institutions have implemented groundwater management policies to regulate farmers groundwater pumping activities lauer et al 2018 feedbacks and interactions between hydrological systems and human activities have also been observed in many other regions around the world such as the murray darling river basin in australia kandasamy et al 2014 wheeler et al 2013 the saskatchewan river basin in canada hassanzadeh et al 2014 the central valley in the u s marston and konar 2017 and the heihe river basin in china cheng et al 2014 song and zhang 2015 understanding the coevolution and dynamics of human nature interactions is critical for holistic river basin management elshafei et al 2014 human hydrological interaction is an important type of human nature interactions understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of human hydrological interactions can provide policy implications for more informed water resources management in river basins to analyze human hydrological interactions with intensive agricultural water use it is fundamentally important to develop integrated modeling frameworks that can adequately represent 1 physically based hydrological processes 2 farmers behaviors driven by economic and social principles and 3 the reciprocal connections between these two components cai 2008 giulian et al 2016 hassanzadeh et al 2014 van heerden et al 2008 tremendous efforts have focused on developing hydrologic agronomic economic models to integrate economic agricultural and hydrological components in a coherent manner for water resources management cai et al 2002 esteve et al 2015 george et al 2011 harou et al 2009 hrozencik et al 2017 schmitz et al 2014 in recent years literatures have increasingly recognized the need to explicitly represent the complex characteristics of farmers empirical decision processes in complex decision problems an individual s decision is typically subject to bounded rationality due to the lack of sufficient and reliable information for decision making the lack of time and or limited intellectual ability for evaluating all of the possible choices and their consequences and emotional arousal that may affect human s cognitive capabilities these will constrain an individual s decision making and lead to sub optimal satisfying decisions rather than the global optimal decision kaufman 1999 puranam et al 2015 compared with the optimization approach agent based model abm has received particular attention in modeling human activities an 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 in an abm each decision unit e g farmer is defined as an agent with a set of attributes and behavioral rules farmer and foley 2009 janssen and ostrom 2006 an agent s decision rule could either be represented by a classic economic optimization principle or by an intuitive rule of thumb principle that might not necessarily be perfectly optimal doran 2001 farmer and foley 2009 yang et al 2012 therefore abm provides more flexible methodologies to represent agents behaviors and their inter connections reeves and zellner 2010 in agricultural systems abms have been used to simulate some important characteristics of farmers behaviors observed in empirical studies such as behavioral heterogeneity collective interactions and social learning ghoulmie et al 2005 abms have also been employed to simulating complex adaptive systems in a variety of domains including but not limited to socio ecological systems filatova et al 2013 ostrom 2009 smajgl et al 2011 land use and land cover change filatova et al 2009 groeneveld et al 2017 matthews et al 2007 economics and finance rekik et al 2014 and transportation and traffic simulation aschwanden et al 2012 du et al 2017b some studies have applied abm to model farmers behaviors in agricultural systems barthel et al 2005 dermody et al 2018 galán et al 2009 kelly et al 2013 in particular there have been several studies that couple abm and hydrological models for water resources management hu et al 2015a lei et al 2019 noël and cai 2017 for example hu et al 2015a couple abm with modflow a three dimensional groundwater model to understand the interactions between farmers pumping behaviors and groundwater table change in the republican river basin noel and cai 2017 integrate abm and modflow to investigate the impacts of farmers individual behaviors i e farmers sensitivity to soil water deficit on water use agricultural production and groundwater drawdown in the republican river basin similarly lei et al 2019 integrate abm and modflow to compare the economic and environmental effects of market based and administrative based water management schemes in particular mulligan et al 2014 couple an agent based decision model and modflow to assess the benefit of water management policies e g tax and quota on groundwater withdraw under the influence of agents various decision mechanisms e g centralized and decentralized optimization in the republican river basin following this study khan and brown 2019 incorporate farmers water permit trading behaviors in the economic hydrologic model to simulate a groundwater market and systematically evaluate the impacts of hydrogeological and climate variability on the performance of the water market the results emphasize the importance to consider the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in the hydrogeological and climate conditions when designing and implementing water management policies in large river basins these studies have greatly advanced the development of integrated abm and hydrological models for water resources management in the context of chns however limitations and challenges still remain in these coupled models firstly from the perspective of model coupling strategies these studies typically couple an abm and a hydrological model in a loose manner that is the model integration is achieved through the exchange of input output files when different models need data transfers however reading processing and writing these exchange files can be inefficient error prone and computational expensive bhatt et al 2014 this limits the coupled models capability to simulate frequent interactions e g daily between abms and hydrological models especially in large river basins with large amounts of data in addition it is difficult to achieve synchronous exchange of information between abms and hydrological models through loose coupling to accurately simulate feedback between human behaviors and hydrology a coupling method that allows for the two way exchange of information is desired unlike the loose coupling method the tight coupling method uses a common data pool to exchange data between multiple models therefore the tight coupling method can significantly reduce data exchange redundancy making the integrated model suitable for water system analysis in large river basins moreover the source code and or functional components of different models can be embedded together into a consistent modeling system bhatt et al 2014 two way exchanges of information between an abm and a hydrological model could be achieved through iteration level coupling however to our best knowledge coupling an abm and a distributed hydrological model via a tight manner has been rarely achieved in previous studies secondly the abms and hydrological models in these studies are often not consistent in the temporal and or spatial resolutions for example some studies have aggregated farmers daily water use into weekly or monthly water withdraw as input to the hydrological model in the model coupling processes e g hu et al 2015a similarly studies have also used a sub region or sub basin to represent a water use agent aggregating field scale daily water use into regional water consumption while the computational units of distributed hydrological models are often at the field scale e g 1 km 1 km hydrological response unit e g lei et al 2019 the inconsistent model resolutions between abms and hydrological models imposes challenges for the coupled models to accurately simulate and capture the interactions between agents decisions and hydrological responses with sufficient spatial and temporal details moreover for the abms developed by previous studies typically only one type of water policy e g water price from an economic perspective is considered this limits the application of the abms for modeling water policy portfolio with mixed policies e g both economic and environmental policies required for some real world water management problems in two recent studies hrozencik et al 2017 and mulligan et al 2014 consider multiple water policies for aquifer management in the republican river basin the results from these studies show that mixed policies can exhibit complex and heterogeneous impacts on water resources system across the river basin thirdly for the hydrological models used in previous coupled modeling framework most of them mainly focus on groundwater gw e g noel and cai 2017 lei et al 2019 mulligan et al 2014 khan and brown 2019 without fully considering surface water sw and more importantly the interactions between gw and sw in water resources systems studies have shown that sw gw exchange can significantly complicate hydrological modeling processes as well as water management policy analysis elbakidze et al 2018 tian et al 2015a in many arid and semiarid regions both gw and sw and the interactions between the two play an important role in hydrological processes and should be taken account of when developing integrated water management models gilfedder et al 2012 shanafield et al 2012 motivated by the above research needs this study proposes a modeling framework that couples 1 an abm that incorporates water policy portfolio consisting of mixed water management policies and farmers decision making of water use at field scales and 2 gsflow an integrated groundwater surface water hydrological model it is important to highlight that the abm and gsflow in this study are coupled in a tight manner i e the two models are coupled at the source code level and therefore has addressed the computational challenge and synchronous data exchange issue that are typically faced by loosely coupled models making it computationally efficient when applied in large river basins in addition the abm and gsflow have consistent high spatial and temporal resolution i e field scale and daily time step providing sufficient spatial and temporal details of the interactions between human activities and hydrological processes with the integration of abm and gsflow we can assess how human influences i e represented by abm can affect the interaction of groundwater and surface water and to evaluate how multiple policies affect hydrological processes in large river basins for illustrative purpose the modeling framework is applied to the heihe river basin hrb to demonstrate its functionalities and capabilities for the analysis of large river basins as chns the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the modeling framework including abm section 2 1 gsflow section 2 2 and how the two models are coupled together section 2 3 section 3 gives an overview of the study site section 4 presents the modeling results followed by conclusions and future work in section 5 2 modeling framework as shown in fig 1 the modeling framework consists of 1 an abm that simulates farmers decision making of water use under the influence of water management policies and 2 gsflow that simulates integrated groundwater surface water hydrological processes abm and gsflow are coupled at the daily and field scales reasonable temporal and spatial scales for farmers water use decision and hydrological simulation droogers et al 2010 markstrom et al 2008 detailed introductions to the model components and model coupling methodologies are provided in the following sections 2 1 development of the abm 2 1 1 overview of the abm architecture the design of the abm in this study follows the standard odd principle i e overview design concepts and details proposed by grimm et al 2006 fig 2 overviews the architecture of the abm which specifies the types of agents and the flowchart of their decision making processes in a water management scheme consisting of a basin level water management authority and a group of water users in the basin the abm considers two types of agents 1 a water management agent type i and 2 a number of water use agents i e farmers type ii the water management agent represents a basin level water management authority miro 2012 in this study the water management agent influences farmers water use activities by designing and implementing a collection of water management policies i e policy portfolio this extends some previous abms that mainly focus on one type of water management policy e g water price from economic perspective in yang et al 2012 making the abm more flexible to be applied to river basins with multiple policies e g economic and environmental for water resources management water use agent i e farmer denoted by index j 1 2 j makes decisions on irrigation scheduling in terms of when and with how much water to irrigate crops andales et al 2011 note that a farmer s irrigation decision can be affected by water management policies and or hydrological conditions for example an increase in groundwater pumping cost will result in farmers less groundwater withdraw the next sections will specifically introduce the water management policies section 2 1 2 and farmers irrigation decisions section 2 1 3 2 1 2 water management policy portfolio let φ denote the policy portfolio designed and implemented by the water management agent following previous studies on water management in agricultural systems brennan 2006 harou and lund 2008 hrozencik et al 2017 lahtinen et al 2017 here we consider policies for both groundwater and surface water management in the watershed for groundwater management we first consider a groundwater resource fee denoted by ϕ gw the price that a farmer needs to pay for each unit of groundwater similar to the concept of groundwater tax as an economic instrument for groundwater management harou and lund 2008 second in order to reflect the environmental concerns of aquifer depletion faced by many groundwater fed regions around the world condon and maxwell 2019 richter et al 2013 we include two additional policies namely a managed allowable groundwater table decline limit denoted by ξ and a penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation denoted by η if water table decline d exceeds its limit ξ a penalty fee denoted by ϕ penalty will be imposed which can be represented by eq 1 1 ϕ penalty 0 when η d ξ when d ξ d ξ note that the penalty term ϕ penalty for groundwater over exploitation may cause fairness issue among farmers that share an aquifer since the water table for a well can be affected by the pumping of other wells in the near neighbor due to the cone of depression phenomena in groundwater systems in this regard a farmer who uses little groundwater might be imposed with a penalty if his neighboring farmers extensively withdraw groundwater and this issue will be more significant if their pumping wells are closer to each other however in our model the effects of penalty are analyzed based on irrigation districts with large area the average area of irrigation districts in our case study site is around 110 km2 so the policy externality issue is less significant compared with that for neighboring wells typically several hundred meters away to completely resolve the fairness issue policy makers can set a large value for water table decline limit ξ and use groundwater resource fee ϕ gw to regulate farmers pumping behaviors for surface water management similar to groundwater management we use a surface water resource fee denoted by ϕ sw the price that a farmer needs to pay for each unit of surface water diverted from river as an economic instrument in addition surface water management could also include a quantity restriction to reflect a water user s water permit and or water availability under the influence of hydrological conditions hansen et al 2015 zheng et al 2012 given the aforementioned policy parameters the water management agent s policy portfolio φ can be represented by notation φ ϕ sw ϕ gw ξ η the proposed water policy portfolio φ here can be applied to address hydrological and environmental issues in river basins for example to address aquifer depletion issue and reduce groundwater pumping the water management agent can implement stricter groundwater use constraints by setting a higher groundwater resource fee ϕ gw a smaller groundwater decline limit ξ and a higher penalty rate η the policy portfolio φ can determine the cost for water use for surface water the cost c sw is the surface water resources fee ϕ sw i e c sw ϕ sw note that here we neglect surface water diversion cost for regions with gravity flow from irrigation channel to farmlands in comparison the cost for groundwater use c gw consists of three components 1 groundwater resource fee ϕ gw 2 the energy cost for pumping water from wells ϕ pumping and 3 a penalty fee ϕ penalty under aquifer overexploitation condition the cost for groundwater use c gw can be expressed by equation 2 2 c gw ϕ gw ϕ pumping ϕ penalty where pumping cost ϕ pumping is a function of pumping lift i e associated with the depth to groundwater table energy price pumping efficiency and transmission losses for details of the expression of ϕ pumping see rothausen and conway 2011 wang et al 2012 and li et al 2016 it is important to note that monitoring every pumping well in a large river basin is very costly in practice since pumping cost ϕ pumping is a function of electricity price the depth to water table and pump efficiency etc increasing electricity price can lead to an increase in pumping cost and thus reduce farmers groundwater consumption in this regard electricity price and or a quota for total electricity use can also be set as feasible policy instruments to regulate farmers groundwater use 2 1 3 farmer agents and irrigation decisions fig 3 depicts farmers irrigation decisions step 1 and demonstrates how the decisions are affected by the water policy portfolio φ step 2 following our prior study du et al 2017a the water balance approach is employed here to simulate irrigation scheduling i e when and with how much water to irrigate crops the water balance approach assumes that farmers irrigation scheduling is driven by maintaining a certain level of soil water content to reduce crop yield loss due to water stress allen et al 1998 andales et al 2011 therefore farmers will apply irrigation e g flood irrigation in the heihe river basin when the soil moisture in crop root zone is below the soil moisture threshold i e crops start to experience water stress if soil water content is below this value irrigation demand is calculated based on the amount of water needed to maintain soil moisture above the threshold since farmers can go to farmland to check soil moisture every day here we assume that farmers decision on irrigation scheduling is made at the daily timescale once a farmer s irrigation demand is determined the next step is to decide how much groundwater and surface water needed to be used respectively we assume that the farmer follows a heuristic economic optimization approach for decision making and will use the more economic water resource i e the one with lower cost as his first choice to irrigate crops described in step 2 of fig 3 if the water resource e g surface water is not enough to satisfy water demand e g under low stream flow conditions the farmer will use the alternative water resource e g groundwater to satisfy the remainder of irrigation demand 2 2 gsflow gsflow is a physically based distributed hydrological model that simulates integrated groundwater surface water processes under the influence of both human activities e g irrigation and natural driving forces e g climate markstrom et al 2008 gsflow is based on the integration of 1 the precipitation runoff modeling system prms and 2 the modular groundwater flow model modflow prms is a physically based modeling tool that simulates stream flow water budget and other general hydrological processes in response to a variety of climate land cover and land use conditions the basic computing unit in prms is hydrological response unit hru which can either be a regular rectangular grid or an irregularly shaped polygon with a unique numeric index viger and leavesley 2007 modflow is a finite difference three dimensional 3d model used to simulate groundwater flow in porous subsurface area harbaug 2005 the basic computing unit of modflow is finite difference cell with regular rectangular shape markstrom et al 2008 modflow can model a

water and groundwater markstrom et al 2008 wu et al 2015b gsflow can provide a robust modeling tool to simulate flow in hydrological cycle and to provide comprehensive water budget analysis in watersheds since its release gsflow has been applied in many medium and large scale river basins around the world for integrated water resources management doherty and hunt 2009 gardner et al 2018 tian et al 2015b 2 3 coupling abm and gsflow in this study abm and gsflow are tightly coupled at the source code level i e the subroutines of the abm are embedded into relevant subroutines of gsflow the primary data exchanged and shared between the two models are 1 farmers water use i e surface water diversion and groundwater pumping from abm and 2 hydrological conditions e g the depth to water table and stream flow from gsflow the workflows of model coupling are as follows fig 4 model initialization gsflow initializes the procedures and subroutines in modflow and prms respectively abm builds one to one connections between water use agents in abm and hrus in gsflow internal data exchange between gsflow and abm at the daily scale on each day gsflow runs prms and modflow iteratively and has data exchange with abm taking the advantage of the internal linkage between the modules of gsflow and abm as detailed below gsflow checks the stress period of modflow and then runs prms to compute land surface and soil zone hydrologic processes including precipitation infiltration and surface runoff note that the irrigation from abm is treated as precipitation and is distributed over hrus in prms following that some hydrological variables e g soil moisture are used by abm as part of the input for agents decision making processes for calculating irrigation water demand abm uses hydrological variables e g water table stream flow in gsflow and runs water use agents decision making processes to determine surface water diversion and groundwater pumping for each water use agent iteration loop between prms and modflow hydrological variables and flow rates from prms are transferred to modflow for computing subsurface flows and stream flow routing irrigation water from abm is included in modflow as the sink term i e surface water diversion and groundwater pumping are associated with sink term for stream flow and groundwater respectively then modflow calculates groundwater heads and flows and transfers the dependent variables to prms for calculating soil zone flow and storage in prms the process continues until the convergence criteria for groundwater flow and soil moisture are satisfied at the end of each time step i e daily in this study the model writes modeling results for gsflow e g groundwater table stream flow and abm e g groundwater pumping and surface water diversion respectively at the end of simulation the model closes all of the files and clears the computer memory 3 case study and experimental design the previous section has introduced how the integrated gsflow abm is constructed to evaluate the modeling framework s functionalities and capabilities we apply the model to a large river basin the heihe river basin hrb as an illustrative demonstration of the modeling tool for river basin analysis in the context of chns with distributed human decisions and distributed hydrological processes note that the abm here applies a rule based method in the water balance approach to simulate agents water use decisions different agents can be characterized by different behavioral parameters and decision rules this provides flexibility to simulate other types of water use decision making mechanisms e g economic optimization thus the abm coupled with gslfow in this study could also be used as a general modeling tool to study water use and hydrological conditions in other river basins 3 1 case study site the hrb is located between a semi arid area i e the qinghai tibet plateau and an arid area i e the mongolian plateau in northwestern china it is the second largest inland river basin in china that encompasses an area of approximately 143 000 km2 yao et al 2018 the upper stream of the hrb is a mountainous area that generates runoff from the qilian mountains the middle stream of the hrb is irrigated agricultural oasis surrounded by sparsely vegetated desert the downstream of the hrb is a vast gobi desert with poor vegetation and vulnerable ecosystem tian et al 2015a the heihe river is the major water resource for the hrb it originates from the qilian mountains in the upper stream flows through the middle stream from yingluoxia gauging station to zhengyixia gauging station and finally to the terminal lakes in the downstream fig 5 a the hrb is a representative arid and semi arid inland river basin with precipitation far less than evapotranspiration irrigation demand in the middle hrb is mainly satisfied by surface water from the heihe river and groundwater pumping from aquifer since the 1950s the hrb has experienced significant agricultural expansion the area of irrigated land increased from 100 000 ha in 1950 to 300 000 ha in 2000 sun et al 2016 the intensive agricultural development and increasing water demand from municipal and other sectors have overexploited water resources causing many environmental and ecological problems such as reduced flow to the downstream groundwater depletion soil salinization vegetation degradation and shrinkage of the terminal lakes li et al 2018a b to address these ecosystem and environmental issues the chinese central government and the local government have initialized a variety of water management policies to regulate water use in the hrb for example to address water conflicts between agricultural water demand in the middle stream and ecological water demand in the downstream the chinese central government has implemented a water reallocation plan since the late 2000s cheng et al 2014 this plan establishes the annual outflow to the downstream under different inflow scenarios e g in normal years annual outflow from zhengyixia to downstream should not be less than 0 95 billion m3 when annual inflow to yingluoxia is 1 58 billion m3 hu et al 2015b other policies include but are not limited to enforcing water rights to individual farmers shutting down the water diversion gates in the heihe river during a particular period of time to ensure sufficient flow to the downstream and imposing water resources fee for irrigation zhou et al 2017 over the past 20 years these water management policies have well regulated surface water diversion in the middle stream leading to noticeable improvement in the vegetation and ecosystems in the downstream cheng et al 2014 li et al 2018a however these policies have to some extent encouraged unregulated groundwater pumping in the middle stream leading to environmental problems such as vegetation degradation groundwater depletion and decay of springs and lakes tian et al 2015b wu et al 2015c therefore it is important to take account of surface water groundwater and their conjunctive use when designing water management policies this requires an integrated economic and environmental based policy portfolio e g water resources fee regulations on water table drawdown for a holistic water resources management solution in the region 3 2 experimental design given the background of the water resources management problems mentioned above here we test various water management policy portfolios φ ϕ sw ϕ gw ξ η to evaluate how water policies affect the water use and hydrological processes in the hrb among the four policies considered in this study the surface water resource fee ϕ sw is set at a constant rate of 0 2 rmb m3 reflecting the current surface water price of the study site note that 1 rmb is approximately 0 15 usd based on the currency exchange rate of 2018 since the hrb has not fully set up groundwater pricing systems we apply a scenario based analysis to test the effectiveness of various groundwater policies groundwater resource fee ϕ gw takes a series of values that range from 0 to 0 2 rmb m3 the values for groundwater table decline limit ξ and the penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation η range from 0 to 10 0 m and from 0 to 0 2 rmb m m3 respectively note that these policies are uniformly applied to all of the farmers in the river basin representing the current non discriminatory water management policies in the case study area future work can be conducted to simulate discriminatory policies in the river basin in this study the impacts of a water management policies on water resources system are mainly measured by four indicators 1 groundwater use s gw billion m3 2 surface water use s sw billion m3 3 stream outflow from the zhengyixia gauging station to the downstream of the hrb q out billion m3 and 4 the depth to water table dwt m we also analyze the change of dwt over time δ d w t m to evaluate the trend of water table dynamics 3 3 model setup in our prior work a gsflow model has been built and well calibrated for the hrb sun et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the model runs from 2000 to 2016 with year 2000 set as the warm up period in this study the temporal and spatial resolutions of the integrated gsflow abm model are kept the same as the ones for the gsflow model in our prior work i e the temporal resolutions of abm and gsflow are both set as daily and 1 km 1 km grids are used to delineate both surface and subsurface domains each of the grid is associated with a conceptual farmer agent that makes water use decisions in the domain given that farmers have varied hydrogeological conditions e g the depth to water table land elevation that could affect water use cost their choices for water resources may differ from each other even they all follow the same economic optimization principle when making irrigation decisions fig 3 therefore farmers may have different responses to the same water policy portfolio in the river basin for details of the geological hydrological meteorological and other data that are needed for setting up the gsflow model in the hrb see tian et al 2018 and sun et al 2018 note that this study focuses on exploring human hydrological interactions in agricultural systems therefore we only analyze the modeling results in the middle of the hrb i e agricultural area instead of the entire river basin as conducted by tian et al 2018 and sun et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of policy portfolio at the river basin scale we start our analysis with investigating the impacts of water management policy portfolio on water use and hydrological conditions at the river basin scale fig 6 shows how the water management policies i e groundwater resource fee ϕ gw allowable water table decline limit ξ and penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation η affect the depth to water table dwt river outflow to the downstream q out surface water use s sw and groundwater use s gw fig 6a1 a3 show that dwt is higher i e indicating more groundwater is exploited from aquifer with smaller ϕ gw larger ξ and smaller η these results are consistent with the results presented in fig 6b1 b3 which show that farmers tends to use more groundwater when groundwater resource fee is low i e ϕ gw is small and or when groundwater is not well protected from overexploitation i e ξ is large and η is small the opposite conclusion holds true for how these policies affect surface water diversion fig 6c1 c3 the outflow to the downstream as shown in fig 6d1 d3 increases when the water management policies 1 make groundwater cost lower than surface water cost and 2 loosen the strict regulations for groundwater protection i e set a larger ξ and or smaller η these results demonstrate that the model is capable of capturing the important relationships between water management policies farmers water use and hydrological conditions in the river basin more interestingly the modeling results have captured the nonlinear characteristics between water management policies water use and the associated hydrological responses for example in general groundwater consumption decreases when groundwater fee ϕ gw increases but the response rate highly depends on the initial value of ϕ gw fig 6b1 when the groundwater fee increases from 0 to 0 1 rmb m3 groundwater consumption decreases from 0 24 billion m3 to 0 19 billion m3 i e a total decrease of 0 05 billion m3 in comparison with the same interval of groundwater fee change from 0 1 rmb m3 to 0 2 rmb m3 groundwater consumption decreases from 0 19 billion m3 to 0 04 billion m3 i e a total decrease of 0 15 billion m3 which is 3 times of the previous decrease in groundwater consumption it can be seen that groundwater gw consumption is more sensitive to the change in gw resource fee ϕ gw when ϕ gw is closer to 0 2 rmb m3 i e the cost for surface water use c sw in this study this can be explained by comparing the cost of surface water sw and gw c gw ϕ gw ϕ pumping ϕ penalty as shown in fig 3 in this study we assume that farmers will first use the water resource with a lower cost when ϕ gw is low and water table drawdown is not significant i e ϕ penalty and ϕ pumping are small c gw is lower than c sw and a small increase in ϕ gw will not make c gw higher than c sw as a result gw consumption is maintained at a high level and is not very sensitive to the increase in ϕ gw however when ϕ gw is closer to c sw i e 0 2 rmb m3 a small increase in ϕ gw can make c gw greater than c sw resulting in a noticeable decrease in gw consumption therefore gw consumption becomes more sensitive to the change of ϕ gw when ϕ gw is larger in this regard surface water price ϕ sw can be used as a threshold indicator for measuring the sensitivity of groundwater consumption to the change of groundwater fee similar analysis can be conducted for understanding the nonlinear impacts of water table decline limit ξ and penalty rate for aquifer overexploitation η on groundwater consumption and other hydrological conditions these nonlinear relationships can provide important insights into human nature interactions and thus guide the design of effective water management policies in the context of chns 4 2 influence of water policies on conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water this section examines the spatial variability in the impacts of the policy portfolio on the water resources system by which we show the effectiveness of considering the heterogeneity in farmers water use and distributed hydrological processes fig 7 shows the ratio of surface water and groundwater use under two groundwater price scenarios over the twenty irrigation regions in the hrb the results show that groundwater and surface water account for 27 2 and 72 8 of total water withdrawal respectively when groundwater price ϕ gw is set as 0 04 rbm m3 note that surface water price ϕ sw is 0 20 rbm m3 in comparison when groundwater price ϕ gw increases to 0 20 rbm m3 i e a price that makes groundwater cost higher than surface water cost considering groundwater pumping cost the ratio of groundwater use decreases to 18 4 this result shows that the proposed water management portfolio can significantly impact the conjunctive groundwater and surface water use in the river basin and this impact can be quantified by the integrated model more importantly the results show the spatial heterogeneity in the conjunctive groundwater surface water use across the irrigation regions which will be discussed from the following two perspectives first noticeable heterogeneity is observed in the ratio of groundwater use over different irrigation regions in some regions e g wujiang shahe luotuocheng and dahuwan groundwater accounts for approximately 40 of total water withdrawal however this ratio is less than 5 in some other regions e g shangsan and ganjun this can be explained by the differences of hydrological conditions in these regions e g water table depth for example shangsan and ganjun have very deep groundwater table 100 m associated with high groundwater pumping cost therefore these regions highly rely on surface water for irrigation from the cost benefit perspective in comparison regions such as luotuocheng and dahuwan have shallow water table 20 m and therefore will use more groundwater due to low pumping cost secondly a noticeable heterogeneity can be observed in terms of the extent to which water policies can affect the conjunctive groundwater surface water use in these regions fig 7c shows that these twenty irrigation regions respond differently to the change of water policies for example for the three regions with a large portion of groundwater use i e shahe luotuocheng and dahuwan approximately 40 of water withdrawal is groundwater an increase of groundwater price from 0 04 rbm m3 to 0 20 rbm m3 can result in a decrease in groundwater use ratio from 40 to 10 for luotuocheng and dahuwan but only from 40 to 20 for shahe this shows that groundwater price ϕ gw has less impacts on groundwater use in shahe compared with the other two regions this is because shahe is located at the high elevation area in hrb and surface flow diversion is more costly making it more dependent on groundwater use than the other two regions with lower elevation wu et al 2015a 4 3 managing groundwater table to address environmental concern this section discusses the role of water policies in managing groundwater table an important environmental concern for the hrb fig 8 shows the change of groundwater table depth denoted by δ d w t during the simulation period from 2001 to 2016 i e δ d w t d w t y 2016 d w t y 2001 for some representative irrigation regions two important insights can be obtained from the results first from a qualitative perspective it is noticed that δ d w t respond to the water management policies in a consistent manner among these regions that is higher groundwater resource fee i e larger ϕ gw stricter constraint for groundwater table drawdown i e smaller ξ and higher penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation i e larger η will reduce groundwater use and increase aquifer recharge i e dwt decreases these regional scale results are consistent with the basin scale results presented in fig 6 secondly from a quantitative perspective the responses of dwt to water management policies vary from region to region for example luotuocheng and xinhua have active responses to water management policies in comparison negligible change of dwt is observed in yanuan and banqiao the results suggest that implementing the proposed policies will have more significant impact on groundwater table in luotuocheng and xinhua than that in yanuan and banqiao this is because yanuan and banqiao are closer to streams pumping induced groundwater depletion can be recharged from surface water in a faster rate therefore groundwater pumping in these two regions has relatively smaller impact on groundwater table compared with luotuocheng and xinhua that are far away from river to evaluate the potential of water policies influence on groundwater we use the absolute value of maximum change of groundwater table depth δ d w t as the indicator the cross region comparison of δ d w t in fig 9 shows that the designed water management policies are more effective to manage groundwater in regions such as luotuocheng sanqing and shahe compared with regions such as yanuan liaoquan and luocheng it is noticed that groundwater tables in regions that are close to the heihe river typically have a less active response to water management policies which is consistent with previous studies wu et al 2015a this is due to the fact that regions that are closer to river tend to have more rapid groundwater recharge from surface water when aquifer depletion occurs these results show that the modeling framework can 1 simulate spatially heterogeneous effects of water policies influence on groundwater system and 2 help with detecting more effective policies e g ϕ gw in fig 8a and active regions e g luotuocheng in fig 9 for location based water resources management 4 4 temporal dynamics of policy influence on hydrological systems the previous analyses have focused on spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policy on hydrological system in this section we evaluate the temporal dynamics of water management policy influence on hydrological system in the hrb using the relationship between groundwater table decline limit ξ and the depth to water table as an illustrative example fig 10 a c shows how daily groundwater table responds to different levels of ξ in luotuocheng yanuan and banqiao respectively which can be categorized into three representative temporal dynamic patterns the first pattern is that changing the levels of water policy ξ can significantly affect groundwater table dynamics which is reflected by the case of luotuocheng in fig 10a when ξ is set as 4 0 m representing a scenario for poorly regulated aquifer groundwater table declines over time in comparison when the policy is strengthened by setting ξ as 0 5 m groundwater table increases due to reduced groundwater pumping the second pattern is that changing the levels of water policy ξ does not significantly change the trend of groundwater table dynamics but the magnitude of groundwater table dynamics is affected this pattern is reflected by the case of banqiao in this region groundwater table exhibits a consistent declining trend for all of the four policy scenarios fig 10c but setting stricter water management policies i e a smaller ξ can reduce the water table declining rate the third pattern is that groundwater table dynamics has negligible response to water policy and this is reflected by the case of yanuan fig 10b it is observed that the annual average of groundwater table is quite stable due to rapid recharge from surface water as a result implementing different levels of water policy ξ does not affect the temporal dynamics of groundwater table in this region these results provide some insights into the temporal coevolution between human activities and hydrological processes which will be discussed in the next section 4 5 insights into the coevolution of chnss and policy implications the modeling results discussed above provide some insights into the analysis of river basins as chnss it is demonstrated that hydrogeological conditions e g depth to groundwater table distance to rivers can significantly affect the interactions between human activities and hydrological systems for example regions with deep groundwater table e g shangsan and ganjun are associated with higher pumping cost and therefore can reduce farmers groundwater consumption and increase farmers surface water diversion activities as demonstrated in fig 7 in regions that are close to rivers surface water can recharge aquifer rapidly and as a result groundwater table has less active response to groundwater policies compared with regions that are far away from rivers these results highlight the role of hydrogeological conditions in the analysis of the coevolution between human activities and hydrological processes the modeling results could also provide some policy implications for river basin management for example as demonstrated in fig 7 increasing groundwater price from 0 04 rmb m3 to 0 20 rmb m3 has significantly different impacts on groundwater consumption across the irrigation regions in the hrb e g dahuwan reduces more groundwater consumption than shahe this indicates that location based water pricing policies can be implemented to influence farmers groundwater use activities also in regions with more intense groundwater table dynamics e g luotuocheng policies that regulate groundwater table can be more effective than that in regions with relatively smaller groundwater table dynamics e g yanuan these results highlight the needs for designing and implementing spatially varied and temporally dynamic policy portfolio in large river basins taking account of the location dependent hydrogeological conditions note that here we analyzed several representative irrigation districts in the hrb more analyses can be conducted to comprehensively compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of human hydrological interactions in all of the 20 irrigation districts which may lead to more insights into policy design for informed water resources management in addition it is also feasible to explore human hydrological interactions under the influence of other types of policy scenarios such as location dependent and temporally dynamic groundwater taxes across the river basin the modeling results for such policy scenarios may further enhance our understanding of human hydrological interactions in agricultural systems 5 conclusions limitations and future work in this study we develop an agent based model abm for simulating farmers decision making on conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water under the influence of policy portfolio with collective water management policies moreover we realize a tight coupling between the abm and an integrated groundwater surface water hydrological model gsflow for simulating groundwater surface water interactions the two models are fully integrated together by embedding the source code of the abm into gsflow which allows for computationally tractable simulation of human hydrological processes in large river basins the integration of abm and gsflow with sufficient spatial field scale and temporal daily time step details allows us to model how the interaction of groundwater surface water affects water use decisions and policy effectiveness and meanwhile how human influences affect hydrological processes for an illustrative purpose the modeling framework is applied to the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china a policy portfolio with mixed groundwater and surface water policies is designed to test the modeling framework s functionalities and capabilities for large river basin management through various scenario analyses the modeling results demonstrate that the tightly coupled model can detect the nonlinear relationships between water management policies farmers water use decisions and hydrological processes even more importantly they can capture the heterogeneities in the human hydrological interactions i e the spatial variability of 1 farmers responses to hydrological conditions and 2 the impacts of water policies and water use decisions on hydrological processes the modeling results have detected three unique temporal dynamic patterns regarding water policies influences on hydrological systems e g water table it is found that regional hydrogeological conditions e g depth to water table distance to rivers are important factors that affect human hydrological interactions insights from these modeling results are informative for identifying effective water management policies such as setting spatially varied groundwater prices and location based penalties for aquifer overexploitation while this paper mainly focuses on the development of such an integrated modeling framework the current model still has some limitations that will be addressed in the future work firstly unlike some studies that consider farmers decision making on crop choice this study does not embed a crop choice module in the abm and simply assumes that farmers will plant corn one of the major planted crops in the case study area this is due to the fact that farmers crop choices in the study site have been significantly affected by the local government s crop policies e g subsidies for planting certain types of crops which is challenging to simulate with the widely used economic optimization methods in previous studies hu et al 2015a mulligan et al 2014 future work can be conducted to include a crop choice module in the abm when the local government s long term crop policy information become available furthermore in this study we simply assume that farmers behaviors follow the economic optimization principle which might not fully reflect the decision making mechanisms of all of the farmers future work can conduct interviews or surveys to understand farmers empirical decision making processes in the real world in particular it is important to investigate how farmers make decisions in the face of uncertainties in water availability precipitation and crop price etc these will enhance our understanding of farmers decision rules in the real world and guide the design of more informed water management policies secondly the current model simulates uniform water management policies across the entire river basin however location specific policies e g water table decline limit and water resources fee could be important for efficient water resources management due to the heterogeneous hydrogeological conditions in the watershed elbakidze et al 2018 khan and brown 2019 in addition the association between different types of policies should be considered when a water management policy portfolio is designed for example a larger groundwater overexploitation penalty should be imposed when the depth to water table is higher thirdly some important model components and constraints can be explicitly included in the model e g water availability that could be influenced by climate variability reservoir operation and minimum flow requirement for the downstream to enhance its capabilities for analyzing comprehensive human natural interactions in large river basins we envision that the proposed modeling framework can be useful for integrated groundwater surface water management and these future improvements could yield more informative insights into our understanding of the complexities feedbacks and co

5053,analyzing river basins as coupled human and hydrological systems is important to advance our understanding of hydrological processes and to provide insights into policy design for water resources management however assessing spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic characteristics of human hydrological interactions remains a challenge and relevant research has been limited by the lack of computationally tractable models that can integrate water management policies human activities and hydrological conditions with sufficient temporal and spatial details in this study we propose a modeling framework that tightly couples 1 an agent based model for farmers decision making on water use influenced by collective water management policies and 2 a distributed hydrological model for simulating integrated groundwater surface water processes with high spatial and temporal resolutions we apply the modeling framework to the heihe river basin a large semi arid river basin with intensive agriculture in china through various policy portfolio analyses the model has identified several unique spatial temporal characteristics of human hydrological interactions these include 1 nonlinear relationships between water policies farmers decisions on water use and hydrological conditions 2 spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policies on farmers conjunctive groundwater and surface water use and 3 location dependent temporal patterns regarding water policies influences on hydrological processes it is found that regional hydrogeological conditions e g depth to water table distance to rivers are key factors to influence human hydrological interactions the modeling results could advance our understanding of the role of human activities in hydrological cycles and yield insights into the design of location based policies for river basin management keywords coupled human and natural systems agent based model policy portfolio analysis gsflow groundwater surface water interactions heihe river basin 1 introduction in recent decades humans have been playing an increasingly active role in hydrological systems the natural hydrological cycles have been converted to coupled human natural systems chns cai et al 2015 cheng and li 2015 li et al 2018a liu et al 2007 reddy and syme 2014 sivapalan et al 2012 in regions with intense agriculture human activities e g crop planting irrigation have noticeably re shaped hydrological systems e g change of stream flow regimes groundwater depletion on the other hand the altered hydrological regimes have in turn affected human activities especially in intensively irrigated areas lawston et al 2017 nie et al 2018 ozdogan et al 2010 for example decades of expansion of irrigation fed agriculture in the republican river basin of the u s have significantly depleted groundwater and reduced stream flow since 1960s causing concerns for sustainable watershed development and conflicts among the three states i e colorado nebraska and kansas that share the river basin scanlon et al 2012 to address this issue the natural resources districts and local water management institutions have implemented groundwater management policies to regulate farmers groundwater pumping activities lauer et al 2018 feedbacks and interactions between hydrological systems and human activities have also been observed in many other regions around the world such as the murray darling river basin in australia kandasamy et al 2014 wheeler et al 2013 the saskatchewan river basin in canada hassanzadeh et al 2014 the central valley in the u s marston and konar 2017 and the heihe river basin in china cheng et al 2014 song and zhang 2015 understanding the coevolution and dynamics of human nature interactions is critical for holistic river basin management elshafei et al 2014 human hydrological interaction is an important type of human nature interactions understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of human hydrological interactions can provide policy implications for more informed water resources management in river basins to analyze human hydrological interactions with intensive agricultural water use it is fundamentally important to develop integrated modeling frameworks that can adequately represent 1 physically based hydrological processes 2 farmers behaviors driven by economic and social principles and 3 the reciprocal connections between these two components cai 2008 giulian et al 2016 hassanzadeh et al 2014 van heerden et al 2008 tremendous efforts have focused on developing hydrologic agronomic economic models to integrate economic agricultural and hydrological components in a coherent manner for water resources management cai et al 2002 esteve et al 2015 george et al 2011 harou et al 2009 hrozencik et al 2017 schmitz et al 2014 in recent years literatures have increasingly recognized the need to explicitly represent the complex characteristics of farmers empirical decision processes in complex decision problems an individual s decision is typically subject to bounded rationality due to the lack of sufficient and reliable information for decision making the lack of time and or limited intellectual ability for evaluating all of the possible choices and their consequences and emotional arousal that may affect human s cognitive capabilities these will constrain an individual s decision making and lead to sub optimal satisfying decisions rather than the global optimal decision kaufman 1999 puranam et al 2015 compared with the optimization approach agent based model abm has received particular attention in modeling human activities an 2012 gorelick and zheng 2015 in an abm each decision unit e g farmer is defined as an agent with a set of attributes and behavioral rules farmer and foley 2009 janssen and ostrom 2006 an agent s decision rule could either be represented by a classic economic optimization principle or by an intuitive rule of thumb principle that might not necessarily be perfectly optimal doran 2001 farmer and foley 2009 yang et al 2012 therefore abm provides more flexible methodologies to represent agents behaviors and their inter connections reeves and zellner 2010 in agricultural systems abms have been used to simulate some important characteristics of farmers behaviors observed in empirical studies such as behavioral heterogeneity collective interactions and social learning ghoulmie et al 2005 abms have also been employed to simulating complex adaptive systems in a variety of domains including but not limited to socio ecological systems filatova et al 2013 ostrom 2009 smajgl et al 2011 land use and land cover change filatova et al 2009 groeneveld et al 2017 matthews et al 2007 economics and finance rekik et

incorporate farmers water permit trading behaviors in the economic hydrologic model to simulate a groundwater market and systematically evaluate the impacts of hydrogeological and climate variability on the performance of the water market the results emphasize the importance to consider the spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in the hydrogeological and climate conditions when designing and implementing water management policies in large river basins these studies have greatly advanced the development of integrated abm and hydrological models for water resources management in the context of chns however limitations and challenges still remain in these coupled models firstly from the perspective of model coupling strategies these studies typically couple an abm and a hydrological model in a loose manner that is the model integration is achieved through the exchange of input output files when different models need data transfers however reading processing and writing these exchange files can be inefficient error prone and computational expensive bhatt et al 2014 this limits the coupled models capability to simulate frequent interactions e g daily between abms and hydrological models especially in large river basins with large amounts of data in addition it is difficult to achieve synchronous exchange of information between abms and hydrological models through loose coupling to accurately simulate feedback between human behaviors and hydrology a coupling method that allows for the two way exchange of information is desired unlike the loose coupling method the tight coupling method uses a common data pool to exchange data between multiple models therefore the tight coupling method can significantly reduce data exchange redundancy making the integrated model suitable for water system analysis in large river basins moreover the source code and or functional components of different models can be embedded together into a consistent modeling system bhatt et al 2014 two way exchanges of information between an abm and a hydrological model could be achieved through iteration level coupling however to our best knowledge coupling an abm and a distributed hydrological model via a tight manner has been rarely achieved in previous studies secondly the abms and hydrological models in these studies are often not consistent in the temporal and or spatial resolutions for example some studies have aggregated farmers daily water use into weekly or monthly water withdraw as input to the hydrological model in the model coupling processes e g hu et al 2015a similarly studies have also used a sub region or sub basin to represent a water use agent aggregating field scale daily water use into regional water consumption while the computational units of distributed hydrological models are often at the field scale e g 1 km 1 km hydrological response unit e g lei et al 2019 the inconsistent model resolutions between abms and hydrological models imposes challenges for the coupled models to accurately simulate and capture the interactions between agents decisions and hydrological responses with sufficient spatial and temporal details moreover for the abms developed by previous studies typically only one type of water policy e g water price from an economic perspective is considered this limits the application of the abms for modeling water policy portfolio with mixed policies e g both economic and environmental policies required for some real world water management problems in two recent studies hrozencik et al 2017 and mulligan et al 2014 consider multiple water policies for aquifer management in the republican river basin the results from these studies show that mixed policies can exhibit complex and heterogeneous impacts on water resources system across the river basin thirdly for the hydrological models used in previous coupled modeling framework most of them mainly focus on groundwater gw e g noel and cai 2017 lei et al 2019 mulligan et al 2014 khan and brown 2019 without fully considering surface water sw and more importantly the interactions between gw and sw in water resources systems studies have shown that sw gw exchange can significantly complicate hydrological modeling processes as well as water management policy analysis elbakidze et al 2018 tian et al 2015a in many arid and semiarid regions both gw and sw and the interactions between the two play an important role in hydrological processes and should be taken account of when developing integrated water management models gilfedder et al 2012 shanafield et al 2012 motivated by the above research needs this study proposes a modeling framework that couples 1 an abm that incorporates water policy portfolio consisting of mixed water management policies and farmers decision making of water use at field scales and 2 gsflow an integrated groundwater surface water hydrological model it is important to highlight that the abm and gsflow in this study are coupled in a tight manner i e the two models are coupled at the source code level and therefore has addressed the computational challenge and synchronous data exchange issue that are typically faced by loosely coupled models making it computationally efficient when applied in large river basins in addition the abm and gsflow have consistent high spatial and temporal resolution i e field scale and daily time step providing sufficient spatial and temporal details of the interactions between human activities and hydrological processes with the integration of abm and gsflow we can assess how human influences i e represented by abm can affect the interaction of groundwater and surface water and to evaluate how multiple policies affect hydrological processes in large river basins for illustrative purpose the modeling framework is applied to the heihe river basin hrb to demonstrate its functionalities and capabilities for the analysis of large river basins as chns the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the modeling framework including abm section 2 1 gsflow section 2 2 and how the two models are coupled together section 2 3 section 3 gives an overview of the study site section 4 presents the modeling results followed by conclusions and future work in section 5 2 modeling framework as shown in fig 1 the modeling framework consists of 1 an abm that simulates farmers decision making of water use under the influence of water management policies and 2 gsflow that simulates integrated groundwater surface water hydrological processes abm and gsflow are coupled at the daily and field scales reasonable temporal and spatial scales for farmers water use decision and hydrological simulation droogers et al 2010 markstrom et al 2008 detailed introductions to the model components and model coupling methodologies are provided in the following sections 2 1 development of the abm 2 1 1 overview of the abm architecture the design of the abm in this study follows the standard odd principle i e overview design concepts and details proposed by grimm et al 2006 fig 2 overviews the architecture of the abm which specifies the types of agents and the flowchart of their decision making processes in a water management scheme consisting of a basin level water management authority and a group of water users in the basin the abm considers two types of agents 1 a water management agent type i and 2 a number of water use agents i e farmers type ii the water management agent represents a basin level water management authority miro 2012 in this study the water management agent influences farmers water use activities by designing and implementing a collection of water management policies i e policy portfolio this extends some previous abms that mainly focus on one type of water management policy e g water price from economic perspective in yang et al 2012 making the abm more flexible to be applied to river basins with multiple policies e g economic and environmental for water resources management water use agent i e farmer denoted by index j 1 2 j makes decisions on irrigation scheduling in terms of when and with how much water to irrigate crops andales et al 2011 note that a farmer s irrigation decision can be affected by water management policies and or hydrological conditions for example an increase in groundwater pumping cost will result in farmers less groundwater withdraw the next sections will specifically introduce the water management policies section 2 1 2 and farmers irrigation decisions section 2 1 3 2 1 2 water management policy portfolio let φ denote the policy portfolio designed and implemented by the water management agent following previous studies on water management in agricultural systems brennan 2006 harou and lund 2008 hrozencik et al 2017 lahtinen et al 2017 here we consider policies for both groundwater and surface water management in the watershed for groundwater management we first consider a groundwater resource fee denoted by ϕ gw the price that a farmer needs to pay for each unit of groundwater similar to the concept of groundwater tax as an economic instrument for groundwater management harou and lund 2008 second in order to reflect the environmental concerns of aquifer depletion faced by many groundwater fed regions around the world condon and maxwell 2019 richter et al 2013 we include two additional policies namely a managed allowable groundwater table decline limit denoted by ξ and a penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation denoted by η if water table decline d exceeds its limit ξ a penalty fee denoted by ϕ penalty will be imposed which can be represented by eq 1 1 ϕ penalty 0 when η d ξ when d ξ d ξ note that the penalty term ϕ penalty for groundwater over exploitation may cause fairness issue among farmers that share an aquifer since the water table for a well can be affected by the pumping of other wells in the near neighbor due to the cone of depression phenomena in groundwater systems in this regard a farmer who uses little groundwater might be imposed with a penalty if his neighboring farmers extensively withdraw groundwater and this issue will be more significant if their pumping wells are closer to each other however in our model the effects of penalty are analyzed based on irrigation districts with large area the average area of irrigation districts in our case study site is around 110 km2 so the policy externality issue is less significant compared with that for neighboring wells typically several hundred meters away to completely resolve the fairness issue policy makers can set a large value for water table decline limit ξ and use groundwater resource fee ϕ gw to regulate farmers pumping behaviors for surface water management similar to groundwater management we use a surface water resource fee denoted by ϕ sw the price that a farmer needs to pay for each unit of surface water diverted from river as an economic instrument in addition surface water management could also include a quantity restriction to reflect a water user s water permit and or water availability under the influence of hydrological conditions hansen et al 2015 zheng et al 2012 given the aforementioned policy parameters the water management agent s policy portfolio φ can be represented by notation φ ϕ sw ϕ gw ξ η the proposed water policy portfolio φ here can be applied to address hydrological and environmental issues in river basins for example to address aquifer depletion issue and reduce groundwater pumping the water management agent can implement stricter groundwater use constraints by setting a higher groundwater resource fee ϕ gw a smaller groundwater decline limit ξ and a higher penalty rate η the policy portfolio φ can determine the cost for water use for surface water the cost c sw is the surface water resources fee ϕ sw i e c sw ϕ sw note that here we neglect surface water diversion cost for regions with gravity flow from irrigation channel to farmlands in comparison the cost for groundwater use c gw consists of three components 1 groundwater resource fee ϕ gw 2 the energy cost for pumping water from wells ϕ pumping and 3 a penalty fee ϕ penalty under aquifer overexploitation condition the cost for groundwater use c gw can be expressed by equation 2 2 c gw ϕ gw ϕ pumping ϕ penalty where pumping cost ϕ pumping is a function of pumping lift i e associated with the depth to groundwater table energy price pumping efficiency and transmission losses for details of the expression of ϕ pumping see rothausen and conway 2011 wang et al 2012 and li et al 2016 it is important to note that monitoring every pumping well in a large river basin is very costly in practice since pumping cost ϕ pumping is a function of electricity price the depth to water table and pump efficiency etc increasing electricity price can lead to an increase in pumping cost and thus reduce farmers groundwater consumption in this regard electricity price and or a quota for total electricity use can also be set as feasible policy instruments to regulate farmers groundwater use 2 1 3 farmer agents and irrigation decisions fig 3 depicts farmers irrigation decisions step 1 and demonstrates how the decisions are affected by the water policy portfolio φ step 2 following our prior study du et al 2017a the water balance approach is employed here to simulate irrigation scheduling i e when and with how much water to irrigate crops the water balance approach assumes that farmers irrigation scheduling is driven by maintaining a certain level of soil water content to reduce crop yield loss due to water stress allen et al 1998 andales et al 2011 therefore farmers will apply irrigation e g flood irrigation in the heihe river basin when the soil moisture in crop root zone is below the soil moisture threshold i e crops start to experience water stress if soil water content is below this value irrigation demand is calculated based on the amount of water needed to maintain soil moisture above the threshold since farmers can go to farmland to check soil moisture every day here we assume that farmers decision on irrigation scheduling is made at the daily timescale once a farmer s irrigation demand is determined the next step is to decide how much groundwater and surface water needed to be used respectively we assume that the farmer follows a heuristic economic optimization approach for decision making and will use the more economic water resource i e the one with lower cost as his first choice to irrigate crops described in step 2 of fig 3 if the water resource e g surface water is not enough to satisfy water demand e g under low stream flow conditions the farmer will use the alternative water resource e g groundwater to satisfy the remainder of irrigation demand 2 2 gsflow gsflow is a physically based distributed hydrological model that simulates integrated groundwater surface water processes under the influence of both human activities e g irrigation and natural driving forces e g climate markstrom et al 2008 gsflow is based on the integration of 1 the precipitation runoff modeling system prms and 2 the modular groundwater flow model modflow prms is a physically based modeling tool that simulates stream flow water budget and other general hydrological processes in response to a variety of climate land cover and land use conditions the basic computing unit in prms is hydrological response unit hru which can either be a regular rectangular grid or an irregularly shaped polygon with a unique numeric index viger and leavesley 2007 modflow is a finite difference three dimensional 3d model used to simulate groundwater flow in porous subsurface area harbaug 2005 the basic computing unit of modflow is finite difference cell with regular rectangular shape markstrom et al 2008 modflow can model a variety of groundwater processes including unsaturated and saturated subsurface flow aquifer discharge and recharge and groundwater interactions with streams harbaug 2005 by integrating prms and modflow gsflow is capable of modeling the major groundwater and surface water processes including runoff generation and infiltration surface and subsurface flow and the interactions between surface water and groundwater markstrom et al 2008 wu et al 2015b gsflow can provide a robust modeling tool to simulate flow in hydrological cycle and to provide comprehensive water budget analysis in watersheds since its release gsflow has been applied in many medium and large scale river basins around the world for integrated water resources management doherty and hunt 2009 gardner et al 2018 tian et al 2015b 2 3 coupling abm and gsflow in this study abm and gsflow are tightly coupled at the source code level i e the subroutines of the abm are embedded into relevant subroutines of gsflow the primary data exchanged and shared between the two models are 1 farmers water use i e surface water diversion and groundwater pumping from abm and 2 hydrological conditions e g the depth to water table and stream flow from gsflow the workflows of model coupling are as follows fig 4 model initialization gsflow initializes the procedures and subroutines in modflow and prms respectively abm builds one to one connections between water use agents in abm and hrus in gsflow internal data exchange between gsflow and abm at the daily scale on each day gsflow runs prms and modflow iteratively and has data exchange with abm taking the advantage of the internal linkage between the modules of gsflow and abm as detailed below gsflow checks the stress period of modflow and then runs prms to compute land surface and soil zone hydrologic processes including precipitation infiltration and surface runoff note that the irrigation from abm is treated as precipitation and is distributed over hrus in prms following that some hydrological variables e g soil moisture are used by abm as part of the input for agents decision making processes for calculating irrigation water demand abm uses hydrological variables e g water table stream flow in gsflow and runs water use agents decision making processes to determine surface water diversion and groundwater pumping for each water use agent iteration loop between prms and modflow hydrological variables and flow rates from prms are transferred to modflow for computing subsurface flows and stream flow routing irrigation water from abm is included in modflow as the sink term i e surface water diversion and groundwater pumping are associated with sink term for stream flow and groundwater respectively then modflow calculates groundwater heads and flows and transfers the dependent variables to prms for calculating soil zone flow and storage in prms the process continues until the convergence criteria for groundwater flow and soil moisture are satisfied at the end of each time step i e daily in this study the model writes modeling results for gsflow e g groundwater table stream flow and abm e g groundwater pumping and surface water diversion respectively at the end of simulation the model closes all of the files and clears the computer memory 3 case study and experimental design the previous section has introduced how the integrated gsflow abm is constructed to evaluate the modeling framework s functionalities and capabilities we apply the model to a large river basin the heihe river basin hrb as an illustrative demonstration of the modeling tool for river basin analysis in the context of chns with distributed human decisions and distributed hydrological processes note that the abm here applies a rule based method in the water balance approach to simulate agents water use decisions different agents can be characterized by different behavioral parameters and decision rules this provides flexibility to simulate other types of water use decision making mechanisms e g economic optimization thus the abm coupled with gslfow in this study could also be used as a general modeling tool to study water use and hydrological conditions in other river basins 3 1 case study site the hrb is located between a semi arid area i e the qinghai tibet plateau and an arid area i e the mongolian plateau in northwestern china it is the second largest inland river basin in china that encompasses an area of approximately 143 000 km2 yao et al 2018 the upper stream of the hrb is a mountainous area that generates runoff from the qilian mountains the middle stream of the hrb is irrigated agricultural oasis surrounded by sparsely vegetated desert the downstream of the hrb is a vast gobi desert with poor vegetation and vulnerable ecosystem tian et al 2015a the heihe river is the major water resource for the hrb it originates from the qilian mountains in the upper stream flows through the middle stream from yingluoxia gauging station to zhengyixia gauging station and finally to the terminal lakes in the downstream fig 5 a the hrb is a representative arid and semi arid inland river basin with precipitation far less than evapotranspiration irrigation demand in the middle hrb is mainly satisfied by surface water from the heihe river and groundwater pumping from aquifer since the 1950s the hrb has experienced significant agricultural expansion the area of irrigated land increased from 100 000 ha in 1950 to 300 000 ha in 2000 sun et al 2016 the intensive agricultural development and increasing water demand from municipal and other sectors have overexploited water resources causing many environmental and ecological problems such as reduced flow to the downstream groundwater depletion soil salinization vegetation degradation and shrinkage of the terminal lakes li et al 2018a b to address these ecosystem and environmental issues the chinese central government and the local government have initialized a variety of water management policies to regulate water use in the hrb for example to address water conflicts between agricultural water demand in the middle stream and ecological water demand in the downstream the chinese central government has implemented a water reallocation plan since the late 2000s cheng et al 2014 this plan establishes the annual outflow to the downstream under different inflow scenarios e g in normal years annual outflow from zhengyixia to downstream should not be less than 0 95 billion m3 when annual inflow to yingluoxia is 1 58 billion m3 hu et al 2015b other policies include but are not limited to enforcing water rights to individual farmers shutting down the water diversion gates in the heihe river during a particular period of time to ensure sufficient flow to the downstream and imposing water resources fee for irrigation zhou et al 2017 over the past 20 years these water management policies have well regulated surface water diversion in the middle stream leading to noticeable improvement in the vegetation and ecosystems in the downstream cheng et al 2014 li et al 2018a however these policies have to some extent encouraged unregulated groundwater pumping in the middle stream leading to environmental problems such as vegetation degradation groundwater depletion and decay of springs and lakes tian et al 2015b wu et al 2015c therefore it is important to take account of surface water groundwater and their conjunctive use when designing water management policies this requires an integrated economic and environmental based policy portfolio e g water resources fee regulations on water table drawdown for a holistic water resources management solution in the region 3 2 experimental design given the background of the water resources management problems mentioned above here we test various water management policy portfolios φ ϕ sw ϕ gw ξ η to evaluate how water policies affect the water use and hydrological processes in the hrb among the four policies considered in this study the surface water resource fee ϕ sw is set at a constant rate of 0 2 rmb m3 reflecting the current surface water price of the study site note that 1 rmb is approximately 0 15 usd based on the currency exchange rate of 2018 since the hrb has not fully set up groundwater pricing systems we apply a scenario based analysis to test the effectiveness of various groundwater policies groundwater resource fee ϕ gw takes a series of values that range from 0 to 0 2 rmb m3 the values for groundwater table decline limit ξ and the penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation η range from 0 to 10 0 m and from 0 to 0 2 rmb m m3 respectively note that these policies are uniformly applied to all of the farmers in the river basin representing the current non discriminatory water management policies in the case study area future work can be conducted to simulate discriminatory policies in the river basin in this study the impacts of a water management policies on water resources system are mainly measured by four indicators 1 groundwater use s gw billion m3 2 surface water use s sw billion m3 3 stream outflow from the zhengyixia gauging station to the downstream of the hrb q out billion m3 and 4 the depth to water table dwt m we also analyze the change of dwt over time δ d w t m to evaluate the trend of water table dynamics 3 3 model setup in our prior work a gsflow model has been built and well calibrated for the hrb sun et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the model runs from 2000 to 2016 with year 2000 set as the warm up period in this study the temporal and spatial resolutions of the integrated gsflow abm model are kept the same as the ones for the gsflow model in our prior work i e the temporal resolutions of abm and gsflow are both set as daily and 1 km 1 km grids are used to delineate both surface and subsurface domains each of the grid is associated with a conceptual farmer agent that makes water use decisions in the domain given that farmers have varied hydrogeological conditions e g the depth to water table land elevation that could affect water use cost their choices for water resources may differ from each other even they all follow the same economic optimization principle when making irrigation decisions fig 3 therefore farmers may have different responses to the same water policy portfolio in the river basin for details of the geological hydrological meteorological and other data that are needed for setting up the gsflow model in the hrb see tian et al 2018 and sun et al 2018 note that this study focuses on exploring human hydrological interactions in agricultural systems therefore we only analyze the modeling results in the middle of the hrb i e agricultural area instead of the entire river basin as conducted by tian et al 2018 and sun et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 impacts of policy portfolio at the river basin scale we start our analysis with investigating the impacts of water management policy portfolio on water use and hydrological conditions at the river basin scale fig 6 shows how the water management policies i e groundwater resource fee ϕ gw allowable water table decline limit ξ and penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation η affect the depth to water table dwt river outflow to the downstream q out surface water use s sw and groundwater use s gw fig 6a1 a3 show that dwt is higher i e indicating more groundwater is exploited from aquifer with smaller ϕ gw larger ξ and smaller η these results are consistent with the results presented in fig 6b1 b3 which show that farmers tends to use more groundwater when groundwater resource fee is low i e ϕ gw is small and or when groundwater is not well protected from overexploitation i e ξ is large and η is small the opposite conclusion holds true for how these policies affect surface water diversion fig 6c1 c3 the outflow to the downstream as shown in fig 6d1 d3 increases when the water management policies 1 make groundwater cost lower than surface water cost and 2 loosen the strict regulations for groundwater protection i e set a larger ξ and or smaller η these results demonstrate that the model is capable of capturing the important relationships between water management policies farmers water use and hydrological conditions in the river basin more interestingly the modeling results have captured the nonlinear characteristics between water management policies water use and the associated hydrological responses for example in general groundwater consumption decreases when groundwater fee ϕ gw increases but the response rate highly depends on the initial value of ϕ gw fig 6b1 when the groundwater fee increases from 0 to 0 1 rmb m3 groundwater consumption decreases from 0 24 billion m3 to 0 19 billion m3 i e a total decrease of 0 05 billion m3 in comparison with the same interval of groundwater fee change from 0 1 rmb m3 to 0 2 rmb m3 groundwater consumption decreases from 0 19 billion m3 to 0 04 billion m3 i e a total decrease of 0 15 billion m3 which is 3 times of the previous decrease in groundwater consumption it can be seen that groundwater gw consumption is more sensitive to the change in gw resource fee ϕ gw when ϕ gw is closer to 0 2 rmb m3 i e the cost for surface water use c sw in this study this can be explained by comparing the cost of surface water sw and gw c gw ϕ gw ϕ pumping ϕ penalty as shown in fig 3 in this study we assume that farmers will first use the water resource with a lower cost when ϕ gw is low and water table drawdown is not significant i e ϕ penalty and ϕ pumping are small c gw is lower than c sw and a small increase in ϕ gw will not make c gw higher than c sw as a result gw consumption is maintained at a high level and is not very sensitive to the increase in ϕ gw however when ϕ gw is closer to c sw i e 0 2 rmb m3 a small increase in ϕ gw can make c gw greater than c sw resulting in a noticeable decrease in gw consumption therefore gw consumption becomes more sensitive to the change of ϕ gw when ϕ gw is larger in this regard surface water price ϕ sw can be used as a threshold indicator for measuring the sensitivity of groundwater consumption to the change of groundwater fee similar analysis can be conducted for understanding the nonlinear impacts of water table decline limit ξ and penalty rate for aquifer overexploitation η on groundwater consumption and other hydrological conditions these nonlinear relationships can provide important insights into human nature interactions and thus guide the design of effective water management policies in the context of chns 4 2 influence of water policies on conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water this section examines the spatial variability in the impacts of the policy portfolio on the water resources system by which we show the effectiveness of considering the heterogeneity in farmers water use and distributed hydrological processes fig 7 shows the ratio of surface water and groundwater use under two groundwater price scenarios over the twenty irrigation regions in the hrb the results show that groundwater and surface water account for 27 2 and 72 8 of total water withdrawal respectively when groundwater price ϕ gw is set as 0 04 rbm m3 note that surface water price ϕ sw is 0 20 rbm m3 in comparison when groundwater price ϕ gw increases to 0 20 rbm m3 i e a price that makes groundwater cost higher than surface water cost considering groundwater pumping cost the ratio of groundwater use decreases to 18 4 this result shows that the proposed water management portfolio can significantly impact the conjunctive groundwater and surface water use in the river basin and this impact can be quantified by the integrated model more importantly the results show the spatial heterogeneity in the conjunctive groundwater surface water use across the irrigation regions which will be discussed from the following two perspectives first noticeable heterogeneity is observed in the ratio of groundwater use over different irrigation regions in some regions e g wujiang shahe luotuocheng and dahuwan groundwater accounts for approximately 40 of total water withdrawal however this ratio is less than 5 in some other regions e g shangsan and ganjun this can be explained by the differences of hydrological conditions in these regions e g water table depth for example shangsan and ganjun have very deep groundwater table 100 m associated with high groundwater pumping cost therefore these regions highly rely on surface water for irrigation from the cost benefit perspective in comparison regions such as luotuocheng and dahuwan have shallow water table 20 m and therefore will use more groundwater due to low pumping cost secondly a noticeable heterogeneity can be observed in terms of the extent to which water policies can affect the conjunctive groundwater surface water use in these regions fig 7c shows that these twenty irrigation regions respond differently to the change of water policies for example for the three regions with a large portion of groundwater use i e shahe luotuocheng and dahuwan approximately 40 of water withdrawal is groundwater an increase of groundwater price from 0 04 rbm m3 to 0 20 rbm m3 can result in a decrease in groundwater use ratio from 40 to 10 for luotuocheng and dahuwan but only from 40 to 20 for shahe this shows that groundwater price ϕ gw has less impacts on groundwater use in shahe compared with the other two regions this is because shahe is located at the high elevation area in hrb and surface flow diversion is more costly making it more dependent on groundwater use than the other two regions with lower elevation wu et al 2015a 4 3 managing groundwater table to address environmental concern this section discusses the role of water policies in managing groundwater table an important environmental concern for the hrb fig 8 shows the change of groundwater table depth denoted by δ d w t during the simulation period from 2001 to 2016 i e δ d w t d w t y 2016 d w t y 2001 for some representative irrigation regions two important insights can be obtained from the results first from a qualitative perspective it is noticed that δ d w t respond to the water management policies in a consistent manner among these regions that is higher groundwater resource fee i e larger ϕ gw stricter constraint for groundwater table drawdown i e smaller ξ and higher penalty rate for groundwater overexploitation i e larger η will reduce groundwater use and increase aquifer recharge i e dwt decreases these regional scale results are consistent with the basin scale results presented in fig 6 secondly from a quantitative perspective the responses of dwt to water management policies vary from region to region for example luotuocheng and xinhua have active responses to water management policies in comparison negligible change of dwt is observed in yanuan and banqiao the results suggest that implementing the proposed policies will have more significant impact on groundwater table in luotuocheng and xinhua than that in yanuan and banqiao this is because yanuan and banqiao are closer to streams pumping induced groundwater depletion can be recharged from surface water in a faster rate therefore groundwater pumping in these two regions has relatively smaller impact on groundwater table compared with luotuocheng and xinhua that are far away from river to evaluate the potential of water policies influence on groundwater we use the absolute value of maximum change of groundwater table depth δ d w t as the indicator the cross region comparison of δ d w t in fig 9 shows that the designed water management policies are more effective to manage groundwater in regions such as luotuocheng sanqing and shahe compared with regions such as yanuan liaoquan and luocheng it is noticed that groundwater tables in regions that are close to the heihe river typically have a less active response to water management policies which is consistent with previous studies wu et al 2015a this is due to the fact that regions that are closer to river tend to have more rapid groundwater recharge from surface water when aquifer depletion occurs these results show that the modeling framework can 1 simulate spatially heterogeneous effects of water policies influence on groundwater system and 2 help with detecting more effective policies e g ϕ gw in fig 8a and active regions e g luotuocheng in fig 9 for location based water resources management 4 4 temporal dynamics of policy influence on hydrological systems the previous analyses have focused on spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policy on hydrological system in this section we evaluate the temporal dynamics of water management policy influence on hydrological system in the hrb using the relationship between groundwater table decline limit ξ and the depth to water table as an illustrative example fig 10 a c shows how daily groundwater table responds to different levels of ξ in luotuocheng yanuan and banqiao respectively which can be categorized into three representative temporal dynamic patterns the first pattern is that changing the levels of water policy ξ can significantly affect groundwater table dynamics which is reflected by the case of luotuocheng in fig 10a when ξ is set as 4 0 m representing a scenario for poorly regulated aquifer groundwater table declines over time in comparison when the policy is strengthened by setting ξ as 0 5 m groundwater table increases due to reduced groundwater pumping the second pattern is that changing the levels of water policy ξ does not significantly change the trend of groundwater table dynamics but the magnitude of groundwater table dynamics is affected this pattern is reflected by the case of banqiao in this region groundwater table exhibits a consistent declining trend for all of the four policy scenarios fig 10c but setting stricter water management policies i e a smaller ξ can reduce the water table declining rate the third pattern is that groundwater table dynamics has negligible response to water policy and this is reflected by the case of yanuan fig 10b it is observed that the annual average of groundwater table is quite stable due to rapid recharge from surface water as a result implementing different levels of water policy ξ does not affect the temporal dynamics of groundwater table in this region these results provide some insights into the temporal coevolution between human activities and hydrological processes which will be discussed in the next section 4 5 insights into the coevolution of chnss and policy implications the modeling results discussed above provide some insights into the analysis of river basins as chnss it is demonstrated that hydrogeological conditions e g depth to groundwater table distance to rivers can significantly affect the interactions between human activities and hydrological systems for example regions with deep groundwater table e g shangsan and ganjun are associated with higher pumping cost and therefore can reduce farmers groundwater consumption and increase farmers surface water diversion activities as demonstrated in fig 7 in regions that are close to rivers surface water can recharge aquifer rapidly and as a result groundwater table has less active response to groundwater policies compared with regions that are far away from rivers these results highlight the role of hydrogeological conditions in the analysis of the coevolution between human activities and hydrological processes the modeling results could also provide some policy implications for river basin management for example as demonstrated in fig 7 increasing groundwater price from 0 04 rmb m3 to 0 20 rmb m3 has significantly different impacts on groundwater consumption across the irrigation regions in the hrb e g dahuwan reduces more groundwater consumption than shahe this indicates that location based water pricing policies can be implemented to influence farmers groundwater use activities also in regions with more intense groundwater table dynamics e g luotuocheng policies that regulate groundwater table can be more effective than that in regions with relatively smaller groundwater table dynamics e g yanuan these results highlight the needs for designing and implementing spatially varied and temporally dynamic policy portfolio in large river basins taking account of the location dependent hydrogeological conditions note that here we analyzed several representative irrigation districts in the hrb more analyses can be conducted to comprehensively compare the spatiotemporal characteristics of human hydrological interactions in all of the 20 irrigation districts which may lead to more insights into policy design for informed water resources management in addition it is also feasible to explore human hydrological interactions under the influence of other types of policy scenarios such as location dependent and temporally dynamic groundwater taxes across the river basin the modeling results for such policy scenarios may further enhance our understanding of human hydrological interactions in agricultural systems 5 conclusions limitations and future work in this study we develop an agent based model abm for simulating farmers decision making on conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water under the influence of policy portfolio with collective water management policies moreover we realize a tight coupling between the abm and an integrated groundwater surface water hydrological model gsflow for simulating groundwater surface water interactions the two models are fully integrated together by embedding the source code of the abm into gsflow which allows for computationally tractable simulation of human hydrological processes in large river basins the integration of abm and gsflow with sufficient spatial field scale and temporal daily time step details allows us to model how the interaction of groundwater surface water affects water use decisions and policy effectiveness and meanwhile how human influences affect hydrological processes for an illustrative purpose the modeling framework is applied to the heihe river basin hrb the second largest inland river basin in china a policy portfolio with mixed groundwater and surface water policies is designed to test the modeling framework s functionalities and capabilities for large river basin management through various scenario analyses the modeling results demonstrate that the tightly coupled model can detect the nonlinear relationships between water management policies farmers water use decisions and hydrological processes even more importantly they can capture the heterogeneities in the human hydrological interactions i e the spatial variability of 1 farmers responses to hydrological conditions and 2 the impacts of water policies and water use decisions on hydrological processes the modeling results have detected three unique temporal dynamic patterns regarding water policies influences on hydrological systems e g water table it is found that regional hydrogeological conditions e g depth to water table distance to rivers are important factors that affect human hydrological interactions insights from these modeling results are informative for identifying effective water management policies such as setting spatially varied groundwater prices and location based penalties for aquifer overexploitation while this paper mainly focuses on the development of such an integrated modeling framework the current model still has some limitations that will be addressed in the future work firstly unlike some studies that consider farmers decision making on crop choice this study does not embed a crop choice module in the abm and simply assumes that farmers will plant corn one of the major planted crops in the case study area this is due to the fact that farmers crop choices in the study site have been significantly affected by the local government s crop policies e g subsidies for planting certain types of crops which is challenging to simulate with the widely used economic optimization methods in previous studies hu et al 2015a mulligan et al 2014 future work can be conducted to include a crop choice module in the abm when the local government s long term crop policy information become available furthermore in this study we simply assume that farmers behaviors follow the economic optimization principle which might not fully reflect the decision making mechanisms of all of the farmers future work can conduct interviews or surveys to understand farmers empirical decision making processes in the real world in particular it is important to investigate how farmers make decisions in the face of uncertainties in water availability precipitation and crop price etc these will enhance our understanding of farmers decision rules in the real world and guide the design of more informed water management policies secondly the current model simulates uniform water management policies across the entire river basin however location specific policies e g water table decline limit and water resources fee could be important for efficient water resources management due to the heterogeneous hydrogeological conditions in the watershed elbakidze et al 2018 khan and brown 2019 in addition the association between different types of policies should be considered when a water management policy portfolio is designed for example a larger groundwater overexploitation penalty should be imposed when the depth to water table is higher thirdly some important model components and constraints can be explicitly included in the model e g water availability that could be influenced by climate variability reservoir operation and minimum flow requirement for the downstream to enhance its capabilities for analyzing comprehensive human natural interactions in large river basins we envision that the proposed modeling framework can be useful for integrated groundwater surface water management and these future improvements could yield more informative insights into our understanding of the complexities feedbacks and co

5054,the need for protection of freshwater resources with population growth and frequent droughts has become an important issue especially in arid and semiarid regions investigations show that evaporation is the reason of significant losses in water reservoirs and thus suppressing it could effectively enhance water storage strategies covering reservoirs with modular floating elements such as floating balls offers a simple and reliable measure for suppression of evaporative losses despite extensive studies on the application of floating covers its performance in the presence of surface flows while coverage fraction might change due to the cover density has not yet been studied systematically the present study thus aims to experimentally address the effect of cover fraction of floating balls induced by changing balls density and thus immersion depth on the evaporation suppression efficiency and potential impacts on the change in the surface energy balance due to surface flows for this purpose a small water basin with 1 13 m2 surface area and 0 5 m depth is fully covered with white and black polyethylene balls with diameter of 70 mm and two different masses i e 90 g and 127 g providing 0 83 and 0 77 surface cover fraction respectively overall the white balls showed the highest evaporation suppression efficiency also it is found that with increasing balls density so that more than half of the volume sinks into the water surface coverage and thus suppression efficiency decreases interestingly the results showed that with increasing water surface flow rate the evaporative loss is first reduced until a certain flow rate the so called optimal water flow rate and then it increases gradually with associated effects on reservoirs energy balance where cover water energy exchanges may alter with changing balls density keywords evaporation suppression floating balls density water surface flow optimal flow rate energy balance 1 introduction population growth with fast development of industry and agriculture has exacerbated the freshwater demands in a changing climate characterized by frequent and prolonged droughts the storage of freshwater in reservoirs and ponds during the rainy seasons has been an ancient way to mitigate water shortages in dry spells nevertheless in arid and semi arid regions a significant fraction of stored water is lost via surface evaporation atmospheric forcing i e air temperature and relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and reservoir s characteristics e g surface area depth primarily govern evaporative losses from reservoirs hence water storage in underground reservoirs aminzadeh et al 2018 elsebaie et al 2017 the use of floating physical covers álvarez et al 2006 or chemical films schouten et al 2012 and construction of windbreaks helfer et al 2009 are the common ways to suppress evaporation studies show that physical covers provide a relatively simple and cost effective solution among different techniques schouten et al 2012 youssef and khodzinskaya 2019 the physical covers are divided into two types i e suspended shades and modular floating covers suspended shades could effectively cover the water surface and thus offer higher suppression efficiency than floating covers nevertheless in case of full coverage of the surface they intercept incoming radiative flux and interfere in oxygen transfer thereby leaving certain biological and chemical impacts in water quality however the presence of gaps between modular floating covers enables light and oxygen transfer supporting the aquatic life ruskowitz et al 2014 although the primary solution for mitigating evaporative losses seems to be maximizing the covered area the complexity of mass transfer from partially covered surfaces and its coupling with surface energy balance and the geometry of floating elements may result in an inefficient solution for evaporation suppression the laboratory investigations of assouline et al 2010 on the effects of partial surface coverage and gap size delineated a non linear relationship between suppression efficiency and surface cover fraction similar results were also obtained by ruskowitz et al 2014 in studying the effect of cover geometry and radiative properties on evaporation suppression and energy efficiency of salt gradient solar ponds see fig 9 in ruskowitz et al 2014 their findings highlighted the effect of cover thermal and radiative properties on energy exchanges between cover elements and water body and heat content of salinity stratified solar ponds in general the effects of cover material geometry and color affecting thermal and radiative properties on evaporation suppression and energy balance of reservoirs have been widely investigated at different scales cooley 1970 studied the design of floating covers through the examination of energy balance at the water surface and covers made of lightweight concrete white butyl rubber and styrofoam it was shown that white color elements have the highest suppression efficiency in addition for a given fraction of covered area a single floating cover with a single open area is more effective in suppressing evaporative losses relative to several smaller covers with several small open water gaps forming between them benzaghta et al 2013 covered a water reservoir surface in putra university malaysia with mengkuang mat pieces of plywood and galvanized iron corrugated sheets and reported 40 33 and 26 suppression efficiency respectively considering potential facilities available in a region natural wastes can be used as covers instead of manufacturing physical covers to reduce evaporation from free water surfaces for example alam and alshaikh 2013 used palm sheets as bio waste to cover open reservoirs in saudi arabia and found that these covers have evaporation reduction efficiency up to 58 with almost no effect on water quality chaudhari and chaudhari 2015 used thermocol sheets to cover water basins in a village in india although the cover sheets were damaged by lightning but they were able to prevent around 32 of the evaporation losses after the damage aminzadeh et al 2018 and lehmann et al 2019 have used white and black polyethylene balls and styrofoam discs as floating covers on a small laboratory basin with 1 44 m2 surface area and 0 16 m depth their experimental results showed that the disc shaped covers have a better performance than floating balls in reducing evaporation surprisingly their numerical field scale analyses and laboratory measurements did not show significant differences in suppression efficiency of black and white covers explained by cover thermal properties however cover color effectively influenced surface energy balance of the covered water bodies an important factor on the evaporative loss from open water reservoirs is thermal mixing of water layers or destratification although the first attempts of artificial destratification aimed at improving the water quality the potential of this technique in controlling evaporative losses due to thermal destratification is now well known in fact induced mixing of water layers can lift up the colder hypolimnion layers and mix it with warmer epilimnion where strongly controls evaporative losses helfer et al 2012 in 1999 cox 1999 investigated the effect of thermal mixing of water layers on evaporation rate of open reservoirs in cyprus his research showed that destratification with agitator machines has the potential to reduce evaporation 10 to 30 sherman et al 2010 performed a numerical analysis on the effect of thermal mixing of layers on evaporation reduction of open reservoirs and showed that the artificial destratification has an acceptable performance in reducing the evaporation rate of deep storages the effectiveness of destratification by air bubble plumes in reducing evaporation from shallow and deep reservoirs was assessed by helfer et al 2012 the results showed that destratification can decrease surface temperature and thus evaporation from both deep and shallow water bodies with a rather higher impact on deep reservoirs despite numerous studies on the application of modular floating elements or thermal destratification techniques in suppression of evaporative losses the lack of a systematic work in consideration of surface coverage fraction in a fully packed configuration of spherical covers in the presence of surface flows is evident many open water reservoirs such as dams ponds or multipurpose reservoirs such as fish cultures have inlet and outlet surface flows induced by rivers springs or supply channels that could potentially affect performance of floating elements and water energy balance especially when surface is not fully covered accordingly the main objective of the present study is to experimentally assess the evaporation suppression in a reservoir covered with floating black and white balls with different densities changing immersion depth and thus surface coverage in the presence of surface water flows then this study aims to link the laboratory scale findings with energy balance considerations and provides a scientific basis for design purposes guided by affecting environmental factors and reservoir characteristics following this introduction the experimental setup and theoretical energy balance modeling are presented finally the experimental results obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and the attributes to the water energy balance will be discussed 2 experimental setup and test procedure the experiments are conducted in a 6 mm thick polyethylene basin with 1 06 m 1 07 m 1 13 m2 surface area and 50 cm depth fig 1 a a centrifugal pump is used to create water surface flow in the tests with surface flow seven different flow rates including 1 0 3 0 4 5 6 5 8 0 10 0 and 12 lit min are considered the pressure head at the outlet of pump upstream reservoir is kept constant by supplying water from a marriott bottle the water level in the pump reservoir is initially adjusted at the air inlet of the marriott bottle and thus the change in water height of the pump reservoir due to the evaporation from the test basin is compensated by the makeup water from the marriott bottle via a siphon accordingly decrease in water elevation of the marriott bottle measured by a pressure transmitter sensys pshh 00 1 biig 0 15 fs accuracy korea is converted to the evaporative losses from the test basin a similar pressure transmitter installed at the bottom of basin directly measures evaporative loss when there is no surface flow air temperature relative humidity and wind speed are measured using a psychrometer anemometer device c310 kimo 0 1 c 1 5 fs rh 3 05 fs vel accuracy

measured by four thermocouples ktt320 kimo 0 1 c accuracy france located at depths of zw 0 zm 1 12 zm 2 24 and zb 36 cm from the water surface six 500 watt osram lamps mimicked a rather uniform radiation flux of 600 to 700 w m2 over the basin measured by a solarimeter sl100 kimo 0 1300 w m2 50 w m2 accuracy france note that the tungsten halogen spectrum is similar to the sunlight with a peak of 0 9 μm at 3200 k a schematic drawing of the arrangement and placement of lamps on the surface of the water is shown in fig 1 the surface of the basin is covered with 246 balls diameter of 70 mm with two different masses of 90 and 127 g i e two different densities of 500 kg m3 and 707 kg m3 note that 90 g balls could float half sunken and 127 g balls are dipped in water about 1 cm more see details in fig 2 note that each test is specified by an identification symbol as s x y q such that q denotes the water surface flow rate lit min x stands for the color of covering balls w white b black bw mix of black and white color balls n no cover and y indicates the type of ball l light balls with mass of 90 g and h heavy balls with mass of 127 g for example s bw h 6 0 means that the test is performed at 6 0 lit min water surface flow while the basin is covered with a mixture of black and white heavy balls fig 3 illustrates details of laboratory equipment and all covering conditions for each water flow rate evaporation from the basin under different surface conditions of uncovered covered with the white balls covered with the black balls and covered with the mixture of black white balls is measured for a period of more than six hours the first four hours are considered to meet an approximate equilibrium in environmental conditions air temperature and relative humidity at 30 cm above the surface and the last two hours are for data recording this allows investigating the dynamics of temperature variation within the basin for a stable environmental condition note that mass loss rates were obtained based on the measurements at the end of data recording period where a rather steady state thermal condition established in the basin each test has been replicated three times and the average of measured parameters is considered for the analysis the square root of the variance of difference between each of the three measurements and the average value represents the uncertainty value although designation of experimental setup looks similar to those in ruskowitz et al 2014 and silva et al 2017 for studying the effect of floating covers on evaporation reduction of solar ponds fundamental differences exist transparent covers in the above mentioned studies do not hinder radiative energy input into the pond while opaque covers here aim to decrease energy content of water body and thus provide less energy available for evaporative losses moreover the salt gradient solar ponds function by maintaining a very strong stratification with depth while our approach using surface flows is designed to reduce the stratification 3 the energy balance model the energy balance of the reservoir is considered based on a simple representation of surface and lateral heat fluxes to provide a theoretical basis for interpretation of experimental findings the model investigates contribution of water surface flows and latent sensible and radiative fluxes in changing water body energy storage based on eq 1 cooley 1970 ali et al 2008 fekih et al 2013 1 δ s r n h l e a s q v q wall where δs w is the change in water energy storage rn w m2 is the net radiation flux le w m2

is the friction velocity that is governed by mean air flow velocity over the surface surface coverage fraction and geometrical characteristics of cover elements see appendix a for details tacit in this formulation is a rigid underlying surface while over water surfaces formation of wind or water flow driven waves and subsequent hydrodynamic interaction of floating covers with water results in a very complex surface condition that is beyond the scope of the present study the change in water body energy storage δs can be obtained from eq 6 gallego elvira et al 2012 6 δ s ρ w c w a s j 1 n d j

24 and zb 36 cm from the water surface and δtwj k is the change in water temperature of each layer during a given time step δt considering the volume and heat capacity of stored water relative to floating covers we further assumed that energy storage into the cover elements is negligible in the presence of water inflows and outflows the net advected heat into the water body is described based on the volume weighted heat content of water flows moreo and swancar 2013 aminzadeh et al 2018 7 q v i ρ w c w q wi t i t e ρ w c w q we t e t where qwi and qwe are the discharge of inflows and outflows respectively and ti and te are the mean temperatures of inflows and outflows respectively the parameter t is the mean temperature of the water body note that in the present experiments water is circulated by the pump in a closed system hence the temperature difference between inlet and outlet water flows rapidly adjusts to a value close to zero at the beginning of each experiment so that qv approaches zero finally the heat exchanges with the surroundings through the reservoir s walls qwall are obtained from eq 8 8 q wall k b a b δ t wall δ x where kb is the thermal conductivity of the

storage reservoirs walls and bottom of the reservoirs are often covered with waterproofing membranes that have very low thermal conductivity thereby the main energy exchanges of the water body with surroundings occur at the surface after implementing the energy balance equation and calculating for the evaporation rate e the efficiency of evaporation suppression for covered reservoir can be obtained based on eq 9 assouline et al 2010 9 1 e e 0 where e 0 is the evaporation rate of the uncovered reservoir in no flow condition in the following experimental results and comparisons with the model estimations of evaporative loss are presented 4 results in this section the results of the evaporation experiments obtained under well controlled laboratory conditions are presented and interpreted based on the energy balance attributes fig 4 shows the radiative flux on the surface of the basin under equilibrium environmental conditions i e after 4 hrs since the onset of each test as pointed out in section 2 the intensity of shortwave radiation flux intercepted at the surface was 600 700 w m2 with an average value around 650 w m2 as an example fig 5 shows the environmental equilibrium conditions air temperature and relative humidity at elevation z 0 3 m for two different cases s w l 1 0 and s n 12 0 the figure demonstrates that the air temperature and relative humidity were almost constant during the last two hours 4 1 uncertainty of measurements the uncertainty analysis of measurements was conducted based on three replications of each test the uncertainty values for light heavy white black and mixed cover balls and uncovered condition under eight surface flow rates are depicted in figs 6 and 7 details are provided in appendix b as seen the maximum uncertainty is about 0 025 mm hr for the case of light black covers in surface flow rate of qw 12 lit min and the average of uncertainty is between 0 004 and 0 014 mm hr generally these uncertainties could be attributed to the difficulty of providing equilibrium environmental conditions and the accuracy of the measurement devices 4 2 evaporative water loss and suppression efficiency the effect of different cover conditions i e no cover covered with white balls covered with black balls and covered with the mixture of black white balls on the evaporation rate and evaporation suppression efficiency in the presence of water surface flow are depicted in fig 6 the results belong to the light balls as expected the use of floating covers has a significant effect on reduction of surface evaporation for instance the use of white covers results in suppression efficiency of 60 8 in the presence of 1 0 lit min water surface flow fig 7 displays evaporation rate and suppression efficiency results when heavy balls with different colors covered the basin the results state that when the covers become heavy and more than half of the ball s volume is immersed in water see fig 2 evaporation increases another important finding from these two figures is that by increasing the water surface flow rate the evaporation rate is first reduced i e the evaporation reduction efficiency is increased to a certain flow rate called the optimal flow rate and then it increases gradually this feature is more visible for the uncovered conditions as the rate of evaporation decreases from 0 915 mm hr for the zero flow rate to a value around 0 685 mm hr for 6 5 lit min surface water flow rate as a matter of fact this 25 1 evaporation suppression efficiency suggests that the presence of water surface flows in shallow reservoirs can be considered as a simple and cost effective way to reduce evaporation along with application of floating covers the trend of evaporation rate marked for the average of three measurement replications with associated error bars in figs 6 and 7 show the robustness and validity of this claim especially for the uncovered scenario however the presence of floating balls decreases the optimal flow rate the interpretation of these phenomena needs analyzing the temperature changes in different layers of the basin which will be discussed in the next subsection the details of the above mentioned laboratory data and also the results of energy balance modeling section 3 for the floating light balls are presented in table 2 as seen in this table the simple representation of energy balance model can estimate the evaporation rate with an acceptable accuracy for all conditions with and without covering with and without water surface flow to show this clearly the comparison of experimental and energy balance model results for the case of uncovered and covered with light and heavy white balls under various water surface flow rates is presented in scatter plot of fig 8 fig 9 compares the combined effects of cover type light and heavy balls cover color and surface flow rate on the evaporation suppression efficiency considering the small difference between cover fractions of light and heavy balls 0 77 and 0 83 the experimental results suggest that cover color and flow rate are dominant factors in suppression efficiency 4 3 vertical water temperature profile fig 10 shows the temperature variations in four different layers during the test for the uncovered condition in three different flow rates zero optimal and maximum in this figure tw is the water surface temperature and tm 1 tm 2 and tb are the water temperatures at depths zm 1 12 zm 2 24 and zb 36 cm respectively as seen by increasing the flow rate and consequently increasing the mixing between water layers the temperature of the surface layer decreases while the temperature of the underlying layers increases in other words the difference of the temperature between the layers decreases this condition decreasing the temperature of the surface layer reduces the water surface evaporation as shown in fig 6 however by increasing the flow rate and passing it from the optimal flow rate for example qw 6 5 lit min for the uncovered condition the water surface evaporation increases gradually variations of the temperature in four different water layers for the conditions of covering with light and heavy white balls are depicted in fig 11 same as the uncovered condition it is seen that by increasing the flow rate and accordingly increasing the mixing of water layers the temperature of the surface layer decreases while the temperature of the underlying layers increases as seen the water surface temperature tw of the basin covered with heavy white balls is always higher than that covered with light white balls 5 discussion 5 1 the effects of cover properties on evaporation rate comparing the results in figs 6 and 7 demonstrates that evaporation suppression efficiency depends on surface coverage fraction governed by cover density a light ball covers the water surface by a 70 mm diameter circle providing 0 83 surface coverage in dense packing of balls while a heavy ball can cover the water surface by a circle with diameter around 67 1 mm 0 77 surface coverage this reduction of surface coverage increases evaporative area on the surface of basin and thus decreases evaporation suppression efficiency as depicted in fig 9 although lehmann et al lehmann et al 2019 did not find significant differences between black and white polyethylene balls in suppression of evaporative loss the higher albedo of white balls in our experiments clearly offered higher suppression efficiency compared with black and mixed covers fig 9 5 2 theoretical energy balance modeling the simple energy balance model provided reliable estimates for evaluating combined effects of cover properties and flow condition on evaporative mass loss from the basin in accordance with experimental measurements details of modeling results table 2 and fig 8 suggest that cover color and water mixing are primary factors affecting evaporation rates based on eq 1 changes in surface temperature due to the influence of cover thermal and radiative properties or water flows affect radiative and sensible heat fluxes and thus alter energy content available for evaporative latent heat on the surface of the partially covered basin note that nuanced aspects of the flow condition associated with the stability of the overlying air were not explicitly addressed in this analysis considering the small surface area of our laboratory basin 1 13 m2 we opted for a simple but still physically based representation of surface boundary layer for the sake of modeling sensible heat exchanges between the surface and air mass however the surface boundary layer approach invoked here could be linked with different monin obukhov atmospheric stability conditions as proposed by haghighi and or 2015b to account for complexities of surface air interactions in field applications 5 3 changes in vertical temperature profile and evaporative loss with surface flow the radiation absorption in water layers changes with depth so that the highest radiative energy is absorbed at the surface without lateral flows in a water column the increase in water temperature at the surface due to the radiation absorption forms a warm and low density layer with a specified thickness over the colder water layers beneath such thermal stratification in water reservoirs hinders vertical oxygen transfer in water layers the increase in incoming radiative flux increases near surface water temperature that in turn increases evaporative losses from the reservoir and probably influences water quality in lower layers with affecting dissolved oxygen concentration cox 1999 as observed in fig 10 the flow induced mixing within the basin decreases the temperature of the surface layer and thus effectively suppresses evaporative loss by decreasing saturated vapor concentration at the water surface nevertheless the increase in flow rate above the optimal flow rate eventually enhances evaporation rate figs 6 and 7 to explain this finding it is worthy to link it with air mass aerodynamic condition above the surface in the presence of a water surface flow the air mass over the surface of the reservoir is forced to move due to the no slip boundary condition yielding an aerodynamic boundary layer with thickness of δv considering that the value of δv is proportional to the inverse of the air velocity near the surface haghighi and or 2013 increasing the water surface flow rate decreases δv formed over the surface consequently the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer i e δm sc 1 3 δv where sc is the schmidt number decreases which eventually increases the vapor concentration gradient between the surface and the air flow on the other hand in accordance with the results of haghighi and or 2013 and aminzadeh and or 2014 the convective sensible heat transfer between the surface and the air is proportional to the thickness of the aerodynamic boundary layer thus by increasing the surface flow the heat transfer between the water body and the air increases where the water surface temperature is often lower than the air temperature mostly in summer and thus required energy for evaporative loss is provided therefore by passing the optimal flow rate the role of increase in evaporation rate due to the reduction of aerodynamic boundary layer thickness overcomes the mixing of the water layers in reducing the evaporation rate and thus evaporation suppression efficiency decreases note that the above mentioned analysis strongly depends on the relative velocity between the overlying air flow and water surface flow and their mutual interaction finally governs the heat and mass exchanges between the surface and air the reduction of optimal flow rate in the presence of floating balls relative to the uncovered scenario might be linked to the role of covers in enhancing surface mixing and thus surface air exchanges with increasing surface flow rate and consequent cover water interactions 6 summary and conclusion in this study the influence of floating balls density in the presence of water surface flows on evaporation reduction of open reservoirs was experimentally examined a small water basin with 1 13 m2 surface area and 0 5 m depth was covered with black and white balls diameter of 70 mm with two different masses of 90 and 127 g corresponding to densities of 500 kg m3 and 707 kg m3 respectively seven different flow rates including 1 0 3 0 4 5 6 5 8 0 10 0 and 12 lit min were created by a pump the main findings of the study can be summarized as follows covering the reservoir with white balls showed the best efficiency in evaporation reduction increasing the density of the ball so that more than half of the ball s volume immersed into the water decreased coverage fraction and increased evaporative losses with increasing the water surface flow rate the evaporation rate was first reduced until a certain flow rate the optimal flow rate and then increased gradually after the optimal flow rate the role of increasing the evaporation rate due to the reduction of aerodynamic boundary layer thickness overcame the role of the water layers mixing in reducing the evaporation rate thereby reduction in evaporation efficiency was observed the simple energy balance model offered certain capability in estimation of evaporative losses for all conditions with and without covering surface flow although the present study made use of polyethylene balls for measurement purposes to quantify the effects of cover density and surface flows on suppression efficiency of spherical covers we acknowledge certain environmental issues associated with plastic fabricated floating covers these covers are often susceptible to degradation under severe environmental condition such as intense solar radiation that might potentially affect water quality accordingly development of environmentally friendly cover materials such as ultra lightweight alkali activated slag concrete not only offers potential applicability in water treatment processes luukkonen et al 2019 but also enables utilizing wastes and by products of industrial activities e g iron manufacturing to alleviate the evaporative water loss problem in open water reservoirs water recirculation in many small reservoirs with inlet and outlet flows would potentially affect suppression efficiency of floating covers highlighting the importance of our results in design purposes notwithstanding interesting laboratory findings here certain aspects including the effects of reservoir depth variation of atmospheric forcing and width and depth of influence of surface flows need systematic reservoir scale investigations to delineate a comprehensive

5054,the need for protection of freshwater resources with population growth and frequent droughts has become an important issue especially in arid and semiarid regions investigations show that evaporation is the reason of significant losses in water reservoirs and thus suppressing it could effectively enhance water storage strategies covering reservoirs with modular floating elements such as floating balls offers a simple and reliable measure for suppression of evaporative losses despite extensive studies on the application of floating covers its performance in the presence of surface flows while coverage fraction might change due to the cover density has not yet been studied systematically the present study thus aims to experimentally address the effect of cover fraction of floating balls induced by changing balls density and thus immersion depth on the evaporation suppression efficiency and potential impacts on the change in the surface energy balance due to surface flows for this purpose a small water basin with 1 13 m2 surface area and 0 5 m depth is fully covered with white and black polyethylene balls with diameter of 70 mm and two different masses i e 90 g and 127 g providing 0 83 and 0 77 surface cover fraction respectively overall the white balls showed the highest evaporation suppression efficiency also it is found that with increasing balls density so that more than half of the volume sinks into the water surface coverage and thus suppression efficiency decreases interestingly the results showed that with increasing water surface flow rate the evaporative loss is first reduced until a certain flow rate the so called optimal water flow rate and then it increases gradually with associated effects on reservoirs energy balance where cover water energy exchanges may alter with changing balls density keywords evaporation suppression floating balls density water surface flow optimal flow rate energy balance 1 introduction population growth with fast development of industry and agriculture has exacerbated the freshwater demands in a changing climate characterized by frequent and prolonged droughts the storage of freshwater in reservoirs and ponds during the rainy seasons has been an ancient way to mitigate water shortages in dry spells nevertheless in arid and semi arid regions a significant fraction of stored water is lost via surface evaporation atmospheric forcing i e air temperature and relative humidity wind speed solar radiation and reservoir s characteristics e g surface area depth primarily govern evaporative losses from reservoirs hence water storage in underground reservoirs aminzadeh et al 2018 elsebaie et al 2017 the use of floating physical covers álvarez et al 2006 or chemical films schouten et al 2012 and construction of windbreaks helfer et al 2009 are the common ways to suppress evaporation studies show that physical covers provide a relatively simple and cost effective solution among different techniques schouten et al 2012 youssef and khodzinskaya 2019 the physical covers are divided into two types i e suspended shades and modular floating covers suspended shades could effectively cover the water surface and thus offer higher suppression efficiency than floating covers nevertheless in case of full coverage of the surface they intercept incoming radiative flux and interfere in oxygen transfer thereby leaving certain biological and chemical impacts in water quality however the presence of gaps between modular floating covers enables light and oxygen transfer supporting the aquatic life ruskowitz et al 2014 although the primary solution for mitigating evaporative losses seems to be maximizing the covered area the complexity of mass transfer from partially covered surfaces and its coupling with surface energy balance and the geometry of floating elements may result in an inefficient solution for evaporation suppression the laboratory investigations of assouline et al 2010 on the effects of partial surface coverage and gap size delineated a non linear relationship between suppression efficiency and surface cover fraction similar results were also obtained by ruskowitz et al 2014 in studying the effect of cover geometry and radiative properties on evaporation suppression and energy efficiency of salt gradient solar ponds see fig 9 in ruskowitz et al 2014 their findings highlighted the effect of cover thermal and radiative properties on energy exchanges between cover elements and water body and heat content of salinity stratified solar ponds in general the effects of cover material geometry and color affecting thermal and radiative properties on evaporation suppression and energy balance of reservoirs have been widely investigated at different scales cooley 1970 studied the design of floating covers through the examination of energy balance at the water surface and covers made of lightweight concrete white butyl rubber and styrofoam it was shown that white color elements have the highest suppression efficiency in addition for a given fraction of covered area a single floating cover with a single open area is more effective in suppressing evaporative losses relative to several smaller covers with several small open water gaps forming between them benzaghta et al 2013 covered a water reservoir surface in putra university malaysia with mengkuang mat pieces of plywood and galvanized iron corrugated sheets and reported 40 33 and 26 suppression efficiency respectively considering potential facilities available in a region natural wastes can be used as covers instead of manufacturing physical covers to reduce evaporation from free water surfaces for example alam and alshaikh 2013 used palm sheets as bio waste to cover open reservoirs in saudi arabia and found that these covers have evaporation reduction efficiency up to 58 with almost no effect on water quality chaudhari and chaudhari 2015 used thermocol sheets to cover water basins in a village in india although the cover sheets were damaged by lightning but they were able to prevent around 32 of the evaporation losses after the damage aminzadeh et al 2018 and lehmann et al 2019 have used white and black polyethylene balls and styrofoam discs as floating covers on a small laboratory basin with 1 44 m2 surface area and 0 16 m depth their experimental results showed that the disc shaped covers have a better performance than floating balls in reducing evaporation surprisingly their numerical field scale analyses and laboratory measurements did not show significant differences in suppression efficiency of black and white covers explained by cover thermal properties however cover color effectively influenced surface energy balance of the covered water bodies an important factor on the evaporative loss from open water reservoirs is thermal mixing of water layers or destratification although the first attempts of artificial destratification aimed at improving the water quality the potential of this technique in controlling evaporative losses due to thermal destratification is now well known in fact induced mixing of water layers can lift up the colder hypolimnion layers and mix it with warmer epilimnion where strongly controls evaporative losses helfer et al 2012 in 1999 cox 1999 investigated the effect of thermal mixing of water layers on evaporation rate of open reservoirs in cyprus his research showed that destratification with agitator machines has the potential to reduce evaporation 10 to 30 sherman et al 2010 performed a numerical analysis on the effect of thermal mixing of layers on evaporation reduction of open reservoirs and showed that the artificial destratification has an acceptable performance in reducing the evaporation rate of deep storages the effectiveness of destratification by air bubble plumes in reducing evaporation from shallow and deep reservoirs was assessed by helfer et al 2012 the results showed that destratification can decrease surface temperature and thus evaporation from both deep and shallow water bodies with a rather higher impact on deep reservoirs despite numerous studies on the application of modular floating elements or thermal destratification techniques in suppression of evaporative losses the lack of a systematic work in consideration of surface coverage fraction in a fully packed configuration of spherical covers in the presence of surface flows is evident many open water reservoirs such as dams ponds or multipurpose reservoirs such as fish cultures have inlet and outlet surface flows induced by rivers springs or supply channels that could potentially affect performance of floating elements and water energy balance especially when surface is not fully covered accordingly the main objective of the present study is to experimentally assess the evaporation suppression in a reservoir covered with floating black and white balls with different densities changing immersion depth and thus surface coverage in the presence of surface water flows then this study aims to link the laboratory scale findings with energy balance considerations and provides a scientific basis for design purposes guided by affecting environmental factors and reservoir characteristics following this introduction the experimental setup and theoretical energy balance modeling are presented finally the experimental results obtained under controlled laboratory conditions and the attributes to the water energy balance will be discussed 2 experimental setup and test procedure the experiments are conducted in a 6 mm thick polyethylene basin with 1 06 m 1 07 m 1 13 m2 surface area and 50 cm depth fig 1 a a centrifugal pump is used to create water surface flow in the tests with surface flow seven different flow rates including 1 0 3 0 4 5 6 5 8 0 10 0 and 12 lit min are considered the pressure head at the outlet of pump upstream reservoir is kept constant by supplying water from a marriott bottle the water level in the pump reservoir is initially adjusted at the air inlet of the marriott bottle and thus the change in water height of the pump reservoir due to the evaporation from the test basin is compensated by the makeup water from the marriott bottle via a siphon accordingly decrease in water elevation of the marriott bottle measured by a pressure transmitter sensys pshh 00 1 biig 0 15 fs accuracy korea is converted to the evaporative losses from the test basin a similar pressure transmitter installed at the bottom of basin directly measures evaporative loss when there is no surface flow air temperature relative humidity and wind speed are measured using a psychrometer anemometer device c310 kimo 0 1 c 1 5 fs rh 3 05 fs vel accuracy

of 0 9 μm at 3200 k a schematic drawing of the arrangement and placement of lamps on the surface of the water is shown in fig 1 the surface of the basin is covered with 246 balls diameter of 70 mm with two different masses of 90 and 127 g i e two different densities of 500 kg m3 and 707 kg m3 note that 90 g balls could float half sunken and 127 g balls are dipped in water about 1 cm more see details in fig 2 note that each test is specified by an identification symbol as s x y q such that q denotes the water surface flow rate lit min x stands for the color of covering balls w white b black bw mix of black and white color balls n no cover and y indicates the type of ball l light balls with mass of 90 g and h heavy balls with mass of 127 g for example s bw h 6 0 means that the test is performed at 6 0 lit min water surface flow while the basin is covered with a mixture of black and white heavy balls fig 3 illustrates details of laboratory equipment and all covering conditions for each water flow rate evaporation from the basin under different surface conditions of uncovered covered with the white balls covered with the black balls and covered with the mixture of black white balls is measured for a period of more than six hours the first four hours are considered to meet an approximate equilibrium in environmental conditions air temperature and relative humidity at 30 cm above the surface and the last two hours are for data recording this allows investigating the dynamics of temperature variation within the basin for a stable environmental condition note that mass loss rates were obtained based on the measurements at the end of data recording period where a rather steady state thermal condition established in the basin each test has been replicated three times and the average of measured parameters is considered for the analysis the square root of the variance of difference between each of the three measurements and the average value represents the uncertainty value although designation of experimental setup looks similar to those in ruskowitz et al 2014 and silva et al 2017 for studying the effect of floating covers on evaporation reduction of solar ponds fundamental differences exist transparent covers in the above mentioned studies do not hinder radiative energy input into the pond while opaque covers here aim to decrease energy content of water body and thus provide less energy available for evaporative losses moreover the salt gradient solar ponds function by maintaining a very strong stratification with depth while our approach using surface flows is designed to reduce the stratification 3 the energy balance model the energy balance of the reservoir is considered based on a simple representation of surface and lateral heat fluxes to provide a theoretical basis for interpretation of experimental findings the model investigates contribution of water surface flows and latent sensible and radiative fluxes in changing water body energy storage based on eq 1 cooley 1970 ali et al 2008 fekih et al 2013 1 δ s r n h l e a s q v q wall where δs w is the change in water energy storage rn w m2 is the net radiation flux le w m2

this formulation is a rigid underlying surface while over water surfaces formation of wind or water flow driven waves and subsequent hydrodynamic interaction of floating covers with water results in a very complex surface condition that is beyond the scope of the present study the change in water body energy storage δs can be obtained from eq 6 gallego elvira et al 2012 6 δ s ρ w c w a s j 1 n d j

24 and zb 36 cm from the water surface and δtwj k is the change in water temperature of each layer during a given time step δt considering the volume and heat capacity of stored water relative to floating covers we further assumed that energy storage into the cover elements is negligible in the presence of water inflows and outflows the net advected heat into the water body is described based

outflows respectively and ti and te are the mean temperatures of inflows and outflows respectively the parameter t is the mean temperature of the water body note that in the present experiments water is circulated by the pump in a closed system hence the temperature difference between inlet and outlet water flows rapidly adjusts to a value close to zero at the beginning of each experiment so that qv approaches zero finally the heat exchanges with the surroundings through the reservoir s walls qwall are obtained from eq 8 8 q wall k b a b δ t wall δ x where kb is the thermal conductivity of the

storage reservoirs walls and bottom of the reservoirs are often covered with waterproofing membranes that have very low thermal conductivity thereby the main energy exchanges of the water body with surroundings occur at the surface after implementing the energy balance equation and calculating for the evaporation rate e the efficiency of evaporation suppression for covered reservoir can be obtained based on eq 9 assouline et al 2010 9 1 e e 0 where e 0 is the evaporation rate of the uncovered reservoir in no flow condition in the following experimental results and comparisons with the model estimations of evaporative loss are presented 4 results in this section the results of the evaporation experiments obtained under well controlled laboratory conditions are presented and interpreted based on the energy balance attributes fig 4 shows the radiative flux on the surface of the basin under equilibrium environmental conditions i e after 4 hrs since the onset of each test as pointed out in section 2 the intensity of shortwave radiation flux intercepted at the surface was 600 700 w m2 with an average value around 650 w m2 as an example fig 5 shows the environmental equilibrium conditions air temperature and relative humidity at elevation z 0 3 m for two different cases s w l 1 0 and s n 12 0 the figure demonstrates that the air temperature and relative humidity were almost constant during the last two hours 4 1 uncertainty of measurements the uncertainty analysis of measurements was conducted based on three replications of each test the uncertainty values for light heavy white black and mixed cover balls and uncovered condition under eight surface flow rates are depicted in figs 6 and 7 details are provided in appendix b as seen the maximum uncertainty is about 0 025 mm hr for the case of light black covers in surface flow rate of qw 12 lit min and the average of uncertainty is between 0 004 and 0 014 mm hr generally these uncertainties could be attributed to the difficulty of providing equilibrium environmental conditions and the accuracy of the measurement devices 4 2 evaporative water loss and suppression efficiency the effect of different cover conditions i e no cover covered with white balls covered with black balls and covered with the mixture of black white balls on the evaporation rate and evaporation suppression efficiency in the presence of water surface flow are depicted in fig 6 the results belong to the light balls as expected the use of floating covers has a significant effect on reduction of surface evaporation for instance the use of white covers results in suppression efficiency of 60 8 in the presence of 1 0 lit min water surface flow fig 7 displays evaporation rate and suppression efficiency results when heavy balls with different colors covered the basin the results state that when the covers become heavy and more than half of the ball s volume is immersed in water see fig 2 evaporation increases another important finding from these two figures is that by increasing the water surface flow rate the evaporation rate is first reduced i e the evaporation reduction efficiency is increased to a certain flow rate called the optimal flow rate and then it increases gradually this feature is more visible for the uncovered conditions as the rate of evaporation decreases from 0 915 mm hr for the zero flow rate to a value around 0 685 mm hr for 6 5 lit min surface water flow rate as a matter of fact this 25 1 evaporation suppression efficiency suggests that the presence of water surface flows in shallow reservoirs can be considered as a simple and cost effective way to reduce evaporation along with application of floating covers the trend of evaporation rate marked for the average of three measurement replications with associated error bars in figs 6 and 7 show the robustness and validity of this claim especially for the uncovered scenario however the presence of floating balls decreases the optimal flow rate the interpretation of these phenomena needs analyzing the temperature changes in different layers of the basin which will be discussed in the next subsection the details of the above mentioned laboratory data and also the results of energy balance modeling section 3 for the floating light balls are presented in table 2 as seen in this table the simple representation of energy balance model can estimate the evaporation rate with an acceptable accuracy for all conditions with and without covering with and without water surface flow to show this clearly the comparison of experimental and energy balance model results for the case of uncovered and covered with light and heavy white balls under various water surface flow rates is presented in scatter plot of fig 8 fig 9 compares the combined effects of cover type light and heavy balls cover color and surface flow rate on the evaporation suppression efficiency considering the small difference between cover fractions of light and heavy balls 0 77 and 0 83 the experimental results suggest that cover color and flow rate are dominant factors in suppression efficiency 4 3 vertical water temperature profile fig 10 shows the temperature variations in four different layers during the test for the uncovered condition in three different flow rates zero optimal and maximum in this figure tw is the water surface temperature and tm 1 tm 2 and tb are the water temperatures at depths zm 1 12 zm 2 24 and zb 36 cm respectively as seen by increasing the flow rate and consequently increasing the mixing between water layers the temperature of the surface layer decreases while the temperature of the underlying layers increases in other words the difference of the temperature between the layers decreases this condition decreasing the temperature of the surface layer reduces the water surface evaporation as shown in fig 6 however by increasing the flow rate and passing it from the optimal flow rate for example qw 6 5 lit min for the uncovered condition the water surface evaporation increases gradually variations of the temperature in four different water layers for the conditions of covering with light and heavy white balls are depicted in fig 11 same as the uncovered condition it is seen that by increasing the flow rate and accordingly increasing the mixing of water layers the temperature of the surface layer decreases while the temperature of the underlying layers increases as seen the water surface temperature tw of the basin covered with heavy white balls is always higher than that covered with light white balls 5 discussion 5 1 the effects of cover properties on evaporation rate comparing the results in figs 6 and 7 demonstrates that evaporation suppression efficiency depends on surface coverage fraction governed by cover density a light ball covers the water surface by a 70 mm diameter circle providing 0 83 surface coverage in dense packing of balls while a heavy ball can cover the water surface by a circle with diameter around 67 1 mm 0 77 surface coverage this reduction of surface coverage increases evaporative area on the surface of basin and thus decreases evaporation suppression efficiency as depicted in fig 9 although lehmann et al lehmann et al 2019 did not find significant differences between black and white polyethylene balls in suppression of evaporative loss the higher albedo of white balls in our experiments clearly offered higher suppression efficiency compared with black and mixed covers fig 9 5 2 theoretical energy balance modeling the simple energy balance model provided reliable estimates for evaluating combined effects of cover properties and flow condition on evaporative mass loss from the basin in accordance with experimental measurements details of modeling results table 2 and fig 8 suggest that cover color and water mixing are primary factors affecting evaporation rates based on eq 1 changes in surface temperature due to the influence of cover thermal and radiative properties or water flows affect radiative and sensible heat fluxes and thus alter energy content available for evaporative latent heat on the surface of the partially covered basin note that nuanced aspects of the flow condition associated with the stability of the overlying air were not explicitly addressed in this analysis considering the small surface area of our laboratory basin 1 13 m2 we opted for a simple but still physically based representation of surface boundary layer for the sake of modeling sensible heat exchanges between the surface and air mass however the surface boundary layer approach invoked here could be linked with different monin obukhov atmospheric stability conditions as proposed by haghighi and or 2015b to account for complexities of surface air interactions in field applications 5 3 changes in vertical temperature profile and evaporative loss with surface flow the radiation absorption in water layers changes with depth so that the highest radiative energy is absorbed at the surface without lateral flows in a water column the increase in water temperature at the surface due to the radiation absorption forms a warm and low density layer with a specified thickness over the colder water layers beneath such thermal stratification in water reservoirs hinders vertical oxygen transfer in water layers the increase in incoming radiative flux increases near surface water temperature that in turn increases evaporative losses from the reservoir and probably influences water quality in lower layers with affecting dissolved oxygen concentration cox 1999 as observed in fig 10 the flow induced mixing within the basin decreases the temperature of the surface layer and thus effectively suppresses evaporative loss by decreasing saturated vapor concentration at the water surface nevertheless the increase in flow rate above the optimal flow rate eventually enhances evaporation rate figs 6 and 7 to explain this finding it is worthy to link it with air mass aerodynamic condition above the surface in the presence of a water surface flow the air mass over the surface of the reservoir is forced to move due to the no slip boundary condition yielding an aerodynamic boundary layer with thickness of δv considering that the value of δv is proportional to the inverse of the air velocity near the surface haghighi and or 2013 increasing the water surface flow rate decreases δv formed over the surface consequently the thickness of the mass transfer boundary layer i e δm sc 1 3 δv where sc is the schmidt number decreases which eventually increases the vapor concentration gradient between the surface and the air flow on the other hand in accordance with the results of haghighi and or 2013 and aminzadeh and or 2014 the convective sensible heat transfer between the surface and the air is proportional to the thickness of the aerodynamic boundary layer thus by increasing the surface flow the heat transfer between the water body and the air increases where the water surface temperature is often lower than the air temperature mostly in summer and thus required energy for evaporative loss is provided therefore by passing the optimal flow rate the role of increase in evaporation rate due to the reduction of aerodynamic boundary layer thickness overcomes the mixing of the water layers in reducing the evaporation rate and thus evaporation suppression efficiency decreases note that the above mentioned analysis strongly depends on the relative velocity between the overlying air flow and water surface flow and their mutual interaction finally governs the heat and mass exchanges between the surface and air the reduction of optimal flow rate in the presence of floating balls relative to the uncovered scenario might be linked to the role of covers in enhancing surface mixing and thus surface air exchanges with increasing surface flow rate and consequent cover water interactions 6 summary and conclusion in this study the influence of floating balls density in the presence of water surface flows on evaporation reduction of open reservoirs was experimentally examined a small water basin with 1 13 m2 surface area and 0 5 m depth was covered with black and white balls diameter of 70 mm with two different masses of 90 and 127 g corresponding to densities of 500 kg m3 and 707 kg m3 respectively seven different flow rates including 1 0 3 0 4 5 6 5 8 0 10 0 and 12 lit min were created by a pump the main findings of the study can be summarized as follows covering the reservoir with white balls showed the best efficiency in evaporation reduction increasing the density of the ball so that more than half of the ball s volume immersed into the water decreased coverage fraction and increased evaporative losses with increasing the water surface flow rate the evaporation rate was first reduced until a certain flow rate the optimal flow rate and then increased gradually after the optimal flow rate the role of increasing the evaporation rate due to the reduction of aerodynamic boundary layer thickness overcame the role of the water layers mixing in reducing the evaporation rate thereby reduction in evaporation efficiency was observed the simple energy balance model offered certain capability in estimation of evaporative losses for all conditions with and without covering surface flow although the present study made use of polyethylene balls for measurement purposes to quantify the effects of cover density and surface flows on suppression efficiency of spherical covers we acknowledge certain environmental issues associated with plastic fabricated floating covers these covers are often susceptible to degradation under severe environmental condition such as intense solar radiation that might potentially affect water quality accordingly development of environmentally friendly cover materials such as ultra lightweight alkali activated slag concrete not only offers potential applicability in water treatment processes luukkonen et al 2019 but also enables utilizing wastes and by products of industrial activities e g iron manufacturing to alleviate the evaporative water loss problem in open water reservoirs water recirculation in many small reservoirs with inlet and outlet flows would potentially affect suppression efficiency of floating covers highlighting the importance of our results in design purposes notwithstanding interesting laboratory findings here certain aspects including the effects of reservoir depth variation of atmospheric forcing and width and depth of influence of surface flows need systematic reservoir scale investigations to delineate a comprehensive
