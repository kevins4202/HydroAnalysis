16700,this study investigated the effects of thirteen photo electro chemical oxidation processes on the formation potential fp of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during the chloramination of ranitidine in reverse osmosis ro permeate and brine the ndma fp varied significantly depending on the pretreatment process initial ph and water matrix types at higher initial ph values 7 0 most pretreatments did not reduce the ndma fp presumably because few radical species and more chloramine reactive byproducts were generated at ph 7 0 however electrochemical oxidation assisted by chloride and fe2 h2o2 catalytic wet peroxide oxidation and peroxydisulfate induced pretreatments removed up to 85 of ndma fp in the ro brine ultraviolet uv irradiation or prechlorination alone did not reduce the ndma fp effectively but combined uv chlorine treatment effectively reduced the ndma fp in contrast after uv irradiation 2 1 mw cm 2 for 0 5 h in the presence of h2o2 and chloramine ndma formation increased substantially up to 26 during the post chloramination of the ro permeate mass spectrometric analysis and structural elucidation of the oxidation byproducts indicated that compared with the reactive nitrogen species generated by uv nh2cl sulfate radicals and photo electro chemically generated reactive chlorine species were more promising for minimizing ndma fp unlike the hemolytic oh driven by uv h2o2 the oh from fe iv assisted pretreatments showed a significant synergistic effect on ndma fp reduction overall the results suggest the need for a careful assessment of the type of radical species to be used for treating an ro water system containing amine functionalized compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential reactive radical species photo electro chemical oxidation ranitidine chloramination reverse osmosis 1 introduction ranitidine rnt is an h2 receptor antagonist widely used in the treatment of peptic ulcers owing to the wide and continuous utilization the rnt content in aquatic ecosystems has reached relatively high levels 1 µg l 1 and it is frequently detected in water bodies cardoso et al 2014 romeyn et al 2016 rnt may undergo transformation into highly toxic carcinogenic products and hence it was classified as a drug of concern u s food and drug administration 2021 as one of the transformation products of rnt n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a potent carcinogen and frequently encountered nitrosamine from water chloramination which deserves special attention in potable reuse applications le roux et al 2012 seid et al 2021 variable types of advanced oxidation processes aops employing free chlorine fc peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are widely used for degradation of micropollutants e g rnt with activation by ultraviolet uv chemicals such as fe2 in fenton process and potential bias jasper et al 2016 naim and ghauch 2016 munoz et al 2017 elias et al 2019 however the performance of aops should be highly dependent on the operational parameters including oxidant dose and the type of activator therefore the concept of reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse a molecular ratio of the degraded pollutants to the consumed oxidants ghauch et al 2015 2017 amasha et al 2018 has been recently proposed for evaluation and or optimization of aops in typical water treatments for reuse membrane processes e g reverse osmosis ro are widely integrated with aops such as those based on uv h2o2 and use chloramine for biofouling control and secondary disinfection sgroi et al 2015 for water reuse however the use of chloramine can cause a significant increase in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps the residual of the chloramine used for cleaning purposes in the ro permeate leads to the formation of ndma via the transfer of chloramine species mccurry et al 2017 sanchís et al 2021 demonstrated that the chloramination of water led to increased levels of ndma as compared with the ndma content in nondisinfected reclaimed water on the other hand the use of preformed monochloramine nh2cl is advantageous over in situ chloramination in terms of minimizing the formation of ndma mccurry et al 2017 further improper pretreatment of ro brine can substantially increase the formation of dbps such as trihalomethanes bagastyo et al 2013 therefore the effect of the pretreatment process combined with chloramination on the formation of ndma in an ro system should be carefully examined early studies demonstrated that the pretreatment of precursors can reduce the ndma formation potential ndma fp the pretreatment efficiencies were primarily dependent on ph contact time water matrix and the type of reactive species for instance ozonation reduced ndma formation more effectively than the use of fc and chlorine dioxide as pretreatment however the ndma fp increased during post chloramination after uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 and chloramine farré et al 2012 selbes et al 2014 wang et al 2015 recent studies reported that ndma can be reformed in the ro permeate by employing ozone and uv based aops mccurry et al 2017 sgroi et al 2015 szczuka et al 2020 however ndma formation driven by other aops such as catalytic wet oxidation cwpo and sulfate radicals based oxidation has not been extensively explored yet this study aimed to investigate the impact of different oxidation processes on in situ ndma formation in ro permeate and brine first to gain further insights into the detailed formation mechanism the ndma fp for rnt chloramination by different oxidation processes was investigated further the effect of the initial ph during pretreatment on the ndma fp was evaluated and the reaction intermediates were identified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uhplc q tof ms finally as pretreatments to reduce the ndma fp in ro permeate and brine the following processes were examined photolysis in the presence of pds h2o2 fe2 h2o2 fc and nh2cl as well as electrochemically assisted processes including electrochemical chlorination e cl electrochemically activated pds e pds and general and electro

the ro permeate and brine were obtained from a pilot plant near pohang republic of korea with total organic carbon toc concentrations of 0 5 and 33 2 mg l 1 respectively the typical range for ph in ro permeate and brine was 5 6 to 6 8 unless stated otherwise experiments were conducted using deionized di water from the milli q purification system millipore bedford ma usa with a conductivity of less than 14 4 μs cm 1 all experiments were performed in triplicate data points in the tables and figures are expressed as the mean standard deviation n 3 and the error bars representing the standard deviation unless the error bars fall within symbols 2 2 estimation of ndma formation ndma formation experiments were conducted in 0 1 l amber bottles by using 20 μm of rnt in di ro permeate and brine

realistic conditions in the typical water treatment process krasner et al 2018 park et al 2016 the fp protocol was slightly modified by shortening the chloramination time followed by allowing the ultimate ndma formation and then it was utilized for post chloramination 2 3 ranitidine oxidation by various pretreatment processes pretreatment oxidation experiments were conducted using different oxidants and 20 µm of rnt for reaction periods of 5 120 min reaction periods table 1 summarizes the reaction conditions i e dose temperature and initial ph and further details are described in the si text s2 note that the desired electrodes and reagent oxidant doses were selected based on the preliminary assessments conducted in our previous studies chung et al 2017 lee et al 2020a son et al 2021 in all pretreatment experiments the effect of ph was investigated by adjusting the solution ph 3 0 9 5 with either 2 mm phosphate or borate buffer further the pretreatment experiments were conducted in the ro permeate and brine by spiking with 20 µm of rnt the samples were periodically withdrawn quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate or methanol and then filtered 0 45 µm pvdf before conducting further analysis and post chloramination experiments according to the fp protocols table s1 a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 1260 infinity quaternary hplc vl agilent usa was used to quantify the residual concentration of rnt text s3 spectrophotometric methods using 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate as an indicator and injection spectroscopy analytical techniques modified hplc setup with capillary columns eluting acidified potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate solution were used to measure pds zou et al 2019 and h2o2 concentration tantawi et al 2019

usa system and uplc q tof mass spectrometry apparatus lc waters acquitytm uplc and ms synapttm g2 q tof waters corp u s a were used for determining the ndma concentration and the reaction intermediates by following the procedures described by kim et al 2013 and seid et al 2021 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 ranitidine degradation and ndma formation by various oxidation methods 3 1 1 ranitidine degradation fig 1 shows the removal efficiency of rnt by different oxidation processes degradation of rnt in control experiments pds h2o2 and fe2 electrolysis by heterogeneous oxidation only and adsorption was less than 25 during a reaction time of 0 5 h fig 1a c upon the addition of 50 µm nh2cl or fc 20 2 56 0 of rnt was removed after 0 5 h in contrast more than 92 of rnt was completely degraded within 0 5 h by fe2 pds fenton and cwpo fig 1d during e cl e pds and e fenton process most of the rnt was removed effectively within only 7 15 min fig 1e as shown in fig 1f rnt was completely degraded within 10 30 min of uv irradiation depending on the additives pds nh2cl fc fe2 h2o2 and h2o2 an increase in the additives dosage to 1 mm significantly increased the rnt degradation by nh2cl or fc whereas the degradation efficiency of the other methods remained constant fig s1 the resulting kinetics well followed the pseudo first order models r2 0 90 and the rate constants kobs ranged from 6 8 10 3 to 0 56 min 1 figs s1 and s2 agreed well with studies radjenović et al 2010 dong et al 2017 elias et al 2019 jasper et al 2016 munoz et al 2017 olvera vargas et al 2014 wu et al 2021 on the other hand there was insignificant change in the rnt oxidation in the ro permeate matrix data not shown whereas rnt degradation and toc reduction were significantly retarded in the ro brine fig s2 possibly a substantial fraction of the reactive oxidant species was quenched by the dissolved organic compounds radjenović et al 2011 xiang et al 2019 to lower the removal efficacy of the rnt during the photo electro and chemically driven oxidation processes various reactive radicals nh2 o2 oh cl and so4 can be formed see tables s2 7 radical scavenging experiments were conducted to identify the key reactive species fig s3 the addition of alcohols showed significant decreases in the rnt removal in cwpo uv h2o2 and fenton based processes demonstrating that the oh played an important role in the absence of chlorine sulfate radical sources the methanol inhibited the rnt removal in the pds activation processes more markedly than t butanol implying that so4 is the dominant active species nitrobenzene k 3 9 109 m 1s 1 and t butanol k 6 0 108 m 1s 1 are known to react rapidly with the oh neta et al 1988 however nitrobenzene has negligible cl reactivity as compared to t butanol k 3 0 108 m 1s 1 remucal and manley 2016 in this study t butanol showed moderately greater scavenging effects on rnt degradation than nitrobenzene in the e cl uv nh2cl and uv cl2 process fig s3 revealing that cl or other reactive chlorine species rcs and oh played a synergistic role in addition the activity of the reactive nitrogen species rns e g nh2 no in uv nh2cl was monitored in the absence of oxygen as previously described wu et al 2021 the reaction of nh2 and o2 produces peroxyl radicals and no which can effectively attack the nucleophilic terminal amine moiety under n2 purging there was a decrease in the rnt degradation rate was observed implying that the role of rns should not be ignored zhang et al 2019 benzoquinone insignificantly interfered with the rnt degradation to rule out the contributions of o2 among the various oxidation methods for rnt removal in this study the pds based oxidations were demonstrated to be the most promising even at a low dosage greater levels of rse were achieved with the pds additions compared with the h2o2 assisted oxidations which is in line with the previous study el asmar et al 2021 for example the calculated rse were 24 9 and 9 6 respectively for uv pds and uv h2o2 at the same oxidant concentration of 1 mm and reaction time of 0 5 h data not shown on the other hand the calculated rse for e pds 15 4 108 7 uv pds 4 8 66 6 and fe2 pds 2 4 46 0 processes decreased as the pds 0 increased from 0 05 to 4 0 mm fig s4 these results were presumably due to a self quenching of radicals by residual pds ghauch et al 2017 el asmar et al 2021 consequently electrochemical or uv driven activation of relatively low concentration of oxidant would enhance the rnt degradation rate 3 1 2 ndma formation in ro permeate and brine by chloramination and pretreatments the ndma fp in the ro permeate and brine was investigated considering that the chloramine based in place cleaning of membranes can potentially generate ndma from the concentrated precursors mccurry et al 2017 under the fp protocol a plateau of molar ndma yield appeared within 6 h 67 76 fig s5 while the yields from the sc and ufc were only 0 4 2 7 and 29 0 43 6 after 72 h of incubation respectively fig 2 a even under different experimental protocols the results were concordant with the results of previous studies hinneh et al 2019 selbes et al 2014 shen and andrews 2010 notably the ndma concentrations from the raw ro brine without spiking with rnt exceeded the value recommend by who 2008 i e 100 ng l 1 fig 2b while its concentrations in the ro permeate ranged between 10 3 and 33 6 ng l 1 fig 2c although most of the rnt degradation was achieved within 0 5 h fig 1 the samples were further incubated for 3 h without ph adjustment to estimate the ultimate ndma formation during the pretreatment electrochemical chlorination produced less ndma yield 5 than chloramination in all samples and less than 3 ndma fp was obtained by the e fenton uv cl2 and uv nh2cl processes fig 3 shin et al 2017 reported the formation of ndma from dma by the e fenton process using a sacrificial stainless steel anode ndma formation was also observed by wu et al 2021 during rnt degradation in uv nh2cl process under identical conditions ndma was not detectable in the other oxidation processes these observations led us to conclude that ndma formation from rnt and its degradation intermediates can be neglected for all examined pretreatment processes except photo electro chemical chlor am ination 3 2 ndma fp varying with different pretreatment methods and chemical dosages 3 2 1 pretreatment with rcs assisted oxidation fig 4 shows the ultimate ndma yields during the post chloramination for rcs assisted pretreatment with variable oxidant doses of fc or nh2cl in chemical chlorination the highest ndma fp reduction was achieved by using 1 mm naocl fig 4a in the electrochemical e cl setup the reduction in ndma fp was negligible without cl in electrolyte fig s6 while the final ndma molar yield significantly decreased from 76 0 to 0 6 as cl 0 increased up to 70 mm fig 4b with 30 mm of cl 0 the ndma fp decreased steeply during the first 0 5 h of e cl treatment fig s7 uv photolysis alone reduced the ndma fp of rnt by up to 38 depending on the ph and light intensity fig s8 on the other hand uv irradiation in the presence of 50 µm nh2cl mitigated ndma formation by only 15 fig 4a notably the ndma fp increased significantly with higher nh2cl doses 1 and 4 mm while the rcs are responsible for the deactivation of core moieties for ndma formation jeon et al 2016 the rns caused the nitrosation amination of rnt during pretreatment thereby accelerating the nitrosamine production in the post chloramination seid et al 2021 wu et al 2021 therefore the use of uv cl2 resulted in a more effective reduction of ndma fp by up to 68 fig 4a at a given fc dosage 1 mm uv irradiation facilitated ndma fp reduction owing to the more facile reaction of cl radicals with rnt the most efficient ndma fp mitigation was achieved by e cl in a control e cl experiment conducted with 30 mm nacl solution without rnt 1 3 mm fc was produced after 15 min more than 95 reduction in the ndma fp of rnt was achieved in the same duration fig s7 and this reduction greatly exceeded the reductions achieved using 1 4 mm fc and uv cl2 fig 4a this observation can be ascribed to the continuous generation of rcs in contrast to the batch fc injection in uv cl2 furst et al 2018 and to the synergetic effects of oh in e cl as shown in fig s3 3 2 2 pretreatment with so4 assisted oxidation fig 5 shows a comparison of the reduction in ndma fps of rnt in di water measured after the pds activation pretreatments the ndma fp reduction achieved using the pds alone was insignificant fig s6 within the given reaction time 0 5 h almost complete annihilation of the ndma fp was achieved by e pds at pds dosages greater than 1 mm fig 5 less efficient reduction of ndma fp was observed in the cases of fe2 pds and uv pds pretreatments with the minimal ndma fps of 30 and 15 respectively at a pds dosage of 4 mm the activation of 1 mm pds reduced the ndma fp almost to zero within 0 5 h fig s7 the variable degree of ndma fp reduction should be considered in terms of the yield and type of so4 previous studies demonstrated that uv irradiation more effectively activates pds than fe 2 ghanbari and moradi 2017 in the e pds the sulfate radical generated on the ti mesh cathode and the oh generated on the self doped tio2 nanotube anode son et al 2021 result in more facile reduction of ndma fp than that possible by uv pds with a pds dosage of 1 4 mm 3 2 3 pretreatment with oh assisted oxidation as shown in fig 6 different oh assisted pretreatments were employed and their effects on the ndma fp was evaluated upon pretreatment for 0 5 h the ndma fp became less than 15 at 1 mm h2o2 dosage except in the case of uv h2o2 and further oxidant input to 4 mm resulted in insignificant enhancement fig 6 with a fixed h2o2 dose of 1 mm the ndma fp was reduced only by cwpo and e fenton within the first 15 min and a subsequent sharp decrease was noted in the case of fenton and uv fenton fig s7 further among all the pretreatment methods e fenton always provided the best pretreatment performance followed by cwpo note that the addition of magnetite alone reduced ndma fp by 55 fig s6 unlike fenton and uv fenton e fenton and cwpo led to a drastic reduction in ndma fp within 0 5 h interestingly with uv h2o2 the ndma fp increased under a varying h2o2 dose and with increase in irradiation time these results are in contrast with the results of other peroxide based methods i e fenton further the results of uv h2o2 indicate that rnt degradation only by the oh radical can lead to an insignificant reduction in ndma fp this phenomenon can be explained by interactions between oh radical and the ferryl ion fe iv and the formation of oxidation intermediates containing the dimethylamino moiety with facile reactivity with chloramine for instance the iron catalyzed oxidation process is more effective for both hydroxylation and n dealkylation zbaida et al 1986 than purely photo driven oxidation pathways dong et al 2017 n dealkylated intermediates had lower ndma fp than the parent precursors wang et al 2015 to better understand the role of fe iv methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was chosen as a probe wang et al 2018 where the oxidation of pmso to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 served as an indicator of the formation of fe iv as shown in fig s9 no pmso2 was found in uv h2o2 whereas pmso2 was produced 47 molar yield in fenton oxidation with the addition of t butanol and rnt pmso oxidation decreased significantly while the pmso2 yield declined slightly in the presence of only rnt these results indicate that fe iv may interfere with the degradation of rnt moieties by oh and reduce ndma fp these possibilities must be further examined 3 3 effect of ph on ndma fp during various pretreatments the reduction in ndma fp by the pretreatment is known to be associated with the removal and or deactivation of core moieties such as dma and the furan ring of rnt importantly the ph would primarily affect the reactivity of moiety specific reaction kinetics which in turn influences the generation of radicals and ultimately affects the ndma fp during subsequent chloramination jeon et al 2016 3 3 1 rcs assisted pretreatment with varying phs in the examinations described hereinafter the pretreatment duration was fixed at 0 5 h the efficiency of prechlorination naocl only was monotonically retarded as ph increased from 3 to 9 5 fig 7 although the reactivity with fc was greater than that achieved with amine and furan moieties by orders of magnitude the chlorination of acetamidine and thioether moieties insignificantly reduced the ndma fp of rnt jeon et al 2016 in contrast the degradation of the furan moiety affected the stability of the carbocation to favor n dealkylation while the prechlorination of the amine moiety yielded chlorammonium intermediates deborde and von gunten 2008 this hampers the interaction of the amine moiety with monochloramine and affects ndma generation the ph dependent speciation of fc i e hocl vs ocl influences its reactivity with variable functional groups in rnt in turn determining the ndma fp reduction efficiency selbes et al 2014 in comparison the effects of ph were trivial in e cl and uv cl2 at ph 3 7 however at ph 9 5 the dissociation of ocl generated cl with lower yields the cl was further quenched by oh to generate a less reactive species fang et al 2014 in e cl the current efficiency of rcs generation can be reduced by an increase in the ph caused by an invigorated oxygen evolution reaction in uv nh2cl ndma fp reduction showed little ph dependence except at ph 3 possibly because of the stability of chloramine and uv reactivity of deprotonated rnt 3 3 2 so4 assisted pretreatment with varying phs for e pds a quasicomplete elimination of ndma 99 was observed at ph 3 0 and 5 6 in contrast only 46 ndma fp removal was realized at ph 9 5 the uv pds method resulted in moderately greater ndma fp removal at ph 5 6 and 9 5 than that achieved with fe2 pds pretreatment one of the reasons for the enhanced reduction of ndma fps at low ph 5 6 is the speciation of fe ions for example under alkaline conditions insoluble iron oxyhydroxide complexes are formed and they are likely to inhibit the release of fe2 in the fe2 pds system xia et al 2020 resulting in the limited formation of so4 besides competitive reactions e g oh generation reduce the steady state concentration of so4 in the pds based oxidation process lee et al 2020b with an increasing ph thereby hampering the reduction in ndma fp at ph 7 3 3 3 oh assisted pretreatment with varying phs as expected the highest ndma fp removal was obtained at ph 3 0 90 during fenton oxidation the removal decreased to 26 32 at higher phs fig 7 likewise the decrease in ndma fp by cwpo pretreatment monotonically decreased with higher phs the ndma fp reduction by uv h2o2 driven by the oh radical was possible only at ph 3 0 38 in fact at ph 5 6 the ndma fp increased uv irradiation itself significantly reduced the formation of ndma at ph 3 0 this reduction can be attributed to acid catalysis hydrolysis fig s8 after uv pretreatment at ph 5 6 and 9 5 greater amounts of ndma were generated because of the lower photosensitivity of the deprotonated rnt as compared to that of their analogous neutral species dong et al 2017 the addition of chemicals i e h2o2 during photolysis even inhibited rnt degradation because of competitive absorption at lower phs but such inhibition did not occur at alkaline phs 3 4 degradation byproducts of rnt obtained by the selected pretreatments depending on the primary oxidants wide varieties of intermediates products table s8 were identified in the gc uplc q tof ms analysis multiple reaction pathways scheme 1 were considered hydroxylation oxygen addition 1 chlorine addition 2 amination 3 c s and c n bond cleavage 4 hydroxylation denitration 5 n dealkylation 6 and n methylation 7 among them only n dealkylation and n methylation could reduce the ndma fp in the post chloramination the possible oxidative pathways scheme 1 are discussed below in the case of rcs based processes the transformation of rnt begins with an attack at multiple moieties leading to chlorinated m z 349 hydroxylated m z 331 and chlorinated oxygenated products m z 365 and 399 further oxidative bond cleavage e g c s and c n produced 5 dimethyl aminoethyl furfuryl alcohol m z 155 n dealkylated products m z 270 and 336 and chlorinated demethylated m z 335 intermediate scheme s1 as reported previously jasper et al 2016 le roux et al 2012 the chlorinated aminated m z 364 scheme s2 product was detected after uv nh2cl presumably via rns i e nh2 attack on dma n this product is a known intermediate for ndma seid et al 2021 in pds activation processes successive electron transfer between so4 and rnt moieties led to the unstable and reactive rnt radical naim and ghauch 2016 subsequent hydroxylation of the thioether and n dealkylation of the dma n moiety generated the intermediates with m z 331 and m z 270 respectively subsequently the oxidation of the acetamidine moiety by the uv pds generated hydroxylation denitration products m z 291 and m z 318 as demonstrated by elias et al 2019 in the e pds furan based fragments m z 110 and m z 129 were obtained by the consecutive c s cleavage and demethylation on the dma n group scheme s3 n demethylated n dealkylated and furan derivative products can induce unstable dma n leading to the mitigation of ndma formation ultimately selbes et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in oh radical driven oxidation oxygenated hydroxylated m z 331 and 361 c s cleavage m z 155 and 175 hydroxylation denitration m z 318 products were formed confirming that oxygen addition hydroxylation and bond cleavage were responsible for the main oxidation pathways schemes s4 s7 these products were probably generated via the electrophilic attack of the iron species followed by the intramolecular rearrangement and or photosensitized oxidation dong et al 2017 latch et al 2003 zbaida et al 1986 the oxidation of rnt with cwpo and fenton led to the formation of an n dealkylated and sulfonated furan based intermediate e g m z 204 suggesting the role of fe iv in the iron catalyzed oxidation process in contrast during the uv h2o2 oxidation the transformation of rnt mostly occurred via the oxidation of thioether and acetamidine leaving the dma n intact scheme s7 these products are believed to form more reactive daughter products and cause an increase in ndma fp after the uv h2o2 pretreatment radjenović et al 2012 wang et al 2015 3 5 evaluation of ndma fp in the pretreated ro permeate and brine under experimental conditions of ph 5 6 6 8 ro permeate and brine were pretreated to evaluate the ndma formation upon exposure to nh2cl 3 0 mg of cl2 only uv based pretreatments were employed for the ro permeate fig 2 depicts ndma formation without pretreatment the pretreatment and subsequent chloramination using the raw fig 8 a and rnt spiked ro permeate fig s10 showed that the ndma fp decreased with uv uv cl2 uv pds and uv fenton treatments in contrast uv irradiation with nh2cl and h2o2 increased the ndma formation and the added chemicals intervened with the direct uv photolysis mccurry et al 2017 szczuka et al 2020 the uv pds and uv fenton processes were more cost effective text s3 than uv cl2 and uv h2o2 with respect to the electrical energy per order eeo reduction of ndma fp fig s11 for the pretreatment of ro brine fig 8b e cl e pds cwpo and e fenton were the most effective pretreatment process in terms of reducing both toc 21 7 33 4 and ndma fp 55 85 these processes were reported to be effective for removing dissolved surrogates present in ro brine radjenović et al 2011 xiang et al 2019 from the viewpoint of economy text s3 however the eeo required to achieve the same reduction efficacy using e fenton and e pds was estimated to be much lower by factors of 2 8 11 than the eeo required for the e cl and cwpo process fig s11 indicating that e fenton and e pds are economically feasible for the simultaneous removal of toc and ndma fp overall this study demonstrated the role of various oxidant species in water reuse ro permeate and treatment ro brine these species can elevate the risk of ndma formation during chloramination the results revealed that the fate and risk of ndma formation can be reduced by selecting the proper oxidants and the optimum operating parameters such as ph however for specific pretreatments such as uv irradiation in the presence of nh2cl and h2o2 the ndma fp of precursors was maintained or increased to form nitrosamine upon exposure to chloramine in the water treatment distribution system 4 conclusion we investigated the effects of thirteen photo electro chemical pretreatment processes on ndma formation during the chloramination of rnt in di water ro permeate and brine the main findings from this study are summarized as follows l when rnt was present in di water ro permeate and brine higher levels of ndma were formed during chloramination as compared to the situations in which the samples were treated by pretreatment processes such as uv irradiation and chlorination l the observed levels of ndma formed varied significantly with the type of pretreatments l the ph during pretreatment played a crucial role in mitigating the ndma fp for the ph range of 3 0 5 6 the cwpo e cl e fenton and e pds remarkably reduced the ndma fp during the post chloramination l uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 and nh2cl showed insignificant reductions in the ndma fp in both di water and ro permeate l most pretreatments resulted in less than 48 reduction of the ndma fp in ro brine compared with the ndma fp in di water pretreatments using cwpo e fenton and e pds exhibited up to an 85 reduction in ndma fp l compared to rns reactive radicals such as rcs and so4 facilitated the destruction of core moieties via n dealkylation and or n methylation this alleviated ndma formation during the subsequent chloramination l oh as a sole reactive radical is inadequate for reducing ndma fp while iron fe iv

16700,this study investigated the effects of thirteen photo electro chemical oxidation processes on the formation potential fp of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during the chloramination of ranitidine in reverse osmosis ro permeate and brine the ndma fp varied significantly depending on the pretreatment process initial ph and water matrix types at higher initial ph values 7 0 most pretreatments did not reduce the ndma fp presumably because few radical species and more chloramine reactive byproducts were generated at ph 7 0 however electrochemical oxidation assisted by chloride and fe2 h2o2 catalytic wet peroxide oxidation and peroxydisulfate induced pretreatments removed up to 85 of ndma fp in the ro brine ultraviolet uv irradiation or prechlorination alone did not reduce the ndma fp

wide and continuous utilization the rnt content in aquatic ecosystems has reached relatively high levels 1 µg l 1 and it is frequently detected in water bodies cardoso et al 2014 romeyn et al 2016 rnt may undergo transformation into highly toxic carcinogenic products and hence it was classified as a drug of concern u s food and drug administration 2021 as one of the transformation products of rnt n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a potent carcinogen and frequently encountered nitrosamine from water chloramination which deserves special attention in potable reuse applications le roux et al 2012 seid et al 2021 variable types of advanced oxidation processes aops employing free chlorine fc peroxydisulfate pds and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are widely used for degradation of micropollutants e g rnt with activation by ultraviolet uv chemicals such as fe2 in fenton process and potential bias jasper et al 2016 naim and ghauch 2016 munoz et al 2017 elias et al 2019 however the performance of aops should be highly dependent on the operational parameters including oxidant dose and the type of activator therefore the concept of reaction stoichiometric efficiency rse a molecular ratio of the degraded pollutants to the consumed oxidants ghauch et al 2015 2017 amasha et al 2018 has been recently proposed for evaluation and or optimization of aops in typical water treatments for reuse membrane processes e g reverse osmosis ro are widely integrated with aops such as those based on uv h2o2 and use chloramine for biofouling control and secondary disinfection sgroi et al 2015 for water reuse however the use of chloramine can cause a significant increase in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps the residual of the chloramine used for cleaning purposes in the ro permeate leads to the formation of ndma via the transfer of chloramine species mccurry et al 2017 sanchís et al 2021 demonstrated that the chloramination of water led to increased levels of ndma as compared with the ndma content in nondisinfected reclaimed water on the other hand the use of preformed monochloramine nh2cl is advantageous over in situ chloramination in terms of minimizing the formation of ndma mccurry et al 2017 further improper pretreatment of ro brine can substantially increase the formation of dbps such as trihalomethanes bagastyo et al 2013 therefore the effect of the pretreatment process combined with chloramination on the formation of ndma in an ro system should be carefully examined early studies demonstrated that the pretreatment of precursors can reduce the ndma formation potential ndma fp the pretreatment efficiencies were primarily dependent on ph contact time water matrix and the type of reactive species for instance ozonation reduced ndma formation more effectively than the use of fc and chlorine dioxide as pretreatment however the ndma fp increased during post chloramination after uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 and chloramine farré et al 2012 selbes et al 2014 wang et al 2015 recent studies reported that ndma can be reformed in the ro permeate by employing ozone and uv based aops mccurry et al 2017 sgroi et al 2015 szczuka et al 2020 however ndma formation driven by other aops such as catalytic wet oxidation cwpo and sulfate radicals based oxidation has not been extensively explored yet this study aimed to investigate the impact of different oxidation processes on in situ ndma formation in ro permeate and brine first to gain further insights into the detailed formation mechanism the ndma fp for rnt chloramination by different oxidation processes was investigated further the effect of the initial ph during pretreatment on the ndma fp was evaluated and the reaction intermediates were identified using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry uhplc q tof ms finally as pretreatments to reduce the ndma fp in ro permeate and brine the following processes were examined photolysis in

realistic conditions in the typical water treatment process krasner et al 2018 park et al 2016 the fp protocol was slightly modified by shortening the chloramination time followed by allowing the ultimate ndma formation and then it was utilized for post chloramination 2 3 ranitidine oxidation by various pretreatment processes pretreatment oxidation experiments were conducted using different

text s2 note that the desired electrodes and reagent oxidant doses were selected based on the preliminary assessments conducted in our previous studies chung et al 2017 lee et al 2020a son et al 2021 in all pretreatment experiments the effect of ph was investigated by adjusting the solution ph 3 0 9 5 with either 2 mm phosphate or borate buffer further the pretreatment experiments were conducted in the ro permeate and brine by spiking with 20 µm of rnt the samples were periodically withdrawn quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate or methanol and then filtered 0 45 µm pvdf before conducting further analysis and post chloramination experiments according to the fp protocols table s1 a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc 1260 infinity quaternary hplc vl agilent usa was used to quantify the residual concentration of rnt text s3 spectrophotometric methods using 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate as an indicator and injection spectroscopy analytical techniques modified hplc setup with capillary columns eluting acidified potassium iodide and sodium bicarbonate solution were used to measure pds zou et al 2019 and h2o2 concentration tantawi et al 2019

methods 3 1 1 ranitidine degradation fig 1 shows the removal efficiency of rnt by different oxidation processes degradation of rnt in control experiments pds h2o2 and fe2 electrolysis by heterogeneous oxidation only and adsorption was less than 25 during a reaction time of 0 5 h fig 1a c upon the addition of 50 µm nh2cl or fc 20 2 56 0 of rnt was removed after 0 5 h in contrast more than 92 of rnt was completely degraded within 0 5 h by fe2 pds fenton and cwpo fig 1d during e cl e pds and e fenton process most of the rnt was removed effectively within only 7 15 min fig 1e as shown in fig 1f rnt was completely degraded within 10 30 min of uv irradiation depending on the additives pds nh2cl fc fe2 h2o2 and h2o2 an increase in the additives dosage to 1 mm significantly increased the rnt degradation by nh2cl or fc whereas the degradation efficiency of the other methods remained constant fig s1 the resulting kinetics well followed the pseudo first order models r2 0 90 and the rate constants kobs ranged from 6 8 10 3 to 0 56 min 1 figs s1 and s2 agreed well with studies radjenović et al 2010 dong et al 2017 elias et al 2019 jasper et al 2016 munoz et al 2017 olvera vargas et al 2014 wu et al 2021 on the other hand there was insignificant change in the rnt oxidation in the ro permeate matrix data not shown whereas rnt degradation and toc reduction were significantly retarded in the ro brine fig s2 possibly a substantial fraction of the reactive oxidant species was quenched by the dissolved organic compounds radjenović et al 2011 xiang et al 2019 to lower the removal efficacy of the rnt during the photo electro and chemically driven oxidation processes various reactive radicals nh2 o2 oh cl and so4 can be formed see tables s2 7 radical scavenging experiments were conducted to identify the key reactive species fig s3 the addition of alcohols showed significant decreases in the rnt removal in cwpo uv h2o2 and fenton based processes demonstrating that the oh played an important role in the absence of chlorine sulfate radical sources the methanol inhibited the rnt removal in the pds activation processes more markedly than t butanol implying that so4 is the dominant active species nitrobenzene k 3 9 109 m 1s 1 and t butanol k 6 0 108 m 1s 1 are known to react rapidly with the oh neta et al 1988 however nitrobenzene has negligible cl reactivity as compared to t butanol k 3 0 108 m 1s 1 remucal and manley 2016 in this study t butanol showed moderately greater scavenging effects on rnt degradation than nitrobenzene in the e cl uv nh2cl and uv cl2 process fig s3 revealing that cl or other reactive chlorine species rcs and oh played a synergistic role in addition the activity of the reactive nitrogen species rns e g nh2 no in uv nh2cl was monitored in the absence of oxygen as previously described wu et al 2021 the reaction of nh2 and o2 produces peroxyl radicals and no which can effectively attack the nucleophilic terminal amine moiety under n2 purging there was a decrease in the rnt degradation rate was observed implying that the role of rns should not be ignored zhang et al 2019 benzoquinone insignificantly interfered with the rnt degradation to rule out the contributions of o2 among the various oxidation methods for rnt removal in this study the pds based oxidations were demonstrated to be the most promising even at a low dosage greater levels of rse were achieved with the pds additions compared with the h2o2 assisted oxidations which is in line with the previous study el asmar et al 2021 for example the calculated rse were 24 9 and 9 6 respectively for uv pds and uv h2o2 at the same oxidant concentration of 1 mm and reaction time of 0 5 h data not shown on the other hand the calculated rse for e pds 15 4 108 7 uv pds 4 8 66 6 and fe2 pds 2 4 46 0 processes decreased as the pds 0 increased from 0 05 to 4 0 mm fig s4 these results were presumably due to a self quenching of radicals by residual pds ghauch et al 2017 el asmar et al 2021 consequently electrochemical or uv driven activation of relatively low concentration of oxidant would enhance the rnt degradation rate 3 1 2 ndma formation in ro permeate and brine by chloramination and pretreatments the ndma fp in the ro permeate and brine was investigated considering that the chloramine based in place cleaning of membranes can potentially generate ndma from the concentrated precursors mccurry et al 2017 under the fp protocol a plateau of molar ndma yield appeared within 6 h 67 76 fig s5 while the yields from the sc and ufc were only 0 4 2 7 and 29 0 43 6 after 72 h of incubation respectively fig 2 a even under different experimental protocols the results were concordant with the results of previous studies hinneh et al 2019 selbes et al 2014 shen and andrews 2010 notably the ndma concentrations from the raw ro brine without spiking with rnt exceeded the value recommend by who 2008 i e 100 ng l 1 fig 2b while its concentrations in the ro permeate ranged between 10 3 and 33 6 ng l 1 fig 2c although most of the rnt degradation was achieved within 0 5 h fig 1 the samples were further incubated for 3 h without ph adjustment to estimate the ultimate ndma formation during the pretreatment electrochemical chlorination produced less ndma yield 5 than chloramination in all samples and less than 3 ndma fp was obtained by the e fenton uv cl2 and uv nh2cl processes fig 3 shin et al 2017 reported the formation of ndma from dma by the e fenton process using a sacrificial stainless steel anode ndma formation was also observed by wu et al 2021 during rnt degradation in uv nh2cl process under identical conditions ndma was not detectable in the other oxidation processes these observations led us to conclude that ndma formation from rnt and its degradation intermediates can be neglected for all examined pretreatment processes except photo electro chemical chlor am ination 3 2 ndma fp varying with different pretreatment methods and chemical dosages 3 2 1 pretreatment with rcs assisted oxidation fig 4 shows the ultimate ndma yields during the post chloramination for rcs assisted pretreatment with variable oxidant doses of fc or nh2cl in chemical chlorination the highest ndma fp reduction was achieved by using 1 mm naocl fig 4a in the electrochemical e cl setup the reduction in ndma fp was negligible without cl in electrolyte fig s6 while the final ndma molar yield significantly decreased from 76 0 to 0 6 as cl 0 increased up to 70 mm fig 4b with 30 mm of cl 0 the ndma fp decreased steeply during the first 0 5 h of e cl treatment fig s7 uv photolysis alone reduced the ndma fp of rnt by up to 38 depending on the ph and light intensity fig s8 on the other hand uv irradiation in the presence of 50 µm nh2cl mitigated ndma formation by only 15 fig 4a notably the ndma fp increased significantly with higher nh2cl doses 1 and 4 mm while the rcs are responsible for the deactivation of core moieties for ndma formation jeon et al 2016 the rns caused the nitrosation amination of rnt during pretreatment thereby accelerating the nitrosamine production in the post chloramination seid et al 2021 wu et al 2021 therefore the use of uv cl2 resulted in a more effective reduction of ndma fp by up to 68 fig 4a at a given fc dosage 1 mm uv irradiation facilitated ndma fp reduction owing to the more facile reaction of cl radicals with rnt the most efficient ndma fp mitigation was achieved by e cl in a control e cl experiment conducted with 30 mm nacl solution without rnt 1 3 mm fc was produced after 15 min more than 95 reduction in the ndma fp of rnt was achieved in the same duration fig s7 and this reduction greatly exceeded the reductions achieved using 1 4 mm fc and uv cl2 fig 4a this observation can be ascribed to the continuous generation of rcs in contrast to the batch fc injection in uv cl2 furst et al 2018 and to the synergetic effects of oh in e cl as shown in fig s3 3 2 2 pretreatment with so4 assisted oxidation fig 5 shows a comparison of the reduction in ndma fps of rnt in di water measured after the pds activation pretreatments the ndma fp reduction achieved using the pds alone was insignificant fig s6 within the given reaction time 0 5 h almost complete annihilation of the ndma fp was achieved by e pds at pds dosages greater than 1 mm fig 5 less efficient reduction of ndma fp was observed in the cases of fe2 pds and uv pds pretreatments with the minimal ndma fps of 30 and 15 respectively at a pds dosage of 4 mm the activation of 1 mm pds reduced the ndma fp almost to zero within 0 5 h fig s7 the variable degree of ndma fp reduction should be considered in terms of the yield and type of so4 previous studies demonstrated that uv irradiation more effectively activates pds than fe 2 ghanbari and moradi 2017 in the e pds the sulfate radical generated on the ti mesh cathode and the oh generated on the self doped tio2 nanotube anode son et al 2021 result in more facile reduction of ndma fp than that possible by uv pds with a pds dosage of 1 4 mm 3 2 3 pretreatment with oh assisted oxidation as shown in fig 6 different oh assisted pretreatments were employed and their effects on the ndma fp was evaluated upon pretreatment for 0 5 h the ndma fp became less than 15 at 1 mm h2o2 dosage except in the case of uv h2o2 and further oxidant input to 4 mm resulted in insignificant enhancement fig 6 with a fixed h2o2 dose of 1 mm the ndma fp was reduced only by cwpo and e fenton within the first 15 min and a subsequent sharp decrease was noted in the case of fenton and uv fenton fig s7 further among all the pretreatment methods e fenton always provided the best pretreatment performance followed by cwpo note that the addition of magnetite alone reduced ndma fp by 55 fig s6 unlike fenton and uv fenton e fenton and cwpo led to a drastic reduction in ndma fp within 0 5 h interestingly with uv h2o2 the ndma fp increased under a varying h2o2 dose and with increase in irradiation time these results are in contrast with the results of other peroxide based methods i e fenton further the results of uv h2o2 indicate that rnt degradation only by the oh radical can lead to an insignificant reduction in ndma fp this phenomenon can be explained by interactions between oh radical and the ferryl ion fe iv and the formation of oxidation intermediates containing the dimethylamino moiety with facile reactivity with chloramine for instance the iron catalyzed oxidation process is more effective for both hydroxylation and n dealkylation zbaida et al 1986 than purely photo driven oxidation pathways dong et al 2017 n dealkylated intermediates had lower ndma fp than the parent precursors wang et al 2015 to better understand the role of fe iv methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso was chosen as a probe wang et al 2018 where the oxidation of pmso to methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 served as an indicator of the formation of fe iv as shown in fig s9 no pmso2 was found in uv h2o2 whereas pmso2 was produced 47 molar yield in fenton oxidation with the addition of t butanol and rnt pmso oxidation decreased significantly while the pmso2 yield declined slightly in the presence of only rnt these results indicate that fe iv may interfere with the degradation of rnt moieties by oh and reduce ndma fp these possibilities must be further examined 3 3 effect of ph on ndma fp during various pretreatments the reduction in ndma fp by the pretreatment is known to be associated with the removal and or deactivation of core moieties such as dma and the furan ring of rnt importantly the ph would primarily affect the reactivity of moiety specific reaction kinetics which in turn influences the generation of radicals and ultimately affects the ndma fp during subsequent chloramination jeon et al 2016 3 3 1 rcs assisted pretreatment with varying phs in the examinations described hereinafter the pretreatment duration was fixed at 0 5 h the efficiency of prechlorination naocl only was monotonically retarded as ph increased from 3 to 9 5 fig 7 although the reactivity with fc was greater than that achieved with amine and furan moieties by orders of magnitude the chlorination of acetamidine and thioether moieties insignificantly reduced the ndma fp of rnt jeon et al 2016 in contrast the degradation of the furan moiety affected the stability of the carbocation to favor n dealkylation while the prechlorination of the amine moiety yielded chlorammonium intermediates deborde and von gunten 2008 this hampers the interaction of the amine moiety with monochloramine and affects ndma generation the ph dependent speciation of fc i e hocl vs ocl influences its reactivity with variable functional groups in rnt in turn determining the ndma fp reduction efficiency selbes et al 2014 in comparison the effects of ph were trivial in e cl and uv cl2 at ph 3 7 however at ph 9 5 the dissociation of ocl generated cl with lower yields the cl was further quenched by oh to generate a less reactive species fang et al 2014 in e cl the current efficiency of rcs generation can be reduced by an increase in the ph caused by an invigorated oxygen evolution reaction in uv nh2cl ndma fp reduction showed little ph dependence except at ph 3 possibly because of the stability of chloramine and uv reactivity of deprotonated rnt 3 3 2 so4 assisted pretreatment with varying phs for e pds a quasicomplete elimination of ndma 99 was observed at ph 3 0 and 5 6 in contrast only 46 ndma fp removal was realized at ph 9 5 the uv pds method resulted in moderately greater ndma fp removal at ph 5 6 and 9 5 than that achieved with fe2 pds pretreatment one of the reasons for the enhanced reduction of ndma fps at low ph 5 6 is the speciation of fe ions for example under alkaline conditions insoluble iron oxyhydroxide complexes are formed and they are likely to inhibit the release of fe2 in the fe2 pds system xia et al 2020 resulting in the limited formation of so4 besides competitive reactions e g oh generation reduce the steady state concentration of so4 in the pds based oxidation process lee et al 2020b with an increasing ph thereby hampering the reduction in ndma fp at ph 7 3 3 3 oh assisted pretreatment with varying phs as expected the highest ndma fp removal was obtained at ph 3 0 90 during fenton oxidation the removal decreased to 26 32 at higher phs fig 7 likewise the decrease in ndma fp by cwpo pretreatment monotonically decreased with higher phs the ndma fp reduction by uv h2o2 driven by the oh radical was possible only at ph 3 0 38 in fact at ph 5 6 the ndma fp increased uv irradiation itself significantly reduced the formation of ndma at ph 3 0 this reduction can be attributed to acid catalysis hydrolysis fig s8 after uv pretreatment at ph 5 6 and 9 5 greater amounts of ndma were generated because of the lower photosensitivity of the deprotonated rnt as compared to that of their analogous neutral species dong et al 2017 the addition of chemicals i e h2o2 during photolysis even inhibited rnt degradation because of competitive absorption at lower phs but such inhibition did not occur at alkaline phs 3 4 degradation byproducts of rnt obtained by the selected pretreatments depending on the primary oxidants wide varieties of intermediates products table s8 were identified in the gc uplc q tof ms analysis multiple reaction pathways scheme 1 were considered hydroxylation oxygen addition 1 chlorine addition 2 amination 3 c s and c n bond cleavage 4 hydroxylation denitration 5 n dealkylation 6 and n methylation 7 among them only n dealkylation and n methylation could reduce the ndma fp in the post chloramination the possible oxidative pathways scheme 1 are discussed below in the case of rcs based processes the transformation of rnt begins with an attack at multiple moieties leading to chlorinated m z 349 hydroxylated m z 331 and chlorinated oxygenated products m z 365 and 399 further oxidative bond cleavage e g c s and c n produced 5 dimethyl aminoethyl furfuryl alcohol m z 155 n dealkylated products m z 270 and 336 and chlorinated demethylated m z 335 intermediate scheme s1 as reported previously jasper et al 2016 le roux et al 2012 the chlorinated aminated m z 364 scheme s2 product was detected after uv nh2cl presumably via rns i e nh2 attack on dma n this product is a known intermediate for ndma seid et al 2021 in pds activation processes successive electron transfer between so4 and rnt moieties led to the unstable and reactive rnt radical naim and ghauch 2016 subsequent hydroxylation of the thioether and n dealkylation of the dma n moiety generated the intermediates with m z 331 and m z 270 respectively subsequently the oxidation of the acetamidine moiety by the uv pds generated hydroxylation denitration products m z 291 and m z 318 as demonstrated by elias et al 2019 in the e pds furan based fragments m z 110 and m z 129 were obtained by the consecutive c s cleavage and demethylation on the dma n group scheme s3 n demethylated n dealkylated and furan derivative products can induce unstable dma n leading to the mitigation of ndma formation ultimately selbes et al 2014 wang et al 2015 in oh radical driven oxidation oxygenated hydroxylated m z 331 and 361 c s cleavage m z 155 and 175 hydroxylation denitration m z 318 products were formed confirming that oxygen addition hydroxylation and bond cleavage were responsible for the main oxidation pathways schemes s4 s7 these products were probably generated via the electrophilic attack of the iron species followed by the intramolecular rearrangement and or photosensitized oxidation dong et al 2017 latch et al 2003 zbaida et al 1986 the oxidation of rnt with cwpo and fenton led to the formation of an n dealkylated and sulfonated furan based intermediate e g m z 204 suggesting the role of fe iv in the iron catalyzed oxidation process in contrast during the uv h2o2 oxidation the transformation of rnt mostly occurred via the oxidation of thioether and acetamidine leaving the dma n intact scheme s7 these products are believed to form more reactive daughter products and cause an increase in ndma fp after the uv h2o2 pretreatment radjenović et al 2012 wang et al 2015 3 5 evaluation of ndma fp in the pretreated ro permeate and brine under experimental conditions of ph 5 6 6 8 ro permeate and brine were pretreated to evaluate the ndma formation upon exposure to nh2cl 3 0 mg of cl2 only uv based pretreatments were employed for the ro permeate fig 2 depicts ndma formation without pretreatment the pretreatment and subsequent chloramination using the raw fig 8 a and rnt spiked ro permeate fig s10 showed that the ndma fp decreased with uv uv cl2 uv pds and uv fenton treatments in contrast uv irradiation with nh2cl and h2o2 increased the ndma formation and the added chemicals intervened with the direct uv photolysis mccurry et al 2017 szczuka et al 2020 the uv pds and uv fenton processes were more cost effective text s3 than uv cl2 and uv h2o2 with respect to the electrical energy per order eeo reduction of ndma fp fig s11 for the pretreatment of ro brine fig 8b e cl e pds cwpo and e fenton were the most effective pretreatment process in terms of reducing both toc 21 7 33 4 and ndma fp 55 85 these processes were reported to be effective for removing dissolved surrogates present in ro brine radjenović et al 2011 xiang et al 2019 from the viewpoint of economy text s3 however the eeo required to achieve the same reduction efficacy using e fenton and e pds was estimated to be much lower by factors of 2 8 11 than the eeo required for the e cl and cwpo process fig s11 indicating that e fenton and e pds are economically feasible for the simultaneous removal of toc and ndma fp overall this study demonstrated the role of various oxidant species in water reuse ro permeate and treatment ro brine these species can elevate the risk of ndma formation during chloramination the results revealed that the fate and risk of ndma formation can be reduced by selecting the proper oxidants and the optimum operating parameters such as ph however for specific pretreatments such as uv irradiation in the presence of nh2cl and h2o2 the ndma fp of precursors was maintained or increased to form nitrosamine upon exposure to chloramine in the water treatment distribution system 4 conclusion we investigated the effects of thirteen photo electro chemical pretreatment processes on ndma formation during the chloramination of rnt in di water ro permeate and brine the main findings from this study are summarized as follows l when rnt was present in di water ro permeate and brine higher levels of ndma were formed during chloramination as compared to the situations in which the samples were treated by pretreatment processes such as uv irradiation and chlorination l the observed levels of ndma formed varied significantly with the type of pretreatments l the ph during pretreatment played a crucial role in mitigating the ndma fp for the ph range of 3 0 5 6 the cwpo e cl e fenton and e pds remarkably reduced the ndma fp during the post chloramination l uv irradiation in the presence of h2o2 and nh2cl showed insignificant reductions in the ndma fp in both di water and ro permeate l most pretreatments resulted in less than 48 reduction of the ndma fp in ro brine compared with the ndma fp in di water pretreatments using cwpo e fenton and e pds exhibited up to an 85 reduction in ndma fp l compared to rns reactive radicals such as rcs and so4 facilitated the destruction of core moieties via n dealkylation and or n methylation this alleviated ndma formation during the subsequent chloramination l oh as a sole reactive radical is inadequate for reducing ndma fp while iron fe iv

16701,water scarcity forces the science to find the most environmentally friendly propulsion technology for supplying plentiful freshwater at low energy costs membrane distillation well meets criteria of eco friendly management of natural resources but it is not yet competitive on scale herein we use a dichalchogenide compound bi2te3 as a conceivable source to accelerate the redesign of advanced

limited resource and high priority is to avoid loss of water energy and other resources many countries suffer water scarcity and the inconvenience of water shortage is expected to increase in the next years due to the progressive demographic expansion along with an amplified demand for freshwater in agriculture and industrial production elimelech and phillip 2011 water desalination is regarded as a reliable and sustainable route for managing natural resources and giving solutions to water shortage ray et al 2018 as a greener technology membrane distillation md enables eco sustainable recovery of

et al 2018 makes this technology further appropriate for preserving ecosystems and biodiversity vörösmarty et al 2010 basically md needs hydrophobic porous membranes to separate a phase containing the saline solution and another collecting distilled water to drive the process it is enough to apply a difference of temperature which generates a difference of partial pressure of water vapor across the membrane this causes water to evaporate from the saline solution feed side diffuse itself through the pores of the membrane and condense in a pure liquid phase permeate side given that the salts are not volatile compounds they can be easily retained if liquid intrusion inside the pores is precluded heat dissipation takes place together with water flux during md operation a convective type heat loss origins with water evaporation on the feed side and water condensation on the permeate side otherwise a conductive heat loss is determined by the trans membrane temperature gradient and depends on materials and structural features of the membrane heat loss by conduction implies inevitably a reduction of the difference of temperature across the membrane with a subsequent lowering of the partial vapor pressure necessary to promote mass transfer so membranes with low resistance to the transport of water vapor and high resistance to conductive heat transfer are crucial to implement fruitful and efficient thermally driven md operations unfortunately membranes currently available on the market do not meet these requirements satisfactorily a wide range of new nanocomposite and

membrane preparation the membranes were prepared by dry wet phase inversion frappa et al 2020 politano et al 2020 from 2d material pvdf mixtures first of all bismuth telluride and graphene were exfoliated in a dispersant liquid phase nmp at a predefined concentration 0 65 and 10 gl 1 politano et al 2020 then pvdf powder was added under mechanical stirring to 2d materials dispersant liquid

bi2te3 graphene bt g 1 1 all mixtures were stirred at 30 c overnight and then degassed for 2 h each mixture was uniformly cast on a glass plate by using a casting knife regulated on 250 μm elcometer instruments inc the casting solution was successively coagulated in a bath containing 2 propanol ipa in order to promote solid liquid demixing and then washed in milli q water each membrane was air dried at room temperature overnight and annealed at 30 c for 1 h before using porous polymeric networks entrapping few layers bi2te3 and graphene were hence formed 2 3 methods membrane morphology was

on holey carbon 400 mesh cu grids from ted pella inc the graphene samples were diluted 1 50 the grids were stored under vacuum at room temperature to remove the solvent residues tem images were captured by a jeol jem 1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kv raman spectroscopy was used to inspect the quality of 2d materials the as prepared dispersions were diluted 1 30 in nmp and drop cast onto a si wafer ldb technologies ltd covered with 300 nm thermally grown sio2 raman measurements were carried out by a renishaw invia spectrometer using a 50 objective numerical aperture 0 75 a laser with a wavelength of 514 5 nm with an incident power of 5 mw infrared analysis was performed collecting the spectra at a resolution of 1 cm 1 by

coated silicon wafers the the xps spectra were acquired xps spectra were acquired using a monochromatic al kα source operating at 20 ma and 15 kv high resolution spectra of c 1 s and au 4f peaks were collected at pass energy of 10 ev and energy step of 0 1 ev energy calibration was performed setting the au 4f7 2 peak at 84 0 ev data analysis was carried out with casaxps software version 2 3 17 the mean pore size was estimated according to the gas liquid displacement technique pm instruments three four samples with an active area of 3 5 cm2 were filled by fc 40 and the liquid was displaced from bigger to smaller pores with increasing pressure pore size values of 0 40 to 0 50 0 06 μm were estimated for all membranes the overall porosity was measured by filling them with fc 40 the membrane weight was estimated before and after filling and the porosity was expressed in percentage as the ratio between the volume occupied by the fluorinert liquid and the volume of the membrane the procedure was averagely repeated on six specimens providing porosity of 65 5 for pristine pvdf 55 3 for pvdf bt g 1 1 0 5 75 1 for pvdf bt 0 5 77 1 for pvdf bt 7 the membrane thickness was measured by a digital gauge carl mhar d 7300 esslingen a n the values were 58 4 μm pvdf 65 5 μm pvdf bt g 1 1 0 5 68 5 μm pvdf bt 0 5 100 5 μm pvdf bt 7 the resistance to wetting of the membranes was evaluated by using contact angle measurements according to the sessile drop method cam 200 ksv instruments ltd mechanical resistance was evaluated by using a tensile stress strain meter roell zwick an average of 4 5 specimens with area of 10 cm2 were tested at 20 c 2 4 membrane distillation experiments thermally driven md experiments were executed accordingly with the membrane direct contact dc configuration using nacl solutions 0 6 m 35 gl 1 synthetic seawater flow rate 100 to 300 ml min 1 tfeed 33 to 58 8 c and t perm 11 c retentate and distillate streams were converged in a counter current way toward the membrane module containing the membrane where the liquid water was evaporated on the retentate side a pump was taking and sending the heated feed to the membrane module also on the distillate side a second pump ensured the counter current recycle of the cold stream in order to remove from the solution the vapour diffusing through the membrane pores the trans membrane fluxes were estimated by evaluating the weight variations in the distillate tanks each single experiment was run for 6 h continuously a longer time test was further carried out in order to prove durability and stability of the novel membranes the salt conductivity of the feed and permeate streams were measured at the end of each single experiment by using a conductive meter eutech instruments pc 2700 2 5 water flux and heat flow equations the permeate flux j was estimated considering the dependence on porosity and thickness according to the relation 1 j r α ε τ δ the fluxes were calculated considering the porosity of each membrane and were normalized for the thickness of pvfd bt 0 5 68 5 μm this is to perform suitable comparative analyses the thermal conductivity of the materials was calculated assuming the thermal conductivity of single type of few layers and related percentage in the nanocomposite membranes thermal conduction was considered as a heat loss mechanism through the membrane material and the vapor that fills the pore and was expressed as 2 q m h m δ t m where 3 h m ε h m g 1 ε h m s k g ε k m 1 ε δ here hms and hmg represent the heat transfer coefficients of the vapor within the membrane pores and the solid membrane material respectively kg and km the thermal conductivity of vapor and membrane total heat transfer across the membrane was estimated as 4 q q v q m where q v h v δ t m j δ h v is the heat of vaporization on the other hand the heat transfer by convection in the feed f and permeate p boundary layers can be expressed as 5 q h f δ t f h f t f t f m 6 q h p δ t p h p t p t p m therefore the overall heat transfer coefficient of the md process is given by 7 1 u 1 h f 1 h m h v 1 h p 1 h f 1 k g k m 1 ε δ j δ h v t f m t p m 1 h p where each h and each t represent the corresponding heat transfer coefficients and temperatures either at feed f side or permeate p side or at membrane surface m finally the total heat transferred across the membrane is expressed as 8 q u δ t while the thermal efficiency in md can be specified as the ratio of latent heat of vaporization to the total latent and conduction heat for dcmd the thermal efficiency is hence expressed as 9 t h e r m a l e f f i c i e n c y j δ h u δ t 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane preparation and characterization nanocomposite pvdf membranes containing few layers bi2te3 and related mixture with graphene 1 1 have been prepared from dispersant liquid phases containing exfoliated bismuth telluride and graphene respectively frappa et al 2020 gugliuzza et al 2019 politano et al 2020 recently this exfoliation procedure has been demonstrated to be more effective in yielding few layers with a better lateral size and high surface area ratio frappa et al 2020 del rio castillo et al 2019 del rio castillo et al 2018 bonaccorso et al 2016 exfoliated bi2te3 shows a lateral size of 200 nm while few layers graphene is 490 nm sized the raman spectra of bi2te3 bt in bulk and exfoliated state exhibit typical raman active modes of the chaclogenide compound a1 g e2 g a21 g fig 1a the raman spectrum of exfoliated graphene g reveals enhanced i d i g ratio while the deconvolution of the band 2d bands evidences a predominant 2d1 2d2 ratio confirming an enrichment in few layers graphene fig 1b tem images show few layers 2d materials obtained via assisted dispersant liquid phase exfoliation fig 2 a b while sem micrographs display few layers bismuth telluride and graphene entrapped in the pvdf polymeric network fig 2 c d x ray diffraction pattern xrd confirms further the presence of few layers bi2te3 and graphene in membranes fig 2 e f in spite of predominant signals of pvdf peaks depicted in blue all of the detected peaks are indexed to the standard diffraction pattern of bi2te3 jcpds 15 0863 with main peaks depicted in red originated from the 015 1010 and 0015 planes hosokawa et al 2019 while the graphene is identified with a detectable peak at c002 depicted in green wang and zhang 2019 additionally x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements indicate the presence of 2d materials in pvdf membranes fig 2i in pvdf membrane containing few layers graphene higher contribution of c 1 s is around 290 ev contributions of bismuth 200 ev and telluride 600 ev are detectable for pvdf filled with bismuth telluride weak contributions of oxygen can be distinguished for both the nanocomposite membranes as sem displays these 2d materials are hence randomly entangled in the polymer network which exhibits a spherulitic like morphology with a predominance of the crystalline form α along with a few β and γ crystallite contributions well evident in infrared spectrum fig 2 g h this singular irregular topography consisting of interconnected polymer particles yields large gaps so that the resistance to water vapor transfer is reduced while resistance to liquid intrusion is prevented gugliuzza et al 2016a porosity of 75 77 has been estimated for membranes containing bi2te3 whereas values around 55 have been calculated for the membrane containing the mixture of bi2te3 and graphene against a value of 65 measured for the pristine membrane values of contact angle of 137 1 have been estimated for the pristine pvdf while values of 135 8 have been measured on pvdf bt0 5 pvdf bt07 membrane and pvdf bt g membranes have revealed good wetting resistance with contact angle values of 135 2 and 136 4 respectively in the first instance all membranes show appropriate structure surface property relationships to equip md devices 3 2 water production via membrane distillation we explore the effect of 2d materials on the water vapor transfer through the membranes when contacting synthetic seawater nacl 35 gl 1 here we show a snapshot of the fluxes measured at different temperature under a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 on the feed side along with the salt rejection ranging from 99 99 to 100 fig 3 a it is relevant to observe how the pvdf bt 0 5 membrane has higher ability to transfer water vapor when a difference of temperature is applied across the matrix its higher porosity ε 75 implies more passages and space for water vapor to pass through an exponential intensification in the flux up to 27 8 lm 2 h 1 is targeted at 53 c the membrane containing bt in mixture with g 1 1 continues to exhibit a constant increase in the mass transfer when compared to the pristine pvdf membrane ε 65 δ 58 μm even if it exhibits a lower porosity ε 55 and a bit higher thickness δ 65 μm it is also quite interesting to observe how the difference between the two nanocomposite membranes pvdf bt 0 5 and pvdf bt g 0 5 becomes larger at high temperature leading to an increase in the flux of 93 at 48 c and 137 at 55 c for membranes wherein only the chalcogenide compound is confined undoubtedly md is a somewhat complex process and its performance depends on interplay of various factors including morphological and thermal properties in this case thickness and pore size are somewhat comparable and are not primary for governing the mass transfer on the other hand the highest porosity of pvdf bt0 5 could justify the largest mass transfer but it does not rationalize fully the amplification of the flux observed at higher temperature as hereafter thermal properties need therefore to be analysed other noteworthy issue is the susceptibility of the flux to wetting and or fouling events fig 3b yields indication about the stability of the flux with time at different temperatures through pvdf bt the relative flux fi f0 confirms stability and durability of bi2te3 enabled pvdf membrane at longer operational time as well fig 3c no decline is observed but rather the flux is kept constant with rejection factors higher than 99 99 this yields clear indication about a good resistance of these novel membranes to wetting and fouling events when a larger content of bi2te3 7 0 is confined in the polymeric matrix the flux tends to increase slightly reaching values of 31 8 lm 2h 1 at 55 c and under a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 an important increase in productivity is achieved by raising the volume of fluid per unit time fig 4 under harsh fluid dynamics the membrane exhibits a great thermal stability and mechanical robustness reaching fluxes of 74 lm 2h 1 really a better resistance to breaking of 60 8 bt 0 5 90 8 bt 7 and 106 4 bt g 1 1 is estimated for all nanocomposite membranes against 30 7 for pristine pvdf also a good resistance to wetting continues to be appreciated with rejection values ranging from 99 92 to 99 99 undoubtedly higher flow rates reduce the residence time of foulants such as salts in the membrane a better mixing of the feed solution is obtained along with a reduced thermal boundary layer and temperature polarization however the gain in productivity is interestingly higher than that estimated for other kinds of nanocomposite membranes table 1 multiwalled carbon nanotubes immobilized in pp pvdf membranes yielded about a flux of 30 8 lm 2h 1 when worked at 60 c and with a flow rate of 150 ml min 1 ragunath et al 2018 electro spinned pvdf hfp membranes filled with graphene have been demonstrated to exhibit a flux close to 23 lm 2h 1 at 60 c and with a flow rate of 200 ml min 1 woo et al 2016 as well as hollow fiber pvdf zno membranes worked at 60 at a flow rate of 250 ml min 1 have produced a flux of 9 68 lm 2h 1 radzi and ahmas 2021 against 69 lm 2h 1 estimated for pvdf bt 7 0 around 58 c at 200 ml min 1 pvdf membranes functionalized with polystyrene zno nanoparticles have yielded flux of 17 79 lm 2h 1 at a temperature and flow rate of 70 c and 400 ml min 1 roshani et al 2018 moreover membranes functionalized with rgo have showed flux of 7 lm 2h 1 when contacting nacl solutions 0 6 m at 90 c and with a flow rate of 350 ml min 1 abdel karim et al 2019 also pvdf membrane filled with graphene nanoplatelets have yielded a flux of 8 27 lm 2h 1 when operated at 80 c under a flow rate of 833 ml min 1 ravi et al 2021 flux of 38 lm 2h 1 have been obtained with cf4 plasma modified superhydrophobic pvdf membranes at 62 4 c and flow rate of 600 ml min 1 yang et al 2014 deposition of tio2 particles on pvdf have rendered a flux of 42 lm 2h 1 at 80 c and 720 ml min 1 razmjou et al 2012 flux of 34 2 lm 2h 1 has been obtained at 60 c and 750 ml min 1 with pvdf sio2 membranes nthunya et al 2019 for pvdf bt 7 0 membranes we calculate a 74 lm 2h 1 at a lower temperature tfeed 58 8 c and with a flow rate of 300 ml min 1 from this comparison bt seems to be more beneficial for higher flux at milder working conditions 3 3 heat dissipation and thermal efficiency according to eqs 7 and 8 heat flow has been estimated for each single membrane taking in account morphological features of the membrane thermal conductivity and flux fig 5 shows the amount of thermal energy q transmitted through pristine and membranes containing nanofiller at different content as expected the amount of heat transmitted through the membranes increases with rising temperature janajreh et al 2017 christie et al 2020 even if reduced heat dissipation is appreciated for membranes filled with bismuth telluride only compared to the pristine pvdf membrane pvdf bt 0 5 yields heat flow values less than 140 at 32 c while a reduction of 2 is found at 53 c a further lessening of heat dissipation around 190 at 32 c and 170 at 53 c is obtained with a thicker pvdf bi2te3 7 0 membrane δ 100 μm based on eqs 7 and 8 a higher thickness reduces the heat transfer coefficient of thermal conduction via membrane material but also it renders longer the passage for water vapor according to eq 1 it is however important to remark that membranes filled with bi2te3 show the highest trans membrane fluxes with a pronounced exponential trend at higher temperature heat flow is positively proportional to the overall membrane thermal conductivity which depends in turn on thermal conductivity of materials and related porosity a thermal conductivity of 0 5 to 1 6 wm 1k 1 in bulk and of 0 1 to 0 3 wm 1k 1 in stacked films has been estimated for bi2te3 at room temperature against 0 17 0 21 wm 1k 1 of pvdf gugliuzza et al 2017 while considering the role of morphological parameters of the membranes and the increase in thermal conductivity of materials with temperature it is noteworthy to point out that bi2te3 is one of the best thermoelectric materials with the highest thermoelectric figure of merit zt 1 1 1 2 of any material around room temperature when exfoliated it can maximize a seebeck effect lan et al 2010 so in membranes with widespread distribution of bi2te3 fig 6 a synergistic effects may reasonably enhance the ability of the bi2te3 enabled membranes to restore the driving force thus maximizing the productivity especially when the feed temperature is increased while the temperature at the cold side is fixed fig 3a shows indeed an important widening of the gap between the fluxes measured at temperature higher than 40 c the beneficial effect of the dichacolgenide compound seems to be contrasted in pvdf bt g 0 5 fig 3a few layer graphene with a thermal conductivity of 5000 wm 1k 1 gugliuzza et al 2017 causes a heat loss higher than one order of magnitude as compared with the other membrane types fig 5 this large heat dissipation is expected to sacrifice the driving force even if the mass transfer continues to control the overall md transport recently perrotta et al 2020 discussed on the defective graphene ability to accelerate water uptake from saline stream as mentioned the productivity of this membrane is better than that measured through the pristine pvdf membrane in spite of the fact that the morphological features should be not in favor to a large mass transfer this confirms how complex effects govern the performance of a md process and it could be misdealing to identify only one factor as affecting the final performance of the separation energetically the pvdf bt g membrane is not however satisfactory while the choice to incorporate bi2te3 is pivotal to make md process ultrafast and energetically efficient simultaneously bi2te3 enabled membranes show the best capability to promote water vapor transfer while contrasting heat conduction according to eq 9 a superior thermal efficiency is subsequent for the md process fig 6b an increase of 65 is estimated for pvdf bt 7 when the difference of the temperature δt across the membrane is increased the intensification is of 40 for pvdf bt 0 5 against the 34 for the pristine pvdf membrane as expected a loss of thermal efficiency is assessed for the membrane containing the mixture of few layers bismuth telluride and graphene in other words a lower resistance to mass transfer and a higher resistance to heat flow are coupled in membranes filled entirely with bismuth telluride values of thermal efficiency up to 19 and 25 6 are calculated at 53 c for systems containing 0 5 and 7 0 of the chalcogenide compound against a value of 6 estimated for pristine pvdf worked under same conditions fig 5b it should be recalled that an increase in thermal efficiency implies a minor use of thermal energy and hence major sustainability compared to other pvdf membrane types park and lee 2019 vanneste et al 2018 li et al 2014 li et al 2020 productivity and thermal efficiency trade off appears to be somewhat competitive for pvdf bt membranes if examined from mass and energy transfer point of views table 2 a suitable balance between water flux and thermal efficiency is obtained in the same membrane after 6 h md test and with nacl 35 gl 1 maximized morphological and thermal properties together with mechanical robustness and low likelihood of wetting complete these novel bi2te3 enabled membranes the suitable compromise between intensified productivity better quality water and low energy consumption is effective at boosting md performance and maximizing the advantage of using chalcogenide materials in water desalination gugliuzza and basile 2014 manju and sagar 2017 heihsel et al 2020 new directions are suggested to separate a larger amount of pure water from saline solutions with a minimum amount of energy menachem and phillip 2011 sealy 2019 ghernaout et al 2011 less energy could be required due to the fact that the driving force for mass transfer can be restored with this perspective further studies are in progress to investigate the conceivable action of chalcogenide enable devices on more complex saline solutions close to existent ones for composition and concentration with a view to more effective evaluation of energy conversion issues herein we provide new evidence about bi2te3 as a new realistic source to boost water flux with important reduction of heat dissipation we propose a practical and viable route to design thermally active membranes which disclose new still unexplored functionalities of chalcogenide materials for a water desalination technology such as the membrane distillation enhanced productivity together with energy efficiency would enable md to be applied to a wide range of source waters with a minimal use of chemicals and reduced energy consumption 4 conclusions using chalcogenide materials exfoliated in dispersant liquid phase we demonstrate bi2te3 enabled membranes for ultrafast and energy saving recovery of freshwater we show that membrane distillation technology can change its own performance when topological compounds are confined in membranes for water desalination purposes our experiments provide clear evidence about the capability of bi2te3 enabled membranes to increase effectively mass transfer reducing heat loss simultaneously this combination in a single device makes md process highly productive and energetically efficient high quality freshwater can be produced reducing energy and working in more eco sustainable way the experimental evidence reported in this work makes the combination of chalcogenides materials and membrane technology more realistic for water desalination purpose high salt rejection together with intensified flux and reduced heat conduction makes the chalcogenide materials extremely attractive for original applications dedicated to water supply at low energy consumption for supporting population and sustaining agriculture and industry this family of topological compounds can facilitate the fabrication of new frontier multi functional devices counting interplay of complementary cooperative functions we believe that this family of edge membranes could be also studied with real systems thus providing advantageous and viable solutions for freshwater generation credit authorship contribution statement m frappa investigation a e del rio castillo

16701,water scarcity forces the science to find the most environmentally friendly propulsion technology for supplying plentiful freshwater at low energy costs membrane distillation well meets criteria of eco friendly management of natural resources but it is not yet competitive on scale herein we use a dichalchogenide compound bi2te3 as a conceivable source to accelerate the redesign of advanced membranes technologies such as thermally driven membrane distillation a procedure based on assisted dispersant liquid phase exfoliation is used to fill pvdf membranes key insights are gained in the crucial role of this topological material confined in hydrophobic membranes dedicated to recovery of freshwater from synthetic seawater intensified water flux together with reduced energy consumption

resistance to heat loss is opposite permeate flux is kept stable and salt rejection is higher than 99 99 during 23 h md test our results confirm the effectiveness of chalcogenides as frontier materials for new concept water desalination through breakthrough thermally driven membrane distillation which is regarded as a new low energy and sustainable solution to address the growing demand for access to freshwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords freshwater water desalination membrane distillation bismuth telluride 2d materials pvdf membrane 1 introduction water is a limited resource and high priority is to avoid loss of water energy and other resources many countries suffer water scarcity and the inconvenience of water shortage is expected to increase in the next years due to the progressive demographic expansion along with an amplified demand for freshwater in agriculture and industrial production elimelech and phillip 2011 water desalination is regarded as a reliable and sustainable route for managing natural resources and giving solutions to water shortage ray et al 2018 as a greener technology membrane distillation md enables eco sustainable recovery of freshwater from saline streams drioli et al 2015 the chance to integrate it with membrane crystallization for the recovery of salts perrotta et al 2020 tsai et al 2018 gugliuzza et al 2009 macedonio et al 2018 makes this technology further appropriate for preserving ecosystems and biodiversity vörösmarty et al 2010 basically md needs hydrophobic porous membranes to separate a phase containing the saline solution and another collecting distilled water to drive the process it is enough to apply a difference of temperature which generates a difference of partial pressure of water vapor across the membrane this causes water to evaporate from the saline solution feed side diffuse itself through the pores of the membrane and condense in a pure liquid phase permeate side given that the salts are not volatile compounds they can be easily retained if liquid intrusion inside the pores is precluded heat dissipation takes place together with water flux during md operation a convective type heat loss origins with water evaporation on the feed side and water condensation on the permeate side otherwise a conductive heat loss is determined by the trans membrane temperature gradient and depends on materials and structural features of the membrane heat loss by conduction implies inevitably a reduction of the difference of temperature across the membrane with a subsequent lowering of the partial vapor pressure necessary to promote mass transfer so membranes with low resistance to the transport of water vapor and high resistance to conductive heat transfer are crucial to implement fruitful and efficient thermally driven md operations unfortunately membranes currently available on the market do not meet these requirements satisfactorily a wide range of new nanocomposite and nanostructured membranes has been proposed over the last years yang et al 2014 speranza et al 2010 chogani et al 2016 an et al 2017 intrchom et al 2018 gontarek et al 2019 noamani et al 2020 efome et

collected at pass energy of 10 ev and energy step of 0 1 ev energy calibration was performed setting the au 4f7 2 peak at 84 0 ev data analysis was carried out with casaxps software version 2 3 17 the mean pore size was estimated according to the gas liquid displacement technique pm instruments three four samples with an active area of 3 5 cm2 were filled by fc 40 and the liquid was displaced from bigger to smaller pores with increasing pressure pore size values of 0 40 to 0 50 0 06 μm were estimated for all membranes the overall porosity was measured by filling them with fc 40 the membrane weight was estimated before and after filling and the porosity was expressed in percentage as the ratio between the volume occupied by the fluorinert liquid and the volume of the membrane the procedure was averagely repeated on six specimens providing porosity of 65 5 for pristine pvdf 55 3 for pvdf bt g 1 1 0 5 75 1 for pvdf bt 0 5 77 1 for pvdf bt 7 the membrane thickness was measured by a digital gauge carl mhar d 7300 esslingen a n the values were 58 4 μm pvdf 65 5 μm pvdf bt g 1 1 0 5 68 5 μm pvdf bt 0 5 100 5 μm pvdf bt 7 the resistance to wetting of the membranes was evaluated by using contact angle measurements according to the sessile drop method cam 200 ksv instruments ltd mechanical resistance was evaluated by using a tensile stress strain meter roell zwick an average of 4 5 specimens with area of 10 cm2 were tested at 20 c 2 4 membrane distillation experiments thermally driven md experiments were executed accordingly with the membrane direct contact dc configuration using nacl solutions 0 6 m 35 gl 1 synthetic seawater flow rate 100 to 300 ml min 1 tfeed 33 to 58 8 c and t perm 11 c retentate and distillate streams were converged in a counter current way toward the membrane module containing the membrane where the liquid water was evaporated on the retentate side a pump was taking and sending the heated feed to the membrane module also on the distillate side a second pump ensured the counter current recycle of the cold stream in order to remove from the solution the vapour diffusing through the membrane pores the trans membrane fluxes were estimated by evaluating the weight variations in the distillate tanks each single experiment was run for 6 h continuously a longer time test was further carried out in order to prove durability and stability of the novel membranes the salt conductivity of the feed and permeate streams were measured at the end of each single experiment by using a conductive meter eutech instruments pc 2700 2 5 water flux and heat flow equations the permeate flux j was estimated considering the dependence on porosity and thickness according to the relation 1 j r α ε τ δ the fluxes were calculated considering the porosity of each membrane and were normalized for the thickness of pvfd bt 0 5 68 5 μm this is to perform suitable comparative analyses the thermal conductivity of the materials was calculated assuming the thermal conductivity of single type of few layers and related percentage in the nanocomposite membranes thermal conduction was considered as a heat loss mechanism through the membrane material and the vapor that fills the pore and was expressed as 2 q m h m δ t m where 3 h m ε h m g 1 ε h m s k g ε k m 1 ε δ here hms and hmg represent the heat transfer coefficients of the vapor within the membrane pores and the solid membrane material respectively kg and km the thermal conductivity of vapor and membrane total heat transfer across the membrane was estimated as 4 q q v q m where q v h v δ t m j δ h v is the heat of vaporization on the other hand the heat transfer by convection in the feed f and permeate p boundary layers can be expressed as 5 q h f δ t f h f t f t f m 6 q h p δ t p h p t p t p m therefore the overall heat transfer coefficient of the md process is given by 7 1 u 1 h f 1 h m h v 1 h p 1 h f 1 k g k m 1 ε δ j δ h v t f m t p m 1 h p where each h and each t represent the corresponding heat transfer coefficients and temperatures either at feed f side or permeate p side or at membrane surface m finally the total heat transferred across the membrane is expressed as 8 q u δ t while the thermal efficiency in md can be specified as the ratio of latent heat of vaporization to the total latent and conduction heat for dcmd the thermal efficiency is hence expressed as 9 t h e r m a l e f f i c i e n c y j δ h u δ t 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane preparation and characterization nanocomposite pvdf membranes containing few layers bi2te3 and related mixture with graphene 1 1 have been prepared from dispersant liquid phases containing exfoliated bismuth telluride and graphene respectively frappa et al 2020 gugliuzza et al 2019 politano et al 2020 recently this exfoliation procedure has been demonstrated to be more effective in yielding few layers with a better lateral size and high surface area ratio frappa et al 2020 del rio castillo et al 2019 del rio castillo et al 2018 bonaccorso et al 2016 exfoliated bi2te3 shows a lateral size of 200 nm while few layers graphene is 490 nm sized the raman spectra of bi2te3 bt in bulk and exfoliated state exhibit typical raman active modes of the chaclogenide compound a1 g e2 g a21 g fig 1a the raman spectrum of exfoliated graphene g reveals enhanced i d i g ratio while the deconvolution of the band 2d bands evidences a predominant 2d1 2d2 ratio confirming an enrichment in few layers graphene fig 1b tem images show few layers 2d materials obtained via assisted dispersant liquid phase exfoliation fig 2 a b while sem micrographs display few layers bismuth telluride and graphene entrapped in the pvdf polymeric network fig 2 c d x ray diffraction pattern xrd confirms further the presence of few layers bi2te3 and graphene in membranes fig 2 e f in spite of predominant signals of pvdf peaks depicted in blue all of the detected peaks are indexed to the standard diffraction pattern of bi2te3 jcpds 15 0863 with main peaks depicted in red originated from the 015 1010 and 0015 planes hosokawa et al 2019 while the graphene is identified with a detectable peak at c002 depicted in green wang and zhang 2019 additionally x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements indicate the presence of 2d materials in pvdf membranes fig 2i in pvdf membrane containing few layers graphene higher contribution of c 1 s is around 290 ev contributions of bismuth 200 ev and telluride 600 ev are detectable for pvdf filled with bismuth telluride weak contributions of oxygen can be distinguished for both the nanocomposite membranes as sem displays these 2d materials are hence randomly entangled in the polymer network which exhibits a spherulitic like morphology with a predominance of the crystalline form α along with a few β and γ crystallite contributions well evident in infrared spectrum fig 2 g h this singular irregular topography consisting of interconnected polymer particles yields large gaps so that the resistance to water vapor transfer is reduced while resistance to liquid intrusion is prevented gugliuzza et al 2016a porosity of 75 77 has been estimated for membranes containing bi2te3 whereas values around 55 have been calculated for the membrane containing the mixture of bi2te3 and graphene against a value of 65 measured for the pristine membrane values of contact angle of 137 1 have been estimated for the pristine pvdf while values of 135 8 have been measured on pvdf bt0 5 pvdf bt07 membrane and pvdf bt g membranes have revealed good wetting resistance with contact angle values of 135 2 and 136 4 respectively in the first instance all membranes show appropriate structure surface property relationships to equip md devices 3 2 water production via membrane distillation we explore the effect of 2d materials on the water vapor transfer through the membranes when contacting synthetic seawater nacl 35 gl 1 here we show a snapshot of the fluxes measured at different temperature under a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 on the feed side along with the salt rejection ranging from 99 99 to 100 fig 3 a it is relevant to observe how the pvdf bt 0 5 membrane has higher ability to transfer water vapor when a difference of temperature is applied across the matrix its higher porosity ε 75 implies more passages and space for water vapor to pass through an exponential intensification in the flux up to 27 8 lm 2 h 1 is targeted at 53 c the membrane containing bt in mixture with g 1 1 continues to exhibit a constant increase in the mass transfer when compared to the pristine pvdf membrane ε 65 δ 58 μm even if it exhibits a lower porosity ε 55 and a bit higher thickness δ 65 μm it is also quite interesting to observe how the difference between the two nanocomposite membranes pvdf bt 0 5 and pvdf bt g 0 5 becomes larger at high temperature leading to an increase in the flux of 93 at 48 c and 137 at 55 c for membranes wherein only the chalcogenide compound is confined undoubtedly md is a somewhat complex process and its performance depends on interplay of various factors including morphological and thermal properties in this case thickness and pore size are somewhat comparable and are not primary for governing the mass transfer on the other hand the highest porosity of pvdf bt0 5 could justify the largest mass transfer but it does not rationalize fully the amplification of the flux observed at higher temperature as hereafter thermal properties need therefore to be analysed other noteworthy issue is the susceptibility of the flux to wetting and or fouling events fig 3b yields indication about the stability of the flux with time at different temperatures through pvdf bt the relative flux fi f0 confirms stability and durability of bi2te3 enabled pvdf membrane at longer operational time as well fig 3c no decline is observed but rather the flux is kept constant with rejection factors higher than 99 99 this yields clear indication about a good resistance of these novel membranes to wetting and fouling events when a larger content of bi2te3 7 0 is confined in the polymeric matrix the flux tends to increase slightly reaching values of 31 8 lm 2h 1 at 55 c and under a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 an important increase in productivity is achieved by raising the volume of fluid per unit time fig 4 under harsh fluid dynamics the membrane exhibits a great thermal stability and mechanical robustness reaching fluxes of 74 lm 2h 1 really a better resistance to breaking of 60 8 bt 0 5 90 8 bt 7 and 106 4 bt g 1 1 is estimated for all nanocomposite membranes against 30 7 for pristine pvdf also a good resistance to wetting continues to be appreciated with rejection values ranging from 99 92 to 99 99 undoubtedly higher flow rates reduce the residence time of foulants such as salts in the membrane a better mixing of the feed solution is obtained along with a reduced thermal boundary layer and temperature polarization however the gain in productivity is interestingly higher than that estimated for other kinds of nanocomposite membranes table 1 multiwalled carbon nanotubes immobilized in pp pvdf membranes yielded about a flux of 30 8 lm 2h 1 when worked at 60 c and with a flow rate of 150 ml min 1 ragunath et al 2018 electro spinned pvdf hfp membranes filled with graphene have been demonstrated to exhibit a flux close to 23 lm 2h 1 at 60 c and with a flow rate of 200 ml min 1 woo et al 2016 as well as hollow fiber pvdf zno membranes worked at 60 at a flow rate of 250 ml min 1 have produced a flux of 9 68 lm 2h 1 radzi and ahmas 2021 against 69 lm 2h 1 estimated for pvdf bt 7 0 around 58 c at 200 ml min 1 pvdf membranes functionalized with polystyrene zno nanoparticles have yielded flux of 17 79 lm 2h 1 at a temperature and flow rate of 70 c and 400 ml min 1 roshani et al 2018 moreover membranes functionalized with rgo have showed flux of 7 lm 2h 1 when contacting nacl solutions 0 6 m at 90 c and with a flow rate of 350 ml min 1 abdel karim et al 2019 also pvdf membrane filled with graphene nanoplatelets have yielded a flux of 8 27 lm 2h 1 when operated at 80 c under a flow rate of 833 ml min 1 ravi et al 2021 flux of 38 lm 2h 1 have been obtained with cf4 plasma modified superhydrophobic pvdf membranes at 62 4 c and flow rate of 600 ml min 1 yang et al 2014 deposition of tio2 particles on pvdf have rendered a flux of 42 lm 2h 1 at 80 c and 720 ml min 1 razmjou et al 2012 flux of 34 2 lm 2h 1 has been obtained at 60 c and 750 ml min 1 with pvdf sio2 membranes nthunya et al 2019 for pvdf bt 7 0 membranes we calculate a 74 lm 2h 1 at a lower temperature tfeed 58 8 c and with a flow rate of 300 ml min 1 from this comparison bt seems to be more beneficial for higher flux at milder working conditions 3 3 heat dissipation and thermal efficiency according to eqs 7 and 8 heat flow has been estimated for each single membrane taking in account morphological features of the membrane thermal conductivity and flux fig 5 shows the amount of thermal energy q transmitted through pristine and membranes containing nanofiller at different content as expected the amount of heat transmitted through the membranes increases with rising temperature janajreh et al 2017 christie et al 2020 even if reduced heat dissipation is appreciated for membranes filled with bismuth telluride only compared to the pristine pvdf membrane pvdf bt 0 5 yields heat flow values less than 140 at 32 c while a reduction of 2 is found at 53 c a further lessening of heat dissipation around 190 at 32 c and 170 at 53 c is obtained with a thicker pvdf bi2te3 7 0 membrane δ 100 μm based on eqs 7 and 8 a higher thickness reduces the heat transfer coefficient of thermal conduction via membrane material but also it renders longer the passage for water vapor according to eq 1 it is however important to remark that membranes filled with bi2te3 show the highest trans membrane fluxes with a pronounced exponential trend at higher temperature heat flow is positively proportional to the overall membrane thermal conductivity which depends in turn on thermal conductivity of materials and related porosity a thermal conductivity of 0 5 to 1 6 wm 1k 1 in bulk and of 0 1 to 0 3 wm 1k 1 in stacked films has been estimated for bi2te3 at room temperature against 0 17 0 21 wm 1k 1 of pvdf gugliuzza et al 2017 while considering the role of morphological parameters of the membranes and the increase in thermal conductivity of materials with temperature it is noteworthy to point out that bi2te3 is one of the best thermoelectric materials with the highest thermoelectric figure of merit zt 1 1 1 2 of any material around room temperature when exfoliated it can maximize a seebeck effect lan et al 2010 so in membranes with widespread distribution of bi2te3 fig 6 a synergistic effects may reasonably enhance the ability of the bi2te3 enabled membranes to restore the driving force thus maximizing the productivity especially when the feed temperature is increased while the temperature at the cold side is fixed fig 3a shows indeed an important widening of the gap between the fluxes measured at temperature higher than 40 c the beneficial effect of the dichacolgenide compound seems to be contrasted in pvdf bt g 0 5 fig 3a few layer graphene with a thermal conductivity of 5000 wm 1k 1 gugliuzza et al 2017 causes a heat loss higher than one order of magnitude as compared with the other membrane types fig 5 this large heat dissipation is expected to sacrifice the driving force even if the mass transfer continues to control the overall md transport recently perrotta et al 2020 discussed on the defective graphene ability to accelerate water uptake from saline stream as mentioned the productivity of this membrane is better than that measured through the pristine pvdf membrane in spite of the fact that the morphological features should be not in favor to a large mass transfer this confirms how complex effects govern the performance of a md process and it could be misdealing to identify only one factor as affecting the final performance of the separation energetically the pvdf bt g membrane is not however satisfactory while the choice to incorporate bi2te3 is pivotal to make md process ultrafast and energetically efficient simultaneously bi2te3 enabled membranes show the best capability to promote water vapor transfer while contrasting heat conduction according to eq 9 a superior thermal efficiency is subsequent for the md process fig 6b an increase of 65 is estimated for pvdf bt 7 when the difference of the temperature δt across the membrane is increased the intensification is of 40 for pvdf bt 0 5 against the 34 for the pristine pvdf membrane as expected a loss of thermal efficiency is assessed for the membrane containing the mixture of few layers bismuth telluride and graphene in other words a lower resistance to mass transfer and a higher resistance to heat flow are coupled in membranes filled entirely with bismuth telluride values of thermal efficiency up to 19 and 25 6 are calculated at 53 c for systems containing 0 5 and 7 0 of the chalcogenide compound against a value of 6 estimated for pristine pvdf worked under same conditions fig 5b it should be recalled that an increase in thermal efficiency implies a minor use of thermal energy and hence major sustainability compared to other pvdf membrane types park and lee 2019 vanneste et al 2018 li et al 2014 li et al 2020 productivity and thermal efficiency trade off appears to be somewhat competitive for pvdf bt membranes if examined from mass and energy transfer point of views table 2 a suitable balance between water flux and thermal efficiency is obtained in the same membrane after 6 h md test and with nacl 35 gl 1 maximized morphological and thermal properties together with mechanical robustness and low likelihood of wetting complete these novel bi2te3 enabled membranes the suitable compromise between intensified productivity better quality water and low energy consumption is effective at boosting md performance and maximizing the advantage of using chalcogenide materials in water desalination gugliuzza and basile 2014 manju and sagar 2017 heihsel et al 2020 new directions are suggested to separate a larger amount of pure water from saline solutions with a minimum amount of energy menachem and phillip 2011 sealy 2019 ghernaout et al 2011 less energy could be required due to the fact that the driving force for mass transfer can be restored with this perspective further studies are in progress to investigate the conceivable action of chalcogenide enable devices on more complex saline solutions close to existent ones for composition and concentration with a view to more effective evaluation of energy conversion issues herein we provide new evidence about bi2te3 as a new realistic source to boost water flux with important reduction of heat dissipation we propose a practical and viable route to design thermally active membranes which disclose new still unexplored functionalities of chalcogenide materials for a water desalination technology such as the membrane distillation enhanced productivity together with energy efficiency would enable md to be applied to a wide range of source waters with a minimal use of chemicals and reduced energy consumption 4 conclusions using chalcogenide materials exfoliated in dispersant liquid phase we demonstrate bi2te3 enabled membranes for ultrafast and energy saving recovery of freshwater we show that membrane distillation technology can change its own performance when topological compounds are confined in membranes for water desalination purposes our experiments provide clear evidence about the capability of bi2te3 enabled membranes to increase effectively mass transfer reducing heat loss simultaneously this combination in a single device makes md process highly productive and energetically efficient high quality freshwater can be produced reducing energy and working in more eco sustainable way the experimental evidence reported in this work makes the combination of chalcogenides materials and membrane technology more realistic for water desalination purpose high salt rejection together with intensified flux and reduced heat conduction makes the chalcogenide materials extremely attractive for original applications dedicated to water supply at low energy consumption for supporting population and sustaining agriculture and industry this family of topological compounds can facilitate the fabrication of new frontier multi functional devices counting interplay of complementary cooperative functions we believe that this family of edge membranes could be also studied with real systems thus providing advantageous and viable solutions for freshwater generation credit authorship contribution statement m frappa investigation a e del rio castillo

16702,an integrated computational fluid dynamics cfd kinetic model framework was developed to numerically describe the hydrodynamic and kinetic phenomena in a liquid solid two phases fluidized bed reactor fenton granular activated carbon fbr fenton gac system the model obtained excellent accuracy for predicting chemical oxygen demand cod removal in reverse osmosis concentrate roc treatment under different operation conditions hydrodynamic evaluation demonstrated that under the quasi steady state the gac particles were uniformly circulated in the bed region with two pairs of counter rotating recirculation cells and a clear interface layer formed between the solid and the liquid phases superficial liquid velocity highly affected the fluidized bed expansion and solid volume fraction while its impact on the overall cod removal efficiency was negligible chemical evaluation revealed that gac h2o2 catalytic reaction enhanced the oh production in fbr fenton gac process by 2 7 folds as compared to homogenous fenton process fenton reaction mainly occurred in the upper liquid region and its kinetics for oh generation significantly diminished by 75 within the first 10 min gac h2o2 reaction took place in the fluidized bed region for continuous oh generation with a relatively stable rate from 1 21 10 6 to 0 60 10 6 m s along the roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process the simulated cod degradation rate decreased along the reaction time with 2 05 10 6 m s and 2 93 10 7 m s at 2 min and 60 min respectively faster cod removal was attained in the fluidized bed region due to combining effects of oh oxidation and gac adsorption the overall predicted cod concentration reduced from 122 to 35 mg l oh oxidation and gac adsorption contributed 59 and 41 respectively to the total cod removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords computational fluid dynamics fluidized bed reactor fbr fenton gac reverse osmosis concentrate organics removal 1 introduction wastewaters generated from papermill cork boiling petrochemical textile and pharmaceutical industries contain high levels of recalcitrant organic pollutants discharge of inadequately treated industrial wastewater might cause severe chemical pollution of the receiving water bodies as well as pose adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems discharge of industrial wastewater is regulated by stringent and specific guidelines while industrial wastewater treatment is challenging due to the inhibitory properties of recalcitrant organic pollutants the compliance to meet discharge standard and the typical variable composition of industrial wastewaters recently extensive research efforts have been invested to develop effective and affordable advanced oxidation processes aops to remove recalcitrant pollutants in industrial wastewaters bansal et al 2018 cai et al 2021a cai et al 2021b cai et al 2020a cai et al 2020b deng et al 2021 fan et al 2017 jothinathan et al 2021 liang et al 2018 ling et al 2020 aops typically involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh for oxidizing most organic compounds without restriction to specific classes or groups fluidized bed reactor fenton fbr fenton is a type of aops it is modified from classic fenton by conducting fenton reaction in a fluidized bed reactor boonrattanakij et al 2011 the fluidized materials used in fbr fenton system are defined as carriers which provide available sites for iron hydroxides crystallization and precipitation and hence reduce the sludge production in fenton reaction our previous studies demonstrated fbr fenton process to be a cost effective solution for treating one typical recalcitrant industrial wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc cai et al 2020b reverse osmosis ro is widely used for water reclamation in many industry sectors roc is the reject stream that contains the impurities from ro feed at significantly higher concentrations these impurities mainly consist of soluble salts nutrients micropollutants and recalcitrant organics bagastyo et al 2011 disposal of roc without adequate treatment may impose negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystem water potability and agriculture produce it is important to develop effective roc treatment technology for direct discharge purpose to further enhance fbr fenton process performance for roc treatment our research team worked on carrier selection and identified granular activated carbon gac to be the better carrier compared to construction sand and zeolite fbr fenton process with gac carrier fbr fenton gac could enhance the organics removal efficiency in roc by 30 cai et al 2020a while the potential of fbr fenton gac process is undoubted equal success cannot be claimed at industrial scale among the main constraints preventing a wider adoption of fbr fenton gac process the lack of strategies for expanding its application in treating different types of industrial wastewater and fluidized bed reactor scale up are the major ones in this context reliable models would facilitate technology scale up by simulating the fbr fenton gac process and predicting its performance at large scale applications organics removal in fbr fenton gac can be affected by several process parameters including fe2 dosage h2o2 dosage ph and hydraulic retention time hrt as fbr fenton gac is conducted in a two phases liquid solid reactor the mass transfer rate between phases and reactor hydrodynamics can also have significant impacts on the process kinetics ebrahimi et al 2019 this multiphase system is highly complex in nature thus adopting an accurate numerical tool for performance prediction is paramount for its successful scale up to the best of our knowledge kinetic models for describing the full chemical dynamics in fbr fenton gac process have not been developed it is also very challenging to numerically solve the mass and momentum conservation equations in conjunction with more than 20 reactions involved in fbr fenton gac process computational fluid dynamics cfd is a suitable tool for simulating this liquid solid reaction system with appropriate boundary and initial conditions cfd technique can integrate reaction kinetics and reactor hydrodynamics into one model framework for describing both physical and chemical changes within the reactor alpert et al 2010 cfd analysis can also effectively reduce the workload and cost required for reactor scale up several studies have successfully implemented cfd technique to simulate the advanced oxidation processes for their performance prediction and reactor scale up alpert et al 2010 chuang et al 2016 ebrahimi et al 2019 mohajerani et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 tisa et al 2014 ebrahimi et al 2019 adopted cfd method to simulate dye removal in fbr fenton pyrite process the study compared the dye removal in the fluidized bed and stirred tank reactor the simulation results showed the turbulent mixing was important for free radicals generation and the fluidized bed reactor achieved higher dye removal performance tisa et al 2014 focused on cfd modeling of fbr fenton goethite process for phenol wastewater treatment the overall total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was successfully predicted with three time reactor scale up toc variation profile and hydrodynamic characteristics can still be accurately attained indicating the potential of cfd modeling for process scale up as of now comprehensive hydrodynamic and chemical evaluations of fbr fenton gac system are limited integrated cfd kinetic simulation of fbr fenton gac for investigating radicals generation and organics removal has not been performed the present study aims to develop a cfd kinetic model framework for numerically describing hydrodynamic and kinetic phenomena occurred in the fbr fenton gac system the parameter chemical oxygen demand cod was used to represent bulk recalcitrant organics in roc and cod removal efficiency reflected the organics abatement performance of fbr fenton gac process the cfd kinetic model was firstly validated against the experimental data obtained from roc treatment under different operation conditions hydrodynamic conditions such as solid volume fraction and liquid velocity were evaluated with the model simulation effects of superficial liquid velocity on fbr fenton gac system s hydrodynamics and kinetics were also assessed to have a clear picture of how the iron ions dynamics h2o2 decomposition and oh production evolved in the reaction system temporal and spatial variations of each chemical species were evaluated with the developed model the cfd kinetic model can be used to simulate fbr fenton gac process for treating different recalcitrant industrial wastewaters understanding the interplay between process and reactor variables and predicting the process performance the present study could contribute a reliable model framework for design optimization and scale up of fbr fenton gac technology 2

effluents were treated by a mf ro system for producing high quality reclaimed water table s1 summarizes the characteristics of raw roc samples collected over a 1 year period roc samples were stored at 4 c and brought to room temperature prior to usage in experiments 2 2 fbr fenton gac process batch fbr fenton gac reactor was built of an acrylic column with a diameter of 7 cm and a height of 78 cm fig 2a a water distributor consisted of 3 mm orifices plate and 0 4 mm sieve was fixed at the reactor bottom to homogenize the inflow carriers were packed above the sieve up to 20 cm height in batch experiments roc water ph was firstly adjusted to the optimal value by adding 5 m h2so4 solution an inlet pump was subsequently turned on to fill up the column reactor with roc water to achieve satisfactory carrier fluidization a circulation pump was used to continuously pump the roc water out from the top of the reactor and back to the reactor bottom to initiate the fenton reaction certain amounts of fenton reagents 5 h2o2 0 2 m feso4 7h2o stock solutions were dosed one shot into the reactor the optimum ph condition and fenton reagents dosages were determined in our previous study cai et al 2020b with reaction ph of 3 10 mm h2o2 and 1 25 mm fe2 along the 60 min roc treatment 10 ml of roc samples were withdrawn every 10 min collected roc samples were neutralized with 0 5 m naoh solution added with 1 μl of 2000 5000 unit ml catalase for h2o2 quenching after 2 hours settling the supernatants were collected for subsequent water quality analysis all experiments were conducted at a constant temperature of 25 c cod and 5 day bod tests were conducted for roc samples in accordance with apha standard method 5220d 5210b 1998 2 5 times dilution with milliq water was performed for each roc sample to overcome the interference of high chloride concentration a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa was used to determine the cod level in roc 3 cfd modeling 3 1 governing equations in this study two fluid model tfm and kinetic theory of granular flow were used to simulate the flow behavior of gac particles in a liquid solid fluidized bed reactor in the tfm model volume of each cell was shared by the liquid and solid phases and the continuous equation was expressed using eq 1 1 ρ p i α p i t ρ p i v p i α p i x i 0 where ρ kg m3 represents the density of each phase α m3 m3 represents the volume fraction occupied by each phase and the subscript p l and p s represents liquid phase and solid phase respectively the momentum equations for liquid and solid phases were expressed using eq 2 and eq 3 2 ρ l i α l i v l i t ρ l i α l i v l i v l i x i α l i p x i τ l i j x i ρ l α l g i β l s v s v l 3 ρ s i α s i v s i t ρ s i α s i v s i v s i x i α s i p x i p s x i

and gradient of velocity in order to model the collision between particles the granular temperature φs k was introduced in the kinetic theory of granular flow and calculated by eq 4 4 3 2 ρ α s t ρ α v i s x i x j k s s x τ s i j v s i x j γ ϑ l s the four terms on the right side of the equation represent the diffusion of granular energy the generated term from stress of solid phase the dissipation due to particle collision and the energy exchange between two phases respectively drag force played an important role in the momentum exchange between liquid and solid phases due to the velocity differences the gidaspow model gidaspow 1994 was used in this study for the drag based on the volume fraction of the liquid phase detailed information of each term included in the governing equations is summarized in table s2 3 2 species conservation the key processes involved in fbr fenton gac system include homogeneous fenton process gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic process the governing equation for evaluating chemical species dynamics was expressed using eq 5 ansys inc 2013 mohajerani et al 2010 5 α l c z l t α l v l i c z l x i x i d z α p i c z l x i s f e n t o n s a d

represent the overall reaction kinetics of chemical species participated in homogeneous fenton gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction respectively during the homogeneous fenton process fe2 and h2o2 are the fenton reagents for initiating oh generation meanwhile fe2 is converted to fe3 fe2 regeneration could also occur via the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 oh plays an important role in organics removal in this modeling work cod was used to represent the bulk organic matters to react with oh table s3 summarizes the reactions and kinetics between these chemical species involved in homogeneous fenton process our previous study found that in fbr fenton gac system gac adsorption contributed to the overall organics removal and the adsorption followed the langmuir isotherm which was expressed using eq 6 6 c c o d e q e c c o d e q m a x 1 k l q m a x where qmax mg g represents gac s maximum adsorption capacity ccod e mg l and qe mg g represent the organics concentration in the aqueous solution and gac surface at equilibrium respectively the gac adsorption kinetics was numerically described with the langmuir kinetic model as expressed in eq 7 plazinski et al 2009 7 q t k l c c o d q m a x q k l b q where kl l mg 1 min 1 is the langmuir constant and b l mg 1 is the equilibrium constant kl of 0 062 l mg 1 min 1 and b of 0 034 l mg 1 were previously determined from the langmuir isotherm with batch gac adsorption studies activated carbon ac could act as an electron transfer catalyst for h2o2 activation and radicals would be formed on ac surface through the following reactions kimura and miyamoto 1994 8 ac h 2 o 2 a c o h oh 9 a c h 2 o 2 ac h ho 2 h2o2 decomposition rate was used to represent the kinetics of gac h2o2 catalytic reaction according to huang et al 2003 in this catalytic process h2o2 decomposition mainly depends on h2o2 concentration and it was described by using a modified langmuir hinshelwood rate model eq 10 10 r h d h 2 o 2 d t h 2 o 2 0 h 2 o 2 t t t 0 k gac h 2 o 2 1 k h h 2 o 2 where k gac is 0 2 10 3 min 1 and k h is 0 13 10 3 mm 1 both k gac and k h represent the characteristic constants of gac particles they were experimental determined by adopting the method described in huang et al 2003 3 3 simulation conditions the structured and unstructured grids were generated to simulate the fluidized bed reactor fig s1 the mesh independence was examined using three different grids 19800 32000 and 48000 it was found that model with relatively higher mesh resolution 32000 and 48000 fit better with the experimental data with deviates less than 2 predicted cod removal efficiency from 32000 grid was similar with the result derived from 48000 grid t test p 0 05 thus considering less calculation time and energy requirement mesh with 32000 grid was used in this study the simulation was carried out with ansys fluent 20 0 installed in a high performance computing system the transient governing equations were solved using phase coupled simple scheme the first order upwind and quick spatial discretization method were selected to obtain the simulation results the bottom inlet of the reactor was set as the mass flow rate inlet in the simulation wastewater flowed out from the top outlet and was recirculated by a pump into the bottom inlet which formed a loop for this reactor the function of the recirculation pump was modelled by user defined function udf code which followed mass conservation in the fluent the reactor wall was defined as no slip wall the gac particles were packed in the bottom part of the reactor with an initial height of 0 2 m although gaseous co2 was produced during organics oxidation the small amount of co2 hardly affected the flow dynamics in the reactor and its impacts was ignored ebrahimi et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 cfd kinetic model validation by combining reactor hydrodynamic condition with reaction kinetics occurred fbr fenton gac process fig s2 the developed cfd kinetic model was firstly adopted to predict cod removal efficiency in fbr fenton gac system to validate the model performance batch fbr fenton gac experiments were carried out to investigate cod removal in roc under four different experimental conditions experimental cod removal data and model predicted cod removal efficiency under each experimental condition are summarized in table s4 fig 1 a illustrates the comparison between modelled cod removal efficiency and experimental data and their best linear fits under each condition are shown in fig s3 temporal cod variation at the fbr fenton gac reactor outlet position was used as the reference point for model validation and the root mean square error rmse was used as the error function to gauge the model performance despite the complexity of the fbr fenton gac reaction system the developed cfd kinetic model was able to accurately predict the cod removal efficiency in roc for all selected experimental conditions the rmse was 1 25 1 03 0 92 and 1 60 for condition 1 2 3 and 4 respectively and the corresponding r2 value of the best liner fit was 0 997 0 997 0 997 and 0 999 respectively more batch experiments were subsequently carried out to monitor cod removal in roc with three individual processes including fbr fenton sand process gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction fig 1b illustrates the simulated and experimental cod removal profiles in different roc treatment processes best linear fits between the model perdition and experimental data are shown in fig s4 fenton reaction kinetics were applied for fbr fenton sand process modeling the overall rmse between the predicted and experimental cod removal efficiency was 0 91 and the r2 value of the linear fit was 0 995 this accurate model prediction implied that fbr fenton sand process can be numerically described with homogenous fenton kinetics our previous study also demonstrated homogeneous fenton process to be the dominate organics removal mechanism in fbr fenton sand process both sand adsorption and sand h2o2 catalytic reaction were found to be negligible for organics removal in roc cai et al 2020a gac h2o2 process modeling consisted of gac h2o2 catalytic reaction and gac adsorption kinetics the model outputs were in a successful fit with the experimental data with rmse and r2 value of 1 30 and 0 997 respectively this confirmed that gac bed could effectively initiate h2o2 decomposition for oh generation and subsequent organics oxidation in the case of gac adsorption the model predicted cod removal in roc fit well with the experimental data with a rmse value of 0 98 and a correlation coefficient r2 value of 0 987 this implied that the adsorption behavior of packed gac bed for organics removal in roc can be accurately described with langmuir kinetic model along the 1 hour roc treatment model predicted cod removal efficiency achieved in fbr fenton gac process and homogeneous fenton reaction was 71 2 and 41 4 respectively cod removal in gac h2o2 process was predicted to be 35 4 as gac adsorption can contribute 24 4 cod removal in roc cod removal attributed to gac h2o2 catalytic reaction was predicted to be 11 based on these modeling results in fbr fenton gac system the contribution to bulk cod reduction decreased in the order of homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption gac h2o2 catalytic reaction 4 2 hydrodynamic evaluation 4 2 1 solid volume fraction and liquid velocity to investigate the hydrodynamic conditions in fbr fenton gac system the solid volume fraction and liquid velocity were predicted by cfd simulation at a superficial liquid velocity of 0 0183 m s fig 2 b and 2c show the snapshots of fbr fenton gac system under stable operation and gac bed volume fraction distribution in the column reactor once the quasi steady state was reached gac particles were uniformly distributed in the fluidized bed a clear interface layer between the gac bed and the liquid phase can be identified on the upper region of the interface layer the liquid volume fraction was 100 and there was no free floating gac particles scattered in the liquid phase under the interface layer a stable solid volume fraction of 34 was achieved at the quasi steady state distribution contour of liquid velocity along the radial direction and the radial liquid velocity at different reactor heights are shown in fig 3 a 2 cm height plot is at the water inlet 15 cm height plot is within the fluidized bed 25 cm height plot is right below the interface layer 35 cm and 50 cm height plots both represent the radical liquid velocity profiles above the interface layer simulation results demonstrate that liquid velocity of lower magnitude was near the reactor wall and higher liquid velocity was in the center region highest liquid velocity was observed at the water inlet where more energy was derived from the inflow in the fluidized bed and interface layer the liquid velocity showed an increasing trend from the wall to a maximum value and further decreased until the reactor center this liquid flow pattern indicates the gac particles flow down at the bed center and up between the reactor wall and the center gac bed fluidization was in a pattern with two pairs of counter rotating recirculation cells limtrakul et al 2005 in the upper liquid region the liquid velocity distribution was static near the wall and more active in the reactor center this phenomenon is due to the intrinsic viscosity of the reactor wall mccabe et al 2005 thus a parabolic like distribution of liquid velocity was observed in the liquid phase fig 3b shows the axial liquid velocity distribution contour and its profile at the reactor center x r 0 at lower axial position attributed to higher energy input from the inflow the liquid velocity drastically increased from 0 0200 to 0 0350 m s afterwards the center liquid velocity gradually dropped along the gac bed to 0 0100 m s as the liquid flowed through the fluidized bed a rapid liquid velocity increase to 0 0230 m s was attained due to less resistance from the solid particles the hydrodynamic modeling results suggested that under stable operation condition gac particles were uniformly suspended within the solid phase moderately uniform liquid flow field was also attained in the upper liquid region with a center liquid velocity ranging from 0 0230 to 0 0180 m s 4 2 2 effect of superficial liquid velocity in a liquid solid fluidized bed reactor higher superficial liquid velocity indicates larger amount of energy input resulting in higher degree of liquid solid mixing and bed expansion limtrakul et al 2005 higher solid bed expansion rate could enhance the mass transfer rate and reaction kinetics chen et al 2015 adopted fbr fenton process to treat flax wastewater it was found that within 100 min reaction time 50 bed expansion rate had significantly higher decolorization performance as compared to 20 bed expansion rate to assess the effects of superficial liquid velocity on fbr fenton gac system s hydrodynamic conditions and reaction kinetics the validated cfd kinetic model was adopted to simulate gac bed expansion height and cod removal efficiency with different liquid velocities fig 4 a illustrates the distribution contour of solid volume fraction at four different liquid velocities the gac bed was expanded uniformly across the column reactor for all the cases with an increase in liquid velocity from 0 0165 to 0 0218 m s the bed expansion height increased axially from 22 to 29 cm the static height of the gac bed was 19 cm and the corresponding bed expansion rate increased from 18 to 51 with higher liquid velocity it was also found that a higher superficial liquid velocity resulted in a lower solid volume fraction the predicted gac volume fraction within the fluidization region showed a decreasing trend from 37 to 29 indicating higher extent of solid circulation in the fluidized bed it was also reported that the superficial liquid velocity can be used as a direct parameter for fine tuning the solid holdup in a liquid solid fluidized bed reactor tan et al 2016 temporal cod variation at the reactor outlet position with different superficial liquid velocities was further evaluated by implementing the reaction kinetics predicted cod removal efficiencies along the 1 hour roc treatment under all given conditions are presented in fig 4b the modeling results showed a slight increment in the final cod removal efficiency from 70 1 to 73 6 table s5 with an increase in the liquid velocity from 0 0165 to 0 0218 m s similar cod removal efficiencies were obtained in all the four cases from the foregoing discussion the superficial liquid velocity seemed to have higher impact on the hydrodynamic conditions such as bed expansion and solid volume fraction its impact on fbr fenton gac reaction kinetics was negligible as insignificant enhancement on cod removal efficiency was observed with higher superficial liquid velocity 4 3 chemical evaluation the integrated cfd kinetic model is able to solve the momentum equations in conjunction with the mass balances between different chemical species thus both temporal and spatial variations of each chemical species inside the reactor can be predicted to better understand the reactions kinetics in fbr fenton gac system the dynamics between fe2 and fe3 h2o2 decomposition and oh production were simulated with defined operation conditions of 10 mm h2o2 1 25 mm feso4 and a superficial liquid velocity of 0 0183 m s 4 3 1 fe2 and fe3 dynamics fig 5 a shows the overall fe2 consumption rate variation and its distribution contour at different reaction times highest fe2 consumption rate was attained at the beginning of the roc treatment implying the fenton reaction was initiated once the ferrous and h2o2 solutions were injected into the reactor at 2 min the predicted fe2 consumption rate was 3 0 10 6 m s it drastically decreased to 3 8 10 7 m s within the first 10 min and became minimal from 30 to 60 min the corresponding fe3 production rate variation and its distribution contour along the 1 hour roc treatment are shown in fig 5b accordingly highest fe3 production rate was attained in the beginning of the reaction and the 2 min ferric ion production rate was 3 0 10 6 m s similar with fe2 consumption significant fe3 production was only observed within the first 10 min simulated fe2 and fe3 concentration variation profiles fig s5 revealed that the overall fe2 concentration decreased from 1 25 to 0 13 mm in 30 min and remained a constant afterwards the overall fe3 concentration was predicted to increase from 0 to 1 12 mm in 30 min and there was no ferric ion production observed from 30 to 60 min the fe2 and fe3 dynamics indicated that in the fbr fenton gac reaction system fe2 was converted to fe3 over a very short period after the fenton reaction has been initiated according to fe2 consumption rate distribution contour fe2 consumption above the interface layer was predicted to be faster compared to that in the fluidized bed region likewise fe3 production rate distribution contour demonstrated faster fe3 formation in the upper liquid region this can be explained by the fact that the reactions converting ferrous ion to ferric ion r1 to r3 table s3 predominantly occurred in the homogenous liquid phase since liquid phase occupied higher volume fraction above the interface layer the reactions r1 to r3 were more active in the upper liquid region in addition as r1 is the main reaction involved in homogenous fenton process for oh generation cai et al 2020a it was concluded that in fbr fenton gac system oh generation attributed to homogenous fenton reaction mainly occurred in the upper liquid region as the fe2 concentration gradually declined till 30 min fe2 production was observed in the fluidized bed region with an average rate of 1 8 10 7 m s and the corresponding average fe3 consumption rate within the gac bed was predicted to be 1 8 10 7 m s this was due to the ferrous ion regeneration involved in the fenton process r4 to r7 table s3 at later stage of the roc treatment homogenous fenton process ceased as the dynamics between fe2 and fe3 remained to be negligible 4 3 2 h2o2 decomposition the overall h2o2 decomposition rate in fbr fenton gac reactor as well as its distribution contour were also simulated along the reaction time as shown in fig 6 h2o2 was decomposed with highest rate at the beginning of the reaction from 2 to 10 min the overall h2o2 decomposition rate sharply declined from 4 55 10 6 to 1 9 10 6 m s and gradually decreased to 8 06 10 7 m s till 60 min in the upper liquid region average h2o2 decomposition rate at 2 min was 2 6 10 6 m s which was same with the average fe2 consumption rate observed in the liquid phase this implied the dominance of homogenous fenton reaction r1 table s3 above the interface layer the 2 min fe2 consumption rate in fluidized bed region was predicted to be 2 68 10 6 m s while much faster h2o2 decomposition was attained in the same region with an average rate of 4 5 10 6 m s this could be due to an extra h2o2 decomposition process occurred in the gac bed and it was reported that gac particles could effectively induce catalytic decomposition of h2o2 molecules for oh generation georgi and kopinke 2005 huang et al 2003 according to the contour plotted at different reaction times h2o2 decomposition rate was observed to be constantly higher in the fluidized bed region this further confirmed the occurrence of gac h2o2 catalytic reaction in gac bed in addition along the reaction time h2o2 decomposition rate in gac bed showed a mild decreasing to 2 6 10 6 m s 1 5 10 6 m s and 1 0 10 6 m s at 10min 30min and 60min respectively however the h2o2 decomposition rate in liquid phase reduced drastically to 1 6 10 7 m s at 60 min this phenomenon denoted that the liquid phase homogenous fenton reaction diminished at the later stage of roc treatment as both h2o2 and fe2 consumption rate became negligible while in the fluidized bed region solid gac particles could continuously decompose h2o2 molecules for producing oh 4 3 3 hydroxyl radical production roc treatment with fbr fenton gac homogenous fenton and gac h2o2 process was separately simulated with the developed model instantaneous oh concentrations presented in the three individual processes were predicted and presented in fig 7 in fbr fenton gac process highest oh concentration of 1 34 10 12 m was attained at the initial stage as the reaction continued oh concentration dropped to 2 85 10 13 m at 20 min and slowly increased to 3 39 10 13 m till 60 min a similar sharp drop within the first 20 min was also observed in homogenous fenton process where oh concentration decreased from 4 95 10 13 to 3 66 10 14 m and remained stable afterwards in the first 20 min oh concentration in gac h2o2 process was negligible as the produced oh was consumed for organics oxidation from 20 to 60 min the predicted oh concentration slowly increased to 4 07 10 14 m during the earlier stage of roc treatment oh concentration in fbr fenton gac process was constantly 2 7 times higher than that in homogenous fenton process this is attributed to extra oh generation from the gac h2o2 catalytic process it was found that both fbr fenton gac and homogenous fenton processes obtained a drastically reduction of oh concentration from 0 to 20 min revealing continuous consumption of oh for organics oxidation and diminishment of fenton reaction along the treatment process it was also noted that after 20 min both fe2 consumption rate and fe3 production rate became negligible and the amount of oh generated from fenton reaction was also expected to be insignificant within the same time span this denoted that in the two reaction systems fenton reaction was terminated due to fully consumption of fe2 ions once the fenton reaction abated majority of the produced oh was contributed by gac h2o2 catalytic reaction since a slow increase of oh concentration from 20 to 60 min was observed in both fbr fenton gac and gac h2o2 processes the simulation results were also validated with our previous oh exposure study with pcba decomposition cai et al 2020a during the 5 min pcba decomposition in the fbr fenton gac system the total oh exposure was measured as 2 891 10 10 m s and the corresponding average oh concentration was 9 637 10 13 m according to the developed model the predicted average oh concentration within the first 5 minutes in fbr fenton gac process was 9 39 10 13 m which correlated well with the previous experimental data the distribution contours of oh production rate in homogenous fenton process and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction are plotted in the panel a and b of fig 8 respectively at 2 min average oh production rate in homogenous fenton process was 2 33 10 6 m s it remarkably reduced to 5 77 10 7 m s at 10 min and slowly decreased till the end of roc treatment this oh production rate variation was similar with the simulated fe2 consumption rate and fe3 production rate profiles where faster reaction rates were attained for all the three chemical species within the first 10 min this further confirmed that fenton reaction r1 table s3 was initiated over a very short period and it was the main process contributing to oh generation at the early stage of fbr fenton gac reaction according to the 2 min contour in fig 8a oh production in homogeneous fenton process was generally uniformly distributed in the column reactor though the upper liquid region obtained a bit higher oh production rate this could be due to higher liquid volume fraction attained in the upper liquid region as the fenton reaction predominantly occurred in the liquid phase from 10 min onward when the fenton reaction started to diminish in the column reactor slightly higher oh production rate was observed in the gac bed this can be accounted to ferrous ion regeneration between h2o2 and fe3 as both fe2 production and fe3 consumption were found in the fluidized bed region the reaction r5 table s3 involved in ferrous ion regeneration could contribute to higher oh production rate in gac bed at the later stage of the reaction as shown in fig 8b oh production in gac h2o2 catalytic process uniformly occurred in the fluidized bed region and no catalytic oh production was observed in the upper liquid region from 2 to 60 min the oh production rate followed a decreasing trend from 1 21 10 6 to 0 60 10 6 m s this phenomenon agrees well with the solid distribution contour in the column reactor gac particles were only evenly circulated inside the fluidized bed region no gac particles were floated in the upper liquid region as the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 molecules must take place by contacting with gac particles considerably high oh production rate was only obtained in the gac fluidized bed region 4 4 organics removal in roc with a fenton reagents dosage of 10 mm h2o2 1 25 mm feso4 and a superficial liquid velocity of 0 0183 m s the cod concentration at different reaction times were predicted with the validated model as shown in fig 9 during the 1 hour roc treatment the average cod concentration in fbr fenton gac reactor was predicted to reduce from 122 to 35 mg l simulation contours of cod mass fraction at different reaction times are also plotted in fig 9 where the cod mass fraction in the fluidized bed region was observed to be constantly lower than that in the upper liquid region this implied that synergistic oh production from homogenous fenton and gac h2o2 catalytic process promoted the organics removal in gac bed due to its extremely high reactivity the produced oh would be mostly consumed in situ for organics oxidation r18 table s3 rather than moving upward to the liquid phase region ebrahimi et al 2019 gac particles could also contribute to organics removal by the adsorption process hence lower cod concentration was attained in the fluidized bed while it was also noted that at 2 min the difference between average cod concentrations in solid and liquid phases was only 1 6 mg l and the difference further reduced to lower than 0 2 mg l after 10 min this observation also denoted good mixing condition inside the column reactor although more effective organics removal occurred in the fluidized bed region the cod abatement kinetics in different reaction processes were further quantified with the cfd kinetic model and its variation along the reaction time were illustrated in fig 10 a the overall cod degradation rate showed a decreasing trend within the first 10 min and it gradually reduced till the end of fbr fenton gac reaction the overall cod degradation rate was predicted to be 2 05 10 6 m s 8 61 10 7 m s and 2 93 10 7 m s at 2 min 10 min and 60 min respectively cod oxidation by oh obtained significantly higher degradation rate during the early period of the reaction the cod oxidation rate greatly decreased from 1 83 10 6 to 5 65 10 7 m s from 2 to 10 min and stabilized at around 2 60 10 7 m s afterwards cod adsorption by the gac bed retained lower rate of 2 59 10 7 to 1 18 10 7 m s along the reaction time within the 60 min roc treatment fbr fenton gac process achieved a total cod removal efficiency of 72 42 3 of cod was removed by oh oxidation and 29 7 of cod removal was attributable to gac adsorption the contour plots in fig 10b demonstrated that cod oxidation by oh took place in both liquid and solid phases and higher cod oxidation rates were constantly achieved in the fluidized bed region this is owing to faster oh production in gac bed resulted from the synergistic effect of homogenous fenton process and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction fig 10c exhibits that along the 1 hour roc treatment only the solid phase gac bed continuously contributed to cod removal through the adsorption process as a result in fbr fenton gac reaction system organics removal in the fluidized bed region was induced by three reaction mechanisms including fenton process gac h2o2 process and gac adsorption both fenton and gac h2o2 process achieved effective cod oxidation with oh generation in the upper liquid region fenton reaction was the only mechanism that contributed to oh generation and organics oxidation 5 conclusion the findings of this study suggested the integrated cfd kinetic model framework to be a promising numerical tool for simulating the fbr fenton gac process the model was able to accurately predict the process performance by considering the interactions between the process and reactor variables a comprehensive investigation on the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the fbr fenton gac system was also carried out with model simulation homogenous fenton process gac h2o2 catalytic process and gac adsorption were validated as the key organics removal mechanisms in the fbr fenton gac system instantaneous temporal and spatial prediction of the chemical species such as fe2 fe3 h2o2 oh and cod were also achieved by the developed model this model performance would contribute greatly to the future real time process control and system automation the presented modelling study is not case specific as the model was developed on the basis of the full reaction mechanisms in fbr fenton gac process it can be applied to simulate the treatment of other industrial wastewaters though fbr fenton technologies were reported to be effective for treating different industrial wastewaters such as paper mill wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater cai et al 2021a process upscaling is still the key bottleneck hampering its full scale applications the cfd kinetic model can be adopted to predict and optimize the fbr fenton gac process in larger scale applications furthermore cfd is a well known technique for effectively reducing the workload and cost required for reactor upscaling the focuses of future studies are mainly about development validation of continuous flow process model model scale up and its validation in larger scale industrial wastewater treatment process declaration of

16702,an integrated computational fluid dynamics cfd kinetic model framework was developed to numerically describe the hydrodynamic and kinetic phenomena in a liquid solid two phases fluidized bed reactor fenton granular activated carbon fbr fenton gac system the model obtained excellent accuracy for predicting chemical oxygen demand cod removal in reverse osmosis concentrate roc treatment under different operation conditions hydrodynamic evaluation demonstrated that under the quasi steady state the gac particles were uniformly circulated in the bed region with two pairs of counter rotating recirculation cells and a clear interface layer formed between the solid and the liquid phases superficial liquid velocity highly affected the fluidized bed expansion and solid volume fraction while its impact on the overall cod removal efficiency was negligible chemical evaluation revealed that gac h2o2 catalytic reaction enhanced the oh production in fbr fenton gac process by 2 7 folds as compared to homogenous fenton process fenton reaction mainly occurred in the upper liquid region and its kinetics for oh generation significantly diminished by 75 within the first 10 min gac h2o2 reaction took place in the fluidized bed region for continuous oh generation with a relatively stable rate from 1 21 10 6 to 0 60 10 6 m s along the roc treatment with fbr fenton gac process the simulated cod degradation rate decreased along the reaction time with 2 05 10 6 m s and 2 93 10 7 m s at 2 min and 60 min respectively faster cod removal was attained in the fluidized bed region due

wastewaters generated from papermill cork boiling petrochemical textile and pharmaceutical industries contain high levels of recalcitrant organic pollutants discharge of inadequately treated industrial wastewater might cause severe chemical pollution of the receiving water bodies as well as pose adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems discharge of industrial wastewater is regulated by stringent and specific guidelines while industrial wastewater treatment is challenging due to the inhibitory properties of recalcitrant organic pollutants the compliance to meet discharge standard and the typical variable composition of industrial wastewaters recently extensive research efforts have been invested to develop effective and affordable advanced oxidation processes aops to remove recalcitrant pollutants in industrial wastewaters bansal et al 2018 cai et al 2021a cai et al 2021b cai et al 2020a cai et al 2020b deng et al 2021 fan et al 2017 jothinathan et al 2021 liang et al 2018 ling et al 2020 aops typically involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh for oxidizing most organic compounds without restriction to specific classes or groups fluidized bed reactor fenton fbr fenton is a type of aops it is modified from classic fenton by conducting fenton reaction in a fluidized bed reactor boonrattanakij et al 2011 the fluidized materials used in fbr fenton system are defined as carriers which provide available sites for iron hydroxides crystallization and precipitation and hence reduce the sludge production in fenton reaction our previous studies demonstrated fbr fenton process to be a cost effective solution for treating one typical recalcitrant industrial wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate roc cai et al 2020b reverse osmosis ro is widely used for water reclamation in many industry sectors roc is the reject stream that contains the impurities from ro feed at significantly higher concentrations these impurities mainly consist of soluble salts nutrients micropollutants and recalcitrant organics bagastyo et al 2011 disposal of roc without adequate treatment may impose negative impacts on the aquatic ecosystem water potability and agriculture produce it is important to develop effective roc treatment technology for direct discharge purpose to further enhance fbr fenton process performance for roc treatment our research team worked on carrier selection and identified granular activated carbon gac to be the better carrier compared to construction sand and zeolite fbr fenton process with gac carrier fbr fenton gac could enhance the organics removal efficiency in roc by 30 cai et al 2020a while the potential of fbr fenton gac process is undoubted equal success cannot be claimed at industrial scale among the main constraints preventing a wider adoption of fbr fenton gac process the lack of strategies for expanding its application in treating different types of industrial wastewater and fluidized bed reactor scale up are the major ones in this context reliable models would facilitate technology scale up by simulating the fbr fenton gac process and predicting its performance at large scale applications organics removal in fbr fenton gac can be affected by several process parameters including fe2 dosage h2o2 dosage ph and hydraulic retention time hrt as fbr fenton gac is conducted in a two phases liquid solid reactor the mass transfer rate between phases and reactor hydrodynamics can also have significant impacts on the process kinetics ebrahimi et al 2019 this multiphase system is highly complex in nature thus adopting an accurate numerical tool for performance prediction is paramount for its successful scale up to the best of our knowledge kinetic models for describing the full chemical dynamics in fbr fenton gac process have not been developed it is also very challenging to numerically solve the mass and momentum conservation equations in conjunction with more than 20 reactions involved in fbr fenton gac process computational fluid dynamics cfd is a suitable tool for simulating this liquid solid reaction system with appropriate boundary and initial conditions cfd technique can integrate reaction kinetics and reactor hydrodynamics into one model framework for describing both physical and chemical changes within the reactor alpert et al 2010 cfd analysis can also effectively reduce the workload and cost required for reactor scale up several studies have successfully implemented cfd technique to simulate the advanced oxidation processes for their performance prediction and reactor scale up alpert et al 2010 chuang et al 2016 ebrahimi et al 2019 mohajerani et al 2010 santoro et al 2017 tisa et al 2014 ebrahimi et al 2019 adopted cfd method to simulate dye removal in fbr fenton pyrite process the study compared the dye removal in the fluidized bed and stirred tank reactor the simulation results showed the turbulent mixing was important for free radicals generation and the fluidized bed reactor achieved higher dye removal performance tisa et al 2014 focused on cfd modeling of fbr fenton goethite process for phenol wastewater treatment the overall total organic carbon toc removal efficiency was successfully predicted with three time reactor scale up toc variation profile and hydrodynamic characteristics can still be accurately attained indicating the potential of cfd modeling for process scale up as of now comprehensive hydrodynamic and chemical evaluations of fbr fenton gac system are limited integrated cfd kinetic simulation of fbr fenton gac for investigating radicals generation and organics removal has not been performed the present study aims to develop a cfd kinetic model framework for numerically describing hydrodynamic and kinetic phenomena occurred in the fbr fenton gac system the parameter chemical oxygen demand cod was used to represent bulk recalcitrant organics in roc and cod removal efficiency reflected the organics abatement performance of fbr fenton gac process the cfd kinetic model was firstly validated against the experimental data obtained from roc treatment under different operation conditions hydrodynamic conditions such as solid volume fraction and liquid velocity were evaluated with the model simulation effects of superficial liquid velocity on fbr fenton gac system s hydrodynamics and kinetics were also assessed to have a clear picture of how the iron ions dynamics h2o2 decomposition and oh production evolved in the reaction system temporal and spatial variations of each chemical species were evaluated with the developed model the cfd kinetic model can be used to simulate fbr fenton gac process for treating different recalcitrant industrial wastewaters understanding the interplay between process and reactor variables and predicting the process performance the present study could contribute a reliable model framework for design optimization and scale up of fbr fenton gac technology 2

carrier were washed with distilled water and dried at 70 c prior to usage in experiments roc samples were collected from a local industrial wastewater treatment plant where the biological secondary effluents were treated by a mf ro system for producing high quality reclaimed water table s1 summarizes the characteristics of raw roc samples collected over a 1 year period roc samples were stored at 4 c and brought to room temperature prior to usage in experiments 2 2 fbr fenton gac process batch fbr fenton gac reactor was built of an acrylic column with a diameter of 7 cm and a height of 78 cm fig 2a a water distributor consisted of 3 mm orifices plate and 0 4 mm sieve was fixed at the reactor bottom to homogenize the inflow carriers were packed above the sieve up to 20 cm height in batch experiments roc water ph was firstly adjusted to the optimal value by adding 5 m h2so4 solution an inlet pump was subsequently turned on to fill up the column reactor with roc water to achieve satisfactory carrier fluidization a circulation pump was used to continuously pump the roc water out from the top of the reactor and back to the reactor bottom to initiate the fenton reaction certain amounts of fenton reagents 5 h2o2 0 2 m feso4 7h2o stock solutions were dosed one shot into the reactor the optimum ph condition and fenton reagents dosages were determined in our previous study cai et al 2020b with reaction ph of 3 10 mm h2o2 and 1 25 mm fe2 along the 60 min roc treatment 10 ml of roc samples were withdrawn every 10 min collected roc samples were neutralized with 0 5 m naoh solution added with 1 μl of 2000 5000 unit ml catalase for h2o2 quenching after 2 hours settling the supernatants were collected for subsequent water quality analysis all experiments were conducted at a constant temperature of 25 c cod and 5 day bod tests were conducted for roc samples in accordance with apha standard method 5220d 5210b 1998 2 5 times dilution with milliq water was performed for each roc sample to overcome the interference of high chloride concentration a spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa was used to determine the cod level in roc 3 cfd modeling 3 1 governing equations in this study two fluid model tfm and kinetic theory of granular flow were used to simulate the flow behavior of gac particles in a liquid solid fluidized bed reactor in the tfm model volume of each cell was shared by the liquid and solid phases and the continuous equation was expressed using eq 1 1 ρ p i α p i t ρ p i v p i α p i x i 0 where ρ kg m3 represents the density of each phase α m3 m3 represents the volume fraction occupied by each phase and the subscript p l and p s represents liquid phase and solid phase respectively the momentum equations for liquid and solid phases were expressed using eq 2 and eq 3 2 ρ l i α l i v l i t ρ l i α l i v l i v l i x i α l i p x i τ l i j x i ρ l α l g i β l s v s v l 3 ρ s i α s i v s i t ρ s i α s i v s i v s i x i α s i p x i p s x i

and gradient of velocity in order to model the collision between particles the granular temperature φs k was introduced in the kinetic theory of granular flow and calculated by eq 4 4 3 2 ρ α s t ρ α v i s x i x j k s s x τ s i j v s i x j γ ϑ l s the four terms on the right side of the equation represent the diffusion of granular energy the generated term from stress of solid phase the dissipation due to particle collision and the energy exchange between two phases respectively drag force played an important role in the momentum exchange between liquid and solid phases due to the velocity differences the gidaspow model gidaspow 1994 was used in this study for the drag based on the volume fraction of the liquid phase detailed information of each term included in the governing equations is summarized in table s2 3 2 species conservation the key processes involved in fbr fenton gac system include homogeneous fenton process gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic process the governing equation for evaluating chemical species dynamics was expressed using eq 5 ansys inc 2013 mohajerani et al 2010 5 α l c z l t α l v l i c z l x i x i d z α p i c z l x i s f e n t o n s a d

represent the overall reaction kinetics of chemical species participated in homogeneous fenton gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction respectively during the homogeneous fenton process fe2 and h2o2 are the fenton reagents for initiating oh generation meanwhile fe2 is converted to fe3 fe2 regeneration could also occur via the reaction between fe3 and h2o2 oh plays an important role in organics removal in this modeling work cod was used to represent the bulk organic matters to react with oh table s3 summarizes the reactions and kinetics between these chemical species involved in homogeneous fenton process our previous study found that in fbr fenton gac system gac adsorption contributed to the overall organics removal and the adsorption followed the langmuir isotherm which was expressed using eq 6 6 c c o d e q e c c o d e q m a x 1 k l q m a x where qmax mg g represents gac s maximum adsorption capacity ccod e mg l and qe mg g represent the organics concentration in the aqueous solution and gac surface at equilibrium respectively the gac adsorption kinetics was numerically described with the langmuir kinetic model as expressed in eq 7 plazinski et al 2009 7 q t k l c c o d q m a x q k l b q where kl l mg 1 min 1 is the langmuir constant and b l mg 1 is the equilibrium constant kl of 0 062 l mg 1 min 1 and b of 0 034 l mg 1 were previously determined from the langmuir isotherm with batch gac adsorption studies activated carbon ac could act as an electron transfer catalyst for h2o2 activation and radicals would be formed on ac surface through the following reactions kimura and miyamoto 1994 8 ac h 2 o 2 a c o h oh 9 a c h 2 o 2 ac h ho 2 h2o2 decomposition rate was used to represent the kinetics of gac h2o2 catalytic reaction according to huang et al 2003 in this catalytic process h2o2 decomposition mainly depends on h2o2 concentration and it was described by using a modified langmuir hinshelwood rate model eq 10 10 r h d h 2 o 2 d t h 2 o 2 0 h 2 o 2 t t t 0 k gac h 2 o 2 1 k h h 2 o 2 where k gac is 0 2 10 3 min 1 and k h is 0 13 10 3 mm 1 both k gac and k h represent the characteristic constants of gac particles they were experimental determined by adopting the method described in huang et al 2003 3 3 simulation conditions the structured and unstructured grids were generated to simulate the fluidized bed reactor fig s1 the mesh independence was examined using three different grids 19800 32000 and 48000 it was found that model with relatively higher mesh resolution 32000 and 48000 fit better with the experimental data with deviates less than 2 predicted cod removal efficiency from 32000 grid was similar with the result derived from 48000 grid t test p 0 05 thus considering less calculation time and energy requirement mesh with 32000 grid was used in this study the simulation was carried out with ansys fluent 20 0 installed in a high performance computing system the transient governing equations were solved using phase coupled simple scheme the first order upwind and quick spatial discretization method were selected to obtain the simulation results the bottom inlet of the reactor was set as the mass flow rate inlet in the simulation wastewater flowed out from the top outlet and was recirculated by a pump into the bottom inlet which formed a loop for this reactor the function of the recirculation pump was modelled by user defined function udf code which followed mass conservation in the fluent the reactor wall was defined as no slip wall the gac particles were packed in the bottom part of the reactor with an initial height of 0 2 m although gaseous co2 was produced during organics oxidation the small amount of co2 hardly affected the flow dynamics in the reactor and its impacts was ignored ebrahimi et al 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 cfd kinetic model validation by combining reactor hydrodynamic condition with reaction kinetics occurred fbr fenton gac process fig s2 the developed cfd kinetic model was firstly adopted to predict cod removal efficiency in fbr fenton gac system to validate the model performance batch fbr fenton gac experiments were carried out to investigate cod removal in roc under four different experimental conditions experimental cod removal data and model predicted cod removal efficiency under each experimental condition are summarized in table s4 fig 1 a illustrates the comparison between modelled cod removal efficiency and experimental data and their best linear fits under each condition are shown in fig s3 temporal cod variation at the fbr fenton gac reactor outlet position was used as the reference point for model validation and the root mean square error rmse was used as the error function to gauge the model performance despite the complexity of the fbr fenton gac reaction system the developed cfd kinetic model was able to accurately predict the cod removal efficiency in roc for all selected experimental conditions the rmse was 1 25 1 03 0 92 and 1 60 for condition 1 2 3 and 4 respectively and the corresponding r2 value of the best liner fit was 0 997 0 997 0 997 and 0 999 respectively more batch experiments were subsequently carried out to monitor cod removal in roc with three individual processes including fbr fenton sand process gac adsorption and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction fig 1b illustrates the simulated and experimental cod removal profiles in different roc treatment processes best linear fits between the model perdition and experimental data are shown in fig s4 fenton reaction kinetics were applied for fbr fenton sand process modeling the overall rmse between the predicted and experimental cod removal efficiency was 0 91 and the r2 value of the linear fit was 0 995 this accurate model prediction implied that fbr fenton sand process can be numerically described with homogenous fenton kinetics our previous study also demonstrated homogeneous fenton process to be the dominate organics removal mechanism in fbr fenton sand process both sand adsorption and sand h2o2 catalytic reaction were found to be negligible for organics removal in roc cai et al 2020a gac h2o2 process modeling consisted of gac h2o2 catalytic reaction and gac adsorption kinetics the model outputs were in a successful fit with the experimental data with rmse and r2 value of 1 30 and 0 997 respectively this confirmed that gac bed could effectively initiate h2o2 decomposition for oh generation and subsequent organics oxidation in the case of gac adsorption the model predicted cod removal in roc fit well with the experimental data with a rmse value of 0 98 and a correlation coefficient r2 value of 0 987 this implied that the adsorption behavior of packed gac bed for organics removal in roc can be accurately described with langmuir kinetic model along the 1 hour roc treatment model predicted cod removal efficiency achieved in fbr fenton gac process and homogeneous fenton reaction was 71 2 and 41 4 respectively cod removal in gac h2o2 process was predicted to be 35 4 as gac adsorption can contribute 24 4 cod removal in roc cod removal attributed to gac h2o2 catalytic reaction was predicted to be 11 based on these modeling results in fbr fenton gac system the contribution to bulk cod reduction decreased in the order of homogenous fenton reaction gac adsorption gac h2o2 catalytic reaction 4 2 hydrodynamic evaluation 4 2 1 solid volume fraction and liquid velocity to investigate the hydrodynamic conditions in fbr fenton gac system the solid volume fraction and liquid velocity were predicted by cfd simulation at a superficial liquid velocity of 0 0183 m s fig 2 b and 2c show the snapshots of fbr fenton gac system under stable operation and gac bed volume fraction distribution in the column reactor once the quasi steady state was reached gac particles were uniformly distributed in the fluidized bed a clear interface layer between the gac bed and the liquid phase can be identified on the upper region of the interface layer the liquid volume fraction was 100 and there was no free floating gac particles scattered in the liquid phase under the interface layer a stable solid volume fraction of 34 was achieved at the quasi steady state distribution contour of liquid velocity along the radial direction and the radial liquid velocity at different reactor heights are shown in fig 3 a 2 cm height plot is at the water inlet 15 cm height plot is within the fluidized bed 25 cm height plot is right below the interface layer 35 cm and 50 cm height plots both represent the radical liquid velocity profiles above the interface layer simulation results demonstrate that liquid velocity of lower magnitude was near the reactor wall and higher liquid velocity was in the center region highest liquid velocity was observed at the water inlet where more energy was derived from the inflow in the fluidized bed and interface layer the liquid velocity showed an increasing trend from the wall to a maximum value and further decreased until the reactor center this liquid flow pattern indicates the gac particles flow down at the bed center and up between the reactor wall and the center gac bed fluidization was in a pattern with two pairs of counter rotating recirculation cells limtrakul et al 2005 in the upper liquid region the liquid velocity distribution was static near the wall and more active in the reactor center this phenomenon is due to the intrinsic viscosity of the reactor wall mccabe et al 2005 thus a parabolic like distribution of liquid velocity was observed in the liquid phase fig 3b shows the axial liquid velocity distribution contour and its profile at the reactor center x r 0 at lower axial position attributed to higher energy input from the inflow the liquid velocity drastically increased from 0 0200 to 0 0350 m s afterwards the center liquid velocity gradually dropped along the gac bed to 0 0100 m s as the liquid flowed through the fluidized bed a rapid liquid velocity increase to 0 0230 m s was attained due to less resistance from the solid particles the hydrodynamic modeling results suggested that under stable operation condition gac particles were uniformly suspended within the solid phase moderately uniform liquid flow field was also attained in the upper liquid region with a center liquid velocity ranging from 0 0230 to 0 0180 m s 4 2 2 effect of superficial liquid velocity in a liquid solid fluidized bed reactor higher superficial liquid velocity indicates larger amount of energy input resulting in higher degree of liquid solid mixing and bed expansion limtrakul et al 2005 higher solid bed expansion rate could enhance the mass transfer rate and reaction kinetics chen et al 2015 adopted fbr fenton process to treat flax wastewater it was found that within 100 min reaction time 50 bed expansion rate had significantly higher decolorization performance as compared to 20 bed expansion rate to assess the effects of superficial liquid velocity on fbr fenton gac system s hydrodynamic conditions and reaction kinetics the validated cfd kinetic model was adopted to simulate gac bed expansion height and cod removal efficiency with different liquid velocities fig 4 a illustrates the distribution contour of solid volume fraction at four different liquid velocities the gac bed was expanded uniformly across the column reactor for all the cases with an increase in liquid velocity from 0 0165 to 0 0218 m s the bed expansion height increased axially from 22 to 29 cm the static height of the gac bed was 19 cm and the corresponding bed expansion rate increased from 18 to 51 with higher liquid velocity it was also found that a higher superficial liquid velocity resulted in a lower solid volume fraction the predicted gac volume fraction within the fluidization region showed a decreasing trend from 37 to 29 indicating higher extent of solid circulation in the fluidized bed it was also reported that the superficial liquid velocity can be used as a direct parameter for fine tuning the solid holdup in a liquid solid fluidized bed reactor tan et al 2016 temporal cod variation at the reactor outlet position with different superficial liquid velocities was further evaluated by implementing the reaction kinetics predicted cod removal efficiencies along the 1 hour roc treatment under all given conditions are presented in fig 4b the modeling results showed a slight increment in the final cod removal efficiency from 70 1 to 73 6 table s5 with an increase in the liquid velocity from 0 0165 to 0 0218 m s similar cod removal efficiencies were obtained in all the four cases from the foregoing discussion the superficial liquid velocity seemed to have higher impact on the hydrodynamic conditions such as bed expansion and solid volume fraction its impact on fbr fenton gac reaction kinetics was negligible as insignificant enhancement on cod removal efficiency was observed with higher superficial liquid velocity 4 3 chemical evaluation the integrated cfd kinetic model is able to solve the momentum equations in conjunction with the mass balances between different chemical species thus both temporal and spatial variations of each chemical species inside the reactor can be predicted to better understand the reactions kinetics in fbr fenton gac system the dynamics between fe2 and fe3 h2o2 decomposition and oh production were simulated with defined operation conditions of 10 mm h2o2 1 25 mm feso4 and a superficial liquid velocity of 0 0183 m s 4 3 1 fe2 and fe3 dynamics fig 5 a shows the overall fe2 consumption rate variation and its distribution contour at different reaction times highest fe2 consumption rate was attained at the beginning of the roc treatment implying the fenton reaction was initiated once the ferrous and h2o2 solutions were injected into the reactor at 2 min the predicted fe2 consumption rate was 3 0 10 6 m s it drastically decreased to 3 8 10 7 m s within the first 10 min and became minimal from 30 to 60 min the corresponding fe3 production rate variation and its distribution contour along the 1 hour roc treatment are shown in fig 5b accordingly highest fe3 production rate was attained in the beginning of the reaction and the 2 min ferric ion production rate was 3 0 10 6 m s similar with fe2 consumption significant fe3 production was only observed within the first 10 min simulated fe2 and fe3 concentration variation profiles fig s5 revealed that the overall fe2 concentration decreased from 1 25 to 0 13 mm in 30 min and remained a constant afterwards the overall fe3 concentration was predicted to increase from 0 to 1 12 mm in 30 min and there was no ferric ion production observed from 30 to 60 min the fe2 and fe3 dynamics indicated that in the fbr fenton gac reaction system fe2 was converted to fe3 over a very short period after the fenton reaction has been initiated according to fe2 consumption rate distribution contour fe2 consumption above the interface layer was predicted to be faster compared to that in the fluidized bed region likewise fe3 production rate distribution contour demonstrated faster fe3 formation in the upper liquid region this can be explained by the fact that the reactions converting ferrous ion to ferric ion r1 to r3 table s3 predominantly occurred in the homogenous liquid phase since liquid phase occupied higher volume fraction above the interface layer the reactions r1 to r3 were more active in the upper liquid region in addition as r1 is the main reaction involved in homogenous fenton process for oh generation cai et al 2020a it was concluded that in fbr fenton gac system oh generation attributed to homogenous fenton reaction mainly occurred in the upper liquid region as the fe2 concentration gradually declined till 30 min fe2 production was observed in the fluidized bed region with an average rate of 1 8 10 7 m s and the corresponding average fe3 consumption rate within the gac bed was predicted to be 1 8 10 7 m s this was due to the ferrous ion regeneration involved in the fenton process r4 to r7 table s3 at later stage of the roc treatment homogenous fenton process ceased as the dynamics between fe2 and fe3 remained to be negligible 4 3 2 h2o2 decomposition the overall h2o2 decomposition rate in fbr fenton gac reactor as well as its distribution contour were also simulated along the reaction time as shown in fig 6 h2o2 was decomposed with highest rate at the beginning of the reaction from 2 to 10 min the overall h2o2 decomposition rate sharply declined from 4 55 10 6 to 1 9 10 6 m s and gradually decreased to 8 06 10 7 m s till 60 min in the upper liquid region average h2o2 decomposition rate at 2 min was 2 6 10 6 m s which was same with the average fe2 consumption rate observed in the liquid phase this implied the dominance of homogenous fenton reaction r1 table s3 above the interface layer the 2 min fe2 consumption rate in fluidized bed region was predicted to be 2 68 10 6 m s while much faster h2o2 decomposition was attained in the same region with an average rate of 4 5 10 6 m s this could be due to an extra h2o2 decomposition process occurred in the gac bed and it was reported that gac particles could effectively induce catalytic decomposition of h2o2 molecules for oh generation georgi and kopinke 2005 huang et al 2003 according to the contour plotted at different reaction times h2o2 decomposition rate was observed to be constantly higher in the fluidized bed region this further confirmed the occurrence of gac h2o2 catalytic reaction in gac bed in addition along the reaction time h2o2 decomposition rate in gac bed showed a mild decreasing to 2 6 10 6 m s 1 5 10 6 m s and 1 0 10 6 m s at 10min 30min and 60min respectively however the h2o2 decomposition rate in liquid phase reduced drastically to 1 6 10 7 m s at 60 min this phenomenon denoted that the liquid phase homogenous fenton reaction diminished at the later stage of roc treatment as both h2o2 and fe2 consumption rate became negligible while in the fluidized bed region solid gac particles could continuously decompose h2o2 molecules for producing oh 4 3 3 hydroxyl radical production roc treatment with fbr fenton gac homogenous fenton and gac h2o2 process was separately simulated with the developed model instantaneous oh concentrations presented in the three individual processes were predicted and presented in fig 7 in fbr fenton gac process highest oh concentration of 1 34 10 12 m was attained at the initial stage as the reaction continued oh concentration dropped to 2 85 10 13 m at 20 min and slowly increased to 3 39 10 13 m till 60 min a similar sharp drop within the first 20 min was also observed in homogenous fenton process where oh concentration decreased from 4 95 10 13 to 3 66 10 14 m and remained stable afterwards in the first 20 min oh concentration in gac h2o2 process was negligible as the produced oh was consumed for organics oxidation from 20 to 60 min the predicted oh concentration slowly increased to 4 07 10 14 m during the earlier stage of roc treatment oh concentration in fbr fenton gac process was constantly 2 7 times higher than that in homogenous fenton process this is attributed to extra oh generation from the gac h2o2 catalytic process it was found that both fbr fenton gac and homogenous fenton processes obtained a drastically reduction of oh concentration from 0 to 20 min revealing continuous consumption of oh for organics oxidation and diminishment of fenton reaction along the treatment process it was also noted that after 20 min both fe2 consumption rate and fe3 production rate became negligible and the amount of oh generated from fenton reaction was also expected to be insignificant within the same time span this denoted that in the two reaction systems fenton reaction was terminated due to fully consumption of fe2 ions once the fenton reaction abated majority of the produced oh was contributed by gac h2o2 catalytic reaction since a slow increase of oh concentration from 20 to 60 min was observed in both fbr fenton gac and gac h2o2 processes the simulation results were also validated with our previous oh exposure study with pcba decomposition cai et al 2020a during the 5 min pcba decomposition in the fbr fenton gac system the total oh exposure was measured as 2 891 10 10 m s and the corresponding average oh concentration was 9 637 10 13 m according to the developed model the predicted average oh concentration within the first 5 minutes in fbr fenton gac process was 9 39 10 13 m which correlated well with the previous experimental data the distribution contours of oh production rate in homogenous fenton process and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction are plotted in the panel a and b of fig 8 respectively at 2 min average oh production rate in homogenous fenton process was 2 33 10 6 m s it remarkably reduced to 5 77 10 7 m s at 10 min and slowly decreased till the end of roc treatment this oh production rate variation was similar with the simulated fe2 consumption rate and fe3 production rate profiles where faster reaction rates were attained for all the three chemical species within the first 10 min this further confirmed that fenton reaction r1 table s3 was initiated over a very short period and it was the main process contributing to oh generation at the early stage of fbr fenton gac reaction according to the 2 min contour in fig 8a oh production in homogeneous fenton process was generally uniformly distributed in the column reactor though the upper liquid region obtained a bit higher oh production rate this could be due to higher liquid volume fraction attained in the upper liquid region as the fenton reaction predominantly occurred in the liquid phase from 10 min onward when the fenton reaction started to diminish in the column reactor slightly higher oh production rate was observed in the gac bed this can be accounted to ferrous ion regeneration between h2o2 and fe3 as both fe2 production and fe3 consumption were found in the fluidized bed region the reaction r5 table s3 involved in ferrous ion regeneration could contribute to higher oh production rate in gac bed at the later stage of the reaction as shown in fig 8b oh production in gac h2o2 catalytic process uniformly occurred in the fluidized bed region and no catalytic oh production was observed in the upper liquid region from 2 to 60 min the oh production rate followed a decreasing trend from 1 21 10 6 to 0 60 10 6 m s this phenomenon agrees well with the solid distribution contour in the column reactor gac particles were only evenly circulated inside the fluidized bed region no gac particles were floated in the upper liquid region as the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 molecules must take place by contacting with gac particles considerably high oh production rate was only obtained in the gac fluidized bed region 4 4 organics removal in roc with a fenton reagents dosage of 10 mm h2o2 1 25 mm feso4 and a superficial liquid velocity of 0 0183 m s the cod concentration at different reaction times were predicted with the validated model as shown in fig 9 during the 1 hour roc treatment the average cod concentration in fbr fenton gac reactor was predicted to reduce from 122 to 35 mg l simulation contours of cod mass fraction at different reaction times are also plotted in fig 9 where the cod mass fraction in the fluidized bed region was observed to be constantly lower than that in the upper liquid region this implied that synergistic oh production from homogenous fenton and gac h2o2 catalytic process promoted the organics removal in gac bed due to its extremely high reactivity the produced oh would be mostly consumed in situ for organics oxidation r18 table s3 rather than moving upward to the liquid phase region ebrahimi et al 2019 gac particles could also contribute to organics removal by the adsorption process hence lower cod concentration was attained in the fluidized bed while it was also noted that at 2 min the difference between average cod concentrations in solid and liquid phases was only 1 6 mg l and the difference further reduced to lower than 0 2 mg l after 10 min this observation also denoted good mixing condition inside the column reactor although more effective organics removal occurred in the fluidized bed region the cod abatement kinetics in different reaction processes were further quantified with the cfd kinetic model and its variation along the reaction time were illustrated in fig 10 a the overall cod degradation rate showed a decreasing trend within the first 10 min and it gradually reduced till the end of fbr fenton gac reaction the overall cod degradation rate was predicted to be 2 05 10 6 m s 8 61 10 7 m s and 2 93 10 7 m s at 2 min 10 min and 60 min respectively cod oxidation by oh obtained significantly higher degradation rate during the early period of the reaction the cod oxidation rate greatly decreased from 1 83 10 6 to 5 65 10 7 m s from 2 to 10 min and stabilized at around 2 60 10 7 m s afterwards cod adsorption by the gac bed retained lower rate of 2 59 10 7 to 1 18 10 7 m s along the reaction time within the 60 min roc treatment fbr fenton gac process achieved a total cod removal efficiency of 72 42 3 of cod was removed by oh oxidation and 29 7 of cod removal was attributable to gac adsorption the contour plots in fig 10b demonstrated that cod oxidation by oh took place in both liquid and solid phases and higher cod oxidation rates were constantly achieved in the fluidized bed region this is owing to faster oh production in gac bed resulted from the synergistic effect of homogenous fenton process and gac h2o2 catalytic reaction fig 10c exhibits that along the 1 hour roc treatment only the solid phase gac bed continuously contributed to cod removal through the adsorption process as a result in fbr fenton gac reaction system organics removal in the fluidized bed region was induced by three reaction mechanisms including fenton process gac h2o2 process and gac adsorption both fenton and gac h2o2 process achieved effective cod oxidation with oh generation in the upper liquid region fenton reaction was the only mechanism that contributed to oh generation and organics oxidation 5 conclusion the findings of this study suggested the integrated cfd kinetic model framework to be a promising numerical tool for simulating the fbr fenton gac process the model was able to accurately predict the process performance by considering the interactions between the process and reactor variables a comprehensive investigation on the mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the fbr fenton gac system was also carried out with model simulation homogenous fenton process gac h2o2 catalytic process and gac adsorption were validated as the key organics removal mechanisms in the fbr fenton gac system instantaneous temporal and spatial prediction of the chemical species such as fe2 fe3 h2o2 oh and cod were also achieved by the developed model this model performance would contribute greatly to the future real time process control and system automation the presented modelling study is not case specific as the model was developed on the basis of the full reaction mechanisms in fbr fenton gac process it can be applied to simulate the treatment of other industrial wastewaters though fbr fenton technologies were reported to be effective for treating different industrial wastewaters such as paper mill wastewater and pharmaceutical wastewater cai et al 2021a process upscaling is still the key bottleneck hampering its full scale applications the cfd kinetic model can be adopted to predict and optimize the fbr fenton gac process in larger scale applications furthermore cfd is a well known technique for effectively reducing the workload and cost required for reactor upscaling the focuses of future studies are mainly about development validation of continuous flow process model model scale up and its validation in larger scale industrial wastewater treatment process declaration of

16703,nanoplastics are an emerging contaminant in aquatic environments however analytical methods for the separation concentration and identification of nanoplastics which are essential to assess nanoplastic presence in the environment are lacking here we developed a new and easy to use method to separate and enrich nanoplastics in field water samples with ultracentrifugation river water was spiked with polystyrene fragments 1000 nm at an environmentally relevant concentration 108 109 particles l the polystyrene fragments were successfully separated and enriched by a factor of nearly 50 times with a high recovery rate 87 1 after undergoing our process particles were then characterized using uv vis spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and enhanced darkfield microscopy with a hyperspectral imaging hsi spectrometer these techniques are non destructive and allow the assessment of plastic concentration morphology and polymer type our method can potentially be applied to other water samples to supply clean enriched nanoplastic samples that can facilitate their identification in environmental samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastic river water ultracentrifugation separation enrichment concentration 1 introduction plastic pollution especially microplastic pollution has been a hot topic of wide public concern cozar et al 2014 law et al 2014 microplastics are small pieces of plastics which can be primary products hernandez et al 2017 or fragmented pieces from larger plastics dawson et al 2018 gewert et al 2015 gigault et al 2016 in recent years research focus has shifted to the lower size range of these particles namely nanoplastics although the exact definition of this size class is still under debate both 1000 nm hartmann et al 2019 oliveira and almeida 2019 ter halle et al 2017 and 100 nm ivleva et al 2017 mintenig et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 have been used to define the upper size limit in nanoplastic studies at present the growing trend is to use a new definition rather than borrowing one from the nanomaterial field gigault et al 2021 although there is no consensus on size definition for nanoplastic the entire scientific community has realized the importance of developing analytical methods for nanoscale plastic debris in this work the more commonly adopted definition in the field of plastic research is used i e nanoplastics are plastic particles 1000 nm as they demonstrate colloidal behavior schwaferts et al 2019 there is currently a methodological gap for the separation quantification and identification of nanoplastics cai et al 2020 many of the protocols developed for microplastic analysis cannot be directly applied to nanoplastics and so new methods are required to fill the gap mintenig et al 2018 schwaferts et al 2019 in previous reports several protocols were designed to separate spherical particles ignoring the irregularly shaped particles that actually compose the majority of plastics in environmental samples karami 2017 preconcentration e g ultrafiltration cloud point extraction zhou et al 2019 and ultracentrifugation abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 have been used to enrich plastic particles in samples for subsequent separation asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 was reported as an ideal tool to divide polydisperse particle distributions into monodisperse ones moon et al 2004 and can be coupled with multi angle light scattering mals to determine size distributions abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 gigault et al 2017 other hyphenated technologies can also carry out separation and identification simultaneously pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms zhou et al 2019 and raman tweezers gillibert et al 2019 were reported to successfully separate and identify several kinds of micro and nanoplastics in spiked samples nanoparticle tracking analysis nta can be used to obtain particle concentration and size distribution lambert and wagner 2016 nta is highly sensitivity to particle concentration by measuring not only light scattering intensity e g dynamic light scattering dls li et al 2019 but also number based size distributions in aqueous samples scanning electron microscopy sem hernandez et al 2019 2017 and raman microscopy gillibert et al 2019 can be used to observe the morphology of nanoplastics in synthetic and environmental samples however only five reports succeeded in detecting nanoplastics in real field samples including relatively clean seawater ter halle et al 2017 snow samples materić et al 2020 air samples xu et al 2020 and soil sand extracts davranche et al 2020 wahl et al 2021 nevertheless nanoplastic analysis remains a challenging task due to the complexity of environmental sample matrix which can cause interference in detection methods and the low concentrations which often fall below the limit of detection lod of instruments for example the lod of dls is about 1011 1015 particles l filipe et al 2010 nta requires at least 109 particles l a limit which is highly dependent on setting selections and user experience gallego urrea et al 2010 sladek et al 2019 the lod for py gc ms depends on polymer type and is 4 mg l for polystyrene ps which translates to 9 08 1011 particles l for 200 nm spheres mintenig et al 2018 raman tweezer also requires a high concentration of particles to avoid spending an impractical amount of time looking for targets gillibert et al 2019 therefore many proposed methods fail to detect nanoplastics in real field samples because of the low endogenous concentration of nanoplastics zhou et al 2019 in order to cater to the high lod of instruments there is a tendency for studies to spike samples with high concentrations of nanoplastics in the range of 1 29 1010 3 37 1017 particles l prior to preconcentration table s1 the highest spike concentration was 5 g l which is 3 37 1017 particles l of 30 nm ps nanoplastics fang et al 2020 these concentrations of nanoplastics are far higher than the concentration of microplastics detected in field water samples and could lead to an overestimation of recovery rates when evaluating preconcentration methods koelmans et al 2019 rezania et al 2018 therefore using more environmentally relevant spike concentrations when evaluating preconcentration methods will be an essential step to bridge the gap between instrumental detection limits and field concentrations of nanoplastics ultracentrifugation is a highly versatile and widely applicable tool for biochemical and polymer science byron et al 2018 ultracentrifugation can concentrate particles and exclude solvent simultaneously giving it a lot of potential to be applied to many types of field samples optical microscopy is considered as a reliable method to observe particles however resolution will be limited by the light source and design of the optical system the recent use of darkfield microscopy has reduced background noise in images so that low contrast samples can be viewed with a high contrast that would otherwise not be seen with brightfield microscopy zamora perez et al 2018 enhanced darkfield microscopy can also be coupled with a hyperspectral imaging hsi spectrometer i e cytoviva to create a fast and powerful tool for the non destructive detection and characterization of nanoplastics badireddy et al 2012 hyperspectral imaging his is a technique that simultaneously collects images and spectral data of a target area by combining components from spectrophotometry advanced optics and computer software it produces two dimensional images that contain entire reflectance spectra within each pixel with the range of captured wavelengths typically running from near infrared to visible light as each material has a unique spectrum materials can be identified within the images by comparing spectral data to references in fact this technique has already been successfully applied to identify various nanomaterials in biological tissues roth et al 2015 in addition to polystyrene particles in homogenized freeze dried fish brains mattsson et al 2017 the goal of this study was to utilize ultracentrifugation as a pretreatment method to increase the concentration of nanoplastics in river water samples spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of spherical and fragmented polystyrene sps and fps spikes concentrations of initial and enriched spiked samples were characterized using uv vis spectroscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis nta to assess the effectiveness of preconcentration potential changes in the morphology in the ps standards from ultracentrifugation was assessed with sem finally we simultaneously visualized and identified ps spikes using enhanced dark field hyperspectral microscopy to further confirm their presence in enriched water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation spherical and fragmented ps nanoplastics spherical ps sps latex 600 1000 nm 2 5 w v latex p107774 and 5 0 μm 6 1 0500 were supplied from aladdin co and tianjin baseline chromtech research center china respectively fragmented ps fps particles were prepared from 5 0 μm spheres by adding 1 5 μl of the ps latex into a glass bottle with 30 ml milli q water and then ultrasonicating the suspensions with a probe sonicator scientz iid ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china samples were prepared in triplicate and sonicated at 60 w for 10 20 or 30 min to evaluate the ultracentrifugation method various spiked milli q water and river water samples were prepared the river water was collected by the shore of yingtao river which is a freshwater river in shanghai 121 26 41 e 31 1 45 n a five liter glass bottle was filled with surface water 0 10 cm in depth using a steel bucket the initial suspensions were made by adding 45 µl of sps latex 600 1000 nm or fps suspension into 800 ml milli q water or river water and then stirring with a glass rod for 2 min afterwards suspensions were poured through a nylon membrane filter ny2004700 millipore to exclude the large microplastics and impurities 20 μm after filtration the filtrate was transferred into glass cylinders 25 cm in height and allowed to settle to exclude large particles 1 μm from supernatant according to the stokes law particles larger than 1 μm will settle 2 cm down in water in 6 h so suspensions were allowed to settle for 66 h then the upper 22 cm of water 600 ml was removed with a peristaltic pump and transferred into narrow mouth glass bottles the bottles were kept in a 4 c fridge until use 2 2 size and concentration measurements the hydrodynamic size distributions of sps and fps suspensions were tested using dynamic light scattering with a zetasizer nano malvern panalytical britain zeta potentials of nanoplastic in concentrated water samples were also measured on this machine two ml of suspension was placed into a standard macro cuvette 1 cm in pass length and measurements were taken at room temperature 25 c results were averaged from three independent measurements nanoparticle tracking analysis zetaview particle metrix germany was used to measure particle concentration of 14 sps suspensions all measurements were conducted according to manufacturer s recommendations for each measurement three cycles were performed by scanning 11 cell positions and capturing 30 frames per position at 25 c the camera was set to autofocus with sensitivity of 70 and shutter 70 scattering intensity was detected automatically the captured videos were analyzed by the in built zetaview software 8 05 04 with the maximum and minimum size set to 1000 and 100 nm respectively and the minimum brightness to 100 the same 14 suspensions were also analyzed with uv vis spectroscopy flame ocean optics usa the absorbance of nanoparticles was obtained in triplicate in the spectral range of 180 and 800 nm using milli q water as reference hence a spectrophotometric standard curve could be created from nta and uv vis data to quantify particle concentration after enrichment without sacrificing samples 2 3 ultracentrifugation a new aspiration device was designed to remove 4 ml of supernatant with minimal disturbance to the bottom ml in tubes in preliminary experiment 1 ml of milli q water was poured into a centrifugation tube and the syringe was lowered until it touched the surface of the water the height was marked as the position to remove the supernatant only leaving behind 1 ml see fig 3c it is important to note that this device cannot be used to remove samples accurately in volume mass the ultracentrifugation was carried out on a beckman optima xpn 80 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter palo alto ca with the beckman sw 55 ti ultracentrifuge rotor and 5 2 ml tubes part no 326819 for spherical spikes sedimentation coefficient s were calculated based on svedberg s theory and written into eq 1 1 4 3 π r v 3 ρ p ρ s f u ω 2 r s where r v is the volume equivalent particle radius ρ p is the particle density ρ s is the solvent densit y f is the frictional coefficient u is the sedimentation velocity of the solute and ω 2 r is the centrifugal acceleration at a radial distance r from the center of rotation with eq 1 a sedimentation coefficient s greater than 1 25 000 svedberg was calculated for calculated 600 1000 nm sps standard in this current work chen et al 2020 in addition provided that the sedimentation boundary rbnd is relatively sharp and symmetrical the sedimentation coefficient can also be expressed by eq 2 2 s u ω 2 r d r b n d d t ω 2 r where 3 ln r b n d r m s ω 2 t where rm is the radial position of the meniscus in the case of the swing out rotor used in this work the rm and rbnd are 72 8 mm and 108 5 mm respectively therefore to completely sediment 600 1000 nm sps the theoretical centrifugal time at a speed of 20 000 rpm equivalent to a relative centrifugal force rcf of about 41 886 g is on the minute scale according to eq 3 experimentally the centrifugal time was set to 2 h which is long enough to assure a complete sedimentation in preliminary experiments the supernatant in centrifugation tubes was divided evenly into 5 layers each layer 1 ml was gently transferred to a cuvette to test the absorbance before centrifugation 5 ml of spiked samples were added into 5 individual tubes and 5 ml of milli q water was run in parallel as a blank sample after each round of centrifugation the run was stopped and the supernatant 4 ml was removed using the custom aspiration device afterwards 4 ml of fresh spiked suspension was added in each tube except the blank sample for next run of centrifugation the uv vis absorbance of blank sample after centrifugation was evaluated to account for possible contamination during the experimental process to determine the particle recovery of ultracentrifugation enrichment method each layer from the tube was tested individually with uv vis spectroscopy after each cumulative centrifugation time that is after 1 2 3 4 12 rounds table s2 differences between absorbance of the four top layers were assessed by analysis of variance followed by kruskal wallis non parametric with corrected p values for multiple comparison p 0 05 was considered significance the relationships between absorbance and concentration were curve fitted using graphpad prism 8 2 1 graphpad software san diego california usa the recovery of ultracentrifugation enrichment method was calculated by 4 r x ax cx a 0 100 where the x stands for cumulative centrifugation times and rx is corresponding recovery of enriched sample ax stands for the absorbance at 340 nm of bottom layer from tubes after x centrifugation rounds cx stands for the concentration ratio after each centrifugation cx can be 5 14 9 28 13 42 17 55 46 53 50 66 corresponding to the cumulative centrifugation rounds after uv vis testing the suspension was transferred into a 2 ml screw thread vial to preserve the sample for other tests 2 4 sem and hyperspectral microscope duplicate samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy sem observation and hyperspectral microscopy analysis by drying 50 µl suspensions onto silicon wafers the silicon wafers were coated with platinum for sem imaging the sem images were observed using an s 4800 hitachi japan operating at 3 0 kv to make sure ultracentrifugation did not change the shape or morphology of spikes sps spikes were observed before and after separation and enrichment process an enhanced darkfield microscope with a hyperspectral imaging hsi spectrometer hyperspectral microscope cytoviva usa was used to confirm the presence of sps and fps nanoplastics in concentrated water samples the hyperspectral microscope is a combination of an olympus bx51 upright microscope with a 60x darkfield objective 0 215 µm pixel a visible near infrared vnir 400 1000 nm light source and a transmission grating spectrograph coupled to a ccd camera the light source was a 150 w quartz aluminum halogen bulb with broadband spectrum range of 400 2500 nm analysis was all conducted using cytoviva proprietary version of envi 4 8 hyperspectral imaging and analysis software slides were prepared by resuspending dried samples in 50 µl of filtered milli q water and aliquoting 10 µl to glass slides with coverslips the first step was to build a reference spectra library of each type of spike fig s1 to do this regions of interest were defined using a particle filter with a size threshold of 30 pixels as determined from images of 1000 nm sps screening out larger likely contaminating material from the reference library each spectrum in the library is the average of all the pixels that compose one particle hyperspectral data cubes were then lamp corrected to eliminate the noise from the lamp and at each end of the spectrum the normalized spectra were saved in a reference library after that unknown particles would be scanned and lamp normalized no size threshold was set here so that potential aggregates would not be excluded from analysis and pixels from particles were compared individually to the reference library using the spectral angle mapper sam classification algorithm kruse et al 1993 briefly spectra are converted to vectors and the angle between them is calculated smaller angles correspond to greater similarity and so unknown spectra that fell below the angle threshold of 0 1 from the references were considered a match and colored in the corresponding image this makes it possible that only a small part of a large object or aggregate to be identified as sps or fps in images 2 5 statistics differences between absorbance of the four layers was assessed by analysis of variance followed by kruskal wallis non parametric with corrected p values for multiple comparison p 0 05 was considered significance the relationships between absorbance and concentration were curve fitted using graphpad prism 8 2 1 graphpad software san diego california usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical features of spherical and fragmented ps nanoplastics little is known about the morphology size distribution and polymer types of nanoplastics in complex field samples spherical nanoplastic spikes are widely available and so are most often used in developing separation and characterization methods abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 barber et al 2020 lv et al 2020 schwaferts et al 2020 these particles are round uniform and smooth which is unlikely for weathered nanoplastics found in the environment koelmans et al 2015 in order to better represent this variety in particles both spherical and non spherical fragmented nano sized ps particles with a broad size range were used as internal standards to test the ultracentrifugation separation method fig 1 the spherical ps sps particles were 711 nm on average with a smooth surface fig 1a and b with ultrasonic treatments of different duration particles became more irregularly shaped and from this point on are referred to as fragmented ps fps dls analysis showed that the average hydrodynamic size decreased after ultrasonic treatment 10 30 min fig s2 considering that the average hydrodynamic size of fps is not accurate due to its high polydispersivity index value pdi 0 64 in average after 30 min treatment the size distribution was extracted which revealed that the majority of particles were actually in the range of 615 1106 nm these results suggest that there were still a few particles larger than 1106 nm and that they strongly affected the average hydrodynamic size fig 1c therefore the size distribution of fps treated with 30 min was adequately uniform and so 30 min was selected as a suitable treatment duration for producing fps sps and fps particles larger than 1000 nm will be removed during the subsequent settling step in particles preparation see section 2 1 after settling the size of particles was determined with sem as the low and more environmentally relevant particle concentration was too low for dls in terms of morphology fps nanoplastics are different from sps nanoplastics fig 1d the irregular shape and relatively rough surface of our fps particles are more environmentally relevant karami 2017 it is well known that plastic particles degrade and fragment in the environment which causes changes in bulk structure such as cracking embrittlement and flaking chamas et al 2020 this extends to micro and nanoplastics as studies fragmenting plastics in the environment observed irregularly shaped plastics with rough surfaces song et al 2020 weinstein et al 2016 on the other hand spherical particles are easier to utilize as they have the optimal shape for quantitative techniques e g nta and dls and are commercially available in highly concentrated solutions therefore sps were use as spikes to optimize equipment parameters and test the feasibility of using ultracentrifugation for enriching nanoplastics in water samples then fps spikes were used to mimic realistic nanoplastics making it more readily applicable in the characterization of field samples 3 2 quantification of sps and fps spikes in samples particle concentration was measured using uv vis spectroscopy at λ 340 nm because this band was enhanced fig 2 a and weakly influenced by media i e milli q and river water fig s3 a standard curve was prepared using 14 sps suspensions ranging from 8 86 108 3 80 1010 particles l fig 2b the particle concentrations particles l were calculated based on the average hydrodynamic size of sps nanoplastics 711 nm and assuming that the density is the same as that of bulk ps there was a strong linear relationship between uv vis absorbance and calculated particle concentration with a linear determination coefficient r 2 of 0 9969 and pearson value p 0 0001 fig 2b and c the lod of uv vis on sps nanoplastics defined as three times the baseline noise s n 3 was about 7 24 108 particles l the limit of quantification loq considering an s n ratio of 10 was 2 41 109 particles l for 600 1000 nm sps in water samples particle concentrations were verified using nta excluding concentrations below 2 21 109 particles l as they fall below the lod of nta table s3 the standard curve built from the nta measurements covered 2 21 109 1 63 1010 particles l fig s4 and fit the linear model r2 0 9570 slightly less than the one based on calculated particle concentrations therefore calculated concentrations were considered to be good approximations of spike concentrations in the 14 suspensions uv vis can be a useful tool for the rapid quantification of nanoplastic at low endogenous concentrations in field samples in this study the particle concentration of sps and fps nanoplastics in initial water samples was 7 12 109 and 7 24 108 particles l respectively these concentrations are the lowest in literature for studies that developed analytical methods using spiked samples gillibert et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 table s1 therefore our method shows promise for real life application compared to previously reported methods that could not be applied to real field samples 3 3 analytical performance of separation and enrichment method prior to analysis it is essential to quantify particles lost during pretreatments since significant losses can result in lower particle concentrations that fall below the lod of the analytical method and thus an inaccurate determination here the performance of the stainless steel filter base custom aspiration device and ultracentrifugation was tested using uv vis spectroscopy the absorbance of filtrate from the stainless steel filter base 0 018 was 800 higher than that from the sand core filter base 0 002 fig 3 a the latter falling below the lod of uv vis 0 003 therefore the stainless steel filter base was used rather than the typical sand core filter base in the prefiltration step fig 3a in the subsequent ultracentrifugation step 5 ml water samples were added into 5 2 ml swing out centrifuge tubes the sample would later be separate into five 1 ml layers defined by their position from the surface layers 1 4 refer to the 4 ml of the uppermost layers and layer 5 refers to 1 ml at the bottom samples were centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 2 h and the absorbance of each layer was analyzed by uv vis after a single round of ultracentrifugation there was no significant differences in the average absorbance among the top 4 layers of spiked milli q and river water samples with sps or fps p 0 05 and values were less than that of the initial samples the absorbance of the bottom layer was higher than that of initial samples fig 3b to further concentrate the sample the top 4 ml were removed and replaced with fresh sample and the process was repeated several times in order to reduce disturbance of ps particles in the bottom layer when removing the supernatant a custom aspiration device was used to gently remove the top layers in tubes fig 3c a 1000 μl pipette was used to add fresh water samples the resulting reduction in mass in the tubes were not exactly 4 g fig 3d preliminary experiments showed small variations in the volumes drawn with the average mass removed from 12 replicates being 4 027 0 046 g the average was used to calculate recovery in the following rounds of ultracentrifugation this aspiration device can be used to remove upper supernatant with minimal disturbance and loss of nanoplastics to bottom layers after 12 rounds of centrifugation the average absorbance of the top layers in spiked milli q samples was 0 0045 0 0077 when spiked with sps and 0 0004 0 0011 when spiked with fps fig 4 the average absorbance of the top layers in spiked river water samples was 0 0133 0 0175 with sps and 0 0047 0 0073 with fps spikes respectively this confirmed that sps were successfully concentrated into the bottom layer leaving very few particles evenly dispersed in the top layers after ultracentrifugation the absorbance and recovery of the bottom 1 ml was also tested fig 5 based on the final added mass 50 66 g and the bottom sample mass post treatment 1 g an enrichment factor of about 50 66 was calculated to account for the effect of absorbance from impurities a blank sample of milli q water was centrifuged following the same samples protocol and in parallel with spiked samples table s2 after 12 rounds of ultracentrifugation the absorbance of blank samples was 0 001 for both sps and fps spikes these values were subtracted from sample measurements to give the final reported values this was also done for river water samples table s4 the final absorbances of enriched samples were 0 520 and 0 157 for sps and fps in milli q water samples the absorbances were 1 292 and 2 338 for sps and fps in river water samples fig 5 after the total ultracentrifugation 12 rounds the highest recovery rate was for fps in milli q 103 3 water followed by fps in river water 87 1 sps in river water 57 9 and sps in milli q 57 0 this differences among different samples can be partially attributed to the differences in zeta potential sps had the most negative value in milli q 34 1 mv then in river water 14 1 mv in comparison fps had lower negative values in river water 11 9 mv and milli q water 8 9 mv fig s5 based on their zeta potentials sps in milli q water was the most stable in suspension and as a result would be more difficult to settle in the tubes resulting in the lowest recovery rate among samples conversely fps in milli q water had the lowest zeta potential and so was the least stable in suspension as such it would more readily aggregate increasing its size and sedimentation rate resulting in the higher recovery rate li et al 2019 in reported studies blank and recovery tests are rarely included in method evaluation cai et al 2020 however as contamination and particle loss are difficult to fully avoid procedural blank samples and recovery tests should always be included during our method development procedure blank tests were conducted to account for contamination and calculate recovery rates to quantify nanoplastic loss from our proposed method the highest recovery rate during enrichment in environmentally relevant river water sample was with fps spikes at 96 4 which is relatively high among reported methods abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 cai et al 2020 correia and loeschner 2018 hildebrandt et al 2020 lin et al 2020 our ultracentrifugation method also enriched the lowest concentration spike among those in literature which will improve the lod and limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of existing methods li et al 2020 3 4 characterization of nanoplastics in spiked laboratory and field samples after enrichment to assess the morphology of sps after the enrichment process sem images were taken of dried samples after round 0 3 6 9 and 12 of ultracentrifugation in milli q fig s6 m0 m1 m4 and river water fig s6 r0 r1 r4 sps were still round and intact after each enrichment step showing that ultracentrifugation is a gentle enrichment method that does not destroy nanoplastics in water samples sps also tended to aggregate together in spiked milli q samples fig s6 m1 m4 while they remained dispersed in spiked river water samples fig s7 the particle density of sps in river water samples was also lower than in milli q samples based on imaging with a large field of vision fig s7 using a hyperspectral microscope equipped with a 60x magnification dark field objective and a visible near infrared light source λ 400 1000 nm we obtained images and spectral information of particles found in spike samples fig 6 reference spectra of the reflected light from sps and fps particles were obtained from suspensions in milli q water then with the spectral angle mapper sam classification algorithm in the envi 4 8 analysis software the reference spectra were used to identify particles in enriched milli q and river water samples fig s1 hyperspectral microscope was a quick way to locate particles 700 nm in size and can characterize their shape and material at the same time it is much faster than other mapping techniques like raman taking minutes instead of hours to image an 90 μm 90 μm area sobhani et al 2019 although other techniques like raman tweezer surface enhanced raman spectroscopy raman imaging and scanning electron microscope rise can also supply morphology and chemical information simultaneously they have higher lods 1010 1017 particles l than hyperspectral microscopy 108 109 particles l in this study fang et al 2020 gillibert et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2020 xu et al 2020 additionally unlike methods such as py gc ms that need to destroy samples to obtain chemical information ter halle et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 hyperspectral microscopy is a non destructive technique and so samples are preserved for additional analytical methods which is essential since given range in the wavelength of light used in hyperspectral microscopy it is not a molecular fingerprinting technique like fourier transformation infrared ftir instead it relies the assumption that there is a unique reflectance spectrum for each material reflectance spectra is not only dependent on the materials it is also sensitive to the surrounding environment therefore users are required to create their own libraries for each combination of material and environment in this case sps and fps particles in water to this end concentrated suspensions of sps and fps in milli q water were imaged to collect reference spectra of spikes prior to analysis of river water samples overall hyperspectral microscopy quickly provides information on particle morphology approximate size distribution and plastic type which complement data from more time consuming quantitative techniques therefore it shows potential for use in nanoplastic detection in previous studies there are some techniques successfully verifying nanoplastic with raman spectroscopy on spiked samples schwaferts et al 2020 or relatively clean samples such as air and seawater samples fu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however nanoplastic samples should be preconcentrated before conducting raman analysis due to the high lod of the raman technique and the low endogenous concentrations in field samples higher particle concentration leads to higher particle density on substrates which facilitates their localization during imaging with the help of ultracentrifugation environmentally relevant shapes and concentrations of nanoplastics were successfully separated and enriched to levels above lods of other techniques allowing verification with uv vis and hyperspectral microscopy techniques this new proposed method can be easily applied to other types of fresh river water because it has been tested using environmentally relevant conditions and uses equipment that is fairly accessible 4 conclusion as nanoplastics are easily ingested by organisms and can damage cells and biological membranes there is an urgent need to determine their environmental concentration this requires an efficient reliable and easy to use separation and preconcentration method to extract the low concentration of nanoplastics in real field water in this work we presented a method for the separation and enrichment of nanoplastics in water samples using ultracentrifugation and evaluated the analytical performance of uv vis spectroscopy nta sem and hsi the protocol developed was successful with low concentrations of spherical and fragmented ps internal standards that are more comparable to levels in real water samples the fragmented nanoplastics were separated and enriched 50 times in river water with a high recovery rate 87 1 establishing its utility for nanoplastics detection in field samples likewise ultracentrifugation is demonstrated as a gentle method that does not destroy or fragment nanoplastic as centrifuge equipment is fairly accessible in most research fields this method can be quickly adopted and contribute greatly to close the knowledge gap on environmental concentrations of nanoplastics after a simple prefiltration researchers can successfully separate and enrich nanoplastics to levels above lods of other techniques and can identify nanoparticles with current techniques or develop more reliable and efficient identification method on well pretreated samples this study provides insight into the separation and enrichment of environmentally relevant nanoplastics in real river water samples which is essential for developing reliable identification methods for unknown nanoplastics in real field samples in the future further work is required to improve the efficiency of ultracentrifugation method such as using larger volume of centrifuge tubes to pretreat bulk water samples and reach higher enrichment factor declaration

16703,nanoplastics are an emerging contaminant in aquatic environments however analytical methods for the separation concentration and identification of nanoplastics which are essential to assess nanoplastic presence in the environment are lacking here we developed a new and easy to use method to separate and enrich nanoplastics in field water samples with ultracentrifugation river water was spiked with polystyrene fragments 1000 nm at an environmentally relevant concentration 108 109 particles l the polystyrene fragments were successfully separated and enriched by a factor of nearly 50 times with a high recovery rate 87 1 after undergoing our process particles were then characterized using uv vis spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy sem and enhanced darkfield microscopy with a hyperspectral imaging hsi spectrometer these techniques are non destructive and allow the assessment of plastic concentration morphology and polymer type our method can potentially be applied to other water samples to supply clean enriched nanoplastic samples that can facilitate their identification in environmental samples graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanoplastic river water ultracentrifugation separation enrichment concentration 1 introduction plastic pollution especially microplastic pollution has been a hot topic of wide public concern cozar et al 2014 law et al 2014 microplastics are small pieces of plastics which can be primary products hernandez et al 2017 or fragmented pieces from larger plastics dawson et al 2018 gewert et al 2015 gigault et al 2016 in recent years research focus has shifted to the lower size range of these particles namely nanoplastics although the exact definition of this size class is still under debate both 1000 nm hartmann et al 2019 oliveira and almeida 2019 ter halle et al 2017 and 100 nm ivleva et al 2017 mintenig et al 2018 nguyen et al 2019 have been used to define the upper size limit in nanoplastic studies at present the growing trend is to use a new definition rather than borrowing one from the nanomaterial field gigault et al 2021 although there is no consensus on size definition for nanoplastic the entire scientific community has realized the importance of developing analytical methods for nanoscale plastic debris in this work the more commonly adopted definition in the field of plastic research is used i e nanoplastics are plastic particles 1000 nm as they demonstrate colloidal behavior schwaferts et al 2019 there is currently a methodological gap for the separation quantification and identification of nanoplastics cai et al 2020 many of the protocols developed for microplastic analysis cannot be directly applied to nanoplastics and so new methods are required to fill the gap mintenig et al 2018 schwaferts et al 2019 in previous reports several protocols were designed to separate spherical particles ignoring the irregularly shaped particles that actually compose the majority of plastics in environmental samples karami 2017 preconcentration e g ultrafiltration cloud point extraction zhou et al 2019 and ultracentrifugation abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 have been used to enrich plastic particles in samples for subsequent separation asymmetric flow field flow fractionation af4 was reported as an ideal tool to divide polydisperse particle distributions into monodisperse ones moon et al 2004 and can be coupled with multi angle light scattering mals to determine size distributions abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 gigault et al 2017 other hyphenated technologies can also carry out separation and identification simultaneously pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms zhou et al 2019 and raman tweezers gillibert et al 2019 were reported to successfully separate and identify several kinds of micro and nanoplastics in spiked samples nanoparticle tracking analysis nta can be used to obtain particle concentration and size distribution lambert and wagner 2016 nta is highly sensitivity to particle concentration by measuring not only light scattering intensity e g dynamic light scattering dls li et al 2019 but also number based size distributions in aqueous samples scanning electron microscopy sem hernandez et al 2019 2017 and raman microscopy gillibert et al 2019 can be used to observe the morphology of nanoplastics in synthetic and environmental samples however only five reports succeeded in detecting nanoplastics in real field samples including relatively clean seawater ter halle et al 2017 snow samples materić et al 2020 air samples xu et al 2020 and soil sand extracts davranche et al 2020 wahl et al 2021 nevertheless nanoplastic analysis remains a challenging task due to the complexity of environmental sample matrix which can cause interference in detection methods and the low concentrations which often fall below the limit of detection lod of instruments for example the lod of dls is about 1011 1015 particles l filipe et al 2010 nta requires at least 109 particles l a limit which is highly dependent on setting selections and user experience gallego urrea et al 2010 sladek et al 2019 the lod for py gc ms depends on polymer type and is 4 mg l for polystyrene ps which translates to 9 08 1011 particles l for 200 nm spheres mintenig et al 2018 raman tweezer also requires a high concentration of particles to avoid spending an impractical amount of time looking for targets gillibert et al 2019 therefore many proposed methods fail to detect nanoplastics in real field samples because of the low endogenous concentration of nanoplastics zhou et al 2019 in order to cater to the high lod of instruments there is a tendency for studies to spike samples with high concentrations of nanoplastics in the range of 1 29 1010 3 37 1017 particles l prior to preconcentration table s1 the highest spike concentration was 5 g l which is 3 37 1017 particles l of 30 nm ps nanoplastics fang et al 2020 these concentrations of nanoplastics are far higher than the concentration of microplastics detected in field water samples and could lead to an overestimation of recovery rates when evaluating preconcentration methods koelmans et al 2019 rezania et al 2018 therefore using more environmentally relevant spike concentrations when evaluating preconcentration methods will be an essential step to bridge the gap between instrumental detection limits and field concentrations of nanoplastics ultracentrifugation is a highly versatile and widely applicable tool for biochemical and polymer science byron et al 2018 ultracentrifugation can concentrate particles and exclude solvent simultaneously giving it a lot of potential to be applied to many types of field samples optical microscopy is considered as a reliable method to observe particles however resolution will be limited by the light source and design of the optical system the recent use of darkfield microscopy has reduced background noise in images so that low contrast samples can be viewed with a high contrast that would otherwise not be seen with brightfield microscopy zamora perez et al 2018 enhanced darkfield microscopy can also be coupled with a hyperspectral imaging hsi spectrometer i e cytoviva to create a fast and powerful tool for the non destructive detection and characterization of nanoplastics badireddy et al 2012 hyperspectral imaging his is a technique that simultaneously collects images and spectral data of a target area by combining components from spectrophotometry advanced optics and computer software it produces two dimensional images that contain entire reflectance spectra within each pixel with the range of captured wavelengths typically running from near infrared to visible light as each material has a unique spectrum materials can be identified within the images by comparing spectral data to references in fact this technique has already been successfully applied to identify various nanomaterials in biological tissues roth et al 2015 in addition to polystyrene particles in homogenized freeze dried fish brains mattsson et al 2017 the goal of this study was to utilize ultracentrifugation as a pretreatment method to increase the concentration of nanoplastics in river water samples spiked with environmentally relevant concentrations of spherical and fragmented polystyrene sps and fps spikes concentrations of initial and enriched spiked samples were characterized using uv vis spectroscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis nta to assess the effectiveness of preconcentration potential changes in the morphology in the ps standards from ultracentrifugation was assessed with sem finally we simultaneously visualized and identified ps spikes using enhanced dark field hyperspectral microscopy to further confirm their presence in enriched water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation spherical and fragmented ps nanoplastics spherical ps sps latex 600 1000 nm 2 5 w v latex p107774 and 5 0 μm 6 1 0500 were supplied from aladdin co and tianjin baseline chromtech research center china respectively fragmented ps fps particles were prepared from 5 0 μm spheres by adding 1 5 μl of the ps latex into a glass bottle with 30 ml milli q water and then ultrasonicating the suspensions with a probe sonicator scientz iid ningbo scientz biotechnology co ltd china samples were prepared in triplicate and sonicated at 60 w for 10 20 or 30 min to evaluate the ultracentrifugation method various spiked milli q water and river water samples were prepared the river water was collected by the shore of yingtao river which is a freshwater river in shanghai 121 26 41 e 31 1 45 n a five liter glass bottle was filled with surface water 0 10 cm in depth using a steel bucket the initial suspensions were made by adding 45 µl of sps latex 600 1000 nm or fps suspension into 800 ml milli q water or river water and then stirring with a glass rod for 2 min afterwards suspensions were poured through a nylon membrane filter ny2004700 millipore to exclude the large microplastics and impurities 20 μm after filtration the filtrate was transferred into glass cylinders 25 cm in height and allowed to settle to exclude large particles 1 μm from supernatant according to the stokes law particles larger than 1 μm will settle 2 cm down in water in 6 h so suspensions were allowed to settle for 66 h then the upper 22 cm of water 600 ml was removed with a peristaltic pump and transferred into narrow mouth glass bottles the bottles were kept in a 4 c fridge until use 2 2 size and concentration measurements the hydrodynamic size distributions of sps and fps suspensions were tested using dynamic light scattering with a zetasizer nano malvern panalytical britain zeta potentials of nanoplastic in concentrated water samples were also measured on this machine two ml of suspension was placed into a standard macro cuvette 1 cm in pass length and measurements were taken at room temperature 25 c results were averaged from three independent measurements nanoparticle tracking analysis zetaview particle metrix germany was used to measure particle concentration of 14 sps suspensions all measurements were conducted according to manufacturer s recommendations for each measurement three cycles were performed by scanning 11 cell positions and capturing 30 frames per position at 25 c the camera was set to autofocus with sensitivity of 70 and shutter 70 scattering intensity was detected automatically the captured videos were analyzed by the in built zetaview software 8 05 04 with the maximum and minimum size set to 1000 and 100 nm respectively and the minimum brightness to 100 the same 14 suspensions were also analyzed with uv vis spectroscopy flame ocean optics usa the absorbance of nanoparticles was obtained in triplicate in the spectral range of 180 and 800 nm using milli q water as reference hence a spectrophotometric standard curve could be created from nta and uv vis data to quantify particle concentration after enrichment without sacrificing samples 2 3 ultracentrifugation a new aspiration device was designed to remove 4 ml of supernatant with minimal disturbance to the bottom ml in tubes in preliminary experiment 1 ml of milli q water was poured into a centrifugation tube and the syringe was lowered until it touched the surface of the water the height was marked as the position to remove the supernatant only leaving behind 1 ml see fig 3c it is important to note that this device cannot be used to remove samples accurately in volume mass the ultracentrifugation was carried out on a beckman optima xpn 80 ultracentrifuge beckman coulter palo alto ca with the beckman sw 55 ti ultracentrifuge rotor and 5 2 ml tubes part no 326819 for spherical spikes sedimentation coefficient s were calculated based on svedberg s theory and written into eq 1 1 4 3 π r v 3 ρ p ρ s f u ω 2 r s where r v is the volume equivalent particle radius ρ p is the particle density ρ s is the solvent densit y f is the frictional coefficient u is the sedimentation velocity of the solute and ω 2 r is the centrifugal acceleration at a radial distance r from the center of rotation with eq 1 a sedimentation coefficient s greater than 1 25 000 svedberg was calculated for calculated 600 1000 nm sps standard in this current work chen et al 2020 in addition provided that the sedimentation boundary rbnd is relatively sharp and symmetrical the sedimentation coefficient can also be expressed by eq 2 2 s u ω 2 r d r b n d d t ω 2 r where 3 ln r b n d r m s ω 2 t where rm is the radial position of the meniscus in the case of the swing out rotor used in this work the rm and rbnd are 72 8 mm and 108 5 mm respectively therefore to completely sediment 600 1000 nm sps the theoretical centrifugal time at a speed of 20 000 rpm equivalent to a relative centrifugal force rcf of about 41 886 g is on the minute scale according to eq 3 experimentally the centrifugal time was set to 2 h which is long enough to assure a complete sedimentation in preliminary experiments the supernatant in centrifugation tubes was divided evenly into 5 layers each layer 1 ml was gently transferred to a cuvette to test the absorbance before centrifugation 5 ml of spiked samples were added into 5 individual tubes and 5 ml of milli q water was run in parallel as a blank sample after each round of centrifugation the run was stopped and the supernatant 4 ml was removed using the custom aspiration device afterwards 4 ml of fresh spiked suspension was added in each tube except the blank sample for next run of centrifugation the uv vis absorbance of blank sample after centrifugation was evaluated to account for possible contamination during the experimental process to determine the particle recovery of ultracentrifugation enrichment method each layer from the tube was tested individually with uv vis spectroscopy after each cumulative centrifugation time that is after 1 2 3 4 12 rounds table s2 differences between absorbance of the four top layers were assessed by analysis of variance followed by kruskal wallis non parametric with corrected p values for multiple comparison p 0 05 was considered significance the relationships between absorbance and concentration were curve fitted using graphpad prism 8 2 1 graphpad software san diego california usa the recovery of ultracentrifugation enrichment method was calculated by 4 r x ax cx a 0 100 where the x stands for cumulative centrifugation times and rx is corresponding recovery of enriched sample ax stands for the absorbance at 340 nm of bottom layer from tubes after x centrifugation rounds cx stands for the concentration ratio after each centrifugation cx can be 5 14 9 28 13 42 17 55 46 53 50 66 corresponding to the cumulative centrifugation rounds after uv vis testing the suspension was transferred into a 2 ml screw thread vial to preserve the sample for other tests 2 4 sem and hyperspectral microscope duplicate samples were prepared for scanning electron microscopy sem observation and hyperspectral microscopy analysis by drying 50 µl suspensions onto silicon wafers the silicon wafers were coated with platinum for sem imaging the sem images were observed using an s 4800 hitachi japan operating at 3 0 kv to make sure ultracentrifugation did not change the shape or morphology of spikes sps spikes were observed before and after separation and enrichment process an enhanced darkfield microscope with a hyperspectral imaging hsi spectrometer hyperspectral microscope cytoviva usa was used to confirm the presence of sps and fps nanoplastics in concentrated water samples the hyperspectral microscope is a combination of an olympus bx51 upright microscope with a 60x darkfield objective 0 215 µm pixel a visible near infrared vnir 400 1000 nm light source and a transmission grating spectrograph coupled to a ccd camera the light source was a 150 w quartz aluminum halogen bulb with broadband spectrum range of 400 2500 nm analysis was all conducted using cytoviva proprietary version of envi 4 8 hyperspectral imaging and analysis software slides were prepared by resuspending dried samples in 50 µl of filtered milli q water and aliquoting 10 µl to glass slides with coverslips the first step was to build a reference spectra library of each type of spike fig s1 to do this regions of interest were defined using a particle filter with a size threshold of 30 pixels as determined from images of 1000 nm sps screening out larger likely contaminating material from the reference library each spectrum in the library is the average of all the pixels that compose one particle hyperspectral data cubes were then lamp corrected to eliminate the noise from the lamp and at each end of the spectrum the normalized spectra were saved in a reference library after that unknown particles would be scanned and lamp normalized no size threshold was set here so that potential aggregates would not be excluded from analysis and pixels from particles were compared individually to the reference library using the spectral angle mapper sam classification algorithm kruse et al 1993 briefly spectra are converted to vectors and the angle between them is calculated smaller angles correspond to greater similarity and so unknown spectra that fell below the angle threshold of 0 1 from the references were considered a match and colored in the corresponding image this makes it possible that only a small part of a large object or aggregate to be identified as sps or fps in images 2 5 statistics differences between absorbance of the four layers was assessed by analysis of variance followed by kruskal wallis non parametric with corrected p values for multiple comparison p 0 05 was considered significance the relationships between absorbance and concentration were curve fitted using graphpad prism 8 2 1 graphpad software san diego california usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical features of spherical and fragmented ps nanoplastics little is known about the morphology size distribution and polymer types of nanoplastics in complex field samples spherical nanoplastic spikes are widely available and so are most often used in developing separation and characterization methods abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 barber et al 2020 lv et al 2020 schwaferts et al 2020 these particles are round uniform and smooth which is unlikely for weathered nanoplastics found in the environment koelmans et al 2015 in order to better represent this variety in particles both spherical and non spherical fragmented nano sized ps particles with a broad size range were used as internal standards to test the ultracentrifugation separation method fig 1 the spherical ps sps particles were 711 nm on average with a smooth surface fig 1a and b with ultrasonic treatments of different duration particles became more irregularly shaped and from this point on are referred to as fragmented ps fps dls analysis showed that the average hydrodynamic size decreased after ultrasonic treatment 10 30 min fig s2 considering that the average hydrodynamic size of fps is not accurate due to its high polydispersivity index value pdi 0 64 in average after 30 min treatment the size distribution was extracted which revealed that the majority of particles were actually in the range of 615 1106 nm these results suggest that there were still a few particles larger than 1106 nm and that they strongly affected the average hydrodynamic size fig 1c therefore the size distribution of fps treated with 30 min was adequately uniform and so 30 min was selected as a suitable treatment duration for producing fps sps and fps particles larger than 1000 nm will be removed during the subsequent settling step in particles preparation see section 2 1 after settling the size of particles was determined with sem as the low and more environmentally relevant particle concentration was too low for dls in terms of morphology fps nanoplastics are different from sps nanoplastics fig 1d the irregular shape and relatively rough surface of our fps particles are more environmentally relevant karami 2017 it is well known that plastic particles degrade and fragment in the environment which causes changes in bulk structure such as cracking embrittlement and flaking chamas et al 2020 this extends to micro and nanoplastics as studies fragmenting plastics in the environment observed irregularly shaped plastics with rough surfaces song et al 2020 weinstein et al 2016 on the other hand spherical particles are easier to utilize as they have the optimal shape for quantitative techniques e g nta and dls and are commercially available in highly concentrated solutions therefore sps were use as spikes to optimize equipment parameters and test the feasibility of using ultracentrifugation for enriching nanoplastics in water samples then fps spikes were used to mimic realistic nanoplastics making it more readily applicable in the characterization of field samples 3 2 quantification of sps and fps spikes in samples particle concentration was measured using uv vis spectroscopy at λ 340 nm because this band was enhanced fig 2 a and weakly influenced by media i e milli q and river water fig s3 a standard curve was prepared using 14 sps suspensions ranging from 8 86 108 3 80 1010 particles l fig 2b the particle concentrations particles l were calculated based on the average hydrodynamic size of sps nanoplastics 711 nm and assuming that the density is the same as that of bulk ps there was a strong linear relationship between uv vis absorbance and calculated particle concentration with a linear determination coefficient r 2 of 0 9969 and pearson value p 0 0001 fig 2b and c the lod of uv vis on sps nanoplastics defined as three times the baseline noise s n 3 was about 7 24 108 particles l the limit of quantification loq considering an s n ratio of 10 was 2 41 109 particles l for 600 1000 nm sps in water samples particle concentrations were verified using nta excluding concentrations below 2 21 109 particles l as they fall below the lod of nta table s3 the standard curve built from the nta measurements covered 2 21 109 1 63 1010 particles l fig s4 and fit the linear model r2 0 9570 slightly less than the one based on calculated particle concentrations therefore calculated concentrations were considered to be good approximations of spike concentrations in the 14 suspensions uv vis can be a useful tool for the rapid quantification of nanoplastic at low endogenous concentrations in field samples in this study the particle concentration of sps and fps nanoplastics in initial water samples was 7 12 109 and 7 24 108 particles l respectively these concentrations are the lowest in literature for studies that developed analytical methods using spiked samples gillibert et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 table s1 therefore our method shows promise for real life application compared to previously reported methods that could not be applied to real field samples 3 3 analytical performance of separation and enrichment method prior to analysis it is essential to quantify particles lost during pretreatments since significant losses can result in lower particle concentrations that fall below the lod of the analytical method and thus an inaccurate determination here the performance of the stainless steel filter base custom aspiration device and ultracentrifugation was tested using uv vis spectroscopy the absorbance of filtrate from the stainless steel filter base 0 018 was 800 higher than that from the sand core filter base 0 002 fig 3 a the latter falling below the lod of uv vis 0 003 therefore the stainless steel filter base was used rather than the typical sand core filter base in the prefiltration step fig 3a in the subsequent ultracentrifugation step 5 ml water samples were added into 5 2 ml swing out centrifuge tubes the sample would later be separate into five 1 ml layers defined by their position from the surface layers 1 4 refer to the 4 ml of the uppermost layers and layer 5 refers to 1 ml at the bottom samples were centrifuged at 20 000 rpm for 2 h and the absorbance of each layer was analyzed by uv vis after a single round of ultracentrifugation there was no significant differences in the average absorbance among the top 4 layers of spiked milli q and river water samples with sps or fps p 0 05 and values were less than that of the initial samples the absorbance of the bottom layer was higher than that of initial samples fig 3b to further concentrate the sample the top 4 ml were removed and replaced with fresh sample and the process was repeated several times in order to reduce disturbance of ps particles in the bottom layer when removing the supernatant a custom aspiration device was used to gently remove the top layers in tubes fig 3c a 1000 μl pipette was used to add fresh water samples the resulting reduction in mass in the tubes were not exactly 4 g fig 3d preliminary experiments showed small variations in the volumes drawn with the average mass removed from 12 replicates being 4 027 0 046 g the average was used to calculate recovery in the following rounds of ultracentrifugation this aspiration device can be used to remove upper supernatant with minimal disturbance and loss of nanoplastics to bottom layers after 12 rounds of centrifugation the average absorbance of the top layers in spiked milli q samples was 0 0045 0 0077 when spiked with sps and 0 0004 0 0011 when spiked with fps fig 4 the average absorbance of the top layers in spiked river water samples was 0 0133 0 0175 with sps and 0 0047 0 0073 with fps spikes respectively this confirmed that sps were successfully concentrated into the bottom layer leaving very few particles evenly dispersed in the top layers after ultracentrifugation the absorbance and recovery of the bottom 1 ml was also tested fig 5 based on the final added mass 50 66 g and the bottom sample mass post treatment 1 g an enrichment factor of about 50 66 was calculated to account for the effect of absorbance from impurities a blank sample of milli q water was centrifuged following the same samples protocol and in parallel with spiked samples table s2 after 12 rounds of ultracentrifugation the absorbance of blank samples was 0 001 for both sps and fps spikes these values were subtracted from sample measurements to give the final reported values this was also done for river water samples table s4 the final absorbances of enriched samples were 0 520 and 0 157 for sps and fps in milli q water samples the absorbances were 1 292 and 2 338 for sps and fps in river water samples fig 5 after the total ultracentrifugation 12 rounds the highest recovery rate was for fps in milli q 103 3 water followed by fps in river water 87 1 sps in river water 57 9 and sps in milli q 57 0 this differences among different samples can be partially attributed to the differences in zeta potential sps had the most negative value in milli q 34 1 mv then in river water 14 1 mv in comparison fps had lower negative values in river water 11 9 mv and milli q water 8 9 mv fig s5 based on their zeta potentials sps in milli q water was the most stable in suspension and as a result would be more difficult to settle in the tubes resulting in the lowest recovery rate among samples conversely fps in milli q water had the lowest zeta potential and so was the least stable in suspension as such it would more readily aggregate increasing its size and sedimentation rate resulting in the higher recovery rate li et al 2019 in reported studies blank and recovery tests are rarely included in method evaluation cai et al 2020 however as contamination and particle loss are difficult to fully avoid procedural blank samples and recovery tests should always be included during our method development procedure blank tests were conducted to account for contamination and calculate recovery rates to quantify nanoplastic loss from our proposed method the highest recovery rate during enrichment in environmentally relevant river water sample was with fps spikes at 96 4 which is relatively high among reported methods abdolahpur monikh et al 2019 cai et al 2020 correia and loeschner 2018 hildebrandt et al 2020 lin et al 2020 our ultracentrifugation method also enriched the lowest concentration spike among those in literature which will improve the lod and limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of existing methods li et al 2020 3 4 characterization of nanoplastics in spiked laboratory and field samples after enrichment to assess the morphology of sps after the enrichment process sem images were taken of dried samples after round 0 3 6 9 and 12 of ultracentrifugation in milli q fig s6 m0 m1 m4 and river water fig s6 r0 r1 r4 sps were still round and intact after each enrichment step showing that ultracentrifugation is a gentle enrichment method that does not destroy nanoplastics in water samples sps also tended to aggregate together in spiked milli q samples fig s6 m1 m4 while they remained dispersed in spiked river water samples fig s7 the particle density of sps in river water samples was also lower than in milli q samples based on imaging with a large field of vision fig s7 using a hyperspectral microscope equipped with a 60x magnification dark field objective and a visible near infrared light source λ 400 1000 nm we obtained images and spectral information of particles found in spike samples fig 6 reference spectra of the reflected light from sps and fps particles were obtained from suspensions in milli q water then with the spectral angle mapper sam classification algorithm in the envi 4 8 analysis software the reference spectra were used to identify particles in enriched milli q and river water samples fig s1 hyperspectral microscope was a quick way to locate particles 700 nm in size and can characterize their shape and material at the same time it is much faster than other mapping techniques like raman taking minutes instead of hours to image an 90 μm 90 μm area sobhani et al 2019 although other techniques like raman tweezer surface enhanced raman spectroscopy raman imaging and scanning electron microscope rise can also supply morphology and chemical information simultaneously they have higher lods 1010 1017 particles l than hyperspectral microscopy 108 109 particles l in this study fang et al 2020 gillibert et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2020 xu et al 2020 additionally unlike methods such as py gc ms that need to destroy samples to obtain chemical information ter halle et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 hyperspectral microscopy is a non destructive technique and so samples are preserved for additional analytical methods which is essential since given range in the wavelength of light used in hyperspectral microscopy it is not a molecular fingerprinting technique like fourier transformation infrared ftir instead it relies the assumption that there is a unique reflectance spectrum for each material reflectance spectra is not only dependent on the materials it is also sensitive to the surrounding environment therefore users are required to create their own libraries for each combination of material and environment in this case sps and fps particles in water to this end concentrated suspensions of sps and fps in milli q water were imaged to collect reference spectra of spikes prior to analysis of river water samples overall hyperspectral microscopy quickly provides information on particle morphology approximate size distribution and plastic type which complement data from more time consuming quantitative techniques therefore it shows potential for use in nanoplastic detection in previous studies there are some techniques successfully verifying nanoplastic with raman spectroscopy on spiked samples schwaferts et al 2020 or relatively clean samples such as air and seawater samples fu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however nanoplastic samples should be preconcentrated before conducting raman analysis due to the high lod of the raman technique and the low endogenous concentrations in field samples higher particle concentration leads to higher particle density on substrates which facilitates their localization during imaging with the help of ultracentrifugation environmentally relevant shapes and concentrations of nanoplastics were successfully separated and enriched to levels above lods of other techniques allowing verification with uv vis and hyperspectral microscopy techniques this new proposed method can be easily applied to other types of fresh river water because it has been tested using environmentally relevant conditions and uses equipment that is fairly accessible 4 conclusion as nanoplastics are easily ingested by organisms and can damage cells and biological membranes there is an urgent need to determine their environmental concentration this requires an efficient reliable and easy to use separation and preconcentration method to extract the low concentration of nanoplastics in real field water in this work we presented a method for the separation and enrichment of nanoplastics in water samples using ultracentrifugation and evaluated the analytical performance of uv vis spectroscopy nta sem and hsi the protocol developed was successful with low concentrations of spherical and fragmented ps internal standards that are more comparable to levels in real water samples the fragmented nanoplastics were separated and enriched 50 times in river water with a high recovery rate 87 1 establishing its utility for nanoplastics detection in field samples likewise ultracentrifugation is demonstrated as a gentle method that does not destroy or fragment nanoplastic as centrifuge equipment is fairly accessible in most research fields this method can be quickly adopted and contribute greatly to close the knowledge gap on environmental concentrations of nanoplastics after a simple prefiltration researchers can successfully separate and enrich nanoplastics to levels above lods of other techniques and can identify nanoparticles with current techniques or develop more reliable and efficient identification method on well pretreated samples this study provides insight into the separation and enrichment of environmentally relevant nanoplastics in real river water samples which is essential for developing reliable identification methods for unknown nanoplastics in real field samples in the future further work is required to improve the efficiency of ultracentrifugation method such as using larger volume of centrifuge tubes to pretreat bulk water samples and reach higher enrichment factor declaration

16704,dissolved organic carbon derived from biomass pyrogenic smoke sdoc can be transported and deposited with atmospheric aerosols enter aqueous environments and possibly alter aqueous chemistry and quality however the characteristics of sdoc in aqueous environments and their effects on the fate of hydrophobic organic pollutants are poorly understood in this study we found that the emitted sdoc is 7 2 19 6 wt of biochar retained in situ after biomass pyrolysis and the emitted sdoc is approximately 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than dissolved organic carbon doc released from biochar in a short term which indicates that sdoc is a more important source of doc in aqueous environments relative to biochar released doc after a biomass burning pyrolysis event the characteristics of sdoc in aqueous environments are dominated by the 1000 da fraction which accounts for 96 wt of bulk sdoc in comparison with doc in biochar natural water and soil the s275 295 value of sdoc 0 037 0 053 is significantly greater further indicating that sdoc has a smaller molecular size moreover fluorescence eem suggests that a fluorescence component located at the ex em of 205 310 nm and the combinational ranges of fluorescence index 1 28 2 28 humification index 0 07 0 80 and biological index 1 16 1 72 can be used to identify sdoc from doc in other media solubilization experiments indicated that sdoc 20 mg l improved the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants pyrene and triclocarban by 2 6 folds in aqueous environments which potentially enhances the mobility of pollutants and enlarges the potential risk region this study indicates that sdoc may cause a severe harm to aqueous environments in addition to the atmosphere the results have profound implications for comprehensive assessments of the environmental effects of sdoc while promoting its identification and elucidating its behavior in aqueous environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomass pyrogenic smoke dissolved organic carbon fluorescence spectrum solubilization effect aqueous environment hydrophobic organic pollutants 1 introduction biomass pyrolysis or burning occurs frequently in both natural e g wildfire and anthropogenic processes e g burning of crop residues and domestic heating cooking which produce large amounts of smoke organic carbon bond et al 2004 budisulistiorini et al 2017 chen et al 2017 forrister et al 2015 park et al 2020 pastor et al 2020 this organic fraction inevitably enters the atmosphere and becomes an important component of atmospheric aerosols which has a significant effect on atmospheric chemistry and quality laskin et al 2015 lin et al 2017 santíin et al 2016 song et al 2018 first smoke organic carbon is an important fraction of particle matter mass which results in severe haze episodes hoyle et al 2011 jimenez et al 2009 tao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 secondly smoke organic carbon carries a series of toxic organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrogen pahs and phenolic compounds huang et al 2020 li et al 2020b which cause air quality to deteriorate and threaten human health through the respiratory system chen et al 2017 yun et al 2020 thirdly smoke organic carbon can absorb solar radiation thus playing an important role in the water cycle and climate change by altering energy fluxes and radiative forcing chen et al 2017 di lorenzo et al 2017 ding et al 2013 phillips and smith 2015 hence the adverse effects of organic carbon in biomass pyrogenic smoke have motivated many laboratory and field studies focusing on the optical properties sources radiative forcing and compound compositions of this organic fraction in the atmosphere pastor et al 2020 tao et al 2016 huang et al 2020 hems et al 2020 li et al 2020a 2020b tang et al 2020 undoubtedly smoke organic carbon has adverse effects on air quality in addition it can be deposited in aqueous environments following atmospheric transport and the dissolved organic fraction in smoke becomes a significant source of dissolved organic carbon doc in water bao et al 2017 godoy silva et al 2017 hohner et al 2019 jones et al 2017 found that aerosol doc contributes to 5 18 of the total doc of the rivers in the paraíba do sul river drainage area brazil moreover estimates of global deposition aerosol doc back into the ocean ranges from 0 47 1011 kg to 0 9 1011 kg per year kanakidou et al 2012 jurado et al 2008 willey et al 2000 black carbon a refractory form of smoke derived doc sdoc is a major source of dissolved black carbon dbc in the ocean bao et al 2017 reported that the global atmospheric deposition of dbc to the ocean reached 1 8 0 83 109 kg per year furthermore they estimated that the atmospheric deposition of dbc reached approximately 40 of the riverine input to the chinese coastal seas sánchez garcía et al 2012 accounted for atmospheric deposition to be much larger than fluxes from rivers for the northern european shelf consequently aqueous environments e g rivers and oceans are the primary ultimate destinations of sdoc the input of sdoc into aqueous environments alters the aqueous chemistry and doc composition however to date the chemical composition and structural characteristics of sdoc in aqueous environments are poorly understood the difference in chemical composition and structural characteristics of sdoc and doc in natural water also remains unknown clarifying sdoc characteristics is crucial for understanding the effect of sdoc on water chemistry and quality the emission of smoke carries a large number of organic pollutants e g pahs and phenolic compounds huang et al 2020 lin et al 2016 lin et al 2018 which inevitably deposit with sdoc into aqueous environments furthermore with the rapid development of industry and agriculture many organic pollutants e g pahs personal care products and antibiotics are artificially discharged into aqueous environments causing organic pollutants in aqueous environments to be ubiquitous brausch and rand 2011 carvalho and santos 2016 latimer and zheng 2003 sun et al 2014 these situations increase the probability of the coexistence of organic pollutants and sdoc in aqueous environments the sdoc may interact with coexisting organic pollutants and alter their water stability or solubility which directly determines the mobility bioavailability and hazardous nature of pollutants therefore exploring the effect of sdoc on the stability or solubility of organic pollutants in aqueous environments is critical for understanding and assessing of the environmental effects of sdoc in this study three different biomasses were pyrolyzed at different temperatures 300 900 c and the generated sdocs were collected first elemental analysis and various spectral determinations e g fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption spectrum and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectrum were performed to clarify the physicochemical properties and components of sdoc second data concerning the spectral characteristics of doc in natural water and soil were collected and compared with the spectral characteristics of sdoc to understand the discrepancies between sdoc and doc in natural water and soil and finally a solubilization experiment was conducted to explore the effect of sdoc on the stability or solubility of hydrophobic organic pollutants in aqueous environments this study contributes to the spectral identification of sdoc in aqueous environments and assess the effect of sdoc on the fate of organic pollutants in aqueous environments 2 methods and materials 2 1 generation and collection of sdoc from biomass pyrolysis sdoc was generated by pyrolyzing biomass including corn straw cs wheat straw ws and pinewood sawdust pw in a temperature controlled tube furnace o ktf1200 jiangsu china n2 was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0 5 l min the pyrolysis temperatures ranged from 300 to 900 c with a temperature interval of 150 c and heating rate of 20 c min the retention time at the pre set final temperature was 3 h the raw smoke was passed through 500 ml ultrapure water prepared by an ultrapure water meter with resistivity of 18 2 ω cm unique s20 rsj water purification technology co xiamen china in a bottle with an ice bath to cool the smoke and promote retrieval after 3 h the smoke solution was sonicated for 30 min 100 w allow doc attached to the insoluble particles to dissolve in the water and then pass through a filter with an aperture of 0 45 μm to remove the insoluble particles the filtered solution was denoted as doc in biomass pyrogenic smoke sdoc finally the sdoc solution was stored at 4 c the solid production biochar after pyrolysis was also collected and ground to pass through a 100 mesh sieve and biochar samples were used to characterize and compare with sdoc meanwhile a control experiment blank experiment was conducted by heating the tube furnace without biomass addition at a median temperature of 600 c and the tail gas was passed through the ultrapure water with ice bath 2 2 molecular size fractionation according to our preliminary dialysis experiment the bulk sdoc mainly consisted of the components with molecular sizes less than 1000 da abundance 90 wt thus the bulk sdoc solution was divided into two fractions 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction the two molecular size fractions were divided using the dialysis method the dialysis experiment was performed in a 1000 ml beaker a 100 ml sdoc solution in a dialysis bag was immersed in 400 ml deionized water with magnetic stirring for 4 h afterward the solution out of the dialysis bag was collected 400 ml fresh deionized water was added to the beaker and the solution dialyzed this procedure was repeated four times later the four solutions out of the dialysis bag were mixed this part of sdoc comprised the 1000 da fraction the sdoc in the dialysis bag after dialysis comprised the 1000 da fraction the two solutions containing different molecular size fractions were stored at 4 c a blank experiment conducted with ultrapure water in a dialysis bag and then dialyzed using the same procedure above the recovery of sdoc ranged from 86 to 98 after dialysis 2 3 characterization of sdoc doc contents in bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction solutions were determined by using total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the accuracy of this instrument is 0 1 0 2 and the limit of determination is 0 05 mg l the ph of bulk sdoc was determined as the solutions were diluted into 0 5 g l using 0 01 mol l nacl solution prior to the characterization of solid sdoc a part of the bulk sdoc solution was freeze dried the bulk h c n and o contents in bulk sdoc were determined using an elemental analyzer thermo fisher flash the surface chemistry of the freeze dried bulk sdoc was provided by a nexus 460 ftir spectrophotometer recording the spectrum from 4000 to 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and the assignments of functional groups were made based on previous research chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and shown in table s1 oxygen containing functional groups of sdoc were quantified using a modified boehm titration method text s1 in supplementary material boehm et al 1964 tessmer et al 1997 the main element contents and the ph of the biochar were also determined the detailed procedures were shown in text s2 the calculations of the c yields of sdoc and biochar are shown in text s3 in addition bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction solutions were diluted to 10 mg l minimizing re absorption effect and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv probe 1780 shimadzu japan at 1 nm increments the uv vis indexes including the absorption coefficient a m m 1 suva254 l mg c m and s275 295 were used and calculated in this study the calculations of a m and suva254 are presented in text s4 suva254 is positively correlated to with doc aromaticity song et al 2020 weishaar et al 2003 an increase in s275 295 indicates a decrease in the molecular size helms et al 2008 li and hur 2017 fluorescence eem and parallel factor parafac analyses were conducted on bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction solutions the eem spectra of the samples were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 hitachi parafac modeling was conducted using the domfluor toolbox with matlab r2014b mathworks natick ma the details of the determination and modeling were shown in text s5 according the previous studies andersen and bro 2003 mahamuni et al 2020 murphy et al 2010 stedmon and bro 2008 in this study four fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were extracted and three fluorescence indicators including fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix fellman et al 2010 huguet et al 2009 were used the calculation of these indicators is shown in text s5 2 4 solubilization experiment of pyrene and triclocarban pyrene a pah and triclocarban a common ingredient in personal care products were selected as model compounds because of their strong hydrophobicity and are frequently detected in the environment brausch and rand 2011 latimer and zheng 2003 the selected physicochemical properties are listed in table s2 first an sdoc solution of 20 mg l containing 0 01 mol l nacl maintaining ion strength was prepared and the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 05 using naoh and hcl solutions the prepared sdoc solutions 60 ml were transferred into 60 ml brown glass vials a blank experiment was performed with a sdoc free solution following this a methanol solution of pyrene or triclocarban was injected using a micro syringe initial concentration of model compounds in solution was 1 0 mg l greater than their water solubility wherein the methanol in the sdoc solution was kept below 0 1 volume percentage to minimize the cosolvent effect the solution in vials was thoroughly mixed by a spin mixer for 1 min the vials were then placed in a thermostatic incubator and static culture at 25 c at different pre set time intervals a 0 5 ml upper solution was pumped into 4 ml vials and mixed with 2 0 ml methanol the mixed solutions passed through 0 22 μm filter membranes the pyrene and triclocarban in the filtrates were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection uplc uv waters acquity uplctm beh c18 column the deposition kinetics curves of pyrene and triclocarban in different sdoc solutions were plotted using pyrene and triclocarban concentrations in the upper solution versus sampling time moreover after 3 weeks the 60 ml vials were removed from the incubator centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min after centrifugation the solution was mixed with methanol solution volume methanol volume 1 4 and determined by uplc uv the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban in the sdoc solution was their concentration after centrifugation the blank experiment showed that the adsorption quantity of pyrene 0 21 0 09 and triclocarban 4 60 1 13 on vial wall was less than 5 0 of their total added quantity indicating the adsorption effect of vial wall could be neglected each sample was analyzed in triplicate furthermore the partitioning coefficient k oc l g of pollutants pyrene and triclocarban on sdoc was calculated using the equation k oc q oc c s in this equation q oc μg g is the adsorbed quantity of pollutants on sdoc after centrifugation c s μg l is the solubility of pollutants in aqueous solution with sdoc free after centrifugation 2 5 statistical analysis one way anova was applied for statistical analysis mean value standard deviations using spss statistics software version 19 0 spss inc chicago usa a probability of difference greater than 0 95 was considered to indicate a significant result data fitting was conducted using the sigmaplot software version 10 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 c yield and element compositions of sdoc as shown in fig 1 a and table s3 c retained in solid production biochar 15 91 26 08 wt of biomass was greater than doc emitted in smoke 2 61 4 78 wt of biomass after biomass pyrolysis based on 1 33 1012 kg dry mass burned pyrolyzed globally per year zhang et al 2012 we estimated that approximately 2 12 1011 3 46 1011 kg solid carbon in biochar retained in situ and 0 35 1011 0 64 1011 kg sdoc was emitted to atmosphere per year globally our estimate 0 35 1011 0 64 1011 kg closes to the estimate of the global deposition of water soluble organic carbon 0 64 1011 kg yr 1 kanakidou et al 2012 the average atmospheric deposition of 0 46 1011 kg yr 1 water soluble organic carbon jurado et al 2008 and 0 90 1011 kg yr 1 of rainwater doc willey et al 2000 in this study the c yield of sdoc accounted for 7 2 19 6 wt of biochar although the mass of c retained in biochar exceeds that of sdoc emitted into the atmosphere sdoc is more labile mobile and susceptible to photo transformation chen et al 2017 godoy silva et al 2017 sumlin et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 and therefore sdoc plays a more critical role in global c turnover and circulation than biochar furthermore biochar can also release doc but its releasable mass is very low qu et al 2016 used deionized water to extract doc from bamboo and rice derived biochars the obtained doc was only 0 3 1 3 wt of biochar liu et al 2019 used the deionized water and nacl solution to extract the doc from various biomasses including hardwood softer wood grass straw and leaves derived biochars the obtained doc was 0 02 2 0 wt of biochar other studies li et al 2017 jamieson et al 2014 wei et al 2019 wu et al 2018 also reported that the doc released from biochar was only 0 01 2 3 wt of biochar accordingly we estimated that the emitted sdoc accounted for approximately ten to thousand folds of the doc released from biochar after a biomass burning pyrolysis event e g wildfire in the short term which suggests that after a biomass burning pyrolysis event smoke deposition is a more important doc source of global water and soil than biochar release in the short term in addition for all biomasses the c yield of biochar decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature while the c yield of sdoc increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature excluding for pw sdoc fig 1a the c yield of sdoc derived from pw initially increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 450 c and then decreased as the pyrolysis temperature continued to increase to 900 c there was an insignificant difference p 0 05 in the c yield of biochar among the three biomasses but the c yield of sdoc derived from cs and ws was significantly greater than that derived from pw p 0 01 this is because pw possesses more lignin structure table s4 which can be converted into more gaseous compounds e g co co2 ch4 c2 c4 hydrocarbons and water insoluble aromatic organic compounds e g pahs 16c during high temperature pyrolysis cerciello et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 as shown in tables s3 and s5 h 5 09 6 99 wt and o 30 11 40 57 wt contents in sdoc were greater than those in biochar h 0 62 4 61 wt o 9 08 27 17 wt respectively the c content in sdoc 37 42 55 28 wt was less than that in biochar 50 58 77 68 wt fig 1b shows that both the h c an aliphaticity index zhang et al 2020 1 29 1 60 and o c a polarity index zhang et al 2020 0 44 0 65 ratios of sdoc were greater than those of biochar h c 0 09 0 84 o c 0 09 0 34 the above results suggest that both the aliphaticity and polarity of sdoc are significantly greater than those of biochar moreover the aliphaticity h c ratio of sdoc was close to that of biomass while the polarity of sdoc was lower than that of biomass the ph values of the biochar and sdoc are compared in fig s1 and table s3 the ph of all the biochars was greater than 6 0 and most of them were basic which resulted from the basic ash being retained in biochar after biomass pyrolysis ash content 6 45 28 36 wt in table s3 chen et al 2019 however the ph of the sdoc was close to 4 0 indicating strong acidity this is because sdoc contains abundant acid oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl groups and phenolic groups which were identified and determined by the ftir spectrum fig s2 and boehm titration table s6 3 2 uv vis and fluorescence eem spectra of bulk sdoc the uv vis spectra of sdoc are shown in fig s3a c the peak at 250 300 nm of a uv vis spectral signal is attributed to aromatic structure containing substances e g low ring pahs and their derivatives huang et al 2020 phillips et al 2017 in this study the peak height of am at 250 300 nm followed the order cs sdoc ws sdoc pw sdoc the aromatic index suva254 was also used to determine the aromaticity of the sdoc fig 2 a and table s7 show that the suva254 values of cs sdoc range 2 51 2 99 mean 2 75 and ws sdoc range 2 23 2 94 mean 2 67 were greater than those of pw sdoc range 1 70 2 33 mean 2 09 these results indicate that cs sdoc and ws sdoc have greater aromaticity than pw sdoc moreover the suva254 values of the three types of sdoc slightly increased with increasing temperature fig 2a indicating that a higher pyrolysis temperature supports the higher aromaticity of sdoc for all three biomasses shoulder peak values of am at 220 nm were significantly positively correlated with the nitrogen content of sdoc and increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature fig 2a these results suggest that nitrogen containing functional groups e g pyridine structure could be responsible for the shoulder peak values at 220 nm fleming and williams 2019 nitrogen containing functional groups were also found at 1100 1250 nm 1 in the ftir spectrum fig s2 s275 295 is an indicator of the molecular size of doc and its value increases with decreasing molecular size helms et al 2008 li and hur 2017 as shown in fig 2b and table s7 the s275 295 value of pw sdoc range 0 041 0 055 mean 0 048 was greater than that of cs sdoc range 0 037 0 040 mean 0 039 and ws sdoc range 0 037 0 039 mean 0 038 the s275 295 value of pw sdoc increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature whereas the s275 295 values of cs sdoc and ws sdoc slightly changed with increasing pyrolysis temperature the results suggest that sdoc derived from pw has a smaller molecular size and is more pyrolysis temperature dependent than that derived from cs and ws the fluorescence spectra of the sdoc are shown in fig s4 the fluorescence intensity of sdoc was generally enhanced by increasing the pyrolysis temperature and followed the order pw sdoc cs sdoc ws sdoc at each pyrolysis temperature the eem parafac analysis of the fluorescence spectra supported a model containing four components c1 c2 c3 and c4 fig 3 c1 presented a primary excitation maximum of 270 nm a secondary peak at 220 nm and an emission maximum of 305 nm this component could be an aromatic protein polyphenol like structure of low molecular size e g tryptophan and tyrosine chen et al 2003 cuss and guéguen 2012a c2 presented a primary excitation maximum of 230 nm a secondary peak at 280 nm and an emission maximum of 340 nm this component has also been described as a typical protein polyphenol like fluorescent component yang et al 2019a c2 had higher emission wavelengths than c1 this red shift in the excitation emission maximum in c2 was associated with increased aromaticity and larger molecular size relative to c1 cuss and guéguen 2012b fellman et al 2010 yang et al 2019a c3 featured two peaks at 240 420 nm and 300 420 nm which are classified as humic like substances hydrophobic fractions with large molecular sizes chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 c4 showed two ex em peaks at 205 310 nm and 205 400 nm the stronger fluorescence intensity at 205 310 nm could be low ring pahs and their derivatives mahamuni et al 2020 yang et al 2019b many previous studies lin et al 2016 2017 2018 mahamuni et al 2020 wang et al 2009 have reported that biomass pyrolysis burning could produce abundant low ring pahs and their derivatives moreover the weaker fluorescence intensity at 205 400 nm was a typical fulvic acid like substance with a large molecular size chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 although c4 had two peaks the fluorescence intensity at 205 310 nm was far greater than that at 205 400 nm indicating c4 was dominated by low ring pahs and their derivatives which were located at 205 310 nm as shown in fig 4 a c and table s7 the relative abundance of the four fluorescent components c1 c4 of sdoc followed the order c1 range 0 269 0 759 mean 0 527 c4 range 0 172 0 317 mean 0 239 c2 range 0 055 0 301 mean 0 156 c3 range 0 012 0 16 mean 0 078 for each biomass derived sdoc of all biomasses pw sdoc contained the highest c1 abundance range 0 683 0 759 mean 0 718 and the minimal c2 abundance range 0 055 0 081 mean 0 061 and c3 abundance range 0 0 012 0 019 mean 0 014 ws sdoc contained the minimal c1 abundance range 0 269 0 428 mean 0 367 and the highest c2 abundance range 0 171 0 301 mean 0 236 and c3 abundance range 0 102 0 160 mean 0 127 and c1 c2 and c3 abundances of cs sdoc were medium this result that suggests the abundance of the fluorescent component of sdoc is biomass type dependent moreover fig 4a c show that increasing the pyrolysis temperature significantly improved the c1 abundance of sdoc but has an irregular effect on the abundances of the other three components fi is a typical indicator used to distinguish sources of doc gao et al 2017 mcknight et al 2001 in this study the fi value followed the order cs sdoc range 2 07 2 27 mean 2 17 ws sdoc range 1 93 2 28 mean 2 15 pw sdoc range 1 27 1 65 mean 1 49 fig 2c and table s7 hix is employed to indicate the condensation degree of aromatic structures or the degree of conjugation of unsaturated aliphatic chains in doc fuentes et al 2007 hur et al 2011 as shown in fig 2d and table s7 the hix values of cs sdoc range 0 42 0 77 mean 0 56 and ws sdoc range 0 59 0 8 mean 0 69 were significantly greater p 0 05 than that of pw sdoc range 0 07 0 13 mean 0 09 this result suggests that cs sdoc and ws sdoc have higher aromaticity and humification degrees than those derived from pw sdoc which agrees with the result of suva254 mentioned above therefore both fi and hix can be used to distinguish straw derived sdoc from wood derived sdoc sdoc with high hix values 0 42 0 90 and fi values 1 93 2 28 can be ascribed to burning pyrolysis of agricultural straw and sdoc with low hix value 0 07 0 13 and fi value 1 27 1 65 can be ascribed to wood burning pyrolysis bix values of sdoc among the three biomasses had an insignificant difference p 0 05 as shown in fig 2d and table s7 the bix values of cs sdoc and ws sdoc were all greater than 1 3 whereas pw sdoc had some bix values less than 1 3 therefore a bix value less than 1 3 can be a boundary line to distinguish wood derived sdoc from agricultural straw derived sdoc martínez et al 2020 found that cellulose hemicellulose and lignin content of biomass strongly influenced solid and volatile species yields during torrefaction the difference in the spectral characteristics of sdoc between agricultural straw and forest wood can also be ascribed to the different contents of hemicellulose and lignin table s4 3 3 characteristics of different molecular size fraction in sdocs as shown in table s6 the 1000 da fraction was the main component of bulk sdoc accounting for more than 96 wt of bulk sdoc while 1000 da fraction only accounted for less than 4 wt of bulk sdoc thus the characteristics of bulk sdoc were mainly dependent on that of the 1000 da fraction which was supported by the analogous uv vis spectra fig s3a f and fluorescence spectra figs s4 and s5 between the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction moreover the 1000 da fraction exhibited very different uv vis spectra fig s3g i and fluorescence spectra fig s6 relative to the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction for example the peaks at 250 300 nm and 220 nm were obvious in the uv vis spectra of the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction but disappeared weakened in the uv vis spectrum of the 1000 da fraction furthermore the ftir spectra of the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction were also different fig s7 bulk sdoc had obvious peaks at 1100 1250 cm 1 and 1700 cm 1 which were ascribed to c o c n and c o respectively while these peaks disappeared weakened in the ftir spectrum of the 1000 da fraction therefore we conclude that the 1000 da fraction contains more oxygen containing functional groups than the 1000 da fraction the s275 295 values of the bulk sdoc 0 037 0 053 and the 1000 da fraction 0 036 0 055 were also equivalent and they were significantly greater than those of the 1000 da fraction 0 010 0 019 fig 2b tables s7 and s8 this result further proves that s275 295 can be a molecular size index higher s275 295 value indicates smaller molecular size and vice versa helms et al 2008 li and hur 2017 nonetheless the suva254 values among bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction showed insignificant differences p 0 05 for each biomass fig 2a tables s7 and s8 indicating their equivalent aromaticity fluorescence spectra of the 1000 da and 1000 da fractions are shown in figs s5 and s6 these two fractions exhibited very different fluorescence signal distributions this result was supported by the abundance of fluorescence components in different molecular size fractions as shown in fig 4d f and table s8 the 1000 da fraction was dominated by c1 33 91 5 which was analogous to the abundance distribution of fluorescence components in the bulk sdocs however the 1000 da fraction was dominated by c2 and c3 components 71 99 fig 4g i and table s8 this result suggests that the 1000 da fraction is mainly composed of low molecular weight protein polyphenol like substances whereas the 1000 da fraction is mainly composed of humic like substances and high molecular weight protein polyphenol like substances as mentioned above c4 is mainly composed of low molecular weight organic pollutants including pahs and their derivatives etc and few fulvic acid like substances therefore after bulk sdoc dialysis high molecular weight substances fulvic acid like substance of c4 were retained in the 1000 da fraction and c4 in the 1000 da fraction was dominated by low ring pahs and their derivatives relative to the bulk sdoc fig 4d f show that c4 abundance in the 1000 da fraction of pw sdoc was lower than that of cs and ws sdoc suggesting that sdoc derived from straw pyrolysis could produce more organic pollutants than that derived from wood pyrolysis as shown in fig 2c e and tables s7 8 the bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction had an insignificant difference in the fi and bix for pw sdoc p 0 05 but the bulk sdoc and 1000 da fraction had significantly greater fi and bix values than the 1000 da fraction p 0 05 for cs sdoc and ws sdoc the results suggest that molecular size has a greater effect on the bix and fi of straw derived sdoc relative to wood derived sdoc in addition the hix value of 1000 da fraction was greater than those of the bulk sdoc and 1000 da fraction further indicating that the 1000 da fraction was mainly composed of humic like substances of large molecular size despite the 1000 da and 1000 da fractions the hix values followed the order cs sdoc ws sdoc pw sdoc these results imply that straw pyrolysis is more beneficial for humic like substance formation than wood pyrolysis 3 4 difference in uv vis and fluorescence spectra between sdoc and doc of natural water and soil the uv vis spectrum indexes suva254 s275 295 of sdoc were used for comparison with those of doc in biochar natural water and soil fig 5 a and table s9 as shown in fig 5a the suva254 range of sdoc range 1 7 2 9 mean 2 49 was included by the ranges of biochar range 0 11 10 23 mean 3 19 natural water range 0 5 12 2 mean 3 68 and soil range 0 19 12 2 mean 6 8 therefore the aromaticity index suva254 was not a feature indicator of sdoc for distinguishing it from other media nonetheless s275 295 range 0 037 0 053 mean 0 041 of sdoc was greater than that of doc in biochar range 0 002 0 036 mean 0 019 natural water range 0 003 0 039 mean 0 018 and soil range 0 008 0 020 mean 0 014 indicating that the molecular size of sdoc was smaller than that of doc in other media in this study we found that more than 96 wt of sdoc less than 1000 da table s6 while xu and guo 2017 reported that there is approximately 47 wt 50 wt and 70 wt of doc less than 1000 da in river lake and sea water respectively this result further proves that the molecular size of sdoc is smaller than that of doc in other media based on this s275 295 values of 0 037 0 053 can be used to distinguish sdoc from doc in other media biochar natural water and soil fluorescence spectrum indicators fi hix bix of sdoc biochar doc water doc and soil doc are also compared in fig 5b c and table s9 the fi values of sdoc range 1 28 2 28 mean 1 94 were close to those of water doc range 0 72 2 92 mean 1 55 and soil doc range 1 07 2 03 mean 1 52 and they were higher than the fi values of biochar doc range 0 12 0 99 mean 0 67 in contrast the bix values of sdoc range 1 16 1 72 mean 1 51 were equivalent to those of biochar doc range 1 08 2 23 mean 1 65 but they were greater than those of water doc range 0 13 1 38 mean 0 75 and soil doc range 0 25 1 00 mean 0 69 the hix values of sdoc range 0 07 0 80 mean 0 45 were significantly lower than that of biochar doc range 0 30 22 9 mean 5 03 water doc range 0 38 18 9 mean 4 45 and soil doc range 0 38 18 9 mean 0 45 based on this the combination of fi 1 28 2 28 hix 0 07 0 80 and bix 1 16 1 72 can be used to distinguish sdoc from biochar doc natural water doc and natural soil doc furthermore in comparison with the fluorescence spectrum of doc in natural water and soil the c4 component at the maximal ex em of 205 310 nm in sdoc was rarely found in natural unpolluted water and soil fernández romero et al 2016 holland et al 2018 kida et al 2019 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2020 c4 component featured low ring pahs and their derivatives thus the high abundance of c4 20 can also be used to identify sdoc fig 4a c 3 5 solubilization effect of sdoc on pyrene and triclocarban an experiment concerning the effect of sdoc on strong hydrophobic pollutant pyrene and triclocarban deposition in an aqueous solution was performed the deposition curves of pyrene and triclocarban are shown in figs s8 and s9 respectively most sdocs suppressed the deposition of pyrene and triclocarban in comparison with the sdoc free solution the results suggest that the input of sdocs into the water extends the residence time of strong hydrophobic pollutants in water which may further enhance the mobility of pollutants and expand the potential risk region in the environment the inhibitory effect of sdocs on the deposition of pyrene and triclocarban was possibly owing to the strong sorption of doc and solubilization of these pollutants cai et al 2017 celis et al 1998 zhou et al 2010 to verify this speculation the solubilization results are shown in fig 6 a and b the inhibitory ability of different sdocs on the deposition of pollutants was consistent with their solubilization ability for instance of all pw sdocs pw sdoc derived from pyrolysis at 600 c had a minimal inhibitory effect on pollutant deposition and minimal solubilization effect on pollutants while pw sdocs derived from pyrolysis at 450 c and 750 c had the maximal inhibitory effect on pollutant deposition and the maximal solubilization effect on pollutants as well as shown in fig 6a and b the pyrolysis temperature had an irregular effect on the solubilization effect of sdoc and some sdocs had a negligible effect on the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban nevertheless under natural conditions the combustion or pyrolysis of biomass is carried out simultaneously at multi temperatures therefore the average solubility of pollutants in various pyrolysis temperatures produced sdoc solutions could better reflect the solubilization effect of sdocs in a real situation the average solubility of pyrene was 184 2 257 0 and 341 2 μg l for cs sdoc ws sdoc and pw sdoc solutions respectively they were 2 0 3 0 folds of the solubility of pyrene in sdoc free solution 107 6 μg l the average solubility of triclocarban was 191 0 195 6 and 341 2 μg l for cs sdoc ws sdoc and pw sdoc solutions respectively they were 4 0 6 0 folds of the solubility of triclocarban in sdoc free solution 57 6 μg l it is generally considered that the adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants on natural organic matters increases with increasing c content liu et al 2020 nguyen et al 2005 tao and lu 1999 for all sdocs the solubilization experiment was performed with the same doc concentration of 20 mg l a doc concentration of 20 mg l for different sdocs should cause an approximate solubilization effect on pyrene and triclocarban unexpectedly our results are not consistent with this tendency interestingly fig s10a shows that the adsorption coefficients of pyrene and triclocarban on sdoc were positively correlated with the abundance of c1 in bulk sdoc in comparison with bulk sdoc the positive correlation was further enhanced by the c1 of the 1000 da fraction because of its lower p value and greater r value figs 6c and s10e for example the adsorption coefficient of triclocarban on sdoc had an extremely positive correlation with the c1 abundance of the 1000 da fraction in bulk sdoc p 0 01 fig 6c as mentioned above c1 of the 1000 da fraction was dominated by aromatic protein polyphenol like structures with low molecular size e g tryptophan and tyrosine the hydrophobic structure benzene ring of c1 could combine with hydrophobic pollutants whereas the hydrophilic functional groups e g nh2 and oh of c1 stabilized the conjugates in the aqueous environment hence c1 of the 1000 da fraction as a surfactant like agent could improve the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants the negative correlation between the adsorption coefficient of pollutants on sdoc and the abundance of other fluorescent components c2 c3 and c4 fig s10b d and f h indicate these fluorescent components play inhibitory roles in the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban in particular the adsorption coefficient of pyrene and triclocarban on sdoc was significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of c4 of the 1000 da fraction in bulk sdoc fig 6d c4 of the 1000 da fraction played a dominantly inhibitory role in the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban as mentioned above c4 in the 1000 da fraction was dominated by low molecular size pahs and their derivatives thus a speculated mechanism was that the small molecules in c4 of sdoc could compete with pyrene and triclocarban for the binding sites on the surfactant like sdoc e g the aromatic protein polyphenol like structures of c1 therefore the high abundance of c4 in the 1000 da fraction suppressed the solubilization effect of sdoc 4 conclusion wild outdoor biomass burning pyrolysis events e g wildfire and agricultural residue burning pyrolysis can produce large amounts of doc in the short term and be an important source of doc in natural water the input of biomass pyrogenic doc into natural water has two pathways one is released from solid production biochar and the other is the deposition of sdoc in this study we found that the release of doc from biochar was only 0 01 2 30 wt of biochar whereas the doc in smoke reached 7 2 19 6 wt of biochar after biomass pyrolysis indicating sdoc far exceeded 10 folds of the doc released from biochar after a biomass burning pyrolysis event therefore we deduced that sdoc has a more significant effect on water quality than biochar released doc in the short term after a biomass burning pyrolysis event e g wildfire we also estimated that global biomass burning pyrolysis could produce approximately 0 35 1011 0 64 1011 kg sdoc per year indicating that sdoc deposition was an important source of doc in the global aqueous environment furthermore the characteristics of sdoc were very different from those of doc in biochar and natural water and soil the characteristics of sdoc are dominated by the 1000 da fraction which accounts for 96 wt of bulk sdoc higher s275 295 values indicated that sdoc had a far smaller molecular size than doc in other media including biochar natural water and soil the fluorescence component located at ex em of 205 310 nm and the combination of fi 1 28 2 28 hix 0 07 0 80 and bix 1 16 1 72 could be used to identify sdoc from biochar doc natural water doc and soil doc on the one hand the negative effect of sdoc on aqueous environments was caused by the carried aromatic pollutants of sdoc on the other hand our solubilization experiment indicated that sdoc significantly improved the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants pyrene and triclocarban in aqueous environments which could enhance the mobility of pollutants and expand the potential risk region this study suggests that sdoc from biomass burning pyrolysis potentially has a significant negative impact on water quality in addition to polluting atmosphere meanwhile owing to the conclusion of this study was obtained from a laboratory experiment a further research on the role of sdoc in natural water needs to be conducted in the future nonetheless the results of this study have significant implications for assessments of the environmental effect of sdoc and elucidate potential methods for identifying its presence and behavior in water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16704,dissolved organic carbon derived from biomass pyrogenic smoke sdoc can be transported and deposited with atmospheric aerosols enter aqueous environments and possibly alter aqueous chemistry and quality however the characteristics of sdoc in aqueous environments and their effects on the fate of hydrophobic organic pollutants are poorly understood in this study we found that the emitted sdoc is 7 2 19 6 wt of biochar retained in situ after biomass pyrolysis and the emitted sdoc is approximately 1 3 orders of magnitude greater than dissolved organic carbon doc released from biochar in a short term which indicates that sdoc is a more important source of doc in aqueous environments relative to biochar released doc after a biomass burning pyrolysis event the characteristics of sdoc in aqueous environments are dominated by the 1000 da fraction which accounts for 96 wt of bulk sdoc in comparison with doc in biochar natural water and soil the s275 295 value of sdoc 0 037 0 053 is significantly greater further indicating that sdoc has a smaller molecular size moreover fluorescence eem suggests that a fluorescence component located at the ex em of 205 310 nm and the combinational ranges of fluorescence index 1 28 2 28 humification index 0 07 0 80 and biological index 1 16 1 72 can be used to identify sdoc from doc in other media solubilization experiments indicated that sdoc 20 mg l improved the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants pyrene and triclocarban by 2 6 folds in aqueous environments which potentially enhances the mobility of pollutants and enlarges the potential risk region this study indicates that sdoc may cause a severe harm to aqueous environments in addition to the atmosphere the results have profound implications for comprehensive assessments of the environmental effects of sdoc while promoting its identification and elucidating its behavior in aqueous environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomass pyrogenic smoke dissolved organic carbon fluorescence spectrum solubilization effect aqueous environment hydrophobic organic pollutants 1 introduction biomass pyrolysis or burning occurs frequently in both natural e g wildfire and anthropogenic processes e g burning of crop residues and domestic heating cooking which produce large amounts of smoke organic carbon bond et al 2004 budisulistiorini et al 2017 chen et al 2017 forrister et al 2015 park et al 2020 pastor et al 2020 this organic fraction inevitably enters the atmosphere and becomes an important component of atmospheric aerosols which has a significant effect on atmospheric chemistry and quality laskin et al 2015 lin et al 2017 santíin et al 2016 song et al 2018 first smoke organic carbon is an important fraction of particle matter mass which results in severe haze episodes hoyle et al 2011 jimenez et al 2009 tao et al 2016 chen et al 2017 secondly smoke organic carbon carries a series of toxic organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrogen pahs and phenolic compounds huang et al 2020 li et al 2020b which cause air quality to deteriorate and threaten human health through the respiratory system chen et al 2017 yun et al 2020 thirdly smoke organic carbon can absorb solar radiation thus playing an important role in the water cycle and climate change by altering energy fluxes and radiative forcing chen et al 2017 di lorenzo et al 2017 ding et al 2013 phillips and smith 2015 hence the adverse effects of organic carbon in biomass pyrogenic smoke have motivated many laboratory and field studies focusing on the optical properties sources radiative forcing and compound compositions of this organic fraction in the atmosphere pastor et al 2020 tao et al 2016 huang et al 2020 hems et al 2020 li et al 2020a 2020b tang et al 2020 undoubtedly smoke organic carbon has adverse effects on air quality in addition it can be deposited in aqueous environments following atmospheric transport and the dissolved organic fraction in smoke becomes a significant source of dissolved organic carbon doc in water bao et al 2017 godoy silva et al 2017 hohner et al 2019 jones et al 2017 found that aerosol doc contributes to 5 18 of the total doc of the rivers in the paraíba do sul river drainage area brazil moreover estimates of global deposition aerosol doc back into the ocean ranges from 0 47 1011 kg to 0 9 1011 kg per year kanakidou et al 2012 jurado et al 2008 willey et al 2000 black carbon a refractory form of smoke derived doc sdoc is a major source of dissolved black carbon dbc in the ocean bao et al 2017 reported that the global atmospheric deposition of dbc to the ocean reached 1 8 0 83 109 kg per year furthermore they estimated that the atmospheric deposition of dbc reached approximately 40 of the riverine input to the chinese coastal seas sánchez garcía et al 2012 accounted for atmospheric deposition to be much larger than fluxes from rivers for the northern european shelf consequently aqueous environments e g rivers and oceans are the primary ultimate destinations of sdoc the input of sdoc into aqueous environments alters the aqueous chemistry and doc composition however to date the chemical composition and structural characteristics of sdoc in aqueous environments are poorly understood the difference in chemical composition and structural characteristics of sdoc and doc in natural water also remains unknown clarifying sdoc characteristics is crucial for understanding the effect of sdoc on water chemistry and quality the emission of smoke carries a large number of organic pollutants e g pahs and phenolic compounds huang et al 2020 lin et al 2016 lin et al 2018 which inevitably deposit with sdoc into aqueous environments furthermore with the rapid development of industry and agriculture many organic pollutants e g pahs personal care products and antibiotics are artificially discharged into aqueous environments causing organic pollutants in aqueous environments to be ubiquitous brausch and rand 2011 carvalho and santos 2016 latimer and zheng 2003 sun et al 2014 these situations increase the probability of the coexistence of organic pollutants and sdoc in aqueous environments the sdoc may interact with coexisting organic pollutants and alter their water stability or solubility which directly determines the mobility bioavailability and hazardous nature of pollutants therefore exploring the effect of sdoc on the stability or solubility of organic pollutants in aqueous environments is critical for understanding and assessing of the environmental effects of sdoc in this study three different biomasses were pyrolyzed at different temperatures 300 900 c and the generated sdocs were collected first elemental analysis and various spectral determinations e g fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum ultraviolet visible uv vis absorption spectrum and fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectrum were performed to clarify the physicochemical properties and components of sdoc second data concerning the spectral characteristics of doc in natural water and soil were collected and compared with the spectral characteristics of sdoc to understand the discrepancies between sdoc and doc in natural water and soil and finally a solubilization experiment was conducted to explore the effect of sdoc on the stability or solubility of hydrophobic organic pollutants in aqueous environments this study contributes to the spectral identification of sdoc in aqueous environments and assess the effect of sdoc on the fate of organic pollutants in aqueous environments 2 methods and materials 2 1 generation and collection of sdoc from biomass pyrolysis sdoc was generated by pyrolyzing biomass including corn straw cs wheat straw ws and pinewood sawdust pw in a temperature controlled tube furnace o ktf1200 jiangsu china n2 was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0 5 l min the pyrolysis temperatures ranged from 300 to 900 c with a temperature interval of 150 c and heating rate of 20 c min the retention time at the pre set final temperature was 3 h the raw smoke was passed through 500 ml ultrapure water prepared by an ultrapure water meter with resistivity of 18 2 ω cm unique s20 rsj water purification technology co xiamen china in a bottle with an ice bath to cool the smoke and promote retrieval after 3 h the smoke solution was sonicated for 30 min 100 w allow doc attached to the insoluble particles to dissolve in the water and then pass through a filter with an aperture of 0 45 μm to remove the insoluble particles the filtered solution was denoted as doc in biomass pyrogenic smoke sdoc finally the sdoc solution was stored at 4 c the solid production biochar after pyrolysis was also collected and ground to pass through a 100 mesh sieve and biochar samples were used to characterize and compare with sdoc meanwhile a control experiment blank experiment was conducted by heating the tube furnace without biomass addition at a median temperature of 600 c and the tail gas was passed through the ultrapure water with ice bath 2 2 molecular size fractionation according to our preliminary dialysis experiment the bulk sdoc mainly consisted of the components with molecular sizes less than 1000 da abundance 90 wt thus the bulk sdoc solution was divided into two fractions 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction the two molecular size fractions were divided using the dialysis method the dialysis experiment was performed in a 1000 ml beaker a 100 ml sdoc solution in a dialysis bag was immersed in 400 ml deionized water with magnetic stirring for 4 h afterward the solution out of the dialysis bag was collected 400 ml fresh deionized water was added to the beaker and the solution dialyzed this procedure was repeated four times later the four solutions out of the dialysis bag were mixed this part of sdoc comprised the 1000 da fraction the sdoc in the dialysis bag after dialysis comprised the 1000 da fraction the two solutions containing different molecular size fractions were stored at 4 c a blank experiment conducted with ultrapure water in a dialysis bag and then dialyzed using the same procedure above the recovery of sdoc ranged from 86 to 98 after dialysis 2 3 characterization of sdoc doc contents in bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction solutions were determined by using total organic carbon analyzer toc l cpn shimadzu japan the accuracy of this instrument is 0 1 0 2 and the limit of determination is 0 05 mg l the ph of bulk sdoc was determined as the solutions were diluted into 0 5 g l using 0 01 mol l nacl solution prior to the characterization of solid sdoc a part of the bulk sdoc solution was freeze dried the bulk h c n and o contents in bulk sdoc were determined using an elemental analyzer thermo fisher flash the surface chemistry of the freeze dried bulk sdoc was provided by a nexus 460 ftir spectrophotometer recording the spectrum from 4000 to 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and the assignments of functional groups were made based on previous research chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and shown in table s1 oxygen containing functional groups of sdoc were quantified using a modified boehm titration method text s1 in supplementary material boehm et al 1964 tessmer et al 1997 the main element contents and the ph of the biochar were also determined the detailed procedures were shown in text s2 the calculations of the c yields of sdoc and biochar are shown in text s3 in addition bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction solutions were diluted to 10 mg l minimizing re absorption effect and analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv probe 1780 shimadzu japan at 1 nm increments the uv vis indexes including the absorption coefficient a m m 1 suva254 l mg c m and s275 295 were used and calculated in this study the calculations of a m and suva254 are presented in text s4 suva254 is positively correlated to with doc aromaticity song et al 2020 weishaar et al 2003 an increase in s275 295 indicates a decrease in the molecular size helms et al 2008 li and hur 2017 fluorescence eem and parallel factor parafac analyses were conducted on bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction solutions the eem spectra of the samples were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 hitachi parafac modeling was conducted using the domfluor toolbox with matlab r2014b mathworks natick ma the details of the determination and modeling were shown in text s5 according the previous studies andersen and bro 2003 mahamuni et al 2020 murphy et al 2010 stedmon and bro 2008 in this study four fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 were extracted and three fluorescence indicators including fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix fellman et al 2010 huguet et al 2009 were used the calculation of these indicators is shown in text s5 2 4 solubilization experiment of pyrene and triclocarban pyrene a pah and triclocarban a common ingredient in personal care products were selected as model compounds because of their strong hydrophobicity and are frequently detected in the environment brausch and rand 2011 latimer and zheng 2003 the selected physicochemical properties are listed in table s2 first an sdoc solution of 20 mg l containing 0 01 mol l nacl maintaining ion strength was prepared and the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 05 using naoh and hcl solutions the prepared sdoc solutions 60 ml were transferred into 60 ml brown glass vials a blank experiment was performed with a sdoc free solution following this a methanol solution of pyrene or triclocarban was injected using a micro syringe initial concentration of model compounds in solution was 1 0 mg l greater than their water solubility wherein the methanol in the sdoc solution was kept below 0 1 volume percentage to minimize the cosolvent effect the solution in vials was thoroughly mixed by a spin mixer for 1 min the vials were then placed in a thermostatic incubator and static culture at 25 c at different pre set time intervals a 0 5 ml upper solution was pumped into 4 ml vials and mixed with 2 0 ml methanol the mixed solutions passed through 0 22 μm filter membranes the pyrene and triclocarban in the filtrates were determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet detection uplc uv waters acquity uplctm beh c18 column the deposition kinetics curves of pyrene and triclocarban in different sdoc solutions were plotted using pyrene and triclocarban concentrations in the upper solution versus sampling time moreover after 3 weeks the 60 ml vials were removed from the incubator centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min after centrifugation the solution was mixed with methanol solution volume methanol volume 1 4 and determined by uplc uv the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban in the sdoc solution was their concentration after centrifugation the blank experiment showed that the adsorption quantity of pyrene 0 21 0 09 and triclocarban 4 60 1 13 on vial wall was less than 5 0 of their total added quantity indicating the adsorption effect of vial wall could be neglected each sample was analyzed in triplicate furthermore the partitioning coefficient k oc l g of pollutants pyrene and triclocarban on sdoc was calculated using the equation k oc q oc c s in this equation q oc μg g is the adsorbed quantity of pollutants on sdoc after centrifugation c s μg l is the solubility of pollutants in aqueous solution with sdoc free after centrifugation 2 5 statistical analysis one way anova was applied for statistical analysis mean value standard deviations using spss statistics software version 19 0 spss inc chicago usa a probability of difference greater than 0 95 was considered to indicate a significant result data fitting was conducted using the sigmaplot software version 10 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 c yield and element compositions of sdoc as shown in fig 1 a and table s3 c retained in solid production biochar 15 91 26 08 wt of biomass was greater than doc emitted in smoke 2 61 4 78 wt of biomass after biomass pyrolysis based on 1 33 1012 kg dry mass burned pyrolyzed globally per year zhang et al 2012 we estimated that approximately 2 12 1011 3 46 1011 kg solid carbon in biochar retained in situ and 0 35 1011 0 64 1011 kg sdoc was emitted to atmosphere per year globally our estimate 0 35 1011 0 64 1011 kg closes to the estimate of the global deposition of water soluble organic carbon 0 64 1011 kg yr 1 kanakidou et al 2012 the average atmospheric deposition of 0 46 1011 kg yr 1 water soluble organic carbon jurado et al 2008 and 0 90 1011 kg yr 1 of rainwater doc willey et al 2000 in this study the c yield of sdoc accounted for 7 2 19 6 wt of biochar although the mass of c retained in biochar exceeds that of sdoc emitted into the atmosphere sdoc is more labile mobile and susceptible to photo transformation chen et al 2017 godoy silva et al 2017 sumlin et al 2018 zhong et al 2020 and therefore sdoc plays a more critical role in global c turnover and circulation than biochar furthermore biochar can also release doc but its releasable mass is very low qu et al 2016 used deionized water to extract doc from bamboo and rice derived biochars the obtained doc was only 0 3 1 3 wt of biochar liu et al 2019 used the deionized water and nacl solution to extract the doc from various biomasses including hardwood softer wood grass straw and leaves derived biochars the obtained doc was 0 02 2 0 wt of biochar other studies li et al 2017 jamieson et al 2014 wei et al 2019 wu et al 2018 also reported that the doc released from biochar was only 0 01 2 3 wt of biochar accordingly we estimated that the emitted sdoc accounted for approximately ten to thousand folds of the doc released from biochar after a biomass burning pyrolysis event e g wildfire in the short term which suggests that after a biomass burning pyrolysis event smoke deposition is a more important doc source of global water and soil than biochar release in the short term in addition for all biomasses the c yield of biochar decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature while the c yield of sdoc increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature excluding for pw sdoc fig 1a the c yield of sdoc derived from pw initially increased as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 300 c to 450 c and then decreased as the pyrolysis temperature continued to increase to 900 c there was an insignificant difference p 0 05 in the c yield of biochar among the three biomasses but the c yield of sdoc derived from cs and ws was significantly greater than that derived from pw p 0 01 this is because pw possesses more lignin structure table s4 which can be converted into more gaseous compounds e g co co2 ch4 c2 c4 hydrocarbons and water insoluble aromatic organic compounds e g pahs 16c during high temperature pyrolysis cerciello et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 as shown in tables s3 and s5 h 5 09 6 99 wt and o 30 11 40 57 wt contents in sdoc were greater than those in biochar h 0 62 4 61 wt o 9 08 27 17 wt respectively the c content in sdoc 37 42 55 28 wt was less than that in biochar 50 58 77 68 wt fig 1b shows that both the h c an aliphaticity index zhang et al 2020 1 29 1 60 and o c a polarity index zhang et al 2020 0 44 0 65 ratios of sdoc were greater than those of biochar h c 0 09 0 84 o c 0 09 0 34 the above results suggest that both the aliphaticity and polarity of sdoc are significantly greater than those of biochar moreover the aliphaticity h c ratio of sdoc was close to that of biomass while the polarity of sdoc was lower than that of biomass the ph values of the biochar and sdoc are compared in fig s1 and table s3 the ph of all the biochars was greater than 6 0 and most of them were basic which resulted from the basic ash being retained in biochar after biomass pyrolysis ash content 6 45 28 36 wt in table s3 chen et al 2019 however the ph of the sdoc was close to 4 0 indicating strong acidity this is because sdoc contains abundant acid oxygen containing functional groups e g carboxyl groups and phenolic groups which were identified and determined by the ftir spectrum fig s2 and boehm titration table s6 3 2 uv vis and fluorescence eem spectra of bulk sdoc the uv vis spectra of sdoc are shown in fig s3a c the peak at 250 300 nm of a uv vis spectral signal is attributed to aromatic structure containing substances e g low ring pahs and their derivatives huang et al 2020 phillips et al 2017 in this study the peak height of am at 250 300 nm followed the order cs sdoc ws sdoc pw sdoc the aromatic index suva254 was also used to determine the aromaticity of the sdoc fig 2 a and table s7 show that the suva254 values of cs sdoc range 2 51 2 99 mean 2 75 and ws sdoc range 2 23 2 94 mean 2 67 were greater than those of pw sdoc range 1 70 2 33 mean 2 09 these results indicate that cs sdoc and ws sdoc have greater aromaticity than pw sdoc moreover the suva254 values of the three types of sdoc slightly increased with increasing temperature fig 2a indicating that a higher pyrolysis temperature supports the higher aromaticity of sdoc for all three biomasses shoulder peak values of am at 220 nm were significantly positively correlated with the nitrogen content of sdoc and increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature fig 2a these results suggest that nitrogen containing functional groups e g pyridine structure could be responsible for the shoulder peak values at 220 nm fleming and williams 2019 nitrogen containing functional groups were also found at 1100 1250 nm 1 in the ftir spectrum fig s2 s275 295 is an indicator of the molecular size of doc and its value increases with decreasing molecular size helms et al 2008 li and hur 2017 as shown in fig 2b and table s7 the s275 295 value of pw sdoc range 0 041 0 055 mean 0 048 was greater than that of cs sdoc range 0 037 0 040 mean 0 039 and ws sdoc range 0 037 0 039 mean 0 038 the s275 295 value of pw sdoc increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature whereas the s275 295 values of cs sdoc and ws sdoc slightly changed with increasing pyrolysis temperature the results suggest that sdoc derived from pw has a smaller molecular size and is more pyrolysis temperature dependent than that derived from cs and ws the fluorescence spectra of the sdoc are shown in fig s4 the fluorescence intensity of sdoc was generally enhanced by increasing the pyrolysis temperature and followed the order pw sdoc cs sdoc ws sdoc at each pyrolysis temperature the eem parafac analysis of the fluorescence spectra supported a model containing four components c1 c2 c3 and c4 fig 3 c1 presented a primary excitation maximum of 270 nm a secondary peak at 220 nm and an emission maximum of 305 nm this component could be an aromatic protein polyphenol like structure of low molecular size e g tryptophan and tyrosine chen et al 2003 cuss and guéguen 2012a c2 presented a primary excitation maximum of 230 nm a secondary peak at 280 nm and an emission maximum of 340 nm this component has also been described as a typical protein polyphenol like fluorescent component yang et al 2019a c2 had higher emission wavelengths than c1 this red shift in the excitation emission maximum in c2 was associated with increased aromaticity and larger molecular size relative to c1 cuss and guéguen 2012b fellman et al 2010 yang et al 2019a c3 featured two peaks at 240 420 nm and 300 420 nm which are classified as humic like substances hydrophobic fractions with large molecular sizes chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 c4 showed two ex em peaks at 205 310 nm and 205 400 nm the stronger fluorescence intensity at 205 310 nm could be low ring pahs and their derivatives mahamuni et al 2020 yang et al 2019b many previous studies lin et al 2016 2017 2018 mahamuni et al 2020 wang et al 2009 have reported that biomass pyrolysis burning could produce abundant low ring pahs and their derivatives moreover the weaker fluorescence intensity at 205 400 nm was a typical fulvic acid like substance with a large molecular size chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2013 although c4 had two peaks the fluorescence intensity at 205 310 nm was far greater than that at 205 400 nm indicating c4 was dominated by low ring pahs and their derivatives which were located at 205 310 nm as shown in fig 4 a c and table s7 the relative abundance of the four fluorescent components c1 c4 of sdoc followed the order c1 range 0 269 0 759 mean 0 527 c4 range 0 172 0 317 mean 0 239 c2 range 0 055 0 301 mean 0 156 c3 range 0 012 0 16 mean 0 078 for each biomass derived sdoc of all biomasses pw sdoc contained the highest c1 abundance range 0 683 0 759 mean 0 718 and the minimal c2 abundance range 0 055 0 081 mean 0 061 and c3 abundance range 0 0 012 0 019 mean 0 014 ws sdoc contained the minimal c1 abundance range 0 269 0 428 mean 0 367 and the highest c2 abundance range 0 171 0 301 mean 0 236 and c3 abundance range 0 102 0 160 mean 0 127 and c1 c2 and c3 abundances of cs sdoc were medium this result that suggests the abundance of the fluorescent component of sdoc is biomass type dependent moreover fig 4a c show that increasing the pyrolysis temperature significantly improved the c1 abundance of sdoc but has an irregular effect on the abundances of the other three components fi is a typical indicator used to distinguish sources of doc gao et al 2017 mcknight et al 2001 in this study the fi value followed the order cs sdoc range 2 07 2 27 mean 2 17 ws sdoc range 1 93 2 28 mean 2 15 pw sdoc range 1 27 1 65 mean 1 49 fig 2c and table s7 hix is employed to indicate the condensation degree of aromatic structures or the degree of conjugation of unsaturated aliphatic chains in doc fuentes et al 2007 hur et al 2011 as shown in fig 2d and table s7 the hix values of cs sdoc range 0 42 0 77 mean 0 56 and ws sdoc range 0 59 0 8 mean 0 69 were significantly greater p 0 05 than that of pw sdoc range 0 07 0 13 mean 0 09 this result suggests that cs sdoc and ws sdoc have higher aromaticity and humification degrees than those derived from pw sdoc which agrees with the result of suva254 mentioned above therefore both fi and hix can be used to distinguish straw derived sdoc from wood derived sdoc sdoc with high hix values 0 42 0 90 and fi values 1 93 2 28 can be ascribed to burning pyrolysis of agricultural straw and sdoc with low hix value 0 07 0 13 and fi value 1 27 1 65 can be ascribed to wood burning pyrolysis bix values of sdoc among the three biomasses had an insignificant difference p 0 05 as shown in fig 2d and table s7 the bix values of cs sdoc and ws sdoc were all greater than 1 3 whereas pw sdoc had some bix values less than 1 3 therefore a bix value less than 1 3 can be a boundary line to distinguish wood derived sdoc from agricultural straw derived sdoc martínez et al 2020 found that cellulose hemicellulose and lignin content of biomass strongly influenced solid and volatile species yields during torrefaction the difference in the spectral characteristics of sdoc between agricultural straw and forest wood can also be ascribed to the different contents of hemicellulose and lignin table s4 3 3 characteristics of different molecular size fraction in sdocs as shown in table s6 the 1000 da fraction was the main component of bulk sdoc accounting for more than 96 wt of bulk sdoc while 1000 da fraction only accounted for less than 4 wt of bulk sdoc thus the characteristics of bulk sdoc were mainly dependent on that of the 1000 da fraction which was supported by the analogous uv vis spectra fig s3a f and fluorescence spectra figs s4 and s5 between the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction moreover the 1000 da fraction exhibited very different uv vis spectra fig s3g i and fluorescence spectra fig s6 relative to the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction for example the peaks at 250 300 nm and 220 nm were obvious in the uv vis spectra of the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction but disappeared weakened in the uv vis spectrum of the 1000 da fraction furthermore the ftir spectra of the bulk sdoc and the 1000 da fraction were also different fig s7 bulk sdoc had obvious peaks at 1100 1250 cm 1 and 1700 cm 1 which were ascribed to c o c n and c o respectively while these peaks disappeared weakened in the ftir spectrum of the 1000 da fraction therefore we conclude that the 1000 da fraction contains more oxygen containing functional groups than the 1000 da fraction the s275 295 values of the bulk sdoc 0 037 0 053 and the 1000 da fraction 0 036 0 055 were also equivalent and they were significantly greater than those of the 1000 da fraction 0 010 0 019 fig 2b tables s7 and s8 this result further proves that s275 295 can be a molecular size index higher s275 295 value indicates smaller molecular size and vice versa helms et al 2008 li and hur 2017 nonetheless the suva254 values among bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction showed insignificant differences p 0 05 for each biomass fig 2a tables s7 and s8 indicating their equivalent aromaticity fluorescence spectra of the 1000 da and 1000 da fractions are shown in figs s5 and s6 these two fractions exhibited very different fluorescence signal distributions this result was supported by the abundance of fluorescence components in different molecular size fractions as shown in fig 4d f and table s8 the 1000 da fraction was dominated by c1 33 91 5 which was analogous to the abundance distribution of fluorescence components in the bulk sdocs however the 1000 da fraction was dominated by c2 and c3 components 71 99 fig 4g i and table s8 this result suggests that the 1000 da fraction is mainly composed of low molecular weight protein polyphenol like substances whereas the 1000 da fraction is mainly composed of humic like substances and high molecular weight protein polyphenol like substances as mentioned above c4 is mainly composed of low molecular weight organic pollutants including pahs and their derivatives etc and few fulvic acid like substances therefore after bulk sdoc dialysis high molecular weight substances fulvic acid like substance of c4 were retained in the 1000 da fraction and c4 in the 1000 da fraction was dominated by low ring pahs and their derivatives relative to the bulk sdoc fig 4d f show that c4 abundance in the 1000 da fraction of pw sdoc was lower than that of cs and ws sdoc suggesting that sdoc derived from straw pyrolysis could produce more organic pollutants than that derived from wood pyrolysis as shown in fig 2c e and tables s7 8 the bulk sdoc 1000 da fraction and 1000 da fraction had an insignificant difference in the fi and bix for pw sdoc p 0 05 but the bulk sdoc and 1000 da fraction had significantly greater fi and bix values than the 1000 da fraction p 0 05 for cs sdoc and ws sdoc the results suggest that molecular size has a greater effect on the bix and fi of straw derived sdoc relative to wood derived sdoc in addition the hix value of 1000 da fraction was greater than those of the bulk sdoc and 1000 da fraction further indicating that the 1000 da fraction was mainly composed of humic like substances of large molecular size despite the 1000 da and 1000 da fractions the hix values followed the order cs sdoc ws sdoc pw sdoc these results imply that straw pyrolysis is more beneficial for humic like substance formation than wood pyrolysis 3 4 difference in uv vis and fluorescence spectra between sdoc and doc of natural water and soil the uv vis spectrum indexes suva254 s275 295 of sdoc were used for comparison with those of doc in biochar natural water and soil fig 5 a and table s9 as shown in fig 5a the suva254 range of sdoc range 1 7 2 9 mean 2 49 was included by the ranges of biochar range 0 11 10 23 mean 3 19 natural water range 0 5 12 2 mean 3 68 and soil range 0 19 12 2 mean 6 8 therefore the aromaticity index suva254 was not a feature indicator of sdoc for distinguishing it from other media nonetheless s275 295 range 0 037 0 053 mean 0 041 of sdoc was greater than that of doc in biochar range 0 002 0 036 mean 0 019 natural water range 0 003 0 039 mean 0 018 and soil range 0 008 0 020 mean 0 014 indicating that the molecular size of sdoc was smaller than that of doc in other media in this study we found that more than 96 wt of sdoc less than 1000 da table s6 while xu and guo 2017 reported that there is approximately 47 wt 50 wt and 70 wt of doc less than 1000 da in river lake and sea water respectively this result further proves that the molecular size of sdoc is smaller than that of doc in other media based on this s275 295 values of 0 037 0 053 can be used to distinguish sdoc from doc in other media biochar natural water and soil fluorescence spectrum indicators fi hix bix of sdoc biochar doc water doc and soil doc are also compared in fig 5b c and table s9 the fi values of sdoc range 1 28 2 28 mean 1 94 were close to those of water doc range 0 72 2 92 mean 1 55 and soil doc range 1 07 2 03 mean 1 52 and they were higher than the fi values of biochar doc range 0 12 0 99 mean 0 67 in contrast the bix values of sdoc range 1 16 1 72 mean 1 51 were equivalent to those of biochar doc range 1 08 2 23 mean 1 65 but they were greater than those of water doc range 0 13 1 38 mean 0 75 and soil doc range 0 25 1 00 mean 0 69 the hix values of sdoc range 0 07 0 80 mean 0 45 were significantly lower than that of biochar doc range 0 30 22 9 mean 5 03 water doc range 0 38 18 9 mean 4 45 and soil doc range 0 38 18 9 mean 0 45 based on this the combination of fi 1 28 2 28 hix 0 07 0 80 and bix 1 16 1 72 can be used to distinguish sdoc from biochar doc natural water doc and natural soil doc furthermore in comparison with the fluorescence spectrum of doc in natural water and soil the c4 component at the maximal ex em of 205 310 nm in sdoc was rarely found in natural unpolluted water and soil fernández romero et al 2016 holland et al 2018 kida et al 2019 tang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 ye et al 2020 c4 component featured low ring pahs and their derivatives thus the high abundance of c4 20 can also be used to identify sdoc fig 4a c 3 5 solubilization effect of sdoc on pyrene and triclocarban an experiment concerning the effect of sdoc on strong hydrophobic pollutant pyrene and triclocarban deposition in an aqueous solution was performed the deposition curves of pyrene and triclocarban are shown in figs s8 and s9 respectively most sdocs suppressed the deposition of pyrene and triclocarban in comparison with the sdoc free solution the results suggest that the input of sdocs into the water extends the residence time of strong hydrophobic pollutants in water which may further enhance the mobility of pollutants and expand the potential risk region in the environment the inhibitory effect of sdocs on the deposition of pyrene and triclocarban was possibly owing to the strong sorption of doc and solubilization of these pollutants cai et al 2017 celis et al 1998 zhou et al 2010 to verify this speculation the solubilization results are shown in fig 6 a and b the inhibitory ability of different sdocs on the deposition of pollutants was consistent with their solubilization ability for instance of all pw sdocs pw sdoc derived from pyrolysis at 600 c had a minimal inhibitory effect on pollutant deposition and minimal solubilization effect on pollutants while pw sdocs derived from pyrolysis at 450 c and 750 c had the maximal inhibitory effect on pollutant deposition and the maximal solubilization effect on pollutants as well as shown in fig 6a and b the pyrolysis temperature had an irregular effect on the solubilization effect of sdoc and some sdocs had a negligible effect on the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban nevertheless under natural conditions the combustion or pyrolysis of biomass is carried out simultaneously at multi temperatures therefore the average solubility of pollutants in various pyrolysis temperatures produced sdoc solutions could better reflect the solubilization effect of sdocs in a real situation the average solubility of pyrene was 184 2 257 0 and 341 2 μg l for cs sdoc ws sdoc and pw sdoc solutions respectively they were 2 0 3 0 folds of the solubility of pyrene in sdoc free solution 107 6 μg l the average solubility of triclocarban was 191 0 195 6 and 341 2 μg l for cs sdoc ws sdoc and pw sdoc solutions respectively they were 4 0 6 0 folds of the solubility of triclocarban in sdoc free solution 57 6 μg l it is generally considered that the adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants on natural organic matters increases with increasing c content liu et al 2020 nguyen et al 2005 tao and lu 1999 for all sdocs the solubilization experiment was performed with the same doc concentration of 20 mg l a doc concentration of 20 mg l for different sdocs should cause an approximate solubilization effect on pyrene and triclocarban unexpectedly our results are not consistent with this tendency interestingly fig s10a shows that the adsorption coefficients of pyrene and triclocarban on sdoc were positively correlated with the abundance of c1 in bulk sdoc in comparison with bulk sdoc the positive correlation was further enhanced by the c1 of the 1000 da fraction because of its lower p value and greater r value figs 6c and s10e for example the adsorption coefficient of triclocarban on sdoc had an extremely positive correlation with the c1 abundance of the 1000 da fraction in bulk sdoc p 0 01 fig 6c as mentioned above c1 of the 1000 da fraction was dominated by aromatic protein polyphenol like structures with low molecular size e g tryptophan and tyrosine the hydrophobic structure benzene ring of c1 could combine with hydrophobic pollutants whereas the hydrophilic functional groups e g nh2 and oh of c1 stabilized the conjugates in the aqueous environment hence c1 of the 1000 da fraction as a surfactant like agent could improve the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants the negative correlation between the adsorption coefficient of pollutants on sdoc and the abundance of other fluorescent components c2 c3 and c4 fig s10b d and f h indicate these fluorescent components play inhibitory roles in the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban in particular the adsorption coefficient of pyrene and triclocarban on sdoc was significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of c4 of the 1000 da fraction in bulk sdoc fig 6d c4 of the 1000 da fraction played a dominantly inhibitory role in the solubility of pyrene and triclocarban as mentioned above c4 in the 1000 da fraction was dominated by low molecular size pahs and their derivatives thus a speculated mechanism was that the small molecules in c4 of sdoc could compete with pyrene and triclocarban for the binding sites on the surfactant like sdoc e g the aromatic protein polyphenol like structures of c1 therefore the high abundance of c4 in the 1000 da fraction suppressed the solubilization effect of sdoc 4 conclusion wild outdoor biomass burning pyrolysis events e g wildfire and agricultural residue burning pyrolysis can produce large amounts of doc in the short term and be an important source of doc in natural water the input of biomass pyrogenic doc into natural water has two pathways one is released from solid production biochar and the other is the deposition of sdoc in this study we found that the release of doc from biochar was only 0 01 2 30 wt of biochar whereas the doc in smoke reached 7 2 19 6 wt of biochar after biomass pyrolysis indicating sdoc far exceeded 10 folds of the doc released from biochar after a biomass burning pyrolysis event therefore we deduced that sdoc has a more significant effect on water quality than biochar released doc in the short term after a biomass burning pyrolysis event e g wildfire we also estimated that global biomass burning pyrolysis could produce approximately 0 35 1011 0 64 1011 kg sdoc per year indicating that sdoc deposition was an important source of doc in the global aqueous environment furthermore the characteristics of sdoc were very different from those of doc in biochar and natural water and soil the characteristics of sdoc are dominated by the 1000 da fraction which accounts for 96 wt of bulk sdoc higher s275 295 values indicated that sdoc had a far smaller molecular size than doc in other media including biochar natural water and soil the fluorescence component located at ex em of 205 310 nm and the combination of fi 1 28 2 28 hix 0 07 0 80 and bix 1 16 1 72 could be used to identify sdoc from biochar doc natural water doc and soil doc on the one hand the negative effect of sdoc on aqueous environments was caused by the carried aromatic pollutants of sdoc on the other hand our solubilization experiment indicated that sdoc significantly improved the solubility of hydrophobic pollutants pyrene and triclocarban in aqueous environments which could enhance the mobility of pollutants and expand the potential risk region this study suggests that sdoc from biomass burning pyrolysis potentially has a significant negative impact on water quality in addition to polluting atmosphere meanwhile owing to the conclusion of this study was obtained from a laboratory experiment a further research on the role of sdoc in natural water needs to be conducted in the future nonetheless the results of this study have significant implications for assessments of the environmental effect of sdoc and elucidate potential methods for identifying its presence and behavior in water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
