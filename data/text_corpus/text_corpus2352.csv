hrts so far further this study addresses the effect of hrt along with different filter media in a cw system for the treatment of dairy wastewater therefore the present study aims the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from dairy farm wastewater utilizing two pilot scale vertical sub surface flow cw systems vf cws loaded with two different sized gravels 10 and 20 mm and operated at shorter hrts 6 12 and 24 h both cw systems were dosed with the same wastewater in the same loading volume but the hrts were different this would be the best method for examining the influence of hrt on cw system pollutant removal efficiency 2 methodology 2 1 study site the present study was carried out in two constructed wetland systems cw 1 cw 2 near a university dairy farm in dehradun uttarakhand india 30 3165 n 78 0322 e each vertical flow pilot scale cw system consists of two beds fig 1 the first and second beds of each cw system had a surface area of 2 5 m2 and 1 5 m2 respectively all the beds were lined with concrete and had a depth of 70 cm 2 2 experimental design and construction of cw systems different filter materials such as gravels of various sizes sand etc can be used in the cw unit gravels are selected as a filter material because of their strong aeration and great nitrification capacity gravels also provide a good substratum surface for biofilm attachment facilitating better mineralization of organic nitrogen and oxidation of ammonium ions priyasharma and brighu 2013 moreover the gravel filled systems have the least chance of clogging during wastewater treatment in a cw system pollutants from wastewater are removed due to various physicochemical and biological processes the filter materials support microbial diversity that helps break down organic matter along with ammonification nitrification and denitrification 2 3 hydraulic retention time hrt each cw system consisted of two vssf beds vssf 1 and vssf 2 connected in series both cw systems were operated at three different hrts i e 6 12 and 24 h the design specifications of cw systems have been given in fig 1 and table 1 respectively all cw beds of 0 7 m depth were concrete lined and built with a slope of 1 from inlet to outlet cw 1 was filled with 10 mm gravels whereas cw 2 was filled with 20 mm gravels both the cw units were planted with arundo donax wastewater was dosed once a day with an organic loading rate olr of 20 g m 2 d 1 samples were obtained from each cw bed s primary tank inlet and outlet the samples were analyzed for ph temperature electrical conductivity ec oxidation redox potential orp total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds salinity dissolved o2 do ammonium nitrogen nh4 n biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and total phosphorus tp fig 2 a d 2 4 analytical procedures approximately 220 l of dairy farm wastewater was dosed intermittently every day to each cw system for a period of three months the outlet drainage pipes for each cw bed were closed with a stopper s help to maintain the hrt 6 h 12 h and 24 h samples were collected and stored in a refrigerator for further analysis the ph orp ec tds salinity temperature and do were analyzed using a multiparameter system hachsension mm150 and do meter hachsension at the study site further bod5 nh4 n and tp were analyzed in the laboratory using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 and the hach manual 2 5 calculation of pollutant removal rate the vertical sub surface flow constructed wetland systems vssf cw performance at different hrts was calculated in terms of removal rate sharma et al 2013 sharma et al 2018 the equation for calculation of removal rate is as follows removal rate c i c o 100 c i i c i influent concentration mg l 1 c o effluent concentration mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do the ph value in the dairy influent varied from 7 3 to 7 9 during the assessment period with an average of 7 6 0 2 the samples were analyzed at various hrts 6 12 and 24 h and the results were compared average ph values in the effluent were 7 7 0 1 7 7 0 1 and 7 7 0 2 in cw 1 outlets at 6 12 and 24 h respectively whereas slight variation was seen in cw 2 outlets and the values were 8 2 0 2 7 6 0 1 and 7 6 0 3 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively table 2 it was observed that ph varied slightly at outlets of both cw systems on increasing hrt to 12 h and 24 h ec values in the influent samples varied from 972 7 to 1492 0 Œºs cm 1 during the study period averaging 1153 6 Œºs cm 1 during the treatment all the cw systems removed the dissolved solids resulting in lower ec values in the final outlets i e 817 7 784 9 and 1023 3 Œºs cm 1 in cw 1 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively in the cw 2 outlets the ec values recorded were 755 7 736 5 and 1005 2 Œºs cm 1at 6 12 and 24 h respectively table 2 after treatment it was observed that the concentration of ec dropped remarkably and minimum ec was recorded 736 5 Œºs cm 1 in the cw 2 outlet 20 mm gravels at 12 h a positive correlation between ec and total dissolved solids r2 0 93 was observed at outlet points vertical constructed wetland systems are well known for providing good aerobic conditions do concentration in the influent ranged between 0 8 and 1 6 mg l 1 whereas the average do content was 1 2 0 3 mg l 1 during the study period the do levels showed an increase from inlet to outlet maximum do increase was observed in cw 2 20 mm gravels as compared to cw 1 a substantial increase in do concentration was observed in all cw table 2 a percentage increase in do was noticed in both the cw units with average values of 473 6 494 2 and 482 4 in cw 1 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively in cw 2 20 mm filled gravels the percent do increase was recorded as 579 0 445 8 and 430 9 at 6 h 12 h and 24 h respectively after comparing the percent do increase in both the filter materials and at all the three hrts it was observed that cw 2 20 mm filters had the highest increase 579 0 in the do concentration at 6 h hrt this variation in the do increase pattern may be probably due to the short hrt of the beds which provided aerobic conditions owing to the large pore size 20 mm gravels of the filter media do increase from inlet to outlet resulted in the reduction of bod5 at the final outlet a significant negative correlation between do and bod5 r2 0 96 at outlet point was observed during the study period table 4 3 2 total suspended solids tss tss removal takes place in cws by sedimentation of suspended particles over the cw bed surface tss concentration of the influent was recorded in the range of 216 0 279 0 mg l 1 with an average tss value of 242 7 mg l 1 the gravels at the bed surface showed good filtration of the solid particles leading to low tss concentration at the cw outlets the lowest tss concentration in cw 1 and cw 2 effluents was observed as 44 7 and 52 3 mg l 1 respectively at 12 h hrt table 3 we found that changes in hrt resulted in considerable differences in tss removal rates with 66 2 81 2 and 52 7 in cw 1 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively and 76 1 78 1 and 55 3 in cw 2 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively fig 2a vymazal 2011 recorded 75 removal of suspended solids using gravel media as substrate which is more or less similar to that recorded in the present study in the previous studies sirianuntapiboon et al 2006 shukla et al 2021 ghosh and gopal 2010 percent tss removal was observed 30 98 8 at different hrts 18 h 4 days table 5 similar studies suggested that tss removal is mainly a physical process and is also affected by retention time davies and cottingham 1994 zachritz and fuller 1993 shutes et al 1997 comparable results were recorded by manios et al 2003 in which the authors proposed that substrates play a very important role in tss removal and the removal rates were found to be 85 and 90 in gravel and sand respectively in the present study 10 mm gravel filters with 12 h hrt were found to be most suitable for achieving maximum approximately 81 tss removal no clogging was observed by particle matter in the wastewater during the operation period 3 3 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 bod5 reflects the presence of organic matter in dissolved and or suspended form in the dairy farm wastewater bod5 in the influent ranged between 76 8 to 236 1 mg l 1 while the average bod5 concentration was recorded as 128 3 73 3 mg l 1 during the study period the minimum average bod5 at the final outlets of each cw bed was 31 3 12 4 and 13 7 mg l 1 at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively in cw 1 whereas in cw 2 minimum average bod5 content was found to be 18 7 12 0 and 14 1 mg l 1 at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively table 3 comparing the bod5 128 mg l 1 and tss 242 mg l 1 values in the influent approximately 84 of total bod5 was in the form of suspended organic material in the wastewater it can be confirmed by the significant positive correlation between tss and bod5 r2 value 0 95 at the inlet point table 4 it was also observed that the maximum portion of easily degradable bod5 was reduced in the first stage of treatment bod5 removal rates fig 2b were observed to be maximum 90 2 at 12 h hrt in cw 2 results suggest that 20 mm gravel filled beds cw 2 provided better aeration than 10 mm gravel filled beds cw 1 due to maximum do concentration in cw 2 hence leading to more organic matter degradation in cw 2 the large fluctuations in bod5 removal were observed in 10 mm gravel filled bed at 6 h hrt the probable reason for the fluctuation is low aerobic conditions that delay microbial biofilm establishment and functioning in a similar study conducted by kantawanichkul and wannasri 2013 purification efficiency and removal rate of organic matter in gravel filled cw units were found in the range of 32 9 50 4 and 7 4 20 6 g m 2 day 1 in vssf cw respectively in 4 9 2 4 and 1 2 days of hrt several studies have demonstrated the impact of hrt in ssf cws revealing that higher hrts improve the effluent quality although toet et al 2005a 2005b found that hrt does not affect organic matter removal akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 found that hrt of more than 8 days is sufficient for high organic matter clearance 91 9 table 5 in our study a short hrt of 12 h also resulted in maximum organic matter removal and maintained the stability of the cw system s efficiency throughout the monitoring period which contradicts the above findings plants play a crucial part in the decomposition of organic materials this occurs as plant biomass increases resulting in a high level of microbial growth among the roots thus microbial degradation and biofilm formation are favored leading to a decrease in the organic matter content of the wastewater schierano et al 2018 in cw systems removal of bod5 requires suitable conditions i e good aerobic conditions on wetland beds appropriate filter material for the growth of microorganisms filtration of suspended organics and sufficient contact period between wastewater and wetland substrate etc in the ssf cw system organic matter removal is accomplished by good cooperation between physical and microbial processes they are responsible for separating the organic solids thus allowing better hydrolysis for biodegradation while the gravel media allow the buildup of associated bacteria which facilitates rapid chemical reactions kadlec et al 2000 3 4 total phosphorous tp phosphorus removal in the constructed wetlands is attributed to physicochemical parameters such as ph conductivity and dissolved ions furthermore the hydrological characteristics of filter media such as influent load and hrt significantly impact phosphorus removal ≈æibiene et al 2015 in the present study the average tp concentration in the influent was 39 4 mg l 1 with minimum and maximum concentrations being 34 9 mg l 1and 42 5 mg l 1 respectively table 3 minimum average tp concentration after discharge from the final outlets of the cw system was found as 19 6 16 9 and 22 2 mg l 1at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively in cw 1 while in cw 2 the average tp content was 14 5 13 9 and 21 2 mg l 1at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively table 3 in every case a retention time of 12 h was shown to remove more contaminants tss bod5 tp and nh4 n from dairy wastewater for tp which is removed by mechanisms such as adsorption on porous media precipitation and plant uptake seo et al 2005 the minimum removal rate was observed as 35 7 in the case of 24 h hrt while the maximum removal of 72 5 was recorded at 12 h hrt in 20 mm gravel filled cws fig 2c mazzola et al 2005 conducted studies regarding phosphorous removal using vssf cws gravel filled and found that there was 20 and 30 removal at 48 and 72 h hrt respectively they also studied the role of macrophytes in tp removal along with other treatment processes physico chemical and biological mechanisms such as sedimentation and microbial transformation seo et al 2005 explained that p might remain bound to the media components as a result of precipitation and adsorption reactions with ions ca fe or al present in sand or gravels the particle size of substrates that are suitable for p removal may vary significantly 3 5 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n dairy effluent contains nitrogen in the form of organic and inorganic nitrogenous substances the major treatment mechanisms responsible for reducing nitrogen and its compounds include ammonification nitrification denitrification processes plant uptake and ammonium volatilization stefanakis et al 2014 biological activities nitrification and denitrification remove a greater proportion of nitrogen in the cw system but plant absorption volatilization and adsorption contribute relatively little to nitrogen removal during the assessment period nh4 n concentration in the dairy influent ranged between 23 0 and 31 0 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 26 5 mg l 1 table 3 the average concentration of ammonium nitrogen showed a noticeable decrease after treatment procedures under different hrts all the three hrts provided a visible decrease in the concentration but a maximum decrease in nh4 n concentration 4 8 mg l 1 was recorded in cw 2 at 12 h hrt table 3 a minimum decrease in removal rate was observed at 24 h hrt fig 2d due to anaerobic conditions that prevailed after a specific time period nh4 n removal is dependent on operating factors i e availability of o2 clogging retention time and root penetration of surface vegetation in a cw bed large fluctuations in nh4 n removal rate in 10 mm gravel filled bed with hrt 24 h might be due to variation in above mentioned operating factors vssf cw creates aerobic conditions on the bed surfaces to facilitate nitrification of wastewater resulting in a high no3 n rich effluent at the outlets of each cw bed for greater removal of nh4 n either by nitrification or denitrification appropriate aeration of the vssf cws is essential and very limited in small pore sized filter media 10 mm gravels this provides less aeration than 20 mm gravels with large pore size and good aeration foladori et al 2013 as a result minimal ammonia to nitrate conversion occurs in small gravel filled cws prost boucle and molle 2012 another explanation for reduced oxidation might be the length of time the wastewater was kept in the vssf beds since anaerobic conditions could develop after only a few hours of water dosing the main feature of this work is the continuous monitoring of controlled trials to investigate the impact of hrt and filter media size on the performance assessment of the vssf cw system in terms of tss bod5 tp and nh4 n removal in this study tp and nh4 n removal rates were comparatively lower than that of organic matter this happens with most wetland systems akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 and this may have occurred due to the longer hrts required for their removal however the present study depicted that even short hrts 6 12 and 24 h may efficiently reduce tp concentration from dairy wastewater 4 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study a two pilot scale vssf cws filled with 10 mm and 20 mm gravels operated continuously for almost three months with hydraulic retention times hrts of 6 12 and 24 h during this period of time the vssf cws showed significant removal efficiency of pollutants tss bod5 tp and nh4 n b hrt of 12 h provided maximum removal of tss bod5 tp and nh4 n in both cws cw 1 cw 2 the cw 2 20 mm gravels showed 81 2 90 2 65 1 and 82 5 removal of tss bod5 tp and nh4 n respectively the 20 mm gravel provided better porosity and more surface area for microbial community attachment which resulted in more pollutant removal c maximum do increase of 579 0 was recorded in cw 2 at 6 h hrt longer hrts lead to anaerobic conditions in cw beds resulting in the depletion of do in wastewater d except for tss which showed slightly greater removal in 10 mm gravels due to small pore size resulting in more particles settling over the bed surface other metrics indicated good removal in the 20 mm gravel filled cw unit e in 10 mm gravel filled bed large fluctuations in bod5 removal was observed at 6 h hrt due to less aerobic conditions and reduced microbial population f the result of our study indicated that 10 mm gravel bed with 24 h hrt showed fluctuation in nh4 n removal owing to limited availability of o2 g hrt of 12 h can be considered suitable for all parameters except for tss it is suggested to use both 10 and 20 mm gravel at different depths in a single bed to obtain high pollutant removal including tss according to the findings of the present study h the findings of this study imply that vssf cw systems may also be operated efficiently with shorter hrts and offer good

hrts so far further this study addresses the effect of hrt along with different filter media in a cw system for the treatment of dairy wastewater therefore the present study aims the removal of organic and inorganic contaminants from dairy farm wastewater utilizing two pilot scale vertical sub surface flow cw systems vf cws loaded with two different sized gravels 10 and 20 mm and operated at shorter hrts 6 12 and 24 h both cw systems were dosed with the same wastewater in the same loading volume but the hrts were different this would be the best method for examining the influence of hrt on cw system pollutant removal efficiency 2 methodology 2 1 study site the present study was carried out in two constructed wetland systems cw 1 cw 2 near a university dairy farm in dehradun uttarakhand india 30 3165 n 78 0322 e each vertical flow pilot scale cw system consists of two beds fig 1 the first and second beds of each cw system had a surface area of 2 5 m2 and 1 5 m2 respectively all the beds were lined with concrete and had a depth of 70 cm 2 2 experimental design and construction of cw systems different filter materials such as gravels of various sizes sand etc can be used in the cw unit gravels are selected as a filter material because of their strong aeration and great nitrification capacity gravels also provide a good substratum surface for biofilm attachment facilitating better mineralization of organic nitrogen and oxidation of ammonium ions priyasharma and brighu 2013 moreover the gravel filled systems have the least chance of clogging during wastewater treatment in a cw system pollutants from wastewater are removed due to various physicochemical and biological processes the filter materials support microbial diversity that helps break down organic matter along with ammonification nitrification and denitrification 2 3 hydraulic retention time hrt each cw system consisted of two vssf beds vssf 1 and vssf 2 connected in series both cw systems were operated at three different hrts i e 6 12 and 24 h the design specifications of cw systems have been given in fig 1 and table 1 respectively all cw beds of 0 7 m depth were concrete lined and built with a slope of 1 from inlet to outlet cw 1 was filled with 10 mm gravels whereas cw 2 was filled with 20 mm gravels both the cw units were planted with arundo donax wastewater was dosed once a day with an organic loading rate olr of 20 g m 2 d 1 samples were obtained from each cw bed s primary tank inlet and outlet the samples were analyzed for ph temperature electrical conductivity

2 4 analytical procedures approximately 220 l of dairy farm wastewater was dosed intermittently every day to each cw system for a period of three months the outlet drainage pipes for each cw bed were closed with a stopper s help to maintain the hrt 6 h 12 h and 24 h samples were collected and stored in a refrigerator for further analysis the ph orp ec tds salinity temperature and do were analyzed

terms of removal rate sharma et al 2013 sharma et al 2018 the equation for calculation of removal rate is as follows removal rate c i c o 100 c i i c i influent concentration mg l 1 c o effluent concentration mg l 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 ph electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do the ph value in the dairy influent varied from 7 3 to 7 9 during the assessment period with an average of 7 6 0 2 the samples were analyzed at various hrts 6 12 and 24 h and the results were compared average ph values in the effluent were 7 7 0 1 7 7 0 1 and 7 7 0 2 in cw 1 outlets at 6 12 and 24 h respectively whereas slight variation was seen in cw 2 outlets and the values were 8 2 0 2 7 6 0 1 and 7 6 0 3 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively table 2 it was observed that ph varied slightly at outlets of both cw systems on increasing hrt to 12 h and 24 h ec values in the influent samples varied from 972 7 to 1492 0 Œºs cm 1 during the study period averaging 1153 6 Œºs cm 1 during the treatment all the cw systems removed the dissolved solids resulting in lower ec values in the final outlets i e 817 7 784 9 and 1023 3 Œºs cm 1 in cw 1 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively in the cw 2 outlets the ec values recorded were 755 7 736 5 and 1005 2 Œºs cm 1at 6 12 and 24 h respectively table 2 after treatment it was observed that the concentration of ec dropped remarkably and minimum ec was recorded 736 5 Œºs cm 1 in the cw 2 outlet 20 mm gravels at 12 h a positive correlation between ec and total dissolved solids r2 0 93 was observed at outlet points vertical constructed wetland systems are well known for providing good aerobic conditions do concentration in the influent ranged between 0 8 and 1 6 mg l 1 whereas the average do content was 1 2 0 3 mg l 1 during the study period the do levels showed an increase from inlet to outlet maximum do increase was observed in cw 2 20 mm gravels as compared to cw 1 a substantial increase in do concentration was observed in all cw table 2 a percentage increase in do was noticed in both the cw units with average values of 473 6 494 2 and 482 4 in cw 1 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively in cw 2 20 mm filled gravels the percent do increase was recorded as 579 0 445 8 and 430 9 at 6 h 12 h and 24 h respectively after comparing the percent do increase in both the filter materials and at all the three hrts it was observed that cw 2 20 mm filters had the highest increase 579 0 in the do concentration at 6 h hrt this variation in the do increase pattern may be probably due to the short hrt of the beds which provided aerobic conditions owing to the large pore size 20 mm gravels of the filter media do increase from inlet to outlet resulted in the reduction of bod5 at the final outlet a significant negative correlation between do and bod5 r2 0 96 at outlet point was observed during the study period table 4 3 2 total suspended solids tss tss removal takes place in cws by sedimentation of suspended particles over the cw bed surface tss concentration of the influent was recorded in the range of 216 0 279 0 mg l 1 with an average tss value of 242 7 mg l 1 the gravels at the bed surface showed good filtration of the solid particles leading to low tss concentration at the cw outlets the lowest tss concentration in cw 1 and cw 2 effluents was observed as 44 7 and 52 3 mg l 1 respectively at 12 h hrt table 3 we found that changes in hrt resulted in considerable differences in tss removal rates with 66 2 81 2 and 52 7 in cw 1 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively and 76 1 78 1 and 55 3 in cw 2 at 6 12 and 24 h respectively fig 2a vymazal 2011 recorded 75 removal of suspended solids using gravel media as substrate which is more or less similar to that recorded in the present study in the previous studies sirianuntapiboon et al 2006 shukla et al 2021 ghosh and gopal 2010 percent tss removal was observed 30 98 8 at different hrts 18 h 4 days table 5 similar studies suggested that tss removal is mainly a physical process and is also affected by retention time davies and cottingham 1994 zachritz and fuller 1993 shutes et al 1997 comparable results were recorded by manios et al 2003 in which the authors proposed that substrates play a very important role in tss removal and the removal rates were found to be 85 and 90 in gravel and sand respectively in the present study 10 mm gravel filters with 12 h hrt were found to be most suitable for achieving maximum approximately 81 tss removal no clogging was observed by particle matter in the wastewater during the operation period 3 3 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 bod5 reflects the presence of organic matter in dissolved and or suspended form in the dairy farm wastewater bod5 in the influent ranged between 76 8 to 236 1 mg l 1 while the average bod5 concentration was recorded as 128 3 73 3 mg l 1 during the study period the minimum average bod5 at the final outlets of each cw bed was 31 3 12 4 and 13 7 mg l 1 at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively in cw 1 whereas in cw 2 minimum average bod5 content was found to be 18 7 12 0 and 14 1 mg l 1 at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively table 3 comparing the bod5 128 mg l 1 and tss 242 mg l 1 values in the influent approximately 84 of total bod5 was in the form of suspended organic material in the wastewater it can be confirmed by the significant positive correlation between tss and bod5 r2 value 0 95 at the inlet point table 4 it was also observed that the maximum portion of easily degradable bod5 was reduced in the first stage of treatment bod5 removal rates fig 2b were observed to be maximum 90 2 at 12 h hrt in cw 2 results suggest that 20 mm gravel filled beds cw 2 provided better aeration than 10 mm gravel filled beds cw 1 due to maximum do concentration in cw 2 hence leading to more organic matter degradation in cw 2 the large fluctuations in bod5 removal were observed in 10 mm gravel filled bed at 6 h hrt the probable reason for the fluctuation is low aerobic conditions that delay microbial biofilm establishment and functioning in a similar study conducted by kantawanichkul and wannasri 2013 purification efficiency and removal rate of organic matter in gravel filled cw units were found in the range of 32 9 50 4 and 7 4 20 6 g m 2 day 1 in vssf cw respectively in 4 9 2 4 and 1 2 days of hrt several studies have demonstrated the impact of hrt in ssf cws revealing that higher hrts improve the effluent quality although toet et al 2005a 2005b found that hrt does not affect organic matter removal akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 found that hrt of more than 8 days is sufficient for high organic matter clearance 91 9 table 5 in our study a short hrt of 12 h also resulted in maximum organic matter removal and maintained the stability of the cw system s efficiency throughout the monitoring period which contradicts the above findings plants play a crucial part in the decomposition of organic materials this occurs as plant biomass increases resulting in a high level of microbial growth among the roots thus microbial degradation and biofilm formation are favored leading to a decrease in the organic matter content of the wastewater schierano et al 2018 in cw systems removal of bod5 requires suitable conditions i e good aerobic conditions on wetland beds appropriate filter material for the growth of microorganisms filtration of suspended organics and sufficient contact period between wastewater and wetland substrate etc in the ssf cw system organic matter removal is accomplished by good cooperation between physical and microbial processes they are responsible for separating the organic solids thus allowing better hydrolysis for biodegradation while the gravel media allow the buildup of associated bacteria which facilitates rapid chemical reactions kadlec et al 2000 3 4 total phosphorous tp phosphorus removal in the constructed wetlands is attributed to physicochemical parameters such as ph conductivity and dissolved ions furthermore the hydrological characteristics of filter media such as influent load and hrt significantly impact phosphorus removal ≈æibiene et al 2015 in the present study the average tp concentration in the influent was 39 4 mg l 1 with minimum and maximum concentrations being 34 9 mg l 1and 42 5 mg l 1 respectively table 3 minimum average tp concentration after discharge from the final outlets of the cw system was found as 19 6 16 9 and 22 2 mg l 1at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively in cw 1 while in cw 2 the average tp content was 14 5 13 9 and 21 2 mg l 1at 6 12 and 24 h hrt respectively table 3 in every case a retention time of 12 h was shown to remove more contaminants tss bod5 tp and nh4 n from dairy wastewater for tp which is removed by mechanisms such as adsorption on porous media precipitation and plant uptake seo et al 2005 the minimum removal rate was observed as 35 7 in the case of 24 h hrt while the maximum removal of 72 5 was recorded at 12 h hrt in 20 mm gravel filled cws fig 2c mazzola et al 2005 conducted studies regarding phosphorous removal using vssf cws gravel filled and found that there was 20 and 30 removal at 48 and 72 h hrt respectively they also studied the role of macrophytes in tp removal along with other treatment processes physico chemical and biological mechanisms such as sedimentation and microbial transformation seo et al 2005 explained that p might remain bound to the media components as a result of precipitation and adsorption reactions with ions ca fe or al present in sand or gravels the particle size of substrates that are suitable for p removal may vary significantly 3 5 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n dairy effluent contains nitrogen in the form of organic and inorganic nitrogenous substances the major treatment mechanisms responsible for reducing nitrogen and its compounds include ammonification nitrification denitrification processes plant uptake and ammonium volatilization stefanakis et al 2014 biological activities nitrification and denitrification remove a greater proportion of nitrogen in the cw system but plant absorption volatilization and adsorption contribute relatively little to nitrogen removal during the assessment period nh4 n concentration in the dairy influent ranged between 23 0 and 31 0 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 26 5 mg l 1 table 3 the average concentration of ammonium nitrogen showed a noticeable decrease after treatment procedures under different hrts all the three hrts provided a visible decrease in the concentration but a maximum decrease in nh4 n concentration 4 8 mg l 1 was recorded in cw 2 at 12 h hrt table 3 a minimum decrease in removal rate was observed at 24 h hrt fig 2d due to anaerobic conditions that prevailed after a specific time period nh4 n removal is dependent on operating factors i e availability of o2 clogging retention time and root penetration of surface vegetation in a cw bed large fluctuations in nh4 n removal rate in 10 mm gravel filled bed with hrt 24 h might be due to variation in above mentioned operating factors vssf cw creates aerobic conditions on the bed surfaces to facilitate nitrification of wastewater resulting in a high no3 n rich effluent at the outlets of each cw bed for greater removal of nh4 n either by nitrification or denitrification appropriate aeration of the vssf cws is essential and very limited in small pore sized filter media 10 mm gravels this provides less aeration than 20 mm gravels with large pore size and good aeration foladori et al 2013 as a result minimal ammonia to nitrate conversion occurs in small gravel filled cws prost boucle and molle 2012 another explanation for reduced oxidation might be the length of time the wastewater was kept in the vssf beds since anaerobic conditions could develop after only a few hours of water dosing the main feature of this work is the continuous monitoring of controlled trials to investigate the impact of hrt and filter media size on the performance assessment of the vssf cw system in terms of tss bod5 tp and nh4 n removal in this study tp and nh4 n removal rates were comparatively lower than that of organic matter this happens with most wetland systems akratos and tsihrintzis 2007 and this may have occurred due to the longer hrts required for their removal however the present study depicted that even short hrts 6 12 and 24 h may efficiently reduce tp concentration from dairy wastewater 4 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study a two pilot scale vssf cws filled with 10 mm and 20 mm gravels operated continuously for almost three months with hydraulic retention times hrts of 6 12 and 24 h during this period of time the vssf cws showed significant removal efficiency of pollutants tss bod5 tp and nh4 n b hrt of 12 h provided maximum removal of tss bod5 tp and nh4 n in both cws cw 1 cw 2 the cw 2 20 mm gravels showed 81 2 90 2 65 1 and 82 5 removal of tss bod5 tp and nh4 n respectively the 20 mm gravel provided better porosity and more surface area for microbial community attachment which resulted in more pollutant removal c maximum do increase of 579 0 was recorded in cw 2 at 6 h hrt longer hrts lead to anaerobic conditions in cw beds resulting in the depletion of do in wastewater d except for tss which showed slightly greater removal in 10 mm gravels due to small pore size resulting in more particles settling over the bed surface other metrics indicated good removal in the 20 mm gravel filled cw unit e in 10 mm gravel filled bed large fluctuations in bod5 removal was observed at 6 h hrt due to less aerobic conditions and reduced microbial population f the result of our study indicated that 10 mm gravel bed with 24 h hrt showed fluctuation in nh4 n removal owing to limited availability of o2 g hrt of 12 h can be considered suitable for all parameters except for tss it is suggested to use both 10 and 20 mm gravel at different depths in a single bed to obtain high pollutant removal including tss according to the findings of the present study h the findings of this study imply that vssf cw systems may also be operated efficiently with shorter hrts and offer good pollution removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

11761,agriculture exemplifies human dependence on water and lack of adequate management puerto rico is no exception although the agricultural sector is expanding to address food security little consideration exists of how water scarcity impacts future production we studied how high producing fruit and vegetable regions of the territory could mitigate the effects of diminished water supply interviews with farmers who irrigate in santa isabel pr did not reveal proficiency about water reserves or measures for conservation to explore whether the same social behavior toward water exists in a community of similar socioeconomic profile the author also conducted interviews in magdalena new mexico where wells ran dry for irrigation and domestic use in 2013 in both settings the dynamic described in the tragedy of the commons seems to best explain water depletion strategies for conservation include transfer of development rights and substitution of groundwater with surface water planning at the local level seems imperative graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction the misperception that water is inexhaustible undercuts its vital importance for all life simple percentages convey the un sustainability of water consumption in agriculture approximately 70 of worldwide withdrawal of groundwater is somehow related to agriculture margat and van der gun 2013 from the perspective of global land use 38 of irrigated lands draw groundwater siebert et al 2010 half of all drinking water in the world is also extracted from groundwater smith et al 2016 the steadily increasing demand for water is however accompanied by a decreased supply the 2014 international panel of climate change ipccc predict a reduced raw water quality b possible increase the frequency of meteorological droughts c even small rates of groundwater pumping from coastal aquifers is expected to lead a stronger salinization of the groundwater than sea level rise during 21st century ferguson and gleeson 2012 loaiciga et al 2012 jim√©nez cisneros et al 2014 sustainable solutions are limited to government imposed regulations community agreed norms or privatization groundwater is a resource for which access had long been open the dilemma of unmanaged withdrawal has antecedents in the 19th century writings of the economist william foster lloyd which became famous a century later in the essay the tragedy of the commons by the ecologist garrett hardin 1968 the abstraction is simple and even lends itself to cartoon illustration fig 1 the artist cleverly separates users of the commons here groundwater by a low rise hill its elevation is not an obstacle to communication but is for perception the cause and effect of depletion are largely ignored until collapse happens how to get users to look over the hill how to get them to join together hardin s famous solution is mutual coercion mutually agreed upon political scientist elinor ostrom proposed a solution to avoid the tragedy that was neither government regulation nor privatization of the resource as hardin had strongly recommended in governing the commons the evolution of institutions for collective action ostrom 2016 ostrom explored how communities come together to solve problems without restrictive intervention by the state or conversion of community held resources to private ownership her pioneering work was recognized in the 2009 nobel memorial prize in economics ostrom s model would seem to have special relevance for puerto rico pr due to overly complex regulation over water and political resistance to privatization i mise en sc√®ne any community based solution is constrained by the institutional setting of the resource in puerto rico the puerto rico electric and power authority prepa manages water endowments for industrial agricultural and domestic use with delivery through the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority prasa whereas the land authority regulates irrigation canals and wells in all government held land regulation of irrigation canals and wells used by farmers however is not prasa but the department of natural resources and environment dnre comparisons can be drawn with a similar institutional constraint in magdalena new mexico nm which faced similar water management issues using interviews we saw patterns between santa isabel pr and magdalena nm and explored how the latter resolved their issues of water management to assess the robustness of those lessons we carried out interviews with farmers in santa isabel pr fig 2 regarding ground water use for irrigation and perceptions about the sustainability of water supply the following questions were posed how much water is needed to irrigate when is irrigation necessary how does the community perceive changes in land use on water quality on aquifer recharge the penultimate question on water quality refers chiefly to saline intrusion to gain perspective on the dynamics of the tragedy of the commons we explored how the agricultural community in magdalena nm perceives groundwater depletion which collapsed in 2013 that misfortune serves as a basis for suggesting actions that may be robust for communities with a similar socioeconomic profile iii rolling crises in 2012 the puerto rico secretary of agriculture identified productive capacity and brought to the public s attention that 85 of all food consumed on the island was imported the awareness raising campaign resulted in the first puerto rico land use plan published in 2015 puerto rico planning board 2015 agriculture has since boomed unfortunately just as this sector was taking off with many enthusiastic young entrants pr experienced catastrophic natural disasters including extreme drought in 2015 high category hurricanes in 2017 and earthquakes in 2020 the cumulative effect has been decreased production and damage to the agricultural infrastructure in the aftermath of hurricane mar√≠a in 2017 95 of local agricultural products were lost airports and docks were closed and a food shortage ensued department of treasury 2018 from this trauma puerto ricans gained renewed appreciation for food security the covid 19 pandemic also drove home how dependent residents are on importation of foodstuffs the municipality of santa isabel is the leading producer of fruits and vegetables usda 2012 for the island and depends chiefly on groundwater 1 1 santa isabel puerto rico as one half of a case study the total consumption of the groundwater in puerto rico during 2018 was 16 of the reserve department of treasury 2018 santa isabel draws water for all uses from the underlying south coast alluvial aquifer fig 3 a the aquifer extends from the descalabrado river in santa isabel to the jueyes river in coamo with an extension of approximately 80 km fig 3b the coamo river flows through santa isabel and recharges the aquifer thus providing groundwater for domestic commercial and industrial users in santa isabel the agricultural sector either uses private wells or the irrigation channel that comes from lake guayabal in the neighboring town of juana d√≠az the climate of santa isabel is semi arid rivers with headwaters in the southern slopes of the central mountainous area provide recharge annual rainfall does not exceed 940 mm fig 4 precipitation has decreased and the number of continuous dry days increased over the last 10 years ortiz carri√≥n 2021 for 2021 usgs station 50106850 measured an annual precipitation of 490 98 mm rain has decreased approximately 30 in the last four years for santa isabel ortiz carri√≥n 2021 over the last two decades santa isabel has also experienced urban sprawl consumption for domestic purposes now competes with agriculture and cattle raising exactly how much water is extracted is difficult to estimate due to numerous illegal wells santa isabel also provides water to the municipality of coamo the usgs has no accurate estimate will the amount of groundwater be sufficient to supply the needs of farmers in the near future are precautions being taken so that the aquifers are not contaminated with saline intrusion is the use of groundwater effectively monitored for sustainable use how informed are consumers to take measures that would lead to sustainability we chose the case of magdalena nm that had severe issues with groundwater in 2013 to see if lessons learned there could be applied to santa isabel pr 1 2 magdalena new mexico as the other half of the case study magdalena is a town of 1000 inhabitants with an area of 16 km2 120 km southwest of albuquerque nm fig 5 according to the us census bureau the population has been declining fig 6 the average annual precipitation in magdalena was between 304 and 406 mm nrcs usda 1997 fig 7 even though groundwater was the source fall all consumption water shortages had never been a concern townspeople were accustomed to consuming water freely in contrast to the santa isabel magdalena has a small population the principal use of water was irrigation in 1972 magdalena had a population of 1 200 which decreased to 635 by 2019 us census the amenities of the town include three motels two cafes and four gas stations originally engaged in mining and timber the townspeople re oriented the economy to tourism with the construction of the national radioastronomy observatory in 1969 aka the very large array many visitors use magdalena as a springboard for day trips to nearby attractions due to the possibility of water depletion with the increased consumption the magdalena nm geohydrology service identified favorable locations for exploration of groundwater as only two wells were in operation the benjamin well pumped 80 gallons per minute gpm and the park well pumped 40 gpm both produced a total of about 135 000 gallons of water per day in late may 2013 during the third year of a state wide drought customers complained that their water was arriving full of bubbles on june 3 2013 the town was shocked to discover that no one had water in their aqueducts authorities found that the water level in the aquifer had dropped several feet below the water extraction depth thompson 2015 the true causes for the lack of water remained uncertain speculations led to accusations about whom or what to blame despite ongoing arguments for years about the need to drill more wells the depth of the water table in magdalena was 131 feet in 2012 and had to be drilled to 145 feet to maintain a good supply fleck 2013 the magdalena experience became news in faraway santa isabel pr where residents were impressed by the possibility of running out of water unlike santa isabel the problem would not be chiefly one of quantity but quality i e saline intrusion nevertheless examination of magdalena experience seemed appropriate as the community demonstrates a similar socioeconomic profile we visited magdalena to interview the population and the government agencies responsible for keeping the well running to document the conservation measures adopted 1 3 what do santa isabel and magdalena have in common physically precipitation in both towns occurs in pulsing events both rest on alluvial fans although magdalena is less productive than santa isabel inasmuch as other geologic formations dominate the american southwest the most productive aquifers in magdalena are those in rock fractures the evapotranspiration in both areas does not exceed the rainfall on most months of the year both receive a 90 contribution from their aquifer resource a profile of the two communities is presented in table 1 2 materials and methods we decided against internet based interviews as most farmers in puerto rico do not use computers for decision making on irrigation needs to market their produce or even to keep records 1 1 the drafting and development of the interview required an internal review board irb permit to protect humans participating in research for the development of the study the deanship of graduate studies and research was requested to approve a permit for the use of human subjects in research through the institutional committee for the protection of human beings in research during the month of march 2014 older farmers with the greatest field experience are also the ones least likely to use a computer to obtain general information about the target population the primary sources were either telephone or in person interviews the secondary sources were historical documents statistics population censuses and agricultural censuses interviews were conversations guided with a questionnaire see lucca and berr√≠os 2003 perceptions were sought about the use of the various retention infiltration and storage ponds we aimed to ascertain farmer awareness and knowledge of the water problem in santa isabel in terms of both quality and quantity 2 1 preparation interview protocol in santa isabel puerto rico prior to conducting the questionnaire one farmer was interviewed using a semi structured draft to validate the instrument fig 8 to avoid bias he did not participate in the subsequent interview concluded the research questionnaire was semi structured with space provided for additional answers the questions explored the perception of the relationship between climate change quality and quantity of aquifer water from the viewpoint of prolonged droughts increases in sea level and more intense hurricanes the attribute quality focused on salinity we also asked how the farmer determines when the field needs watering and whether they consider forecasts of rainy days questions for the farmers of santa isabel included how much water is needed for irrigation when is watering crops necessary how does the community perceive the impacts and changes in land use on water quality how does the community perceive an aquifer recharge zone to sustainably manage the resource to ascertain patterns in behavior we also used a similar instrument in santa isabel to the one used in magdalena new mexico see figure 8 we interviewed fifteen of thirty farmers registered with the puerto rico department of agriculture answers to the questions would reveal how farmers make decisions regarding irrigation whether they are aware of climate change and likely impacts and if they have observed changes in salinity of the groundwater 2 2 preparation interview protocol in magdalena new mexico to understand the context of the crisis of 2013 when two the three community wells ran dry we interviewed john larson a local journalist inasmuch as water levels had only previously been monitored annually the collapse was somewhat of a surprise larson published an article on june 12 2013 in the arm chair explorer new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources 2014 which highlighted the cohesion of neighbors confronted with the crisis we interviewed a leader from the community board and nine other members from the town follow up communications were through the email we learned that simple overuse resulted in depletion hydrogeologist stacey timmons from the new mexico bureau of geology and mineral resources nmbgmr spoke of the lack of the regulations necessary for sustainability besides community supplied water private landowners had drilled wells whose impact was not considered in the decision to drill despite yearly or more often meetings of the community and a general amenability toward collective decision making we posed an overarching question to the interviewees will the water be enough for all the users after the 2013 event that resulted the depletion of the well nmbgmr conducted tests free of charge and assured landowners that personal information would remain confidential if they had drilled wells without registration the nmbgmr did not analyze houses served by the public system each property was visited to measure field parameters and collect samples needed for the study this work helped in mapping the large scale hydrogeology of the community the data would be used to choose the best location for drilling a new well for the community in response to the crisis the town limited the use of the only functioning well with an emergency decree effective june 4 2013 excess demand was recognized as the cause of the depletion the nmbgmr issued the following restrictions unnecessary use of water was prohibited residents could only water their gardens 3 days per week and prohibited watering between 11 a m and 7 p m washing of cars filling of swimming pools and use of tap water for livestock were forbidden these restrictions were authorized under the new mexico emergency preparedness act due to the emergency the local government retained the authority to fix the wells or drill new ones non potable water was delivered twice a week to farmers for animal use a failure like that of magdalena in 2013 would be catastrophic not only for santa isabel but also for the already precarious food security of the entire island of puerto rico in magdalena the interviews were open with ten interviewees due to the proximity of the occurrence of the event the interviewer listened to how interviewees described the events that led to the decline of water levels in the only well that supplied the water for all uses 3 results of the interviews in santa isabel in light of the responses to the questionnaire four additional questions appeared most pertinent for the agricultural population of santa isabel are you aware of climate change do you turn on your well right after a rain event what is the water source of your farm do you draw from your well every day without considering the volume of recent rain the dearth of farmers limited the diversity of the pilot group the farmers in the santa isabel questionnaire were 20 women and 80 men which constituted half of the 30 farmers registered in the department of agriculture of puerto rico for this municipality the composition of the group also reflected the community as we have farmers that are regulated by the land authority of puerto rico as well as some private farmers by listening to farmers discuss the aquifer we developed material to inform the community about what depletion would mean for the municipality and the territory we proposed an easy to read booklet focused on the importance of the aquifer its dissemination would be through the agricultural experimental stations in puerto rico fig 9 presents the results regarding the questions on use of the aquifer and farmer knowledge of the impact of climate change although more senior farmers are unfamiliar with the terminology of hydrology they do appear familiar with the concept of an aquifer they informed us about the increased frequency of droughts and subsequent decrease in crop production and increase in the demand for water although not conversant in technical language they clearly identified the impacts of climate change on their farms none 0 15 0 have you observed traces of minerals white crust in your irrigation system yes 15 15 100 would you be willing to pay a minimum amount of money if this meant the permanence of the resource in the area yes 15 15 100 would you be willing to participate in a community group in charge of monitoring and managing the best use of groundwater yes 15 15 100 but all answered that they would not have time of the farmers interviewed 53 use well water and 47 depend on irrigation canals and retention ponds twenty seven percent had heard about climate change though not necessarily understanding the underlying science seventy eight percent of the interviewees who receive water monitored by the puerto rico land authority atpr say that they turn on their pumps for as long as they are allowed without considering recent rain events or soil moisture inasmuch as these farmers rent the land the atpr could promote a creation of a group to monitor water management cooperation and commitment vary with group size as famously argued by the french philosopher jacques ellul 1964 group formation with less than twenty people encourage feedback among members and commitment towards the goal to be achieved with more than twenty people this dynamic is lost the encounter tends to become unilateral one hundred percent of interviewees said they did not have time to participate in a group to oversee management of the aquifer inasmuch as the group size was small such unwillingness goes against ellul s perspicacity the farmers did not fully know the status of the water in terms of quality and quantity and so could not appreciate the need for collective action questions about quality were left unanswered many farmers did not know about or pay much attention to changes in the quality of the water as water sampling was not a requirement none of the interviewees carried out water samples on their farms at the time of the interviews this changed when the food and drug administration fda law food safety modernization act fsma imposed the requirement of annual sampling of water for agricultural use fda 2011 signed by president barack obama in january 2011 the law requires that the quality of the water used on a farm be tested at least once a year if water from irrigation canals is used the frequency must be four times a year the justification is public health each year 48 million people in the united states roughly 1 in 6 fall ill from contaminated food often due to water quality 128 000 are hospitalized and 3000 die center for disease control and prevention 2020 3 1 santa isabel pr and magdalena nm synthesis of the two halves assessing an aquifer is complex given the heterogeneous hydrogeologic conditions of any basin in 2015 for the first time in history of the dnre the area in the southern part of puerto rico was declared critical due to water contamination from high extraction and saline intrusion this assessment is disquieting given that 48 of the land use of santa isabel is for cultivation of fruits and vegetables in 2021 fig 10 stratigraphy is typically documented in developed countries when drilling a well it is not required in puerto rico a detailed stratigraphic report should be required during the application of any groundwater franchise permission to access groundwater and invest in a well should not be taken as a right but as a privilege granted with due responsibilities for the resource in many hydrological basins around the world limits are identified and educational campaigns inform local people how diverse activities impact water quality and quantity citizens can also be made aware by road marking the limits of the aquifer groups had existed in santa isabel which took care of the groundwater resource one such community leader was the late ernestina faman√≠a who passed away in 2019 we learned of her dedication to a struggle that even resulted in a hunger strike to prevent the construction of a carwash in the aquifer recharge zone which was built anyway but is now defunct at present other people with the same spirit have come forward to defend the maritime terrestrial zone in the community of jauca a coastal community in santa isabel threatened by proposals for tourism development recalling the theoretical framework of elinor ostrom river basin boards could be established among neighboring communities to help manage groundwater however these experiences seem to contradict the interviewee resistance to participate in any group to monitor the aquifer ostrom is often cited as a counterpoint to hardin s inclination of individuals to overexploit an open resource and provoke collapse ostrom reconciled the concepts of non privatization with sustainability those who use the resource should be encouraged to organize for its sustainable management we understand however that in the case of santa isabel hardin s approach seems to better fit the profile of the community most of the land in santa isabel is managed by the puerto rico land authority a state government agency although this agency regulates the irrigation time of each farmer assigning days for irrigation there is no control on those days to stop watering before during or after rain events the farmer out of desperation to keep the farm at field capacity amount of water available for plant growth will keep the pumps activated for the entire time allowed by the concession farmers under pressure to produce do not contemplate future availability uncontrolled increases in the extraction of water from the aquifer portends complete salinization the ostrom collective solution does not seem likely hardin points out that when the individuals of a community do not act in accord with the welfare of the whole community either through public mindfulness of regulatory compliance then privatization is the solution an example illustrates this point in may 2019 a local newspaper reported that well 4 at paso seco located in santa isabel operated by the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority was out of service digital news la perla 2019 the communities served by this well lay in the municipality of coamo which borders to the north as this well was managed by santa isabel the impact on this neighboring municipality was simply not considered the water supplies in the area now face daily stress events aggravated by climate change lower lying communities that experience flooding have constructed a series of retention pools with the help of usda fig 11 water quality has become a growing concern we identified the salient parameters of household and irrigation water quality so that the consumers could better understand the requirements for potable water table 2 the potential collapse of the santa isabel farming industry due to inadequate water supply and or poor quality can be attributed to four inter related causes 1 state government agencies and the dnre do not have sufficient personnel to monitor consumption 2 farmers turn on their well pumps when they arrive in the field and turn them off when they leave late in the afternoons farmers who use irrigation canals monitored by the land authority are not responsible for deciding when to use the water they use water to the maximum volume during the time allotted which is usually three days a week 3 citizens are not an organized group when it comes to making collective decisions since the prasa is responsible for operating the wells in the area and distributing water among the users 4 industry and commerce in santa isabel have grown steadily and tend to be high users current legislation assigns responsibility of the resource to the dnre because the impact of distinct institutional actors and users is multiplicative responsibility for any future collapse will be difficult to assign should the tragedy of the commons eventuate agriculture industry and commerce would be horribly affected the value of properties would drop and would probably result in abandonment therefore the community must act now one way to avoid collapse would be to apply the economic concept of option value the concept of option value explores how much users are willing to pay to conserve resources for future use so that future generations can continue benefiting only sustainable use of a renewable but exhaustible resource protects the interests of future generations farmers understand the expenses on the farm but not the cost of protecting the resources today for its use tomorrow the latter remains an abstraction for farmers the cost of water is the electricity spent in extraction the water itself is not priced i e free viewed over time nothing could be more inefficient the collapse of the aquifer in magdalena nm may be a fast forward version of what will unfold in santa isabel pr magdalena strictly limited use of water due to a reduction in the levels of the well then in use through an emergency decree effective june 4 2013 which resulted in subsequent permit to drill a second well puerto rico has more favorable climatic conditions from those of new mexico which includes the possibility to capture and retain rain for home use however for agriculture the amount of water required to maintain crop production at current levels is beyond foreseeable storage capacity the water requirements for each crop should define the amount of land needed to develop it commercially if all the crops have high water requirements collapse in times of drought is inevitable however variance exists in water demand of crops less thirsty crops such as pigeon peas would be an example of sustainable planning for a semi arid area the analysis of irrigation requirements should be a priority for every farmer choice of crops should be in conjunction with the puerto rico department of agriculture to stabilize income for each crop rather drive down the prices into the inelastic region of demand which results in lower incomes furthermore advertising campaigns for local seasonal agricultural products and new products could help stabilize agricultural livelihoods puerto rico is experiencing growing interest in agriculture with the entry of many young people into the sector new farmers have entered the wave of industry 4 0 which refers to the new industrial revolution that integrates technology for efficiency in manufacturing puerto rico manufacturing extension primex 2021 however older farmers tend not to integrate technology into their livelihoods and may be less willing to experiment with different crops until there is a demographic transition much of the land will be in the hands of people who do not use technology effectively and may be resistant to change like high water use crops livestock is another agricultural activity that is inappropriate where water is scarce in magdalena the most important agricultural activity had been livestock during our interviews the author sensed an urgency for recovering the security of the water resource for the future nevertheless magdalena presents a more hopeful picture than santa isabel regarding the protection of the resource the author was favorably impressed by how the community organized to protect the resource and transition away from livestock in the years subsequent to the collapse the community had reduced its consumption by up to 50 thompson 2015 salient are the following characteristics of the water management in magdalena 1 the new mexico bureau of geology and mineral resources as happens in puerto rico had not ascertained how many unregistered wells existed frustrating effective monitoring 2 farmers lacked guidance regarding the status of groundwater in the locality for which they should be identified as custodians 3 citizens acted as a group to make decisions on water management yet the government was responsible for operating the wells water drawn was stored in 100 000 gallon tanks and distributed among users 4 although business and commerce have been small scale in magdalena they sometimes required a high amount of water depending on the type of activity business use of water was subsequently adjusted to reduce it by more than 50 4 recommendations 4 1 santa isabel puerto rico few farmers in santa isabel fully understand the meaning and scope of climate change use of better agronomic practices and measurement of the water resource and avoidance of overexploitation should be part of each farmer s management plan creating groups with common goals will not be easy in santa isabel three classes of users exist groups served by the land authority those by irrigation canals and farm owners who operate their own wells the current use of the resource responds to the individual needs of the farms in terms of requirements and quality the owner of the farm is not always the person who monitors water use which may be delegated the method of monitoring is usually just visual and the sensation of tactile humidity of the land land use must also be monitored the urban footprint of santa isabel increased from 3 in 1985 to 13 in 2021 fig 9 this increase affects agriculture as pesticides cannot be applied in the vicinity of an urban area a buffer zone must now be maintained puerto rico pesticides law 1999 faced with excessive demand for irrigation efforts should be directed toward quality solutions include monitoring and storage alternatives for the common farm tasks an overarching recommendation is that irrigation pumps be used only for irrigation and that they have water storage tanks for cleaning the common areas farmers should not leave their pumps activated the entire time they are on the farm the sustainable use of fresh water in puerto rico should be more regulated especially for industrial domestic and agricultural use monitoring water quality will make users more aware of how loss in quality occurs only a few people own the land they work in santa isabel most belongs to the government and is managed by the puerto rico land authority the role of government is to restrict land use to only agriculture and not grant permits for construction food security requires such restricted land use in perpetuity option values can be institutionalized through transferred development rights tdr the mechanism has been successful in much of the united states are considering setting up a government agency that pay landholders to keep that land for agricultural purposes in perpetuity shahab et al 2018 much of the land is dedicated to large scale agriculture and is considered by usda as premium agricultural land other lands suitable for agriculture should also be considered for tdrs such transfers of rights would be key to sound management of groundwater although the government owns the land tdrs would restrict change in policies as administrations change over time the puerto rico planning board would be the entity to manage the tdrs which would align incentives in other words the social value of the sustainability of the agricultural field will recognize the opportunity costs of alternative land use for future generations despite a shrinking economy and demographics construction paradoxically continues making tdrs highly relevant 4 2 magdalena nm the distance of magdalena from other towns makes it more vulnerable to the scarcity of water resources the search for new supplies and increased storage capacity must be considered in sound water management citizens should be regularly updated on just how limited their supply is agencies that monitor the aquifer should do so more frequently inasmuch as magdalena has committed citizens and a responsive government intervention to emergencies coordinated community based solutions are feasible for example the use of grey water from sinks and washing machines must be encouraged for outdoor use and for discharging toilets movable drains could be built to recover reused waters author

11761,agriculture exemplifies human dependence on water and lack of adequate management puerto rico is no exception although the agricultural sector is expanding to address food security little consideration exists of how water scarcity impacts future production we studied how high producing fruit and vegetable regions of the territory could mitigate the effects of diminished water supply interviews with farmers who irrigate in santa isabel pr did not reveal proficiency about water reserves or measures for conservation to explore whether the same social behavior toward water exists in a community of similar socioeconomic profile the author also conducted interviews in magdalena new mexico where wells ran dry for irrigation and domestic use in 2013 in both settings the dynamic described in the tragedy of the commons seems to best explain water depletion strategies for conservation include transfer of development rights and substitution of groundwater with surface water planning at the local level seems imperative graphical abstract image 1 1 introduction the misperception that water is inexhaustible undercuts its vital importance for all life simple percentages convey the un sustainability of water consumption in agriculture approximately 70 of worldwide withdrawal of groundwater is somehow related to agriculture margat and van der gun 2013 from the perspective of global land use 38 of irrigated lands draw groundwater siebert et al 2010 half of all drinking water in the world is also extracted from groundwater smith et al 2016 the steadily increasing demand for water is however accompanied by a decreased supply the 2014 international panel of climate change ipccc predict a reduced raw water quality b possible increase the frequency of meteorological droughts c even small rates of groundwater pumping from coastal aquifers is expected to lead a stronger salinization of the groundwater than sea level rise during 21st century ferguson and gleeson 2012 loaiciga et al 2012 jim√©nez cisneros et al 2014 sustainable solutions are limited to government imposed regulations community agreed norms or privatization groundwater is a resource for which access had long been open the dilemma of unmanaged withdrawal has antecedents in the 19th century writings of the economist william foster lloyd which became famous a century later in the essay the tragedy of the commons by the ecologist garrett hardin 1968 the abstraction is simple and even lends itself to cartoon illustration fig 1 the artist cleverly separates users of the commons here groundwater by a low rise hill its elevation is not an obstacle to communication but is for perception the cause and effect of depletion are largely ignored until collapse happens how to get users to look over the hill how to get them to join together hardin s famous solution is mutual coercion mutually agreed upon political scientist elinor ostrom proposed a solution to avoid the tragedy that was neither government regulation nor privatization of the resource as hardin had strongly recommended in governing the commons the evolution of institutions for collective action ostrom 2016 ostrom explored how communities come together to solve problems without restrictive intervention by the state or conversion of community held resources to private ownership her pioneering work was recognized in the 2009 nobel memorial prize in economics ostrom s model would seem to have special relevance for puerto rico pr due to overly complex regulation over water and political resistance to privatization i mise en sc√®ne any community based solution is constrained by the institutional setting of the resource in puerto rico the puerto rico electric and power authority prepa manages water endowments for industrial agricultural and domestic use with delivery through the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority prasa whereas the land authority regulates irrigation canals and wells in all government held land regulation of irrigation canals and wells used by farmers however is not prasa but the department of natural resources and environment dnre comparisons can be drawn with a similar institutional constraint in magdalena new mexico nm which faced similar water management issues using interviews we saw patterns between santa isabel pr and magdalena nm and explored how the latter resolved their issues of water management to assess the robustness of those lessons we carried out interviews with farmers in santa isabel pr fig 2 regarding ground water use for irrigation and perceptions about the sustainability of water supply the following questions were posed how much water is needed to irrigate when is irrigation necessary how does the community perceive changes in land use on water quality on aquifer recharge the penultimate question on water quality refers chiefly to saline intrusion to gain perspective on the dynamics of the tragedy of the commons we explored how the agricultural community in magdalena nm perceives groundwater depletion which collapsed in 2013 that misfortune serves as a basis for suggesting actions that may be robust for communities with a similar socioeconomic profile iii rolling crises in 2012 the puerto rico secretary of agriculture identified productive capacity and brought to the public s attention that 85 of all food consumed on the island was imported the awareness raising campaign resulted in the first puerto rico land use plan published in 2015 puerto rico planning board 2015 agriculture has since boomed unfortunately just as this sector was taking off with many enthusiastic young entrants pr experienced catastrophic natural disasters including extreme drought in 2015 high category hurricanes in 2017 and earthquakes in 2020 the cumulative effect has been decreased production and damage to the agricultural infrastructure in the aftermath of hurricane mar√≠a in 2017 95 of local agricultural products were lost airports and docks were closed and a food shortage ensued department of treasury 2018 from this trauma puerto ricans gained renewed appreciation for food security the covid 19 pandemic also drove home how dependent residents are on importation of foodstuffs the municipality of santa isabel is the leading producer of fruits and vegetables usda 2012 for the island and depends chiefly on groundwater 1 1 santa isabel puerto rico as one half of a case study the total consumption of the groundwater in puerto rico during 2018 was 16 of the reserve department of treasury 2018 santa isabel draws water for all uses from the underlying south coast alluvial aquifer fig 3 a the aquifer extends from the descalabrado river in santa isabel to the jueyes river in coamo with an extension of approximately 80 km fig 3b the coamo river flows through santa isabel and recharges the aquifer thus providing groundwater for domestic commercial and industrial users in santa isabel the agricultural sector either uses private wells or the irrigation channel that comes from lake guayabal in the neighboring town of juana d√≠az the climate of santa isabel is semi arid rivers with headwaters in the southern slopes of the central mountainous area provide recharge annual rainfall does not exceed 940 mm fig 4 precipitation has decreased and the number of continuous dry days increased over the last 10 years ortiz carri√≥n 2021 for 2021 usgs station 50106850 measured an annual precipitation of 490 98 mm rain has decreased approximately 30 in the last four years for santa isabel ortiz carri√≥n 2021 over the last two decades santa isabel has also experienced urban sprawl consumption for domestic purposes now competes with agriculture and cattle raising exactly how much water is extracted is difficult to estimate due to numerous illegal wells santa isabel also provides water to the municipality of coamo the usgs has no accurate estimate will the amount of groundwater be sufficient to supply the needs of farmers in the near future are precautions being taken so that the aquifers are not contaminated with saline intrusion is the use of groundwater effectively monitored for sustainable use how informed are consumers to take measures that would lead to sustainability we chose the case of magdalena nm that had severe issues with groundwater in 2013 to see if lessons learned there could be applied to santa isabel pr 1 2 magdalena new mexico as the other half of the case study magdalena is a town of 1000 inhabitants with an area of 16 km2 120 km southwest of albuquerque nm fig 5 according to the us census bureau the population has been declining fig 6 the average annual precipitation in magdalena was between 304 and 406 mm nrcs usda 1997 fig 7 even though groundwater was the source fall all consumption water shortages had never been a concern townspeople were accustomed to consuming water freely in contrast to the santa isabel magdalena has a small population the principal use of water was irrigation in 1972 magdalena had a population of 1 200 which decreased to 635 by 2019 us census the amenities of the town include three motels two cafes and four gas stations originally engaged in mining and timber the townspeople re oriented the economy to tourism with the construction of the national radioastronomy observatory in 1969 aka the very large array many visitors use magdalena as a springboard for day trips to nearby attractions due to the possibility of water depletion with the increased consumption the magdalena nm geohydrology service identified favorable locations for exploration of groundwater as only two wells were in operation the benjamin well pumped 80 gallons per minute gpm and the park well pumped 40 gpm both produced a total of about 135 000 gallons of water per day in late may 2013 during the third year of a state wide drought customers complained that their water was arriving full of bubbles on june 3 2013 the town was shocked to discover that no one had water in their aqueducts authorities found that the water level in the aquifer had dropped several feet below the water extraction depth thompson 2015 the true causes for the lack of water remained uncertain speculations led to accusations about whom or what to blame despite ongoing arguments for years about the need to drill more wells the depth of the water table in magdalena was 131 feet in 2012 and had to be drilled to 145 feet to maintain a good supply fleck 2013 the magdalena experience became news in faraway santa isabel pr where residents were impressed by the possibility of running out of water unlike santa isabel the problem would not be chiefly one of quantity but quality i e saline intrusion nevertheless examination of magdalena experience seemed appropriate as the community demonstrates a similar socioeconomic profile we visited magdalena to interview the population and the government agencies responsible for keeping the well running to document the conservation measures adopted 1 3 what do santa isabel and magdalena have in common physically precipitation in both towns occurs in pulsing events both rest on alluvial fans although magdalena is less productive than santa isabel inasmuch as other geologic formations dominate the american southwest the most productive aquifers in magdalena are those in rock fractures the evapotranspiration in both areas does not exceed the rainfall on most months of the year both receive a 90 contribution from their aquifer resource a profile of the two communities is presented in table 1 2 materials and methods we decided against internet based interviews as most farmers in puerto rico do not use computers for decision making on irrigation needs to market their produce or even to keep records 1 1 the drafting and development of the interview required an internal review board irb permit to protect humans participating in research for the development of the study the deanship of graduate studies and research was requested to approve a permit for the use of human subjects in research through the institutional committee for the protection of human beings in research during the month of march 2014 older farmers with the greatest field experience are also the ones least likely to use a computer to obtain general information about the target population the primary sources were either telephone or in person interviews the secondary sources were historical documents statistics population censuses and agricultural censuses interviews were conversations guided with a questionnaire see lucca and berr√≠os 2003 perceptions were sought about the use of the various retention infiltration and storage ponds we aimed to ascertain farmer awareness and knowledge of the water problem in santa isabel in terms of both quality and quantity 2 1 preparation interview protocol in santa isabel puerto rico prior to conducting the questionnaire one farmer was interviewed using a semi structured draft to validate the instrument fig 8 to avoid bias he did not participate in the subsequent interview concluded the research questionnaire was semi structured with space provided for additional answers the questions explored the perception of the relationship between climate change quality and quantity of aquifer water from the viewpoint of prolonged droughts increases in sea level and more intense hurricanes the attribute quality focused on salinity we also asked how the farmer determines when the field needs watering and whether they consider forecasts of rainy days questions for the farmers of santa isabel included how much water is needed for irrigation when is watering crops necessary how does the community perceive the impacts and changes in land use on water quality how does the community perceive an aquifer recharge zone to sustainably manage the resource to ascertain patterns in behavior we also used a similar instrument in santa isabel to the one used in magdalena new mexico see figure 8 we interviewed fifteen of thirty farmers registered with the puerto rico department of agriculture answers to the questions would reveal how farmers make decisions regarding irrigation whether they are aware of climate change and likely impacts and if they have observed changes in salinity of the groundwater 2 2 preparation interview protocol in magdalena new mexico to understand the context of the crisis of 2013 when two the three community wells ran dry we interviewed john larson a local journalist inasmuch as water levels had only previously been monitored annually the collapse was somewhat of a surprise larson published an article on june 12 2013 in the arm chair explorer new mexico bureau of geology mineral resources 2014 which highlighted the cohesion of neighbors confronted with the crisis we interviewed a leader from the community board and nine other members from the town follow up communications were through the email we learned that simple overuse resulted in depletion hydrogeologist stacey timmons from the new mexico bureau of geology and mineral resources nmbgmr spoke of the lack of the regulations necessary for sustainability besides community supplied water private landowners had drilled wells whose impact was not considered in the decision to drill despite yearly or more often meetings of the community and a general amenability toward collective decision making we posed an overarching question to the interviewees will the water be enough for all the users after the 2013 event that resulted the depletion of the well nmbgmr conducted tests free of charge and assured landowners that personal information would remain confidential if they had drilled wells without registration the nmbgmr did not analyze houses served by the public system each property was visited to measure field parameters and collect samples needed for the study this work helped in mapping the large scale hydrogeology of the community the data would be used to choose the best location for drilling a new well for the community in response to the crisis the town limited the use of the only functioning well with an emergency decree effective june 4 2013 excess demand was recognized as the cause of the depletion the nmbgmr issued the following restrictions unnecessary use of water was prohibited residents could only water their gardens 3 days per week and prohibited watering between 11 a m and 7 p m washing of cars filling of swimming pools and use of tap water for livestock were forbidden these restrictions were authorized under the new mexico emergency preparedness act due to the emergency the local government retained the authority to fix the wells or drill new ones non potable water was delivered twice a week to farmers for animal use a failure like that of magdalena in 2013 would be catastrophic not only for santa isabel but also for the already precarious food security of the entire island of puerto rico in magdalena the interviews were open with ten interviewees due to the proximity of the occurrence of the event the interviewer listened to how interviewees described the events that led to the decline of water levels in the only well that supplied the water for all uses 3 results of the interviews in santa isabel in light of the responses to the questionnaire four additional questions appeared most pertinent for the agricultural population of santa isabel are you aware of climate change do you turn on your well right after a rain event what is the water source of your farm do you draw from your well every day without considering the volume of recent rain the dearth of farmers limited the diversity of the pilot group the farmers in the santa isabel questionnaire were 20 women and 80 men which constituted half of the 30 farmers registered in the department of agriculture of puerto rico for this municipality the composition of the group also reflected the community as we have farmers that are regulated by the land authority of puerto rico as well as some private farmers by listening to farmers discuss the aquifer we developed material to inform the

collective solution does not seem likely hardin points out that when the individuals of a community do not act in accord with the welfare of the whole community either through public mindfulness of regulatory compliance then privatization is the solution an example illustrates this point in may 2019 a local newspaper reported that well 4 at paso seco located in santa isabel operated by the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority was out of service digital news la perla 2019 the communities served by this well lay in the municipality of coamo which borders to the north as this well was managed by santa isabel the impact on this neighboring municipality was simply not considered the water supplies in the area now face daily stress events aggravated by climate change lower lying communities that experience flooding have constructed a series of retention pools with the help of usda fig 11 water quality has become a growing concern we identified the salient parameters of household and irrigation water quality so that the consumers could better understand the requirements for potable water table 2 the potential collapse of the santa isabel farming industry due to inadequate water supply and or poor quality can be attributed to four inter related causes 1 state government agencies and the dnre do not have sufficient personnel to monitor consumption 2 farmers turn on their well pumps when they arrive in the field and turn them off when they leave late in the afternoons farmers who use irrigation canals monitored by the land authority are not responsible for deciding when to use the water they use water to the maximum volume during the time allotted which is usually three days a week 3 citizens are not an organized group when it comes to making collective decisions since the prasa is responsible for operating the wells in the area and distributing water among the users 4 industry and commerce in santa isabel have grown steadily and tend to be high users current legislation assigns responsibility of the resource to the dnre because the impact of distinct institutional actors and users is multiplicative responsibility for any future collapse will be difficult to assign should the tragedy of the commons eventuate agriculture industry and commerce would be horribly affected the value of properties would drop and would probably result in abandonment therefore the community must act now one way to avoid collapse would be to apply the economic concept of option value the concept of option value explores how much users are willing to pay to conserve resources for future use so that future generations can continue benefiting only sustainable use of a renewable but exhaustible resource protects the interests of future generations farmers understand the expenses on the farm but not the cost of protecting the resources today for its use tomorrow the latter remains an abstraction for farmers the cost of water is the electricity spent in extraction the water itself is not priced i e free viewed over time nothing could be more inefficient the collapse of the aquifer in magdalena nm may be a fast forward version of what will unfold in santa isabel pr magdalena strictly limited use of water due to a reduction in the levels of the well then in use through an emergency decree effective june 4 2013 which resulted in subsequent permit to drill a second well puerto rico has more favorable climatic conditions from those of new mexico which includes the possibility to capture and retain rain for home use however for agriculture the amount of water required to maintain crop production at current levels is beyond foreseeable storage capacity the water requirements for each crop should define the amount of land needed to develop it commercially if all the crops have high water requirements collapse in times of drought is inevitable however variance exists in water demand of crops less thirsty crops such as pigeon peas would be an example of sustainable planning for a semi arid area the analysis of irrigation requirements should be a priority for every farmer choice of crops should be in conjunction with the puerto rico department of agriculture to stabilize income for each crop rather drive down the prices into the inelastic region of demand which results in lower incomes furthermore advertising campaigns for local seasonal agricultural products and new products could help stabilize agricultural livelihoods puerto rico is experiencing growing interest in agriculture with the entry of many young people into the sector new farmers have entered the wave of industry 4 0 which refers to the new industrial revolution that integrates technology for efficiency in manufacturing puerto rico manufacturing extension primex 2021 however older farmers tend not to integrate technology into their livelihoods and may be less willing to experiment with different crops until there is a demographic transition much of the land will be in the hands of people who do not use technology effectively and may be resistant to change like high water use crops livestock is another agricultural activity that is inappropriate where water is scarce in magdalena the most important agricultural activity had been livestock during our interviews the author sensed an urgency for recovering the security of the water resource for the future nevertheless magdalena presents a more hopeful picture than santa isabel regarding the protection of the resource the author was favorably impressed by how the community organized to protect the resource and transition away from livestock in the years subsequent to the collapse the community had reduced its consumption by up to 50 thompson 2015 salient are the following characteristics of the water management in magdalena 1 the new mexico bureau of geology and mineral resources as happens in puerto rico had not ascertained how many unregistered wells existed frustrating effective monitoring 2 farmers lacked guidance regarding the status of groundwater in the locality for which they should be identified as custodians 3 citizens acted as a group to make decisions on water management yet the government was responsible for operating the wells water drawn was stored in 100 000 gallon tanks and distributed among users 4 although business and commerce have been small scale in magdalena they sometimes required a high amount of water depending on the type of activity business use of water was subsequently adjusted to reduce it by more than 50 4 recommendations 4 1 santa isabel puerto rico few farmers in santa isabel fully understand the meaning and scope of climate change use of better agronomic practices and measurement of the water resource and avoidance of overexploitation should be part of each farmer s management plan creating groups with common goals will not be easy in santa isabel three classes of users exist groups served by the land authority those by irrigation canals and farm owners who operate their own wells the current use of the resource responds to the individual needs of the farms in terms of requirements and quality the owner of the farm is not always the person who monitors water use which may be delegated the method of monitoring is usually just visual and the sensation of tactile humidity of the land land use must also be monitored the urban footprint of santa isabel increased from 3 in 1985 to 13 in 2021 fig 9 this increase affects agriculture as pesticides cannot be applied in the vicinity of an urban area a buffer zone must now be maintained puerto rico pesticides law 1999 faced with excessive demand for irrigation efforts should be directed toward quality solutions include monitoring and storage alternatives for the common farm tasks an overarching recommendation is that irrigation pumps be used only for irrigation and that they have water storage tanks for cleaning the common areas farmers should not leave their pumps activated the entire time they are on the farm the sustainable use of fresh water in puerto rico should be more regulated especially for industrial domestic and agricultural use monitoring water quality will make users more aware of how loss in quality occurs only a few people own the land they work in santa isabel most belongs to the government and is managed by the puerto rico land authority the role of government is to restrict land use to only agriculture and not grant permits for construction food security requires such restricted land use in perpetuity option values can be institutionalized through transferred development rights tdr the mechanism has been successful in much of the united states are considering setting up a government agency that pay landholders to keep that land for agricultural purposes in perpetuity shahab et al 2018 much of the land is dedicated to large scale agriculture and is considered by usda as premium agricultural land other lands suitable for agriculture should also be considered for tdrs such transfers of rights would be key to sound management of groundwater although the government owns the land tdrs would restrict change in policies as administrations change over time the puerto rico planning board would be the entity to manage the tdrs which would align incentives in other words the social value of the sustainability of the agricultural field will recognize the opportunity costs of alternative land use for future generations despite a shrinking economy and demographics construction paradoxically continues making tdrs highly relevant 4 2 magdalena nm the distance of magdalena from other towns makes it more vulnerable to the scarcity of water resources the search for new supplies and increased storage capacity must be considered in sound water management citizens should be regularly updated on just how limited their supply is agencies that monitor the aquifer should do so more frequently inasmuch as magdalena has committed citizens and a responsive government intervention to emergencies coordinated community based solutions are feasible for example the use of grey water from sinks and washing machines must be encouraged for outdoor use and for discharging toilets movable drains could be built to recover reused waters author

11762,water trade has been recognized as a tool to improve water efficiency and reduce negative impacts of water scarcity however water trade success depends on regional settings institutional framework trade mechanism and water consumer behavior this research presents an agent based approach to simulate the behavior of farmers towards the local water market formation policy and measures its feedback in the hydrological agricultural economic system accordingly the farmers in each region were represented as an agricultural agent while the environment with which farmers interact was partitioned into three parts physical environment economic environment and social environment the behavior of agricultural agents was simulated based on linked mathematical programming and a multi objective optimization model coupled with borda count method to resolve conflicts among agents to evaluate the proposed method in a case study in central iran namely najafabad hydrological unit 16 scenarios including black market scenario were developed and further simulated the results showed that the equilibrium water price was strongly influenced by water supply and demand in the system the average equilibrium price under normal condition was equal to 3 cents per cubic meter this is while if permits were to be reduced in accordance with aquifer recovery policy both reducing supply and increasing demand the average equilibrium price increased by about 3 5 cents conversely following the scenario of imposing fines penalties for over exploitation increasing supply and reducing demand the equilibrium price dropped to 2 5 cents graphical abstract image 1 keywords agent based simulation borda conte method equilibrium price of water local water market non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii iran 1 introduction water demand in developing countries including iran is increasing day by day and as a result water resources especially groundwater resources are increasingly at risk mirzaei et al 2019 the trend continues to cause severe damage to the environment in addition with the unrelenting threat on resources in the long run economic and social sustainability as well as environmental sustainability will continue to suffer in such a situation water resources managers either try to increase supply and or manage the demand wheeler et al 2017 aghaie et al 2020 meanwhile water market is one of the demand side management strategies to deal with water shortages reddy 2008 wheeler et al 2017 rey et al 2018 aghaie et al 2020 by reallocating water dick and ringler 2008 on the basis of practical experiences de bonviller et al 2020 water trade has advantages such as protecting social and environmental values crase and o keefe 2009 providing more efficient ways to water reallocation nikouei and ward 2013 wheeler et al 2017 reducing drought damage najafi alamdarlo et al 2019 however water trade may lead to reduce water inflows and lower groundwater levels e g garrick et al 2009 janmaat 2011 ancev 2015 may not be suitable for areas with developing economies wheeler et al 2017 may lead to favor rich and powerful people barlow and clarke 2002 lead to deepen challenges in economies with inequality easter and huang 2014 and lead to negative social externalities e g bourgeon et al 2008 poddar et al 2014 libecap 2015 despite all criticism the water market is one of the most practical ways for water reallocation grafton and horne 2014 and has widely been adopted in the last decade seidl et al 2020 however the efficiency of water markets and managing its adverse effects depend heavily on institutional arrangement and market structure erfani et al 2015 wheeler et al 2017 aghaie et al 2020 in order to install an efficient water market in a region it is necessary to implement arrangements such as restructuring the administrative body and removing legal and judicial barriers wheeler et al 2017 aside from the numerous cases in the australian water trade arrangement experience young 2010 clear water rights are one of the pre conditions for water market success wheeler et al 2017 commercial tradable nature of water rights must be recognized in order to consolidate water rights matthews 2004 in iran ambitious goals have been targeted in order to reform the underlying structure of water resources management nikouei and ward 2013 for example in iran s national water resources development plan for the 20 year horizon the emphasis is on organizing and developing local water markets lwm iranian ministry of energy 2012 on the other hand temporary water transfer is not a new issue in water resources management in iranian context bohlolvand et al 2015 vahedizade et al 2018 in general water trade among license holders may be divided into temporary transfer short term and medium term and permanent license transfer hadjigeorgalis 2009 wheeler et al 2017 the tendency for temporary trade is much more common donohew 2009 various mechanisms have been designed for water transfers among which one can mention the bulletin board and double auction markets bjornlund 2003 hadjigeorgalis 2009 although many strengths may be enumerated for these two mechanisms howe 1997 they also have weaknesses on how buyers and sellers meet in bulletin board mechanism as well as inefficiency in sellers profit and buyers cost in double auction mechanism bjornlund 2003 therefore special attention should be paid to the pricing mechanism in the context of water market because if this is not done properly it can negatively affect the performance of water market feldman et al 2005 there are a number of considerations to keep in mind when a water market is framed and water is priced first water is an uncooperative commodity bakker 2005 2007 second the water market cannot be considered completely competitive tu et al 2015 du et al 2017 and third for economic reasons ostrom et al 1994 water resources especially groundwater are common pool resources l√≥pez corona et al 2013 overall the price of water follows the supply and demand system tu et al 2015 when demand increases under constant supply the price increases while if supply increases under constant demand the price of water decreases accordingly various models for market mechanisms and water prices were developed on the basis of rational economic behavior of farmers including dynamic models e g pitafi and roumasset 2009 nonlinear programming models e g balali et al 2011 or a combination of both e g ward and pulido velazquez 2009 and balali et al 2011 such models generally first estimate the water demand and then examine the water trade najafi alamdarlo et al 2019 while ignoring behavioral aspects of water consumers farmers decision making process is quite complex the process is a function of time and place du et al 2017 and influenced by farmers perception and experience deressa et al 2011 duinen et al 2015 in addition to the complexities and heterogeneities in the water market yang et al 2012 models based on the simulation of farmers behavior have recently been adopted although researchers have tried to simulate farmers behavior based on a positive planning model e g varela ortega et al 1998 iglesias and blanco 2008 agent based models abms are suited because of their ability to simulate the complexity of water demand behavior considering the interaction with other farmers and with water price in lwm berglund 2015 ali et al 2016 al amin et al 2018 many studies have focused on agent based modeling to simulate the behavior of water users e g nouri et al 2019 while some have studied water trade du et al 2017 studied farmers behavior by developing an abm in a hypothetical water market in texas based on double auction framework they found that while the common effects of behavioral parameters on sensitivity of water scarcity rent and learning in the water market are strong and complex efficient planning and advanced water market institutions are necessary for water trade to increase productivity as another example three different water auction mechanisms were compared in rafsanjan plain in iran aghaie et al 2020 to simulate the interactions in rafsanjan hydro economic system they divided agents into agricultural agents aas who are able to buy and sell water permits and regulator agents who may buy water permits for environmental conservation purposes they reported that there is a close relationship yet opposing trends between economic issues and hydrologic performance however because the interests of the water market are influenced by the behavior of water users nguyen et al 2013 no study is reported to have obtained the equilibrium water price through the intersection of supply and demand curves based on the behavior of agents in the system in this research the feedback of the formation of lwm on the hydrological agricultural economic system based on equilibrium price of water epw for the first time in iran is studied research objectives are to determine 1 aas profit 2 production volume of dominant products and 3 the aquifer status after the formation of local water market under different policy scenarios the innovation aspects of the present study are as follows 1 determine the epw in a lwm by crossing the supply and demand curve 2 examine the impact of aquifer recovery policy arp on the epw and 3 investigate the effect of black market in the form of pricing based on the policy of fines for over exploitation on water trade in the lwm the paper is organized as follows our abm is presented in section 2 followed by how to execute the model section 3 deals with the problem definition and is devoted to details of the methodology section 4 presents the algorithm validation and parameters tuning section 5 analyses the case study results and section 6 discusses outlines directions for future studies and limitations of the study finally section 7 presents conclusions of the study 2 agent based approach an abm consists of three parts the set of agents the environment and the interaction of agents with the components macal and north 2010 in developing an abm the agents in the system the environment in which the agents are located and the interaction among the agents and with the environment must be defined macal and north 2006 in this study farmers are considered as effective agents in the lwm for this purpose the type of interactions and their outcome are presented in fig 1 as fig 1a shows the aa with four neighbors also the volume of water over exploitation by each aa affects the production and consequently the price on one hand and impacts the aquifer status on the other hand since the abm should be able to simulate the hydrological agricultural economic system within the lwm the environment may be partitioned into as shown in fig 1b ecological environment ee social environment se and market environment me past research on abms has also listed interactions such as competition mialhe et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 cooperation akhbari and grigg 2013 sun and m√ºller 2013 learning mialhe et al 2012 akhbari and grigg 2013 berglund 2015 and self learning zhang et al 2016 nouri et al 2019 in this research four types of interactions including competition for over harvesting and buying selling water at better price cooperation to regulate the production market by choosing a superior cultivation pattern and learning and self learning for minimum and maximum cultivation of crops are adopted it should be noted that the government as a regulatory agent for enacting laws related to the formation of lwm and environmental organization s as an environmental agent to monitor the impact of the market on the aquifer and possible conflicts are also present in the system however in this study they have not been introduced into the simulation process due to their static and passive role as fig 2 shows the proposed model consists of four major parts 1 basic settings of the models which involve the supply price model of agricultural products the aquifer simulation model and the behavioral model of aas including simulation of the environment and that of the interaction between agents and the environment 2 estimation of the non dominated front of decision variables including the volume of over exploitation by each agent and the water trade among aas this is done via a multi objective optimization technique 3 the social hydrological agricultural economic model setup and execution and 4 identify aas agreed choice via the borda count method in the following section different parts of the proposed model are outlined 2 1 environment explanation 2 1 1 social environment one of the most important steps in abm is the simulation of its social components the first environment that is affected by the agents in this study is se se is a virtual space formed on the basis of observations communications and possibly aa controversies all the interactions of an aa as shown in fig 1 originate in the se along with other parts of the environment each aa interacts with other aas in the se for example nouri et al 2022 examined different aspects of aa interaction subject to over exploitation within the se among the interactions they examined the impact of drop in aquifer water table on the regulator s decision to impose penalty the institutions involved are those that monitor the amount of over exploitation and its impact on aquifer status as well as those that monitor the profit earned by aas in forming the lwm such institutions in addition to economic institutions will regulate and try to improve the status of all sectors without incorporating the impact of such institutions on the social environment any abm will lack real world interactions another advantage of abm that is embedded in the social environment is the ability to simulate the tragedy of commons based on the competitive behavior of aas nouri et al 2022 described the competitive behavior of agents i e the tendency to over exploitation in response to over exploitation of other aas they came to the conclusion that competitive gw overdraft leads to the tragedy of commons in this research aas behaviors were simulated based on abm setting proposed by nouri et al 2022 section 3 2 provides further description of how to simulate this part of the environment 2 1 2 ecological environment in this study ee involves an aquifer that is directly affected by aa s water pumping the pumping is influenced firstly by the amount declared in legal license issued by the authorities to the farmer and secondly by the amount of over exploitation in this study the interactions for simulation of aas illegal over exploitation pumping is considered as competition it should be noted that ee in addition to being influenced by aa s behavior is also impacted by hydrological and hydrogeological parameters to simulate the aquifer in this study like many other studies in the field of agent based modeling modflow was used e g reeves and zellner 2010 nouri et al 2019 2 1 3 market environment one step performed in me is to determine the price of water in lwm by crossing supply and demand curves where equilibrium price is recognized hoekstra et al 2001 to determine the epw presume that there is a virtual agent in the me that can trade water between buyer and seller agents next sensitivity analysis on the price of water and the volume of water may indicate aa s tendency to buy demand and or sell supply for different prices according to fig 3 a for any water price pi there are a million cubic meters in buying demand by the virtual agent and b million cubic meters of water subject to selling the value of pi which is called the shadow price will not be stable because trading at this price will correspond to a which does not necessarily generate maximum benefit in the market for the seller and the buyer thus there will be a certain price denoted by p so that the volume of water sold to the virtual agent and bought from it will be equal to c million cubic meters in this case p will be the epw and c will be the volume of water traded between aas in the region accordingly by crossing supply and demand curves the agreed water price epw for aas is obtained and without the need for a virtual agent buyers and sellers will identify their trading partner by knowing the amount of water they can exchange the characteristics of the equilibrium price determined as such is that neither the buyer nor the seller tends to disturb the price and or the quantity of water in the water market now if there is a change in water supply and demand e g reduction of groundwater permits or black market demand the epw will also respond according to the new conditions if the black market is formed due to over exploitation water supply will improve and since aas can meet their demand through the black market the overall demand will decrease under such conditions the supply and demand curves will react and accordingly the price of water decreases as illustrated in fig 3b however if groundwater permit is cut water demand will increase while supply will decrease in this case the supply and demand curves are as shown in fig 3c and the epw increases accordingly 2 2 behavioral rule of aas according to bandini et al 2009 the behavioral characteristics of agents are divided into three types reactive cognitive and hybrid aas are considered reactive agents because they have a specific location and perform their activity by being influenced by stimuli received from other agents or their environment akhbari and grigg 2015 accordingly aa behavioral characteristics is a set of action condition rules with a strategy selector that when more than one rule is activated chooses from different solutions the decision selected by the aa as a human being may be simulated by a number of models such as microeconomic models statistical models rules derived from experimental data an 2012 and economic optimizer ng et al 2011 the aas rules of behavior may be based on if then rules and behavioral functions based on questions from informed sources berglund 2015 accordingly on the basis of their memory on the feedback of the cultivation area type of crops neighbors type of product and their price aas will carry on following if then rules such that to prevent the cultivation area of each aa being optimized nouri et al 2019 and 2022 developed an abm that traces the behavior of aas using a linear programming with the objective function of maximizing profits gained through the sale of agricultural products part 1 to 3 of eq 1 subject to physical water and land balance and perceptual eq 4 to 6 constraints in this study the calibrated model of nouri et al 2019 and 2022 is adopted with the difference that in order to simulate the interactions among aas in this study the objective function in eq 1 is enforced eq 1 max b t i j 1 n o i j a r e a t i j p t 1 j c p a r t 1 j 1 n m i j p p t j n a r e a t i j p a r t 2 p e n a l t y t i p a r t 3 p t w w a t e r t i b u y w a t e r t i s a l e p a r t 4 i the objective function in eq 1 consists of four steps that determine sale revenue of agricultural products costs of services and investment penalties due to over exploitations and water trade benefit cost the difference between the objective function adopted in this research and the objective function implemented by nouri et al 2019 and 2022 lies in the latter step water trade issues in addition the water balance constraint must also be specified as in eq 2 in order to include the algebraic sum of over exploitation and traded water however the balance in the cultivation area maximum minimum of crop area and maximum of over exploitation of aas remains unchanged as expressed in eqs 3 5 respectively the latter is rooted in the perception and behavior of aas and reverses the interaction of learning and self learning eq 2 j 1 n a r e a t i j w a t e r i j w a t e r t i g w a t e r i s w a t e r t i b u y w a t e r t i s a l e w a t e r t i v i eq 3 j 1 n a r e a t i j a r e a i a v e i eq 4 pr o t i j Œ± 1 l e a r n i n g i j Œ≤ 1 i j eq 5 pr o t i j Œ± 2 s o t i o l e a r n i n g i j Œ≤ 2 i j eq 6 w a t e r t i v s o t i o pr e s s u r e i t i to develop the abm in a situation where aas trade can also be simulated there should be constraints imposed on the model developed by nouri et al 2019 and 2022 aas do not sell all their water permit in any trade because they wish to stay in the business through maintain a minimum production this constraint is reflected in eq 7 on the other hand the amount of over exploitation and traded water must be detectable for reasons such as pumping restrictions and the status of aquifer water table accordingly eq 8 is enforced in the linear programming as follows eq 7 w a t e r t i s a l e m w t i i eq 8 w a t e r t i v w a t e r t i b u y m w a i i 2 2 1 conflict resolution among aas eqs 1 to 8 are not adequate to simulate the behavior of agricultural sector the fluctuation in region s production is influence by overdraft and water trade and thus may hurt some aas that have did not participate in over exploitation and or water trade this process is organized by the farmers social network and persuades the aas to favor over exploitation and or water trading solutions nouri et al 2022 consider the objective function of linear programming as a multi objective for simulating this consequences there are several approaches to select a choice solution from available non dominated choices solutions one approach is the social choice method the social choice method also has various branches including the borda count method which is recognized as a suitable method for water resources planning zarghami and szidarovszky 2011 in this study eqs 9 and 10 enable selection of agreed choices solutions among aas eq 9 min m i t j 1 m w j t r i j t eq 10 s u n j e c t t o b j t b j t m i n i it should be noted that when r i j t equals unity the best choice from aa j in period t is choice i 3 case study the najafabad hydrological unit located in central iranian plateau contains one of the largest aquifers in iran the aquifer water table has experienced an average annual drop of 80 cm in the last decade nouri et al 2019 some 96 of the total annual groundwater pumping which amounts to 817 million cubic meters is withdrawn by agricultural sector isfahan regional water organization 2010 as shown in fig 4 there are five independent agricultural units i e agents that share najafabad aquifer nouri et al 2019 dominant crops in the region may be classified into three groups cereals including wheat rice barley and millet vegetables including potatoes onions and other vegetables and forage grains including corn alfalfa and clover nouri et al 2019 the characteristics of aa as of 2014 are shown in table 1 it should be noted that table 1 is derived through the review of available reports local interviews and questionnaires planned in this study 3 1 scenario generation in order to form a lwm in a given region specific local conditions including exchange restrictions priority allocation etc should be examined and the corresponding laws should be enacted ward and pulido velazquez 2009 maestu and g√≥mez ramos 2013 nikouei and ward 2013 sadoff et al 2015 wheeler et al 2017 some of the local conditions and limitations rules in this study are provided in appendix b in this study four policies were examined as shown in table 2 in this regard to manage groundwater abstractions groundwater permits was reduced by 17 in enforcing penalty policy on over exploitation penalty of 2 3 and 4 cents per cubic meter were imposed through sensitivity analysis combination of above four policies a total of 16 scenarios as addressed in table 3 were formed 4 results 4 1 initial settings the abm presented in section 2 was developed with collected information reports and questionnaires on najafabad hydrological unit to run the model as shown in fig 2 the first step requires initial settings ee was simulated using calibrated modflow model of heydari et al 2016 they calibrated the model based on 29 observation wells during 2009 2010 period and validated the model during 2010 2011 period furthermore linear programming subject to physical and behavioral constraints was adopted to simulate the behavior of aas maximum and minimum cultivation thresholds of fis s crops compiled by nouri et al 2019 and the associated calibrated coefficients were used in eqs 4 and 5 the maximum over exploitation constraint used in eq 6 was also estimated by fis based on settings of nouri et al 2022 relying on input of over exploitation of neighboring aas and the aquifer status in the previous period 4 2 agent based model results nsga ii was used to estimate the non dominated front of the set of solutions for this purpose the initial population of chromosomes was considered to be 100 while the generations of nsga ii implementation continued until full convergence of non dominated front agreed solution was selected from 100 convergent non dominated solutions according to eqs 9 and 10 the values of r i j t were calculated from the choices on the non dominated front in each period t while w j t was used as the lobbying power equal to aa s groundwater permit presented in table 1 finally the 16 scenarios presented in table 3 were executed over a ten year horizon of the 16 scenarios eight are based on the formation of lwm as shown in table 4 scenarios p i rp i tp i and rtp i involved lwm formation and the possibility of over exploitation the average maximum and minimum of over exploitation are shown in fig 5 to study the effect of lwm formation and over exploitation on the status of the aquifer the simulation results of the termination year are presented in fig 6 in addition aa s net profit and regional production are also important for evaluating lwm policy in the region for this purpose table 5 reports aa s net profit and regional production 5 analyses the results of scenarios may be examined from three perspectives water use crop pattern and net profit 5 1 water use and aquifer status the water use represents the algebraic sum of the aas groundwater permits the over exploitation and the water trade in scenarios in which r policy was not enforced the groundwater pumping remained constant during the implementation period in terms of over exploitation two issues of cost effectiveness for aas as consumers and resource sustainability for the government as regulator are important nikouei and ward 2013 clearly with increase in penalties water demand changes aidam 2015 this effect was observed throughout the scenarios in which the penalty policy was followed i e p i rp i tp i and rtp i as in fig 5 in scenarios p i the average amount of overdraft decreases as fine increases in case of p 4 in particular the over exploitation drops to zero in some years the declining trend is due to the fact that the net profit was less than the penalty that aas had to pay similar trend occurred in rp i tp i and rtp i scenarios the amount of overdraft within the set of rp i scenarios was more than those in p i scenarios the reason is that with the implementation of arp the aquifer level rises due to the decrease in the groundwater abstraction permits and thus aas tendency to over exploit increases similar trend also occurred in rtp i scenarios as compared with tp i scenarios although water demand is generally expected to decline with water pricing varela ortega et al 1998 the overdraft in tp i scenarios is much higher than those in p i scenarios this is because when lwm is formed aas tend to take more profit by trading their over exploitation this has occurred in lwm around the world zhang 2007 wheeler and cheesman 2015 wheeler et al 2017 in addition the tendency of aas to behave selfishly as common pool resources l√≥pez corona et al 2013 led to non cooperative response of water sellers 1 2 4 and 5 agents in over exploitation this is due to the greater tendency of the water buyer s agent 3 to increase over exploitation this situation was also observed in rtp i scenarios in comparison with rp i scenarios the aquifer was also affected by the policies embedded in the implemented scenarios as in fig 6 the arp implemented solely in scenario r balanced the aquifer and was able to compensate for about 27 m of decline in aquifer water table the aquifer water table in t and rt scenarios did not differ significantly from similar scenarios in which the lwm was not formed bau and r on the other hand as in fig 6 parts of the aquifer close to water buyer agent s were in an unfavorable state due to continuous pumping while the parts close to water seller agent s s were in better state due to decline in pumping this is one of negative water trade consequences palazzo and brozoviƒá 2014 that may lead to spatial inconsistency of groundwater resources young 2014 in rp i scenarios although there was over exploitation aquifer recovery occurred at a slow pace only in rp 2 scenario despite large over exploitation the water table was 0 7 m lower than the bau in the termination year however in rtp i scenarios except for rtp 4 water table dropped due to high penalty rtp 4 resulted in a trend similar to the bua scenario except that the water table was 1 2 m higher than that in bua scenario in the termination year 5 2 equilibrium water price in iran agricultural water permit varies from very cheap for surface water to free for groundwater nikouei and ward 2013 the fine imposed by the government in p i tp i and rtp i scenarios does not reflect the true value of water but may be a shadow price ziolkowska 2015 or black market price the epw was not similar in scenarios in which there was a policy of forming lwm as in table 4 according to section 2 1 3 the variation of epw occurred because supply and demand varied in different scenarios with increase in water in the market the price of water decreases and vice versa tu et al 2015 to draw the supply and demand diagram a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the price of water between scores of zero to 10 the total amount of water purchased by aas from the virtual agent was considered as demand and the total amount of water sold by aas to the virtual agent was considered as supply as in fig 7 the amount of water supply at the end was lower than the first year due to the implementation of the arp while at the same time the demand had increased therefore the supply demand curves shifted upwards in the termination year and as a result the epw increased it should be noted as shown in fig 2 that in step 4 social choice after selecting the best solution by borda count the amount of water purchased from the virtual agent and sold to the virtual agent corresponding to the specific price of water is checked if there is a balance between buying demand and selling supply then the model has reached the value of c in fig 3a otherwise the price of water will vary until the balance is established according to section 2 1 3 and fig 3c in the tr scenario due to the reduced supply and increased demand the epw increased by an average of 0 3 cents compared to that of the t scenario also due to overdraft in exchange of fine increase in supply and decrease in demand epw in tp i scenarios is generally lower than that in t scenarios in the case of tp i in practice the epw depended on the amount of fine penalty thus for example when a fine of 2 cents per cubic meter is imposed pt 2 since black market price is also equal to 2 cents per cubic meter the epw in the official market is the same but in scenario pt 4 where the fine is set at 4 cents per cubic meter the epw does not change much compared with that of scenario t the dependence of the epw on the amount of fine penalty in rtp i scenarios is much larger due to supply reduction based on arp and increased supply based on the overdraft policy 5 3 crop pattern as expected with change in water price farmers change their choice of crops aidam 2015 as shown in table 5 with the implementation of the arp in scenario r although the area of fodders remained almost constant the area of cereals and vegetables was reduced by 5 and 21 respectively in confronting with the decline of groundwater discharge permits aas are most concerned with maintaining the level of fodder resisting reduction of cereals cultivation while they exercised most of water reduction on cultivating vegetables therefore in order to implement the arp the regulator agent must adopt measures to limit such products in the region in scenarios subject to penalty policy in addition to increase in water consumption the area of crop cultivation also increased but increase in crop production was not similar in all scenarios in scenarios p i increase in crop area occurred for different crops however in rp i scenarios the area of cereals and fodders decreased while the area of vegetables increased the decrease in cereal area stems from the reduction in rice cultivation this is while the reduction of fodders is due to the fact that with reduction of groundwater permits aas allocated the water extracted through over exploitation to vegetable cultivation for more profit in scenario t because the water buyer aa was more inclined to grow vegetables the area under cereals and fodders reduced compared to those of bau scenario whereas the area of vegetable cultivation increased however by simultaneously enforcing arp and lwm in rt scenario since available water to the water buyer aa was less than that in t scenario the area of vegetables fodders reduced increased compared to those of t scenario the area of all products in tp i scenarios increased compared to those in t scenario because selling aas offered most of their groundwater permits in the market they started to over exploit and grow crops therefore the cultivation of crops especially fodder vegetables grew in case of rtp i scenarios due to implementation of arp the area of products decreased compared to that of tp i scenarios however in comparing rtp i scenarios with bau the area of vegetables and fodder increased while the area of cereals decreased so to maintain the level of strategic production the need for government intervention aimed at reducing the negative externalities is inevitable av et al 2016 this may be accomplished through legislation and monitoring razzaq et al 2019 5 4 benefit analysis due to reduction of groundwater permit scenarios based on arp i e scenarios r rp i rt and rtp i yielded less profit than scenarios in which balancing is not enforced i e scenarios bau p i t and pt i in scenarios subject to penalty policy water consumption increased due to overdraft and aas profit increased except in p 3 and p 4 scenarios in general with increase of fines penalty the tendency to over exploit decreased and consequently the net profit of agricultural sector decreased but such declining trend was not universal among aas the reason for such discrepancy in aas net profit may be attributed to the mechanism of choosing the agreed choice based on eqs 9 and 10 in scenarios where lwm was involved aas profit increased significantly especially for water seller agents because water buyer agent had to pay for planting and harvesting the increase in water buyer s profit was less than those of water sellers it should be noted that the success of the lwm depends on various factors including the diversity of water value added wheeler et al 2017 while according sections 2 1 1 and 3 1 profit in the lwm is strongly related to the environmental and institutional settings du et al 2017 6 discussion in this research through developing a socio agricultural economic model a major step was undertaken in understanding the water market functions and its consequences according to our results involving changes in agricultural pattern and negative impacts on the aquifer government interventions are the source of many resource problems in the region from there governance failures are the source of many resource problems paying attention to comprehensive approaches base on the impact of formal and informal institutions and the role of governmental and non governmental actors is more and more apparent pahl wostl 2009 meanwhile a comprehensive approach that involves sustainability and adopts water food energy nexus will be required social sustainability is promoted in the integrated water resources management approach pires et al 2017 zamanzad ghavidel et al 2021 although in this research a social model was developed that simulates the behavior of farmers while the aquifer was treated as the most important environmental indicator in the system social sustainability indicators such as employment or work hours have also been recommended karimi and ardakanian 2010 lehmann et al 2011 another approach that may be considered for comprehensive assessment of water market formation is water food energy nexus agricultural sector is one of the major energy consuming sectors in the world mirzaei et al 2019 although the cost of energy for farmers in a subsidized system including in iran is insignificant the effect of water trading on energy consumption in a non subsidized system should be further studied however what is most needed is a practical path to achieve the above goals by answering the question what are the necessary actions to achieve groundwater sustainability gleeson et al 2012 to answer this question the backcasting approach is a well known method of focusing on the desired future and knowing how to achieve it van der voorn et al 2012 for example van der voorn et al 2020 based on a comprehensive multi target backcasting and nexus approaches set environmental goals in a long term horizon and assessed potential of the conflicts and synergies between the environmental policy goals they concluded that the proposed comprehensive approach has the potential to ensure the resilience and sustainability of the system the proposed model in this study has limitations in terms of dealing with climate change impacts climate change affects the gw as well as the irrigation pattern nevertheless precipitation in the developed abm is considered as the main input by changing the input under climate change the model will respond accordingly however simulation of aas selection of crop pattern subject to climate change is required in future research this was beyond the scope of the present study 7 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to develop an abm that measures the feedback of lwm formation on the coupled hydrological agricultural economic system for this purpose the existing farmers were considered as aas the environment was divided into ee se and me components then the interaction among aas and with their environment was simulated in self learning and learning competition and cooperation categories the simulation model of aas behavior was developed based on linking linear programming nsga ii and borda count methods a linear programming model with physical constraints and behavioral constraints was developed in order to maximize aas profits finally based on three water policies involving arp penalty policy for over exploitation and formation of lwm 16 scenarios were developed and simulated the epw in the study area was obtained by crossing the supply and demand curves in scenarios where arp was not enforced the epw was almost constant during the simulation horizon on the other hand in scenarios where there was a possibility of over exploitation by aas the epw reduced to the amount of the fine penalty due to black market formation that benefitted from supply demand mechanism declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

appendix b the local conditions and limitations rules in this study some of the local conditions and limitations rules in this study may be summarized as follows due to large water demand for rice production in najafabad unit the policy of banning rice cultivation in this area has been proposed nouri et al 2019 for this reason in this study the use of traded water within the lwm is banned for rice cultivation any water trade is limited to legal permits therefore water pumped through over cannot be traded trade is limited to existing operating wells and new wells are prohibited for various reasons including traditional cultivation and small land area owned by some farmers not all of permits water is available to lwm diesel and electricity prices are subsidized only to licensed wells it is thus assumed that through sale of any license the electricity or diesel quota and subsidies will be delivered to the buyer 
11762,water trade has been recognized as a tool to improve water efficiency and reduce negative impacts of water scarcity however water trade success depends on regional settings institutional framework trade mechanism and water consumer behavior this research presents an agent based approach to simulate the behavior of farmers towards the local water market formation policy and measures its feedback in the hydrological agricultural economic system accordingly the farmers in each region were represented as an agricultural agent while the environment with which farmers interact was partitioned into three parts physical environment economic environment and social environment the behavior of agricultural agents was simulated based on linked mathematical programming and a multi objective optimization model coupled with borda count method to resolve conflicts among agents to evaluate the proposed method in a case study in central iran namely najafabad hydrological unit 16 scenarios including black market scenario were developed and further simulated the results showed that the equilibrium water price was strongly influenced by water supply and demand in the system the average equilibrium price under normal condition was equal to 3 cents per cubic meter this is while if permits were to be reduced in accordance with aquifer recovery policy both reducing supply and increasing demand the average equilibrium price increased by about 3 5 cents conversely following the scenario of imposing fines penalties for over exploitation increasing supply and reducing demand the equilibrium price dropped to 2 5 cents graphical abstract image 1 keywords agent based simulation borda conte method equilibrium price of water local water market non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii iran 1 introduction water demand in developing countries including iran is increasing day by day and as a result water resources especially groundwater resources are increasingly at risk mirzaei et al 2019 the trend continues to cause severe damage to the environment in addition with the unrelenting threat on resources in the long run economic and social sustainability as well as environmental sustainability will continue to suffer in such a situation water resources managers either try to increase supply and or manage the demand wheeler et al 2017 aghaie et al 2020 meanwhile water market is one of the demand side management strategies to deal with water shortages reddy 2008 wheeler et al 2017 rey et al 2018 aghaie et al 2020 by reallocating water dick and ringler 2008 on the basis of practical experiences de bonviller et al 2020 water trade has advantages such as protecting social and environmental values crase and o keefe 2009 providing more efficient ways to water reallocation nikouei and ward 2013 wheeler et al 2017 reducing drought damage najafi alamdarlo et al 2019 however water trade may lead to reduce water inflows and lower groundwater levels e g garrick et al 2009 janmaat 2011 ancev 2015 may not be suitable for areas with developing economies wheeler et al 2017 may lead to favor rich and powerful people barlow and clarke 2002 lead to deepen challenges in economies with inequality easter and huang 2014 and lead to negative social externalities e g bourgeon et al 2008 poddar et al 2014 libecap 2015 despite all criticism the water market is one of the most practical ways for water reallocation grafton and horne 2014 and has widely been adopted in the last decade seidl et al 2020 however the efficiency of water markets and managing its adverse effects depend heavily on institutional arrangement and market structure erfani et al 2015 wheeler et al 2017 aghaie et al 2020 in order to install an efficient water market in a region it is necessary to implement arrangements such as restructuring the administrative body and removing legal and judicial barriers wheeler et al 2017 aside from the numerous cases in the australian water trade arrangement experience young 2010 clear water rights are one of the pre conditions for water market success wheeler et al 2017 commercial tradable nature of water rights must be recognized in order to consolidate water rights matthews 2004 in iran ambitious goals have been targeted in order to reform the underlying structure of water resources management nikouei and ward 2013 for example in iran s national water resources development plan for the 20 year horizon the emphasis is on organizing and developing local water markets lwm iranian ministry of energy 2012 on the other hand temporary water transfer is not a new issue in water resources management in iranian context bohlolvand et al 2015 vahedizade et al 2018 in general water trade among license holders may be divided into temporary transfer short term and medium term and permanent license transfer hadjigeorgalis 2009 wheeler et al 2017 the tendency for temporary trade is much more common donohew 2009 various mechanisms have been designed for water transfers among which one can mention the bulletin board and double auction markets bjornlund 2003 hadjigeorgalis 2009 although many strengths may be enumerated for these two mechanisms howe 1997 they also have weaknesses on how buyers and sellers meet in bulletin board mechanism as well as inefficiency in sellers profit and buyers cost in double auction mechanism bjornlund 2003 therefore special attention should be paid to the pricing mechanism in the context of water market because if this is not done properly it can negatively affect the performance of water market feldman et al 2005 there are a number of considerations to keep in mind when a water market is framed and water is priced first water is an uncooperative commodity bakker 2005 2007 second the water market cannot be considered completely competitive tu et al 2015 du et al 2017 and third for economic reasons ostrom et al 1994 water resources especially groundwater are common pool resources l√≥pez corona et al 2013 overall the price of water follows the supply and demand system tu et al 2015 when demand increases under constant supply the price increases while if supply increases under constant demand the price of water decreases accordingly various models for market mechanisms and water prices were developed on the basis of rational economic behavior of farmers including dynamic models e g pitafi and roumasset 2009 nonlinear programming models e g balali et al 2011 or a combination of both e g ward and pulido velazquez 2009 and balali et al 2011 such models generally first estimate the water demand and then examine the water trade najafi alamdarlo et al 2019 while ignoring behavioral aspects of water consumers farmers decision making process is quite complex the process is a function of time and place du et al 2017 and influenced by farmers perception and experience deressa et al 2011 duinen et al 2015 in addition to the complexities and heterogeneities in the water market yang et al 2012 models based on the simulation of farmers behavior have recently been adopted although researchers have tried to simulate farmers behavior based on a positive planning model e g varela ortega et al 1998 iglesias and blanco 2008 agent based models abms are suited because of their ability to simulate the complexity of water demand behavior considering the interaction with other farmers and with water price in lwm berglund 2015 ali et al 2016 al amin et al 2018 many studies have focused on agent based modeling to simulate the behavior of water users e g nouri et al 2019 while some have studied water trade du et al 2017 studied farmers behavior by developing an abm in a hypothetical water market in texas based on double auction framework they found that while the common effects of behavioral parameters on sensitivity of water scarcity rent and learning in the water market are strong and complex efficient planning and advanced water market institutions are necessary for water trade to increase productivity as another example three different water auction mechanisms were compared in rafsanjan plain in iran aghaie et al 2020 to simulate the interactions in rafsanjan hydro economic system they divided agents into agricultural agents aas who are able to buy and sell water permits and regulator agents who may buy water permits for environmental conservation purposes they reported that there is a close relationship yet opposing trends between economic issues and hydrologic performance however because the interests of the water market are influenced by the behavior of water users nguyen et al 2013 no study is reported to have obtained the equilibrium water price through the intersection of supply and demand curves based on the behavior of agents in the system in this research the feedback of the formation of lwm on the hydrological agricultural economic system based on equilibrium price of water epw for the first time in iran is studied research objectives are to determine 1 aas profit 2 production volume of dominant products and 3 the aquifer status after the formation of local water market under different policy scenarios the innovation aspects of the present study are as follows 1 determine the epw in a lwm by crossing the supply and demand curve 2 examine the impact of aquifer recovery policy arp on the epw and 3 investigate the effect of black market in the form of pricing based on the policy of fines for over exploitation on water trade in the lwm the paper is organized as follows our abm is presented in section 2 followed by how to execute the model section 3 deals with the problem definition and is devoted to details of the methodology section 4 presents the algorithm validation and parameters tuning section 5 analyses the case study results and section 6 discusses outlines directions for future studies and limitations of the study finally section 7 presents conclusions of the study 2 agent based approach an abm consists of three parts the set of agents the environment and the interaction of agents with the components macal and north 2010 in developing an abm the agents in the system the environment in which the agents are located and the interaction among the agents and with the environment must be defined macal and north 2006 in this study farmers are considered as effective agents in the lwm for this purpose the type of interactions and their outcome are presented in fig 1 as fig 1a shows the aa with four neighbors also the volume of water over exploitation by each aa affects the production and consequently the price on one hand and impacts the aquifer status on the other hand since the abm should be able to simulate the hydrological agricultural economic system within the lwm the environment may be partitioned into as shown in fig 1b ecological environment ee social environment se and market environment me past research on abms has also listed interactions such as competition mialhe et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 cooperation akhbari and grigg 2013 sun and m√ºller 2013 learning mialhe et al 2012 akhbari and grigg 2013 berglund 2015 and self learning zhang et al 2016 nouri et al 2019 in this research four types of interactions including competition for over harvesting and buying selling water at better price cooperation to regulate the production market by choosing a superior cultivation pattern and learning and self learning for minimum and maximum cultivation of crops are adopted it should be noted that the government as a regulatory agent for enacting laws related to the formation of lwm and environmental organization s as an environmental agent to monitor the impact of the market on the aquifer and possible conflicts are also present in the system however in this study they have not been introduced into the simulation process due to their static and passive role as fig 2 shows the proposed model consists of four major parts 1 basic settings of the models which involve the supply price model of agricultural products the aquifer simulation model and the behavioral model of aas including simulation of the environment and that of the interaction between agents and the environment 2 estimation of the non dominated front of decision variables including the volume of over exploitation by each agent and the water trade among aas this is done via a multi objective optimization technique 3 the social hydrological agricultural economic model setup and execution and 4 identify aas agreed choice via the borda count method in the following section different parts of the proposed model are outlined 2 1 environment explanation 2 1 1 social environment one of the most important steps in abm is the simulation of its social components the first environment that is affected by the agents in this study is se se is a virtual space formed on the basis of observations communications and possibly aa controversies all the interactions of an aa as shown in fig 1 originate in the se along with other parts of the environment each aa interacts with other aas in the se for example nouri et al 2022 examined different aspects of aa interaction subject to over exploitation within the se among the interactions they examined the impact of drop in aquifer water table on the regulator s decision to impose penalty the institutions involved are those that monitor the amount of over exploitation and its impact on aquifer status as well as those that monitor the profit earned by aas in forming the lwm such institutions in addition to economic institutions will regulate and try to improve the status of all sectors without incorporating the impact of such institutions on the social environment any abm will lack real world interactions another advantage of abm that is embedded in the social environment is the ability to simulate the tragedy of commons based on the competitive behavior of aas nouri et al 2022 described the competitive behavior of agents i e the tendency to over exploitation in response to over exploitation of other aas they came to the conclusion that competitive gw overdraft leads to the tragedy of commons in this research aas behaviors were simulated based on abm setting proposed by nouri et al 2022 section 3 2 provides further description of how to simulate this part of the environment 2 1 2 ecological environment in this study ee involves an aquifer that is directly affected by aa s water pumping the pumping is influenced firstly by the amount declared in legal license issued by the authorities to the farmer and secondly by the amount of over exploitation in this study the interactions for simulation of aas illegal over exploitation pumping is considered as competition it should be noted that ee in addition to being influenced by aa s behavior is also impacted by hydrological and hydrogeological parameters to simulate the aquifer in this study like many other studies in the field of agent based modeling modflow was used e g reeves and zellner 2010 nouri et al 2019 2 1 3 market environment one step performed in me is to determine the price of water in lwm by crossing supply and demand curves where equilibrium price is recognized hoekstra et al 2001 to determine the epw presume that there is a virtual agent in the me that can trade water between buyer and seller agents next sensitivity analysis on the price of water and the volume of water may indicate aa s tendency to buy demand and or sell supply for different prices according to fig 3 a for any water price pi there are a million cubic meters in buying demand by the virtual agent and b million cubic meters of water subject to selling the value of pi which is called the shadow price will not be stable because trading at this price will correspond to a which does not necessarily generate maximum benefit in the market for the seller and the buyer thus there will be a certain price denoted by p so that the volume of water sold to the virtual agent and bought from it will be equal to c million cubic meters in this case p will be the epw and c will be the volume of water traded between aas in the region accordingly by crossing supply and demand curves the agreed water price epw for aas is obtained and without the need for a virtual agent buyers and sellers will identify their trading partner by knowing the amount of water they can exchange the characteristics of the equilibrium price determined as such is that neither the buyer nor the seller tends to disturb the price and or the quantity of water in the water market now if there is a change in water supply and demand e g reduction of groundwater permits or black market demand the epw will also respond according to the new conditions if the black market is formed due to over exploitation water supply will improve and since aas can meet their demand through the black market the overall demand will decrease under such conditions the supply and demand curves will react and accordingly the price of water decreases as illustrated in fig 3b however if groundwater permit is cut water demand will increase while supply will decrease in this case the supply and demand curves are as shown in fig 3c and the epw increases accordingly 2 2 behavioral rule of aas according to bandini et al 2009 the behavioral characteristics of agents are divided into three types reactive cognitive and hybrid aas are considered reactive agents because they have a specific location and perform their activity by being influenced by stimuli received from other agents or their environment akhbari and grigg 2015 accordingly aa behavioral characteristics is a set of action condition rules with a strategy selector that when more than one rule is activated chooses from different solutions the decision selected by the aa as a human being may be simulated by a number of models such as microeconomic models statistical models rules derived from experimental data an 2012 and economic optimizer ng et al 2011 the aas rules of behavior may be based on if then rules and behavioral functions based on questions from informed sources berglund 2015 accordingly on the basis of their memory on the feedback of the cultivation area type of crops neighbors type of product and their price aas will carry on following if then rules such that to prevent the cultivation area of each aa being optimized nouri et al 2019 and 2022 developed an abm that traces the behavior of aas using a linear programming with the objective function of maximizing profits gained through the sale of agricultural products part 1 to 3 of eq 1 subject to physical water and land balance and perceptual eq 4 to 6 constraints in this study the calibrated model of nouri et al 2019 and 2022 is adopted with the difference that in order to simulate the interactions among aas in this study the objective function in eq 1 is enforced eq 1 max b t i j 1 n o i j a r e a t i j p t 1 j c p a r t 1 j 1 n m i j p p t j n a r e a t i j p a r t 2 p e n a l t y t i p a r t 3 p t w w a t e r t i b u y w a t e r t i s a l e p a r t 4 i the objective function in eq 1 consists of four steps that determine sale revenue of agricultural products costs of services and investment penalties due to over exploitations and water trade benefit cost the difference between the objective function adopted in this research and the objective function implemented by nouri et al 2019 and 2022 lies in the latter step water trade issues in addition the water balance constraint must also be specified as in eq 2 in order to include the algebraic sum of over exploitation and traded water however the balance in the cultivation area maximum minimum of crop area and maximum of over exploitation of aas remains unchanged as expressed in eqs 3 5 respectively the latter is rooted in the perception and behavior of aas and reverses the interaction of learning and self learning eq 2 j 1 n a r e a t i j w a t e r i j w a t e r t i g w a t e r i s w a t e r t i b u y w a t e r t i s a l e w a t e r t i v i eq 3 j 1 n a r e a t i j a r e a i a v e i eq 4 pr o t i j Œ± 1 l e a r n i n g i j Œ≤ 1 i j eq 5 pr o t i j Œ± 2 s o t i o l e a r n i n g i j Œ≤ 2 i j eq 6 w a t e r t i v s o t i o pr e s s u r e i t i to develop the abm in a situation where aas trade can also be simulated there should be constraints imposed on the model developed by nouri et al 2019 and 2022 aas do not sell all their water permit in any trade because they wish to stay in the business through maintain a minimum production this constraint is reflected in eq 7 on the other hand the amount of over exploitation and traded water must be detectable for reasons such as pumping restrictions and the status of aquifer water table accordingly eq 8 is enforced in the linear programming as follows eq 7 w a t e r t i s a l e m w t i i eq 8 w a t e r t i v w a t e r t i b u y m w a i i 2 2 1 conflict resolution among aas eqs 1 to 8 are not adequate to simulate the behavior of agricultural sector the fluctuation in region s production is influence by overdraft and water trade and thus may hurt some aas that have did not participate in over exploitation and or water trade this process is organized by the farmers social network and persuades the aas to favor over exploitation and or water trading solutions nouri et al 2022 consider the objective function of linear programming as a multi objective for simulating this consequences there are several approaches to select a choice solution from available non dominated choices solutions one approach is the social choice method the social choice method also has various branches including the borda count method which is recognized as a suitable method for water resources planning zarghami and szidarovszky 2011 in this study eqs 9 and 10 enable selection of agreed choices solutions among aas eq 9 min m i t j 1 m w j t r i j t eq 10 s u n j e c t t o b j t b j t m i n i it should be noted that when r i j t equals unity the best choice from aa j in period t is choice i 3 case study the najafabad hydrological unit located in central iranian plateau contains one of the largest aquifers in iran the aquifer water table has experienced an average annual drop of 80 cm in the last decade nouri et al 2019 some 96 of the total annual groundwater pumping which amounts to 817 million cubic meters is withdrawn by agricultural sector isfahan regional water organization 2010 as shown in fig 4 there are five independent agricultural units i e agents that share najafabad aquifer nouri et al 2019 dominant crops in the region may be classified into three groups cereals including wheat rice barley and millet vegetables including potatoes onions and other vegetables and forage grains including corn alfalfa and clover nouri et al 2019 the characteristics of aa as of 2014 are shown in table 1 it should be noted that table 1 is derived through the review of available reports local interviews and questionnaires planned in this study 3 1 scenario generation in order to form a lwm in a given region specific local conditions including exchange restrictions priority allocation etc should be examined and the corresponding laws should be enacted ward and pulido velazquez 2009 maestu and g√≥mez ramos 2013 nikouei and ward 2013 sadoff et al 2015 wheeler et al 2017 some of the local conditions and limitations rules in this study are provided in appendix b in this study four policies were examined as shown in table 2 in this regard to manage groundwater abstractions groundwater permits was reduced by 17 in enforcing penalty policy on over exploitation penalty of 2 3 and 4 cents per cubic meter were imposed through sensitivity analysis combination of above four policies a total of 16 scenarios as addressed in table 3 were formed 4 results 4 1 initial settings the abm presented in section 2 was developed with collected information reports and questionnaires on najafabad hydrological unit to run the model as shown in fig 2 the first step requires initial settings ee was simulated using calibrated modflow model of heydari et al 2016 they calibrated the model based on 29 observation wells during 2009 2010 period and validated the model during 2010 2011 period furthermore linear programming subject to physical and behavioral constraints was adopted to simulate the behavior of aas maximum and minimum cultivation thresholds of fis s crops compiled by nouri et al 2019 and the associated calibrated coefficients were used in eqs 4 and 5 the maximum over exploitation constraint used in eq 6 was also estimated by fis based on settings of nouri et al 2022 relying on input of over exploitation of neighboring aas and the aquifer status in the previous period 4 2 agent based model results nsga ii was used to estimate the non dominated front of the set of solutions for this purpose the initial population of chromosomes was considered to be 100 while the generations of nsga ii implementation continued until full convergence of non dominated front agreed solution was selected from 100 convergent non dominated solutions according to eqs 9 and 10 the values of r i j t were calculated from the choices on the non dominated front in each period t while w j t was used as the lobbying power equal to aa s groundwater permit presented in table 1 finally the 16 scenarios presented in table 3 were executed over a ten year horizon of the 16 scenarios eight are based on the formation of lwm as shown in table 4 scenarios p i rp i tp i and rtp i involved lwm formation and the possibility of over exploitation the average maximum and minimum of over exploitation are shown in fig 5 to study the effect of lwm formation and over exploitation on the status of the aquifer the simulation results of the termination year are presented in fig 6 in addition aa s net profit and regional production are also important for evaluating lwm policy in the region for this purpose table 5 reports aa s net profit and regional production 5 analyses the results of scenarios may be examined from three perspectives water use crop pattern and net profit 5 1 water use and aquifer status the water use represents the algebraic sum of the aas groundwater permits the over exploitation and the water trade in scenarios in which r policy was not enforced the groundwater pumping remained constant during the implementation period in terms of over exploitation two issues of cost effectiveness for aas as consumers and resource sustainability for the government as regulator are important nikouei and ward 2013 clearly with increase in penalties water demand changes aidam 2015 this effect was observed throughout the scenarios in which the penalty policy was followed i e p i rp i tp i and rtp i as in fig 5 in scenarios p i the average amount of overdraft decreases as fine increases in case of p 4 in particular the over exploitation drops to zero in some years the declining trend is due to the fact that the net profit was less than the penalty that aas had to pay similar trend occurred in rp i tp i and rtp i scenarios the amount of overdraft within the set of rp i scenarios was more than those in p i scenarios the reason is that with the implementation of arp the aquifer level rises due to the decrease in the groundwater abstraction permits and thus aas tendency to over exploit increases similar trend also occurred in rtp i scenarios as compared with tp i scenarios although water demand is generally expected to decline with water pricing varela ortega et al 1998 the overdraft in tp i scenarios is much higher than those in p i scenarios this is because when lwm is formed aas tend to take more profit by trading their over exploitation this has occurred in lwm around the world zhang 2007 wheeler and cheesman 2015 wheeler et al 2017 in addition the tendency of aas to behave selfishly as common pool resources l√≥pez corona et al 2013 led to non cooperative response of water sellers 1 2 4 and 5 agents in over exploitation this is due to the greater tendency of the water buyer s agent 3 to increase over exploitation this situation was also observed in rtp i scenarios in comparison with rp i scenarios the aquifer was also affected by the policies embedded in the implemented scenarios as in fig 6 the arp implemented solely in scenario r balanced the aquifer and was able to compensate for about 27 m of decline in aquifer water table the aquifer water table in t and rt scenarios did not differ significantly from similar scenarios in which the lwm was not formed bau and r on the other hand as in fig 6 parts of the aquifer close to water buyer agent s were in an unfavorable state due to continuous pumping while the parts close to water seller agent s s were in better state due to decline in pumping this is one of negative water trade consequences palazzo and brozoviƒá 2014 that may lead to spatial inconsistency of groundwater resources young 2014 in rp i scenarios although there was over exploitation aquifer recovery occurred at a slow pace only in rp 2 scenario despite large over exploitation the water table was 0 7 m lower than the bau in the termination year however in rtp i scenarios except for rtp 4 water table dropped due to high penalty rtp 4 resulted in a trend similar to the bua scenario except that the water table was 1 2 m higher than that in bua scenario in the termination year 5 2 equilibrium water price in iran agricultural water permit varies from very cheap for surface water to free for groundwater nikouei and ward 2013 the fine imposed by the government in p i tp i and rtp i scenarios does not reflect the true value of water but may be a shadow price ziolkowska 2015 or black market price the epw was not similar in scenarios in which there was a policy of forming lwm as in table 4 according to section 2 1 3 the variation of epw occurred because supply and demand varied in different scenarios with increase in water in the market the price of water decreases and vice versa tu et al 2015 to draw the supply and demand diagram a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the price of water between scores of zero to 10 the total amount of water purchased by aas from the virtual agent was considered as demand and the total amount of water sold by aas to the virtual agent was considered as supply as in fig 7 the amount of water supply at the end was lower than the first year due to the implementation of the arp while at the same time the demand had increased therefore the supply demand curves shifted upwards in the termination year and as a result the epw increased it should be noted as shown in fig 2 that in step 4 social choice after selecting the best solution by borda count the amount of water purchased from the virtual agent and sold to the virtual agent corresponding to the specific price of water is checked if there is a balance between buying demand and selling supply then the model has reached the value of c in fig 3a otherwise the price of water will vary until the balance is established according to section 2 1 3 and fig 3c in the tr scenario due to the reduced supply and increased demand the epw increased by an average of 0 3 cents compared to that of the t scenario also due to overdraft in exchange of fine increase in supply and decrease in demand epw in tp i scenarios is generally lower than that in t scenarios in the case of tp i in practice the epw depended on the amount of fine penalty thus for example when a fine of 2 cents per cubic meter is imposed pt 2 since black market price is also equal to 2 cents per cubic meter the epw in the official market is the same but in scenario pt 4 where the fine is set at 4 cents per cubic meter the epw does not change much compared with that of scenario t the dependence of the epw on the amount of fine penalty in rtp i scenarios is much larger due to supply reduction based on arp and increased supply based on the overdraft policy 5 3 crop pattern as expected with change in water price farmers change their choice of crops aidam 2015 as shown in table 5 with the implementation of the arp in scenario r although the area of fodders remained almost constant the area of cereals and vegetables was reduced by 5 and 21 respectively in confronting with the decline of groundwater discharge permits aas are most concerned with maintaining the level of fodder resisting reduction of cereals cultivation while they exercised most of water reduction on cultivating vegetables therefore in order to implement the arp the regulator agent must adopt measures to limit such products in the region in scenarios subject to penalty policy in addition to increase in water consumption the area of crop cultivation also increased but increase in crop production was not similar in all scenarios in scenarios p i increase in crop area occurred for different crops however in rp i scenarios the area of cereals and fodders decreased while the area of vegetables increased the decrease in cereal area stems from the reduction in rice cultivation this is while the reduction of fodders is due to the fact that with reduction of groundwater permits aas allocated the water extracted through over exploitation to vegetable cultivation for more profit in scenario t because the water buyer aa was more inclined to grow vegetables the area under cereals and fodders reduced compared to those of bau scenario whereas the area of vegetable cultivation increased however by simultaneously enforcing arp and lwm in rt scenario since available water to the water buyer aa was less than that in t scenario the area of vegetables fodders reduced increased compared to those of t scenario the area of all products in tp i scenarios increased compared to those in t scenario because selling aas offered most of their groundwater permits in the market they started to over exploit and grow crops therefore the cultivation of crops especially fodder vegetables grew in case of rtp i scenarios due to implementation of arp the area of products decreased compared to that of tp i scenarios however in comparing rtp i scenarios with bau the area of vegetables and fodder increased while the area of cereals decreased so to maintain the level of strategic production the need for government intervention aimed at reducing the negative externalities is inevitable av et al 2016 this may be accomplished through legislation and monitoring razzaq et al 2019 5 4 benefit analysis due to reduction of groundwater permit scenarios based on arp i e scenarios r rp i rt and rtp i yielded less profit than scenarios in which balancing is not enforced i e scenarios bau p i t and pt i in scenarios subject to penalty policy water consumption increased due to overdraft and aas profit increased except in p 3 and p 4 scenarios in general with increase of fines penalty the tendency to over exploit decreased and consequently the net profit of agricultural sector decreased but such declining trend was not universal among aas the reason for such discrepancy in aas net profit may be attributed to the mechanism of choosing the agreed choice based on eqs 9 and 10 in scenarios where lwm was involved aas profit increased significantly especially for water seller agents because water buyer agent had to pay for planting and harvesting the increase in water buyer s profit was less than those of water sellers it should be noted that the success of the lwm depends on various factors including the diversity of water value added wheeler et al 2017 while according sections 2 1 1 and 3 1 profit in the lwm is strongly related to the environmental and institutional settings du et al 2017 6 discussion in this research through developing a socio agricultural economic model a major step was undertaken in understanding the water market functions and its consequences according to our results involving changes in agricultural pattern and negative impacts on the aquifer government interventions are the source of many resource problems in the region from there governance failures are the source of many resource problems paying attention to comprehensive approaches base on the impact of formal and informal institutions and the role of governmental and non governmental actors is more and more apparent pahl wostl 2009 meanwhile a comprehensive approach that involves sustainability and adopts water food energy nexus will be required social sustainability is promoted in the integrated water resources management approach pires et al 2017 zamanzad ghavidel et al 2021 although in this research a social model was developed that simulates the behavior of farmers while the aquifer was treated as the most important environmental indicator in the system social sustainability indicators such as employment or work hours have also been recommended karimi and ardakanian 2010 lehmann et al 2011 another approach that may be considered for comprehensive assessment of water market formation is water food energy nexus agricultural sector is one of the major energy consuming sectors in the world mirzaei et al 2019 although the cost of energy for farmers in a subsidized system including in iran is insignificant the effect of water trading on energy consumption in a non subsidized system should be further studied however what is most needed is a practical path to achieve the above goals by answering the question what are the necessary actions to achieve groundwater sustainability gleeson et al 2012 to answer this question the backcasting approach is a well known method of focusing on the desired future and knowing how to achieve it van der voorn et al 2012 for example van der voorn et al 2020 based on a comprehensive multi target backcasting and nexus approaches set environmental goals in a long term horizon and assessed potential of the conflicts and synergies between the environmental policy goals they concluded that the proposed comprehensive approach has the potential to ensure the resilience and sustainability of the system the proposed model in this study has limitations in terms of dealing with climate change impacts climate change affects the gw as well as the irrigation pattern nevertheless precipitation in the developed abm is considered as the main input by changing the input under climate change the model will respond accordingly however simulation of aas selection of crop pattern subject to climate change is required in future research this was beyond the scope of the present study 7 conclusion the main purpose of this study was to develop an abm that measures the feedback of lwm formation on the coupled hydrological agricultural economic system for this purpose the existing farmers were considered as aas the environment was divided into ee se and me components then the interaction among aas and with their environment was simulated in self learning and learning competition and cooperation categories the simulation model of aas behavior was developed based on linking linear programming nsga ii and borda count methods a linear programming model with physical constraints and behavioral constraints was developed in order to maximize aas profits finally based on three water policies involving arp penalty policy for over exploitation and formation of lwm 16 scenarios were developed and simulated the epw in the study area was obtained by crossing the supply and demand curves in scenarios where arp was not enforced the epw was almost constant during the simulation horizon on the other hand in scenarios where there was a possibility of over exploitation by aas the epw reduced to the amount of the fine penalty due to black market formation that benefitted from supply demand mechanism declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

appendix b the local conditions and limitations rules in this study some of the local conditions and limitations rules in this study may be summarized as follows due to large water demand for rice production in najafabad unit the policy of banning rice cultivation in this area has been proposed nouri et al 2019 for this reason in this study the use of traded water within the lwm is banned for rice cultivation any water trade is limited to legal permits therefore water pumped through over cannot be traded trade is limited to existing operating wells and new wells are prohibited for various reasons including traditional cultivation and small land area owned by some farmers not all of permits water is available to lwm diesel and electricity prices are subsidized only to licensed wells it is thus assumed that through sale of any license the electricity or diesel quota and subsidies will be delivered to the buyer 
11763,hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater has been carried out in a hard rock aquifer from balangir district a fluorosis affected area of odisha india with the aim of understanding the sources and processes controlling fluoride f enrichment a total of 37 groundwater tube wells and 7 surface water pond samples were collected during the pre monsoon period groundwaters are mostly categorized as moderate to very hard water types with alkaline nature the enhanced na and hco3 concentration in groundwater is mostly a result of silicate weathering the f concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 4 to 4 29 mg l with 38 of samples exceeded the drinking water limit 1 5 mg l as prescribed by the world health organization 2011 in contrast to very low f 0 9 mg l in surface water high f concentrations in underlying granitic bedrocks up to 700 mg kg which spatially corresponds to f rich groundwater suggest that lithological composition is the main control of f fluoride rich waters are mostly na hco3 type followed by mixed na ca hco3 cl type with na ca2 ratio 1 the significant positive correlations of f with na hco3 and ph indicate that the weathering of sodium rich silicate minerals and increase of ph mobilizes f ion geochemical modeling indicates that the activity of f in groundwater increased by precipitation of calcite dolomite and aragonite fluoride risk assessment indicates that 38 of groundwater samples can cause a high prevalence of dental fluorosis with children being at greater risk than adults henceforth it is advisable to treat this contaminated groundwater before consumption or provide alternative drinking water to avoid further fluorosis risks in the concerned area graphical abstract image 1 keywords deep aquifer fluoride enrichment

bending of bones and stiffs joints with difficulties in walking along with other health problems such as low hemoglobin levels gastrointestinal problems bone resorption skin rashes urinary tract malfunctioning etc ayoob and gupta 2006 ijumulana et al 2021 jha et al 2013 kharb and susheela 1994 mitsuru et al 2001 excess fluoride level in groundwater has been a great challenge for several countries worldwide globally it is estimated that more than 300 million people across 29 countries including india china pakistan saudi arabia the united states u s uganda tanzania egypt and ethiopia are suffering from endemic fluorosis mainly due to consumption of f contaminated drinking water groundwater on a daily basis for various purposes bhattacharya et al 2020 carrillo rivera et al 2002 de et al 2022 demelash et al 2019 ijumulana et al 2020 2022 kimambo et al 2019 kim and jeong 2005 kumar et al 2020 2021 mridha et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 in india more than 66 million people are at risk of developing fluorosis from consuming fluoride enriched groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 and this is alarming in 20 out of 29 states starting from hard rock and alluvial aquifers in southern central and eastern states like tamil nadu andhra pradesh madhya pradesh odisha jharkhand bihar west bengal etc de et al 2022 jacks et al 2005 kumar et al 2019 laxamkumar et al 2019 magesh et al 2016 mridha et al 2021 sahu et al 2021 to the alluvial aquifers in north western states like punjab haryana rajasthan gujarat etc choubisa 2018 garg and singh 2013 kumar et al 2021 mittal et al 2021 sahoo et al 2022 thus in these areas groundwater is becoming a serious concern for the drinking water supply the high occurrence of f in groundwater is generally governed by several natural factors including the high abundance of f bearing minerals in the host rocks hydrogeological condition groundwater chemistry and residence time carrillo rivera et al 2002 de et al 2022 jacks et al 2005 kim and jeong 2005 mukherjee and singh 2018 besides the distribution of f in groundwater is also influenced by environmental and climate conditions kumar et al 2020 sahoo et al 2022 the common fluoride enriched minerals are fluorite biotites apatite micas and amphiboles which are associated with host rocks such as granite alkali igneous rocks gneisses mica shales etc choubisa 2018 kumar et al 2019 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 also fluorine is a component of all magmas thus fluorine is much higher in igneous rocks compared to any other rocks hayes et al 2017 the mobilization process of fluoride in groundwater is dependent on various factors such as temperature ph solubility of fluoride bearing minerals cation and anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials precipitation adsorption and biochemical reaction garc√≠a and borgnino 2015 mukherjee and singh 2018 saxena and ahmed 2003 fluoride has a very nearly similar ionic size to hydroxide ion oh and both are negatively charged thus the f ion can easily displace oh within the mineral arrangements during the chemical reaction saxena and ahmed 2003 the presence of excessive sodium na and bicarbonates hco3 in groundwater increases the dissolution rate of fluoride from f bearing minerals due to water mineral interaction saxena and ahmed 2003 mukherjee and singh 2018 besides natural processes anthropogenic sources such as the use of fertilizer extraction of metals and burning of coal also cause enhancement of f in groundwater ayoob and gupta 2006 kumar et al 2020 thus a better understanding of the source and mobilization mechanism of f and consequent changes in the water chemistry under specific geographic and geologic conditions are very crucial for water resources management purposes odisha an eastern state in india houses around 40 million inhabitants of which more than 90 of rural household and 50 of urban household is dependent on groundwater for drinking purpose in some districts of central and western parts of the state cgwb 2010 sahu et al 2021 the issue of f contamination 1 5 mg l in groundwater is severe balangir district is one of them where the prevalence of dental fluorosis is a serious health concern in several villages due to the excessive presence of fluoride in groundwater cgwb 2013 mahapatra 2007 although the general aspect of groundwater f contamination for this district has been reported behera 2020 the genetic classification of the groundwater fluoride contamination and the hydrogeochemical processes that drive this contamination has been hardly addressed furthermore regarding the source sahu et al 2021 reported the geogenic contribution of fluoride in this region however the specific rock type that is responsible for higher levels of fluoride in groundwater is under explored since the rock types of the area are varied widely the geogenic sources of fluoride in the region can be diverse and complicated considering this fact the present study aims to address the hydrogeochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater along with fluorine analysis in underlying rock types to understand the major source process and geochemical mechanism responsible for f enrichment in groundwater of the balangir district this result will be very helpful for identifying risk areas and minimizing the health risks of fluoride exposure also this knowledge will help to develop a management plan for augmenting safe drinking water sources in the area and to open a new vista for further research 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is located in the northern part of the balangir district odisha which lies between latitudes 21 4 n and 20 9 n and longitudes 82 41 e and 83 32 e and has an area of 6575 km2 fig 1 the climate of the district is tropical with hot and dry climate prevailing in the region three distinct seasons are mainly observed such as winter summer and rainy the winter november february temperatures vary from 3 to 16 c while the summer march june temperature reaches up to 45 c the rainy season prevails from june to october with an average annual rainfall of 1502 mm out of which approximately 80 is received during the southwest monsoon cgwb 2013 droughts are quite common in the district 2 2 hydrogeological settings the hydrogeology of the district is primarily controlled by the bed rock lithology and the associated geological structures topography rainfall pattern and aquifer type the major parts of the district are covered by hard rock terrain and fall within the proterozoic eastern ghats mobile belt egmb behera 2020 mahalik 1996 ramakrishnan and vaidyanadhan 2008 sahu et al 2013 the major crystalline rock types in the region include granite and gneisses leptynite khondalite megacrystic granitoid charnockite quartzites and anorthosite which cover a major proportion about 95 of the area fig 2 a among them granite gneisses are the most dominating followed by khondalites the groundwater in the area occurs in both shallow and deep aquifers shallow aquifers are constituted by weathered formations while deep aquifers are constituted by fractured crystalline rocks where groundwater occurs under semi confined to confined conditions cgwb 2013 chandra et al 2012 the depth to water level fig 2b in the region was 0 78 6 85 m bgl during the post monsoon season in shallow aquifers while in the pre monsoon season it ranges from 1 33 to 8 85 m bgl cgwb 2013 2 3 sampling and chemical analysis 2 3 1 sample collection and preparation a total number of 37 groundwater samples were collected from tube wells of the 19 villages around the study area fig 1 these wells mostly penetrate the fractured aquifer and occur in the deep aquifer between 60 and 100 m depth samples were collected in cleaned high density polyethylene bottles during the post monsoon season in the year 2015 also about 7 surface water samples were collected from ponds in the nearby villages prior to the collection of groundwater samples the tube wells were flushed 4 to 5 times to remove stagnant waters and get a true representative of a sample the samples used for metal analysis were acidified with nitric acid ph 2 in the field the entire water quality and rock chemical data used in this work were taken from the geological survey of india report ray 2005 and complete information has been provided in supplementary information table s1 2 3 2 chemical analysis physico chemical parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 carbonate

analytical quality for the major ions was checked via computing ionic balance error ibe cations anions cations anions 100 where all cations and anions were expressed in meq l the calculated results showed that the ibe varied from 4 43 to 4 04 which confirmed the reliability of the data the water quality was evaluated by comparing it with the who drinking water guideline values who 2011 to measure the fluorine level in rock samples 0 25 g of the finely powdered rock samples 75 Œºm was mixed with a 2 5 g fusion mixture anhydrous sodium carbonate and anhydrous potassium nitrate in 2 1 by weight in a nickel crucible the mixture was fused at 600 c for 30 40 min on a mecker burner after cooling 10 ml of deionized water di was added to the nickel crucible and left overnight to dissolve the residue then the solution was filtered using whatman cellulose filter paper 8 Œºm pore size grade 40 transferred to a 100 ml volumetric flask added 20 ml citrate buffer and made up to the mark with di approximately 25 ml of the solution was taken in a 50 ml plastic beaker and mixed with a total ionic strength adjusting buffer tisab iii solution at a ratio of 1 1 the tisab iii was prepared using cdta 1 2 diaminocyclohexane n n n n tetraacetic acid acetic acid sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide following the standard method nico 2000 this buffer has three major functions including the adjustment of the ph to 5 5 this ph appears to be optimum for the determination of fluoride the provision of a constant high ionic strength and the release of fluoride from complexes fluoride standards used in the preparation of the calibration curve were also added to the tisab buffer in the same ratio and then the concentration of fluoride in the solution was measured using the fluoride ion selective electrode method orion ise model no 9409sc for method calibration a stock solution 100 ppm f was prepared by dissolving 0 221 g of sodium fluoride salts naf previously dried 5 h at 120 c

characterization relevant graphical plots such as piper plot gibbs plot and bivariate plot were prepared for the dataset the saturation index si of various secondary mineral phases and fluoride species in groundwater and surface water samples was calculated using the gss the geochemist s spreadsheet program of the geochemist s workbench student version edition 12 2 5 human health risk assessment an assessment of human health risk upon consumption of fluoride contaminated groundwater was carried out for this work for three different groups male female and children this is based upon the method introduced by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1989 this method involves the calculation of chronic daily intake cdi and a non carcinogenic risk index also known as the hazard quotient hq detailed below the cdi has been calculated using formula 1 introduced by usepa 1989 and defined by the following parameters 1 c d i c w i r e f e d b w a t where cdi is the chronic daily intake of groundwater mg kg day cw is the concentration of fluoride in water mg l ir is the ingestion rate of the water l day ef is the exposure frequency day year and ed is the exposure period years bw is the average body weight kg and at denotes average exposure time days the standard reference values for all of the above mentioned parameters used for assessment are furnished in supplementary table s2 the hq is calculated using formula 2 2 h q c d i r f d where rfd is the reference fluoride dose in mg kg day rfd is used to evaluate the fluoride health risk associated with a particular exposure route the reference value for rfd is also mentioned in supplementary table s2 hq value 1 ensures protection against the possibility of negative health related impacts whereas a value greater than one enhances the risk of potential non carcinogenic health problems from consuming fluoride contaminated water 3 results and discussion 3 1 general expression of hydro geochemical data the general descriptive statistics of chemical compositions of the groundwater and surface water samples along with the drinking water guideline values who 2011 are given in table 1 the mean and median concentrations of several chemical constituents were nearly similar which is indicative of their normal distribution however this is different for na k and no3 which had a higher variability with cv coefficient of variation 100 with higher sd standard deviation a larger cv indicates a wide variety of chemical contents in water which may be a result of multiple sources hydrogeochemical processes sahoo et al 2019 the descriptive statistics mean median and quartile values table 1 show that there is a considerable variation in the concentrations of chemical constituents between groundwater and surface waters with significantly higher concentrations in the former this is corroborated with the mann whitney u test which indicated that most of the parameters were significantly different sig 0 00 between the two water types table 2 the ph ranged from 7 27 to 8 76 and 7 24 7 86 in groundwater and surface waters respectively indicating weak alkaline conditions and all these values are falling within the permissible limit for drinking water who 2011 except one the tds was found to be much higher 405 1717 mg l in groundwater compared to surface water 88 493 mg l with 88 of groundwater samples exceeding the most desirable limit of tds 500 mg l in drinking water as per who 2011 high tds levels indicate a high level of mineralization in the sub surface due to high leaching of major cations and anions from aquifer rocks hem 1989 the average dominant cation in groundwater is na and the order of abundance is na ca2 mg2 k while ca is dominating in most of the surface water samples in the order as ca2 na mg2 k the concentration of na ranged from 27 8 to 400 6 mg l in groundwater and 4 4 54 mg l in surface water the maximum permissible limit of na in drinking water is 200 mg l who 2011 and most of the samples were within the limit except 5 5 in comparison with na very low concentration of k in both groundwater and surface water which was probably due to the high resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering in the study area hem 1989 mg2 is slightly lower than ca2 probably due to the low abundance of mg2 in the bedrocks the ca2 and mg2 ions present in the groundwater may be derived from carbonate and or calcium and magnesium bearing rock forming silicates total hardness th was calculated from the individual ion concentrations of ca2 and mg2 using equation 3 sawyer et al 2003 the th is varying from 111 to 728 mg l and 55 241 mg l in groundwater and surface water respectively this indicates groundwater tends to be harder than surface water high positive correlation of th with so4 2 and cl and poorly with hco3 table 3 is suggesting that the hardness of the water is predominantly permanent in nature according to sawyer and mccarthy 1967 classification 64 of groundwater samples are considered very hard water 300 mg l while 25 as hard water 150 300 mg l however all surface waters are designated as soft 75 mg l to moderately hard water 75 150 mg l the acceptable hardness level for drinking purpose is from 80 to 100 mg l while hardness values exceeding 200 mg l is considered poor and those over 500 mg l are considered unacceptable for domestic purposes health canada 1995 this indicates that some of the groundwaters are unsuitable for drinking as well as for domestic purposes 3 hardness as mgcaco 3 l 2 49 ca mg l 4 118 mg mg l in major anions the order of average abundance was found to be hco3 cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 is the predominant weak acid in the water which varied from 133 to 821 mg l and 75 262 mg l respectively in groundwater and surface water its predominance in water along with na suggests intense chemical weathering of primary silicate minerals dominated by alkali metals hem 1989 between strong acid cl so4 2 anions the average cl is higher and ranges from 10 to 398 mg l in groundwater wherein 10 of samples exceeded the who permissible limit 250 mg l but in the case of so4 2 all samples lie within the maximum permissible limit of who 200 mg l the cl in groundwater can be contributed by atmospheric deposition or lithogenic like weathering of halites and evaporates and or anthropogenic sources like irrigation runoff leachate from landfill waste dumps etc izbicki et al 2006 no3 varies from 1 2 to 318 mg l in groundwater and 0 2 27 mg l in surface water a higher concentration of no3 exceeding the desirable drinking water limit 50 mg l was observed in 30 of groundwater samples this may be contributed by agricultural activity animal waste and septic tank leakage the po4 3 in the study area was lowest among anions maybe because of po4 3 adsorption by soil fe al oxyhydroxides clay minerals and or its uptake by the plants fang et al 2017 3 2 f distribution and source in groundwater and surface water the f concentration in groundwaters varied widely from 0 1 to 4 2 mg l table 1 with 33 of samples exceeding the drinking water permissible limit 1 5 mg l recommended by who 2011 on contrary in surface water its concentration was mostly below 0 9 mg l the distribution maps figs 1 and 3 showed that f was mostly enriched 1 5 mg l in the northern villages such as patharmunda rampur m pada jhamipali kudapali barnakita badighar the highest concentration was reported in patharmunda these villages can be considered in high risk zones other studies also reported high f concentrations in groundwater of the northern part agalpur block and central part belpada and deogaon blocks of the balangir district srivastava and tiwari 2006 high f enriched groundwater can be commonly influenced by local lithology and rock water interaction in the hard rock aquifers the study area balangir district is occupied by diverse rock types with granite granitic gneiss as the dominating types in the present study f analysis of different rock samples collected from the balangir district was given in table 3 it is observed that f is highly enriched in the underlying rock types mainly in porphyroblastic garnetiferous granite gnesis 700 mg kg followed by migmatite with pyroxene granulite enclave 600 mg kg and garnetiferous granite gnesis 500 mg kg and anorthosite luco granite 400 mg kg from the spatial distribution plot fig 1 it can also be seen that f enriched groundwaters are closely following their corresponding high f enriched rock samples this indicates that groundwater f contamination in the study area is mostly of geogenic origin and this is predominantly contributed by granitic and migmatitic rocks this is corroborated by recent studies conducted in the hard rock terrain of odisha sahoo et al 2019 the contribution from anthropogenic sources like the application of fertilizer due to agricultural activity is negligible as f is very poorly correlated with no3 and so4 2 table 4 3 3 hydrogeochemical facies in waters in order to identify the dominant water facies in water bodies the major ions were subjected to the piper plot piper 1994 which gives better insight into the hydrochemistry of water for this purpose the water samples were grouped into 3 categories based on f enrichment group 1 groundwater 1 5 mg l f group 2 groundwater f 1 5 mg l and group 3 surface water f 1 mg l in the piper plot fig 3a it can be seen that no clear dominance of alkali na k over alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 in groundwaters except for a few samples of group 1 but in the anions field weak acid hco3 remained predominant over strong acids so4 2 cl in all groups also there is a significant change in the hydro chemical facies between water types the majority of group 1 samples whose f concentrations are 1 5 mg l are mostly classified into na hco3 type followed by mixed na ca mg hco3 and mixed ca mg cl whereas group 2 samples mostly fall into mixed ca mg cl and ca hco3 type and most of the group 3 samples fall into ca hco3 type except a few samples fig 3b absence of na cl facies indicates that salinity is not an issue in this area 3 4 identification of hydro geochemical processes and source of major solutes different geochemical processes such as rock water interactions dissolution precipitation evaporation ion exchange oxidation and reduction reaction commonly control groundwater chemistry jacks et al 2005 mukherjee and singh 2018 saxena and ahmed 2003 to understand this aspect gibbs plot and bivariate diagrams were constructed spearman correlation coefficients were also estimated to understand the relations between water quality variables table 3 gibbs diagram fig 4 a and b was constructed by the equivalence ratios of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 as a function of tds gibbs 1970 this diagram demarcates three predominant hydrogeochemical processes rock water interaction precipitation and evaporation dominance as seen in fig 4 except for a few samples most of the data points were plotted on the rock weathering dominance zone suggesting that the weathering of the rock minerals is the important process governing the groundwater geochemistry in the study area the high and positive correlation r between tds and the major cationic species like na2 0 8 mg2 0 78 ca2 0 6 and hco3 0 66 r significant at p 0 01 suggests that these parameters originate from a common source and silicate hydrolysis is the most governing hydrochemical process the role of evaporation was evaluated through the na cl ratio vs ec scatter diagram fig 5 h generally evaporation results in an increase in the concentration of ec with the na cl ratio remaining constant thus this ratio can be used as a good indicator of evaporation jankowski and acworth 1997 from fig 5h it can be seen that group 1 groundwater samples mostly showed a declining trend and the na cl ratio does change during the increase of ec this indicates that evaporation may not be a major process controlling water chemistry jankowski and acworth 1997 the probable cause for altering the na cl ratio may be due to silicate weathering and or extreme ion exchange processes kumar and james 2016 this is consistent with gibb s plot as most of the samples were plotted in the rock weathering zone this can be further evaluated by na vs cl plot fig 5a if the molar ratio of na cl is 1 then there will be silicate weathering or cation exchange if this is 1 it will represent evaporation or anthropogenic contribution and if this ratio is approximately 1 the data points will be distributed along a 1 1 line then halite dissolution is responsible for na dominance in groundwater meybeck 1987 in this study most of the group 1 groundwater samples lie above the 1 1 na cl line indicating that the na may be attributed to silicate weathering meybeck 1987 although some samples lie close to and below the 1 1 equiline the dominance of hco3 as the most abundant anion in those waters and most of these samples falling along the 1 1 line in the na vs hco3 biplot fig 5b along with both ions maintained a very strong correlation which evidenced that weathering of silicate minerals like granite gneiss oligoclase perthite and k feldspars etc are the major source of na and hco3 rajmohan and elango 2004 zhang et al 2020 this is further supported by the bivariate plot of ca2 na vs hco3 na fig 5f in which most of the data points fall close to the global average silicate weathering domain the relationship between na k and total cations tz fig 5c also evaluated the silicate vs carbonate weathering stallard and edmond 1983 in this plot fig 5 the majority of the samples are plotted above the 1 1 line fig 5c indicating an abundance of silicate weathering for the higher concentrations of na with hco3 in the groundwater in the studied aquifer rajmohan and elango 2004 stallard and edmond 1983 in the groundwater alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 may come from various sources like weathering and dissolution of carbonate silicate minerals and sulphate minerals like gypsum in the ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 scatter diagram fig 5e samples falling above the 1 1 trend line suggest these ions resulted from carbonate weathering while along the 1 1 trend line suggests weathering of carbonates and silicate minerals rajmohan and elango 2004 sonkamble et al 2012 additionally samples plotting below 1 1 trend line indicating silicate weathering collectively the results indicate that for most of the group 1 groundwater samples silicate weathering is dominant whereas others could have a mixed source such as carbonate silicate gypsum etc in the system the poor correlations of ca2 table 4 with hco3 0 17 suggest a limited role in carbonate dissolution zhang et al 1995 this is further evaluated in a bivariate plot of ca2 and hco3 fig 5d according to this if the ratio between ca2 and hco3 is 1 1 it is indicative of calcite weathering while 1 2 for dolomite 1 1 7 is for pyroxene and 2 7 for amphibole zhang et al 2020 reference therein in this study this distinctly indicates silicate weathering in group 1 with high f waters that are under the 2 1 trend line while a few samples are under the 1 1 line however as shown in the plot of ca2 and so4 2 fig 5g most of the samples plotted below the 1 1 line and theca so4 2 molar ratio 1 indicating gypsum contribution is less likely although ca2 shows a positive correlation with so4 2 0 51 the gypsum si values for all groundwater samples were less than zero fig 6 a indicating that groundwaters are unsaturated with respect to this mineral and it is less likely to occur in the study area this is consistent with the geology of the study area moreover si values of dolomite calcite and anhydrite 1 fig 6a and their positive correlation with ca suggest table 4 that secondary precipitation of carbonate minerals can be an additional factor influencing ca2 concentration in groundwater furthermore cation exchange reactions with aquifer clay materials can be a responsible process for controlling f chemistry in groundwater cartwright et al 2007 schoeller 1965 in direct ion exchange na and k in groundwater may exchange with ca2 or mg2 in clay minerals equation 4 and na or k will decrease in water and on the contrary in a reverse reaction equation 5 ca2 or mg2 in groundwater may lead to the exchange of na to water by ca2 or mg2 in clay minerals cartwright et al 2007 4 2 na cax 2 2 nax ca 2 5 ca 2 2 nax cax 2 2 na where x indicates as soil exchanger in the plot fig 5e high f bearing points shift towards the hco3 so4 2 region which indicates reverse ion exchange is the case controlling these samples while others shift towards the ca2 mg2 region indicating a normal ion exchange process for them this is further studied using the chloro alkaline indices cai i equation 6 and cai ii equation 7 proposed by schoeller 1965 which were used to study the occurrence of specific ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment fig 5i shows that most of the samples indicate negative values for both indices suggesting a dominance of reverse ion exchange processes in the aquifer systems 6 c a i i cl n a k cl 7 c a i i i cl n a k c o 3 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 n o 3 3 5 genesis of f enriched groundwater and geochemical modeling besides rock mineralogy fluoride concentration in groundwater can be controlled by its hydrogeochemical characteristics jacks et al 2005 laxamkumar et al 2019 saxena and ahmed 2003 the high f enriched groundwaters are rich in na hco3 relatively high ph and poor in ca2 and are predominantly na hco3 type this chemical characteristic is predominantly controlled by silicate weathering and cation exchange processes in the aquifer as discussed above the significant positive correlation of f with ph and na indicates that the dissolution of f bearing silicate minerals under alkaline conditions could lead to simultaneous f and na enrichment in groundwater alkaline ph favours the precipitation of caco3 which leads to producing f na enriched and ca2 poor water jacks et al 2005 this can be supported by the hco3 ca2 ratio 1 for all f enriched groundwater samples saxena and ahmed 2003 moreover a strong positive correlation between f and hco3 a competitive ion revealed that elevated hco3 promoted f release from the aquifer matrix into groundwater haji et al 2018 also anion exchange oh for f can be a dominant process for f mobilization at alkaline ph as oh in groundwater replaces the exchangeable f containing in minerals clays thus it favours the solubility of fluoride bearing minerals apambire et al 1997 in groundwater where fluorite dissolution is a predominant cause of f contamination then f concentration should be negatively correlated with ca in this study the weak correlation between f and ca2 table 4 suggests that the f contribution in the groundwater is not only from the dissolution of fluorite minerals but also from other rocks rich in alkali metals haji et al 2018 the former is unlikely as there is hardly any fluorite in the rocks of the study area the latter can be supported with the f enrichment in different granite bearing silicate rocks in the study area moreover elevated na concentration coupled with low ca2 suggests that ca2 and na2 ion exchange process is an important geochemical process for f rich groundwater the ca2 deficiency is caused by a high cation exchange reaction in the aquifer that facilitates the removal of ca2 from the solution by replacing it with na ions from clay exchange sites to understand the chemical equilibrium occurring in groundwater that controls f contamination geochemical modeling has been applied in this study the saturation index si of fluorite calcite dolomite and aragonite has been calculated fig 6a and discussed to provide natural control of water quality in view of ca mg and f when si 1 minerals tend to dissolve while at si 1 they tend to be precipitated fluorite caf2 is often considered as a major source of f concentration in waters and it depends upon the state of equilibrium with regards to fluorite though there are some other minerals such as fluoroapatite mica amphibole clays etc which also regulate fluoride concentrations in groundwater apambire et al 1997 mukherjee and singh 2018 the absence of fluorite minerals in the studied lithology and its si 1 indicates that this mineral has no major contribution to f contamination the si values for calcite dolomite and aragonite for most of the groundwater samples are 1 indicating oversaturation and precipitation of these carbonate minerals in the study area while the waters are undersaturated with respect to evaporite minerals like gypsum anhydrite and halite the positive correlation of calcite and dolomite with f activity and inverse trend between ca2 and f fig 7 table 4 suggest that the precipitation of calcite and dolomite increases f mobility in groundwater unlike ca2 na does not undergo mineral precipitation reactions as a result it gradually becomes the dominant ion in groundwater furthermore the na hco3 type which is associated with f enriched groundwater accelerates the precipitation of calcite accompanying the release of f from the granite basement rocks due to the dissolution of silicates in alkaline ph narsimha and sudarshan 2017 in addition the chemical activity of f is not only depending on the equilibrium of water with respect to carbonate minerals but also on f species fig 6b considering f as a strong ligand in water it may also form various insoluble complexes with major cations such as ca2 mg2 fe3 and al3 in groundwater the aqueous speciation of f indicates that free f which contributes around more than 95 of the total f concentration was found as the predominant species in most groundwater while the remaining such as mgf caf naf and others are present in low concentration in the studied groundwater activities of all these facies show a good correlation with si of fluorite while the maximum correlation was noted for f free species table 4 3 6 fluoride health risk assessment and health related implications on inhabitants adequate intake of fluoride is vital for skeletal and dental development usepa 2010 however consumption of excess fluoride through drinking water is known to cause non carcinogenic health problems and can critically affect human wellbeing kumar et al 2019 mridha et al 2021 therefore assessing the consequences of consuming f contaminated groundwater is essential to establish the magnitude and probability of health risks for inhabitants in fluorosis affected areas the associated risks upon consumption of fluoride contaminated drinking water are estimated in terms of hazard quotient hq for children as well as adults including both males and females fig 8 the hq values for fluoride are in the order of children female male with the range varying from 0 026 to 3 718 average 1 0835 0 0227 3 25 average 0 947 and 0 192 2 75 average 0 8 for children female and male of the study area respectively these values indicate that children consumers in the study area are more prone to the non carcinogenic risk of fluoride exposure than an adult other studies have also reported children are at a higher risk of fluoride followed by men and women aghapour et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 mridha et al 2021 relatively lower body weight of children than men and women could have resulted in higher hazard quotients prolonged exposure to the contaminant at such early stages of life can have negative implications on tooth and bone development kharb and susheela 1994 mridha et al 2021 furthermore based on fluoride concentration related to health risk groundwater has been categorized into two classes class 1 f content of 1 5 4 mg l in drinking water leads to dental fluorosis and class 2 f of concentration 4 leads to dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis bailey et al 2006 on this basis this study showed that the prevalence of dental fluorosis was in about 38 of groundwater while only 2 7 which fall under class 2 can lead to dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis in groundwater consumers 4 conclusions in the present study a detailed assessment of the fluoride contamination in groundwater and associated health risk was carried out in the balangir district of odisha this study revealed that a high f concentration 1 5 mg l was found in 38 of the studied groundwater in the district which leads to the prevalence of dental fluorosis in the region the hq values indicate that all three age groups male female and children in this study area are vulnerable to fluoride toxicity while children would be more vulnerable to it the geochemical analysis strongly supported that underlying granitic granitic genesis rock types are the predominant source of groundwater fluoride contamination in the region hydrochemical analysis revealed that fluoride mobility and enrichment in groundwater are strongly influenced by alkaline ph increasing levels of na and hco3 and decreasing levels of ca2 the precipitation of calcite aragonite and dolomite promotes f enrichment behind groundwater this study identified fluoride contaminated regions and the cause of this contamination which will help government authorities to frame health policies for the management of groundwater resources and provide safe drinking water in this region for the prevention and control of endemic fluorosis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11763,hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater has been carried out in a hard rock aquifer from balangir district a fluorosis affected area of odisha india with the aim of understanding the sources and processes controlling fluoride f enrichment a total of 37 groundwater tube wells and 7 surface water pond samples were collected during the pre monsoon period groundwaters are mostly categorized as moderate to very hard water types with alkaline nature the enhanced na and hco3 concentration in groundwater is mostly a result of silicate weathering the f concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 4 to 4 29 mg l with 38 of samples exceeded the drinking water limit 1 5 mg l as prescribed by the world health organization 2011 in contrast to very low f 0 9 mg l in surface water high f concentrations in underlying granitic bedrocks up to 700 mg kg which spatially corresponds to f rich groundwater suggest that lithological composition is the main control of f fluoride rich waters are mostly na hco3 type followed by mixed na ca hco3 cl type with na ca2 ratio 1 the significant positive correlations of f with na hco3 and ph indicate that the weathering of sodium rich silicate minerals and increase of ph mobilizes f ion geochemical modeling indicates that the activity of f in groundwater increased by precipitation of calcite dolomite and aragonite fluoride risk assessment indicates that 38 of groundwater samples can cause a high prevalence of dental fluorosis with children being at greater risk than adults henceforth it is advisable to treat this contaminated groundwater before consumption or provide alternative drinking water to avoid further fluorosis risks in the concerned area graphical abstract image 1 keywords deep aquifer fluoride enrichment

malfunctioning etc ayoob and gupta 2006 ijumulana et al 2021 jha et al 2013 kharb and susheela 1994 mitsuru et al 2001 excess fluoride level in groundwater has been a great challenge for several countries worldwide globally it is estimated that more than 300 million people across 29 countries including india china pakistan saudi arabia the united states u s uganda tanzania egypt and ethiopia are suffering from endemic fluorosis mainly due to consumption of f contaminated drinking water groundwater on a daily basis for various purposes bhattacharya et al 2020 carrillo rivera et al 2002 de et al 2022 demelash et al 2019 ijumulana et al 2020 2022 kimambo et al 2019 kim and jeong 2005 kumar et al 2020 2021 mridha et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 in india more than 66 million people are at risk of developing fluorosis from consuming fluoride enriched groundwater mukherjee and singh 2018 and this is alarming in 20 out of 29 states starting from hard rock and alluvial aquifers in southern central and eastern states like tamil nadu andhra pradesh madhya pradesh odisha jharkhand bihar west bengal etc de et al 2022 jacks et al 2005 kumar et al 2019 laxamkumar et al 2019 magesh et al 2016 mridha et al 2021 sahu et al 2021 to the alluvial aquifers in north western states like punjab haryana rajasthan gujarat etc choubisa 2018 garg and singh 2013 kumar et al 2021 mittal et al 2021 sahoo et al 2022 thus in these areas groundwater is becoming a serious concern for the drinking water supply the high occurrence of f in groundwater is generally governed by several natural factors including the high abundance of f bearing minerals in the host rocks hydrogeological condition groundwater chemistry and residence time carrillo rivera et al 2002 de et al 2022 jacks et al 2005 kim and jeong 2005 mukherjee and singh 2018 besides the distribution of f in groundwater is also influenced by environmental and climate conditions kumar et al 2020 sahoo et al 2022 the common fluoride enriched minerals are fluorite biotites apatite micas and amphiboles which are associated with host rocks such as granite alkali igneous rocks gneisses mica shales etc choubisa 2018 kumar et al 2019 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 also fluorine is a component of all magmas thus fluorine is much higher in igneous rocks compared to any other rocks hayes et al 2017 the mobilization process of fluoride in groundwater is dependent on various factors such as temperature ph solubility of fluoride bearing minerals cation and anion exchange capacity of aquifer materials precipitation adsorption and biochemical reaction garc√≠a and borgnino 2015 mukherjee and singh 2018 saxena and ahmed 2003 fluoride has a very nearly similar ionic size to hydroxide ion oh and both are negatively charged thus the f ion can easily displace oh within the mineral arrangements during the chemical reaction saxena and ahmed 2003 the presence of excessive sodium na and bicarbonates hco3 in groundwater increases the dissolution rate of fluoride from f bearing minerals due to water mineral interaction saxena and ahmed 2003 mukherjee and singh 2018 besides natural processes anthropogenic sources such as the use of fertilizer extraction of metals and burning of coal also cause enhancement of f in groundwater ayoob and gupta 2006 kumar et al 2020 thus a better understanding of the source and mobilization mechanism of f and consequent changes in the water chemistry under specific geographic and geologic conditions are very crucial for water resources management purposes odisha an eastern state in india houses around 40 million inhabitants of which more than 90 of rural household and 50 of urban household is dependent on groundwater for drinking purpose in some districts of central and western parts of the state cgwb 2010 sahu et al 2021 the issue of f contamination 1 5 mg l in groundwater is severe balangir district is one of them where the prevalence of dental fluorosis is a serious health concern in several villages due to the excessive presence of fluoride in groundwater cgwb 2013 mahapatra 2007 although the general aspect of groundwater f contamination for this district has been reported behera 2020 the genetic classification of the groundwater fluoride contamination and the hydrogeochemical processes that drive this contamination has been hardly addressed furthermore regarding the source sahu et al 2021 reported the geogenic contribution of fluoride in this region however the specific rock type that is responsible for higher levels of fluoride in groundwater is under explored since the rock types of the area are varied widely the geogenic sources of fluoride in the region can be diverse and complicated considering this fact the present study aims to address the hydrogeochemical characteristics of surface water and groundwater along with fluorine analysis in underlying rock types to understand the major source process and geochemical mechanism responsible for f enrichment in groundwater of the balangir district this result will be very helpful for identifying risk areas and minimizing the health risks of fluoride exposure also this knowledge will help to develop a management plan for augmenting safe drinking water sources in the area and to open a new vista for further research 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is located in the northern part of the balangir district odisha which lies between latitudes 21 4 n and 20 9 n and longitudes 82 41 e and 83 32 e and has an area of 6575 km2 fig 1 the climate of the district is tropical with hot and dry climate prevailing in the region three distinct seasons are mainly observed such as winter summer and rainy the winter november february temperatures vary from 3 to 16 c while the summer march june temperature reaches up to 45 c the rainy season prevails from june to october with an average annual rainfall of 1502 mm out of which approximately 80 is received during the southwest monsoon cgwb 2013 droughts are quite common in the district 2 2 hydrogeological settings the hydrogeology of the district is primarily controlled by the bed rock lithology and the associated geological structures topography rainfall pattern and aquifer type the major parts of the district are covered by hard rock terrain and fall within the proterozoic eastern ghats mobile belt egmb behera 2020 mahalik 1996 ramakrishnan and vaidyanadhan 2008 sahu et al 2013 the major crystalline rock types in the region include granite and gneisses leptynite khondalite megacrystic granitoid charnockite quartzites and anorthosite which cover a major proportion about 95 of the area fig 2 a among them granite gneisses are the most dominating followed by khondalites the groundwater in the area occurs in both shallow and deep aquifers shallow aquifers are constituted by weathered formations while deep aquifers are constituted by fractured crystalline rocks where groundwater occurs under semi confined to confined conditions cgwb 2013 chandra et al 2012 the depth to water level fig 2b in the region was 0 78 6 85 m bgl during the post monsoon season in shallow aquifers while in the pre monsoon season it ranges from 1 33 to 8 85 m bgl cgwb 2013 2 3 sampling and chemical analysis 2 3 1 sample collection and preparation a total number of 37 groundwater samples were collected from tube wells of the 19 villages around the study area fig 1 these wells mostly penetrate the fractured aquifer and occur in the deep aquifer between 60 and 100 m depth samples were collected in cleaned high density polyethylene bottles during the post monsoon season in the year 2015 also about 7 surface water samples were collected from ponds in the nearby villages prior to the collection of groundwater samples the tube wells were flushed 4 to 5 times to remove stagnant waters and get a true representative of a sample the samples used for metal analysis were acidified with nitric acid ph 2 in the field the entire water quality and rock chemical data used in this work were taken from the geological survey of india report ray 2005 and complete information has been provided in supplementary

measure the fluorine level in rock samples 0 25 g of the finely powdered rock samples 75 Œºm was mixed with a 2 5 g fusion mixture anhydrous sodium carbonate and anhydrous potassium nitrate in 2 1 by weight in a nickel crucible the mixture was fused at 600 c for 30 40 min on a mecker burner after cooling 10 ml of deionized water di was added to the nickel crucible and left overnight to dissolve the residue then the solution was filtered using whatman cellulose filter paper 8 Œºm pore size grade 40 transferred to a 100 ml volumetric flask added 20 ml citrate buffer and made up to the mark with di approximately 25 ml of the solution was taken in a 50 ml plastic beaker and mixed with a total ionic strength adjusting buffer tisab iii solution at a ratio of 1 1 the tisab iii was prepared using cdta 1 2 diaminocyclohexane n n n n tetraacetic acid acetic acid sodium chloride and sodium hydroxide following the standard method nico 2000 this buffer has three major functions including the adjustment of the ph to 5 5 this ph appears to be optimum for the determination of fluoride the provision of a constant high ionic strength and the release of fluoride from complexes fluoride standards used in the preparation of the calibration curve were also added to the tisab buffer in the same ratio and then the concentration of fluoride in the solution was measured using the fluoride ion selective electrode method orion ise model no 9409sc for method calibration a stock solution 100 ppm f was prepared by dissolving 0 221 g of sodium fluoride salts naf previously dried 5 h at 120 c

characterization relevant graphical plots such as piper plot gibbs plot and bivariate plot were prepared for the dataset the saturation index si of various secondary mineral phases and fluoride species in groundwater and surface water samples was calculated using the gss the geochemist s spreadsheet program of the geochemist s workbench student version edition 12 2 5 human health risk assessment an assessment of human health risk upon consumption of fluoride contaminated groundwater was carried out for this work for three different groups male female and children this is based upon the method introduced by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 1989 this method involves the calculation of chronic daily intake cdi and a non carcinogenic risk index also known as the hazard quotient hq detailed below the cdi has been calculated using formula 1 introduced by usepa 1989 and defined by the following parameters 1 c d i c w i r e f e d b w a t where cdi is the chronic daily intake of groundwater mg kg day cw is the concentration of fluoride in water mg l ir is the ingestion rate of the water l day ef is the exposure frequency day year and ed is the exposure period years bw is the average body weight kg and at denotes average exposure time days the standard reference values for all of the above mentioned parameters used for assessment are furnished in supplementary table s2 the hq is calculated using formula 2 2 h q c d i r f d where rfd is the reference fluoride dose in mg kg day rfd is used to evaluate the fluoride health risk associated with a particular exposure route the reference value for rfd is also mentioned in supplementary table s2 hq value 1 ensures protection against the possibility of negative health related impacts whereas a value greater than one enhances the risk of potential non carcinogenic health problems from consuming fluoride contaminated water 3 results and discussion 3 1 general expression of hydro geochemical data the general descriptive statistics of chemical compositions of the groundwater and surface water samples along with the drinking water guideline values who 2011 are given in table 1 the mean and median concentrations of several chemical constituents were nearly similar which is indicative of their normal distribution however this is different for na k and no3 which had a higher variability with cv coefficient of variation 100 with higher sd standard deviation a larger cv indicates a wide variety of chemical contents in water which may be a result of multiple sources hydrogeochemical processes sahoo et al 2019 the descriptive statistics mean median and quartile values table 1 show that there is a considerable variation in the concentrations of chemical constituents between groundwater and surface waters with significantly higher concentrations in the former this is corroborated with the mann whitney u test which indicated that most of the parameters were significantly different sig 0 00 between the two water types table 2 the ph ranged from 7 27 to 8 76 and 7 24 7 86 in groundwater and surface waters respectively indicating weak alkaline conditions and all these values are falling within the permissible limit for drinking water who 2011 except one the tds was found to be much higher 405 1717 mg l in groundwater compared to surface water 88 493 mg l with 88 of groundwater samples exceeding the most desirable limit of tds 500 mg l in drinking water as per who 2011 high tds levels indicate a high level of mineralization in the sub surface due to high leaching of major cations and anions from aquifer rocks hem 1989 the average dominant cation in groundwater is na and the order of abundance is na ca2 mg2 k while ca is dominating in most of the surface water samples in the order as ca2 na mg2 k the concentration of na ranged from 27 8 to 400 6 mg l in groundwater and 4 4 54 mg l in surface water the maximum permissible limit of na in drinking water is 200 mg l who 2011 and most of the samples were within the limit except 5 5 in comparison with na very low concentration of k in both groundwater and surface water which was probably due to the high resistance of potash feldspars to chemical weathering in the study area hem 1989 mg2 is slightly lower than ca2 probably due to the low abundance of mg2 in the bedrocks the ca2 and mg2 ions present in the groundwater may be derived from carbonate and or calcium and magnesium bearing rock forming silicates total hardness th was calculated from the individual ion concentrations of ca2 and mg2 using equation 3 sawyer et al 2003 the th is varying from 111 to 728 mg l and 55 241 mg l in groundwater and surface water respectively this indicates groundwater tends to be harder than surface water high positive correlation of th with so4 2 and cl and poorly with hco3 table 3 is suggesting that the hardness of the water is predominantly permanent in nature according to sawyer and mccarthy 1967 classification 64 of groundwater samples are considered very hard water 300 mg l while 25 as hard water 150 300 mg l however all surface waters are designated as soft 75 mg l to moderately hard water 75 150 mg l the acceptable hardness level for drinking purpose is from 80 to 100 mg l while hardness values exceeding 200 mg l is considered poor and those over 500 mg l are considered unacceptable for domestic purposes health canada 1995 this indicates that some of the groundwaters are unsuitable for drinking as well as for domestic purposes 3 hardness as mgcaco 3 l 2 49 ca mg l 4 118 mg mg l in major anions the order of average abundance was found to be hco3 cl no3 so4 2 co3 2 hco3 is the predominant weak acid in the water which varied from 133 to 821 mg l and 75 262 mg l respectively in groundwater and surface water its predominance in water along with na suggests intense chemical weathering of primary silicate minerals dominated by alkali metals hem 1989 between strong acid cl so4 2 anions the average cl is higher and ranges from 10 to 398 mg l in groundwater wherein 10 of samples exceeded the who permissible limit 250 mg l but in the case of so4 2 all samples lie within the maximum permissible limit of who 200 mg l the cl in groundwater can be contributed by atmospheric deposition or lithogenic like weathering of halites and evaporates and or anthropogenic sources like irrigation runoff leachate from landfill waste dumps etc izbicki et al 2006 no3 varies from 1 2 to 318 mg l in groundwater and 0 2 27 mg l in surface water a higher concentration of no3 exceeding the desirable drinking water limit 50 mg l was observed in 30 of groundwater samples this may be contributed by agricultural activity animal waste and septic tank leakage the po4 3 in the study area was lowest among anions maybe because of po4 3 adsorption by soil fe al oxyhydroxides clay minerals and or its uptake by the plants fang et al 2017 3 2 f distribution and source in groundwater and surface water the f concentration in groundwaters varied widely from 0 1 to 4 2 mg l table 1 with 33 of samples exceeding the drinking water permissible limit 1 5 mg l recommended by who 2011 on contrary in surface water its concentration was mostly below 0 9 mg l the distribution maps figs 1 and 3 showed that f was mostly enriched 1 5 mg l in the northern villages such as patharmunda rampur m pada jhamipali kudapali barnakita badighar the highest concentration was reported in patharmunda these villages can be considered in high risk zones other studies also reported high f concentrations in groundwater of the northern part agalpur block and central part belpada and deogaon blocks of the balangir district srivastava and tiwari 2006 high f enriched groundwater can be commonly influenced by local lithology and rock water interaction in the hard rock aquifers the study area balangir district is occupied by diverse rock types with granite granitic gneiss as the dominating types in the present study f analysis of different rock samples collected from the balangir district was given in table 3 it is observed that f is highly enriched in the underlying rock types mainly in porphyroblastic garnetiferous granite gnesis 700 mg kg followed by migmatite with pyroxene granulite enclave 600 mg kg and garnetiferous granite gnesis 500 mg kg and anorthosite luco granite 400 mg kg from the spatial distribution plot fig 1 it can also be seen that f enriched groundwaters are closely following their corresponding high f enriched rock samples this indicates that groundwater f contamination in the study area is mostly of geogenic origin and this is predominantly contributed by granitic and migmatitic rocks this is corroborated by recent studies conducted in the hard rock terrain of odisha sahoo et al 2019 the contribution from anthropogenic sources like the application of fertilizer due to agricultural activity is negligible as f is very poorly correlated with no3 and so4 2 table 4 3 3 hydrogeochemical facies in waters in order to identify the dominant water facies in water bodies the major ions were subjected to the piper plot piper 1994 which gives better insight into the hydrochemistry of water for this purpose the water samples were grouped into 3 categories based on f enrichment group 1 groundwater 1 5 mg l f group 2 groundwater f 1 5 mg l and group 3 surface water f 1 mg l in the piper plot fig 3a it can be seen that no clear dominance of alkali na k over alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 in groundwaters except for a few samples of group 1 but in the anions field weak acid hco3 remained predominant over strong acids so4 2 cl in all groups also there is a significant change in the hydro chemical facies between water types the majority of group 1 samples whose f concentrations are 1 5 mg l are mostly classified into na hco3 type followed by mixed na ca mg hco3 and mixed ca mg cl whereas group 2 samples mostly fall into mixed ca mg cl and ca hco3 type and most of the group 3 samples fall into ca hco3 type except a few samples fig 3b absence of na cl facies indicates that salinity is not an issue in this area 3 4 identification of hydro geochemical processes and source of major solutes different geochemical processes such as rock water interactions dissolution precipitation evaporation ion exchange oxidation and reduction reaction commonly control groundwater chemistry jacks et al 2005 mukherjee and singh 2018 saxena and ahmed 2003 to understand this aspect gibbs plot and bivariate diagrams were constructed spearman correlation coefficients were also estimated to understand the relations between water quality variables table 3 gibbs diagram fig 4 a and b was constructed by the equivalence ratios of na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 as a function of tds gibbs 1970 this diagram demarcates three predominant hydrogeochemical processes rock water interaction precipitation and evaporation dominance as seen in fig 4 except for a few samples most of the data points were plotted on the rock weathering dominance zone suggesting that the weathering of the rock minerals is the important process governing the groundwater geochemistry in the study area the high and positive correlation r between tds and the major cationic species like na2 0 8 mg2 0 78 ca2 0 6 and hco3 0 66 r significant at p 0 01 suggests that these parameters originate from a common source and silicate hydrolysis is the most governing hydrochemical process the role of evaporation was evaluated through the na cl ratio vs ec scatter diagram fig 5 h generally evaporation results in an increase in the concentration of ec with the na cl ratio remaining constant thus this ratio can be used as a good indicator of evaporation jankowski and acworth 1997 from fig 5h it can be seen that group 1 groundwater samples mostly showed a declining trend and the na cl ratio does change during the increase of ec this indicates that evaporation may not be a major process controlling water chemistry jankowski and acworth 1997 the probable cause for altering the na cl ratio may be due to silicate weathering and or extreme ion exchange processes kumar and james 2016 this is consistent with gibb s plot as most of the samples were plotted in the rock weathering zone this can be further evaluated by na vs cl plot fig 5a if the molar ratio of na cl is 1 then there will be silicate weathering or cation exchange if this is 1 it will represent evaporation or anthropogenic contribution and if this ratio is approximately 1 the data points will be distributed along a 1 1 line then halite dissolution is responsible for na dominance in groundwater meybeck 1987 in this study most of the group 1 groundwater samples lie above the 1 1 na cl line indicating that the na may be attributed to silicate weathering meybeck 1987 although some samples lie close to and below the 1 1 equiline the dominance of hco3 as the most abundant anion in those waters and most of these samples falling along the 1 1 line in the na vs hco3 biplot fig 5b along with both ions maintained a very strong correlation which evidenced that weathering of silicate minerals like granite gneiss oligoclase perthite and k feldspars etc are the major source of na and hco3 rajmohan and elango 2004 zhang et al 2020 this is further supported by the bivariate plot of ca2 na vs hco3 na fig 5f in which most of the data points fall close to the global average silicate weathering domain the relationship between na k and total cations tz fig 5c also evaluated the silicate vs carbonate weathering stallard and edmond 1983 in this plot fig 5 the majority of the samples are plotted above the 1 1 line fig 5c indicating an abundance of silicate weathering for the higher concentrations of na with hco3 in the groundwater in the studied aquifer rajmohan and elango 2004 stallard and edmond 1983 in the groundwater alkaline earth metals ca2 mg2 may come from various sources like weathering and dissolution of carbonate silicate minerals and sulphate minerals like gypsum in the ca2 mg2 vs so4 2 hco3 scatter diagram fig 5e samples falling above the 1 1 trend line suggest these ions resulted from carbonate weathering while along the 1 1 trend line suggests weathering of carbonates and silicate minerals rajmohan and elango 2004 sonkamble et al 2012 additionally samples plotting below 1 1 trend line indicating silicate weathering collectively the results indicate that for most of the group 1 groundwater samples silicate weathering is dominant whereas others could have a mixed source such as carbonate silicate gypsum etc in the system the poor correlations of ca2 table 4 with hco3 0 17 suggest a limited role in carbonate dissolution zhang et al 1995 this is further evaluated in a bivariate plot of ca2 and hco3 fig 5d according to this if the ratio between ca2 and hco3 is 1 1 it is indicative of calcite weathering while 1 2 for dolomite 1 1 7 is for pyroxene and 2 7 for amphibole zhang et al 2020 reference therein in this study this distinctly indicates silicate weathering in group 1 with high f waters that are under the 2 1 trend line while a few samples are under the 1 1 line however as shown in the plot of ca2 and so4 2 fig 5g most of the samples plotted below the 1 1 line and theca so4 2 molar ratio 1 indicating gypsum contribution is less likely although ca2 shows a positive correlation with so4 2 0 51 the gypsum si values for all groundwater samples were less than zero fig 6 a indicating that groundwaters are unsaturated with respect to this mineral and it is less likely to occur in the study area this is consistent with the geology of the study area moreover si values of dolomite calcite and anhydrite 1 fig 6a and their positive correlation with ca suggest table 4 that secondary precipitation of carbonate minerals can be an additional factor influencing ca2 concentration in groundwater furthermore cation exchange reactions with aquifer clay materials can be a responsible process for controlling f chemistry in groundwater cartwright et al 2007 schoeller 1965 in direct ion exchange na and k in groundwater may exchange with ca2 or mg2 in clay minerals equation 4 and na or k will decrease in water and on the contrary in a reverse reaction equation 5 ca2 or mg2 in groundwater may lead to the exchange of na to water by ca2 or mg2 in clay minerals cartwright et al 2007 4 2 na cax 2 2 nax ca 2 5 ca 2 2 nax cax 2 2 na where x indicates as soil exchanger in the plot fig 5e high f bearing points shift towards the hco3 so4 2 region which indicates reverse ion exchange is the case controlling these samples while others shift towards the ca2 mg2 region indicating a normal ion exchange process for them this is further studied using the chloro alkaline indices cai i equation 6 and cai ii equation 7 proposed by schoeller 1965 which were used to study the occurrence of specific ion exchange between the groundwater and its host environment fig 5i shows that most of the samples indicate negative values for both indices suggesting a dominance of reverse ion exchange processes in the aquifer systems 6 c a i i cl n a k cl 7 c a i i i cl n a k c o 3 2 s o 4 2 h c o 3 n o 3 3 5 genesis of f enriched groundwater and geochemical modeling besides rock mineralogy fluoride concentration in groundwater can be controlled by its hydrogeochemical characteristics jacks et al 2005 laxamkumar et al 2019 saxena and ahmed 2003 the high f enriched groundwaters are rich in na hco3 relatively high ph and poor in ca2 and are predominantly na hco3 type this chemical characteristic is predominantly controlled by silicate weathering and cation exchange processes in the aquifer as discussed above the significant positive correlation of f with ph and na indicates that the dissolution of f bearing silicate minerals under alkaline conditions could lead to simultaneous f and na enrichment in groundwater alkaline ph favours the precipitation of caco3 which leads to producing f na enriched and ca2 poor water jacks et al 2005 this can be supported by the hco3 ca2 ratio 1 for all f enriched groundwater samples saxena and ahmed 2003 moreover a strong positive correlation between f and hco3 a competitive ion revealed that elevated hco3 promoted f release from the aquifer matrix into groundwater haji et al 2018 also anion exchange oh for f can be a dominant process for f mobilization at alkaline ph as oh in groundwater replaces the exchangeable f containing in minerals clays thus it favours the solubility of fluoride bearing minerals apambire et al 1997 in groundwater where fluorite dissolution is a predominant cause of f contamination then f concentration should be negatively correlated with ca in this study the weak correlation between f and ca2 table 4 suggests that the f contribution in the groundwater is not only from the dissolution of fluorite minerals but also from other rocks rich in alkali metals haji et al 2018 the former is unlikely as there is hardly any fluorite in the rocks of the study area the latter can be supported with the f enrichment in different granite bearing silicate rocks in the study area moreover elevated na concentration coupled with low ca2 suggests that ca2 and na2 ion exchange process is an important geochemical process for f rich groundwater the ca2 deficiency is caused by a high cation exchange reaction in the aquifer that facilitates the removal of ca2 from the solution by replacing it with na ions from clay exchange sites to understand the chemical equilibrium occurring in groundwater that controls f contamination geochemical modeling has been applied in this study the saturation index si of fluorite calcite dolomite and aragonite has been calculated fig 6a and discussed to provide natural control of water quality in view of ca mg and f when si 1 minerals tend to dissolve while at si 1 they tend to be precipitated fluorite caf2 is often considered as a major source of f concentration in waters and it depends upon the state of equilibrium with regards to fluorite though there are some other minerals such as fluoroapatite mica amphibole clays etc which also regulate fluoride concentrations in groundwater apambire et al 1997 mukherjee and singh 2018 the absence of fluorite minerals in the studied lithology and its si 1 indicates that this mineral has no major contribution to f contamination the si values for calcite dolomite and aragonite for most of the groundwater samples are 1 indicating oversaturation and precipitation of these carbonate minerals in the study area while the waters are undersaturated with respect to evaporite minerals like gypsum anhydrite and halite the positive correlation of calcite and dolomite with f activity and inverse trend between ca2 and f fig 7 table 4 suggest that the precipitation of calcite and dolomite increases f mobility in groundwater unlike ca2 na does not undergo mineral precipitation reactions as a result it gradually becomes the dominant ion in groundwater furthermore the na hco3 type which is associated with f enriched groundwater accelerates the precipitation of calcite accompanying the release of f from the granite basement rocks due to the dissolution of silicates in alkaline ph narsimha and sudarshan 2017 in addition the chemical activity of f is not only depending on the equilibrium of water with respect to carbonate minerals but also on f species fig 6b considering f as a strong ligand in water it may also form various insoluble complexes with major cations such as ca2 mg2 fe3 and al3 in groundwater the aqueous speciation of f indicates that free f which contributes around more than 95 of the total f concentration was found as the predominant species in most groundwater while the remaining such as mgf caf naf and others are present in low concentration in the studied groundwater activities of all these facies show a good correlation with si of fluorite while the maximum correlation was noted for f free species table 4 3 6 fluoride health risk assessment and health related implications on inhabitants adequate intake of fluoride is vital for skeletal and dental development usepa 2010 however consumption of excess fluoride through drinking water is known to cause non carcinogenic health problems and can critically affect human wellbeing kumar et al 2019 mridha et al 2021 therefore assessing the consequences of consuming f contaminated groundwater is essential to establish the magnitude and probability of health risks for inhabitants in fluorosis affected areas the associated risks upon consumption of fluoride contaminated drinking water are estimated in terms of hazard quotient hq for children as well as adults including both males and females fig 8 the hq values for fluoride are in the order of children female male with the range varying from 0 026 to 3 718 average 1 0835 0 0227 3 25 average 0 947 and 0 192 2 75 average 0 8 for children female and male of the study area respectively these values indicate that children consumers in the study area are more prone to the non carcinogenic risk of fluoride exposure than an adult other studies have also reported children are at a higher risk of fluoride followed by men and women aghapour et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 mridha et al 2021 relatively lower body weight of children than men and women could have resulted in higher hazard quotients prolonged exposure to the contaminant at such early stages of life can have negative implications on tooth and bone development kharb and susheela 1994 mridha et al 2021 furthermore based on fluoride concentration related to health risk groundwater has been categorized into two classes class 1 f content of 1 5 4 mg l in drinking water leads to dental fluorosis and class 2 f of concentration 4 leads to dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis bailey et al 2006 on this basis this study showed that the prevalence of dental fluorosis was in about 38 of groundwater while only 2 7 which fall under class 2 can lead to dental skeletal and crippling fluorosis in groundwater consumers 4 conclusions in the present study a detailed assessment of the fluoride contamination in groundwater and associated health risk was carried out in the balangir district of odisha this study revealed that a high f concentration 1 5 mg l was found in 38 of the studied groundwater in the district which leads to the prevalence of dental fluorosis in the region the hq values indicate that all three age groups male female and children in this study area are vulnerable to fluoride toxicity while children would be more vulnerable to it the geochemical analysis strongly supported that underlying granitic granitic genesis rock types are the predominant source of groundwater fluoride contamination in the region hydrochemical analysis revealed that fluoride mobility and enrichment in groundwater are strongly influenced by alkaline ph increasing levels of na and hco3 and decreasing levels of ca2 the precipitation of calcite aragonite and dolomite promotes f enrichment behind groundwater this study identified fluoride contaminated regions and the cause of this contamination which will help government authorities to frame health policies for the management of groundwater resources and provide safe drinking water in this region for the prevention and control of endemic fluorosis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

introduction water is abundantly available on planet earth and is the most important source for survival of all living thing on earth approximately 71 of the earth is surrounded by water however around 97 of this quantity is salty water and the rest is freshwater tuly et al 2021 moreover the human just grasps less than 1 from a freshwater omara and eltawil 2013 which basically shows the demand of freshwater also world population is being substantially increasing and the india the third world countries that needs a huge requirement of freshwater for drinking and other purpose duffie and beckman 2013 with this rate it can be predict that in coming years the rate of demand of fresh water will increase greatly in order to overcome water shortage problem several desalination plant technologies have been developed and experimental outcomes have also been obtained but most of the desalination systems require intensive energy ghaffour et al 2015 for that utilizing the alternative renewable energy for desalination plants which may be pondered for best results in addition with the inexpensive process for producing freshwater with lower overall cost qiblawey and banat 2008 have discussed different desalination technologies in commercial and pilot stages of development they have focused those technologies which are suitable for use in remote areas salinas rodr√≠gue et al salinas rodr√≠guez and schippers 2021 published book on seawater reverse osmosis desalination where they have done assessment and pre treatment of fouling and scaling tiwari et al 2021 developed hottel whillier bliss equation in modified version for an solar distillation system for higher yield and thermal efficiency they have proposed different equations to evaluate efficiency of pvt based active solar distillation and conventional fpc among all alternative desalination systems solar distillation system has received great attention as it has less operation and maintenance costs environmentally friendly and economically viable fath and hosny 2002 however it requires high initial investments and big installation areas jamil et al 2020 solar distillation is classified into two categories those are passive and active solar still singh et al 2021 in a passive solar still the saline water is heated directly by solar radiation in order to produce fresh water in one simple process and it doesn t require mechanical components chaurasiya et al 2022 has reviewed the techniques for increasing the productivity of passive solar stills in detail however in case of active solar still it reinforces by integrating it with external thermal unit such as thermal collector to enhance the temperature difference between evaporating and conducting surface for increasing the productivity of freshwater several researchers and scientists have worked to enhance the productivity and efficiency of solar still das et al 2020 theoretical and experimental analysis on a single slope solar still based on solar radiation intensity has been conducted by badran et al 2005 they concluded that the thermal efficiency and daily productivity of the solar still enhance with an increase in the intensity of solar radiation murugavel et al murugavel and srithar 2009 studied the impact of using an electrical resistance heater in the double slope solar still on the productivity of freshwater el sebaii 2004 investigated the impact of wind speed on the daily yield of freshwater for passive and active solar still by utilizing simulation technology and concluded that the daily yield rises with an increase in wind speed up to an ideal velocity beyond which the rise in production becomes meaningless the impact of using external air cooled condenser with solar still have been evaluated by ibrahim et al 2015 panchal et al 2019 carried out the detail analysis of single basin passive solar still coupled with evacuated tubes for the climate conditions of mahesana gujarat they have presented the annual performance of the said system and compared the system with the distillate output with other work mevada et al 2022 carried a review on applications of evacuated tubes

performed experimental exergo economic and exergo environment analyses of evacuated tubes coupled solar still with condenser and fins panchal and awasthi 2017 investigated the performance of single slope single basin solar still integrated with evacuated tubes they have calculated water temperature inner glass cover temperature and distillate output for the said system under the climate conditions of mahesana gujarat 23 5880 n 72 3693 e considering 0 04 m depth and 6 months of time interval a detail study of evacuated tubes has been reported in the literature panchal et al 2020a 2020b patel et al 2020 singh et al 2020 reported experimental results that an enhancement of 16 2 and 29 7 in the productivity of freshwater and thermal efficiency respectively comparison with conventional solar still also illustrated the impact of collector s number on the life cycle conversion efficiency lcce of a conventional solar still desalination unit augmented with n identical of photovoltaic thermal compound parabolic concentrator collectors pvt cpcs it has been found that increasing the number of collectors improved the value of lcce experimental and theoretical analysis for conventional solar still coupled with solar parabolic trough collector and heat exchanger has been done by abdel rehim and lasheen 2007 they concluded that the amount of productivity was higher by 18 as compared to conventional solar still moreover the impact of form of condensing glass cover on the productivity of passive and fully covered pvt active solar still have been studied by mishra et al 2020 they concluded that at inclination 60 of conical shape of condensing glass cover with 0 01 m water depth and mass flow rate of 0 01 kg s the productivity was optimum and with increasing the depth of water the yield is got down in addition sampathkumar and senthilkumar 2012 investigated the performance of a solar distiller inserted with flat plate collector fpc experimentally further by augmented evacuated tube collector in the passive solar still investigated the performance of productivity at climatic conditions of mehsana gujarat sheeba et al 2015 moreover singh et al 2016 experimentally examined the performance of active solar still inserted with two hybrid photovoltaic collectors and found that the yield increased more compared to conventional solar still sampathkumar karuppusamy 2012 experimentally evaluated the effect of coupling a solar still with an evacuated tube collector on water productivity and concluded that the yield increased to 49 7 for solar still integrated with evacuated tube collector and 59 485 for solar still inserted with evacuated tube collector and black gravel also the performance of integrating a storage tank and flat plate collector with solar still have been examined by voropoulos et al 2001 and found that the productivity was doubled for a solar still unit incorporated with a storage tank comparison with conventional solar still from the study reported so far in the open literature it can be observed that plethora of work have been focused on the performance analysis of active solar still integrated with flat plate collector or solar dish system the conventional flat plate collector fpc mentioned in above literature is low temperature operating system due to more losses to the surrounding while the evacuated flat plate collector efpc is high operating temperature due to evacuated enclosure between top glass and the absorber plate it can also be found that the effect of single and double glass cover on the performance of efpc is seemed to be missing in the open literature however no work has been reported on the performance investigation of active solar still coupling with efpc yet in this regard the present study incorporates the above mentioned research gaps based on these gaps following objectives have been addressed in the present study that are shown below a modelling and performance of solar still integrated with evacuated flat plate collector with one cover glass ss efpc 1c and two cover glass ss efpc 2c have been carried out b hourly variation of basin water temperature and productivity of the fresh water total yield for the proposed system have been presented for typical day of march 2021 c detailed energy and exergy analyses of both the system as ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c have been evaluated and presented d detailed comparison between different configuration of the solar still namely conventional solar still ss solar still augmented with flat plate collector having one glass cover ss fpc 1c and having two glass cover ss fpc 2c have been shown for the climate condition of new delhi at 22nd of march 2021 2 description of the proposed system fig 1 shows the schematic plot of single slope solar still augmented with evacuated flat plate collector in this work conventional single slope glass cover solar still consist of galvanized iron sheet based basin with insulation the evacuated flat plate collector efpc consists of sheet in tube black absorber plate top glass cover insulating materials and housing cover the efpc is an improved technology of convention flat plate collector which consist vacuum environment between top glass cover and absorber plate unlike others the vacuum environment is advantageous for efpc because of elimination heat loss to surrounding due to conduction and convection thus the efpc can generates enhanced thermal energy for less surface area both systems namely conventional solar still and efpc coupled with each other with the help of suitable coupling as shown in fig 1 the auxiliary components of the proposed system are circulation pump distillate tank saline water tank valves insulated pipes etc the design parameters of the proposed system are mentioned in table 1 the integrated system is exposed to the solar radiation then conventional solar still and efpc both harness solar radiation the solar radiation intercepted by conventional solar still is known as passive heat gain while a solar thermal collector intercepts the solar radiation and connected with solar still is known as active heat gain thus the proposed system is operating under active mode in the proposed system the sunlight passes through the glass cover of the evacuated flat plate collector to the absorber plate that transfers the heat energy to the fluid passing through tubes therefore hot fluid is obtained at the outlet of efpc which is further feed to the basin of solar still meanwhile the solar radiation also passes through the glass cover of the solar still and heats the saline water stored in the basin in this way the saline water stored in the basin of solar still is heated in active as well as passive mode due to high thermal energy of saline water the water transforms into vapor and rises to condensing cover the vapor is condensed when approached to the cold glass condensing cover and condensate runs down through the slope of the glass cover to the freshwater reservoir the reaming saline water in the basin of solar still is feed to efpc continuously through circulation pump in closed loop as shown in fig 1 when level of saline water decreases in the basin then level of water maintained constant say 0 02 m for investigation purpose by storage tank on hourly basis the basin water depth of 0 02 m is considered due to sufficient latent heat and weight of water at that depth helps to reduce the time needed for evaporation of water due to these reasons the 0 02 m is taken in the present work also the proposed system is closed loop hence constant flow rate of water through the collector is considered and the amount of water evaporated as freshwater is replaced by feeding same amount of salt water stored in water tank in basin on hourly basis this maintain the constant water depth in the basin therefore the same operation is repeated during the whole day 3 thermal modeling of the proposed system all the components of the proposed conventional solar still integrated with efpc as shown in fig 1 are considered as thermal equipment which satisfy the basic energy balance for the simplification of the

as methodology that have been adopted to calculate the hourly calculation of productivity of freshwater energy and exergy efficiency for the proposed model step 1 the total solar radiation incident solar flux radiation and ambient air temperature on horizontal surface for a typical day in the march month 22nd march 2021 for new delhi have been made input to an excel and matlab program the climate data of weather has been possessed from indian meteorological department imd pune india the value of total solar radiation and incident solar flux radiation of solar still and efp collector for inclined surface at 28 62 n latitude has been computed by utilizing liu and jordan 1960 formula step 2 the value of the outlet fluid temperature of collector t f o basin water temperature t w inner outer glass temperature t g i t g o and absorber plate temperature t b of active solar still have been computed using eqs 2 and 6 and 9 11 respectively step 3 the rate of useful thermal energy gain has been calculated using eq 1 step 4 the hourly and daily yield of the proposed system has been computed with the help of eqs 18 and 22 respectively step 5 the hourly and daily thermal efficiency of passive and active solar still have been estimated by using eqs 23 26 while the hourly and daily exergy efficiency has been computed by using eqs 27 30 5 results and discussions the hourly variation of total solar radiation incident solar flux radiation and ambient temperature on a typical spring day in the march month on 22nd march 2021 of new delhi climatic condition has been shown in fig 3 from the plot of fig 3 it can be observed that from 7 00 a m till 12 00 p m the total solar radiation rises from 158 039 w m2 to 951 032 w m2 and then declines to zero w m2 at 18 00 p m due to sun set similarly the incident solar flux radiation slowly rises from 95 073 w m2 to 818 808 w m2 and then drop to zero in the evening in addition at 14 00 p m the peak value of ambient temperature has been registered with the value of 32 c whereas the low value is obtained as 13 c at 6 00 a m 4 shows the hourly variation of theoretical basin water temperature for passive conventional solar still and active solar still from fig 4 it is seen that the highest value of basin water temperature has been obtained for solar still integrated with evacuated flat plate collector while the lowest value for conventional solar still due to high thermal energy gain in former one furthermore it can also notice that the basin water temperature for each system gradually increases up to noon and then decrease slowly till the evening the maximum values of basin water temperature for ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are obtained as 65 58 c 86 59 c 92 28 c 102 23 c and 103 12 c respectively at local time 14 00 p m moreover it is inferred that the highest value of basin water temperature obtained in case of ss efpc 2c due to decrease in the convection and radiation heat losses because of two glass cover along with vacuum environment the hourly variation of average glass cover and absorber plate temperatures of passive and active solar still are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively from these figures the peak value of temperatures of glass cover and absorber plate have been recorded for ss efpc 2c configuration at local time 14 00 p m while for the conventional solar still having minimum average glass cover and absorber plate temperatures the average glass cover and absorber plate temperature for ss efpc 2c are recorded as 98 12 c and 106 6 c respectively whereas the temperature of conventional solar still are recorded as 55 17 c and 68 57 c respectively thus it can be concluded that the ss efpc 2c configuration has higher operating temperature in terms of average glass cover temperature and absorber plate temperature therefore the hourly variation of all operating temperatures namely outer glass cover inner glass cover absorber plate bottom surface and basin water temperatures of ss efpc 2c have also been investigated and plotted in fig 7 the trends of all operating temperatures of the ss efpc 2c configuration are as per our expectation the hourly variation of productivity of fresh water i e yield for all cases namely ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c have been illustrated in fig 8 it can be seen in the graph that the yield of all configuration gradually elevates up from 7 00 a m to 14 00 p m and then begins slowly decreasing to the end of the day however it is noticed that at the noon hour when the basin water temperature of active solar still systems is higher than 70 c the latent heat of water is changed causing jump in the productivity of freshwater in addition to this it is also evident from fig 8 that the ss efpc 2c system has the highest amount of productivity at 14 00 p m whereas the lowest value of yield of freshwater is obtained from conventional solar still as expected the maximum productivity of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are reported as 0 61 kg h 0 81 kg h 1 18 kg h 1 57 kg h and 1 68 kg h respectively at 14 00 furthermore fig 9 demonstrates the amount of daily productivity of fresh water for all different configuration of solar still from the graph of the figure it has been observed that the daily productivity of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are recorded as 7 59 kg day 10 12 kg day 12 75 kg day 17 45 kg day and 17 97 kg day respectively it can be concluded that the ss efpc 2c configuration can produce 136 37 and 77 57 higher daily yield of freshwater than conventional ss ss fpc 1c respectively therefore from the above discussion it can be inferred that ss efpc 2c is the best configuration and this is one of the key finding of the present study further the hourly variation of instantaneous energy and exergy efficiencies of all different configuration of solar still have been presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively the instantaneous energy and exergy efficiency of all different configuration of solar still progressively increase from 7 00 a m to 16 00 p m and attains the maximum value at 16 00 p m it is due to combine effect of solar intensity and ambient temperature during sunshine hours despite the total solar radiation decreasing from 12 00 p m till the end of the day i e 16 00 p m but the energy and exergy efficiency still raises because of increasing the latent heat of basin water later on the daily energy and exergy efficiency for all configuration of solar still has been plotted in fig 12 it is observed that the daily energy efficiency of conventional solar still is higher than from ss fpc 2c and ss fpc 1c it is due to fact that the operation area of conventional solar still is smaller than ss fpc 2c and ss fpc 1c hence thermal losses is also low however the energy efficiency of ss efpc 2c and ss efpc 1c are higher than conventional solar still because the negligible conduction and convection heat transfer coefficient due to vacuum environment of efpc the daily energy efficiency of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are 39 74 30 95 36 09 45 86 and 46 64 respectively whereas daily exergy efficiency of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are 2 69 3 99 5 19 7 95 and 8 2 respectively this is also the key finding of the present study 6 conclusions and future scopes 6 1 conclusions the present research work has major following conclusions 1 maximum total solar radiation and incident solar flux radiation are obtained at 12 00 p m with the values of 951 032 w m2 and 818 808 w m2 respectively whereas maximum ambient temperature recorded as 32 c at 14 00 p m while minimum 13 c at 6 00 a m 2 highest values of basin water temperature for ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are recorded as 65 58 c 86 59 c 92 28 c 102 23 c and 103 12 c respectively at local time 14 00 p m on 22nd march 2021 3 the proposed system i e

2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are around 39 74 30 95 36 10 45 85 and 46 64 while the daily exergy efficiency is 2 69 3 99 5 19 7 95 and 8 21 respectively 7 the proposed ss efpc 2c will be the best system as compared to the other configuration namely solar still ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c and ss efpc 1c this is one of the key finding of the present study 6 2 future scope and recommendations based on the present research work the following future scope and recommendations can be drawn for the further studies 1 it recommends to use solar still inserted with efpc with double cover to get higher productivity energy and exergy efficiency from the proposed hybrid solar still 2 the impact of water depth salinity of water and the gap distance between basin water surface and glass cover on the productivity of freshwater should be studied 3 analysis the system by using cfd software and comparing it with theoretical results 4 the theoretical results of proposed of thermal model for solar

introduction water is abundantly available on planet earth and is the most important source for survival of all living thing on earth approximately 71 of the earth is surrounded by water however around 97 of this quantity is salty water and the rest is freshwater tuly et al 2021 moreover the human just grasps less than 1 from a freshwater omara and eltawil 2013 which basically shows the demand of freshwater also world population is being substantially increasing and the india the third world countries that needs a huge requirement of freshwater for drinking and other purpose duffie and beckman 2013 with this rate it can be predict that in coming years the rate of demand of fresh water will increase greatly in order to overcome water shortage problem several desalination plant technologies have been developed and experimental outcomes have also been obtained but most of the desalination systems require intensive energy ghaffour et al 2015 for that utilizing the alternative renewable energy for desalination plants which may be pondered for best results in addition with the inexpensive process for producing freshwater with lower overall cost qiblawey and banat 2008 have discussed different desalination technologies in commercial and pilot stages of development they have focused those technologies which are suitable for use in remote areas salinas rodr√≠gue et al salinas rodr√≠guez and schippers 2021 published book on seawater reverse osmosis desalination where they have done assessment and pre treatment of fouling and scaling tiwari et al 2021 developed hottel whillier bliss equation in modified version for an solar distillation system for higher yield and thermal efficiency they have proposed different equations to evaluate efficiency of pvt based active solar distillation and conventional fpc among all alternative desalination systems solar distillation system has received great attention as it has less operation and maintenance costs environmentally friendly and economically viable fath and hosny 2002 however it requires high initial investments and big installation areas jamil et al 2020 solar distillation is classified into two categories those are passive and active solar still singh et al 2021 in a passive solar still the saline water is heated directly by solar radiation in order to produce fresh water in one simple process and it doesn t require mechanical components chaurasiya et al 2022 has reviewed the techniques for increasing the productivity of passive solar stills in detail however in case of active solar still it reinforces by integrating it with external thermal unit such as thermal collector to enhance the temperature difference between evaporating and conducting surface for increasing the productivity of freshwater several researchers and scientists have worked to enhance the productivity and efficiency of solar still das et al 2020 theoretical and experimental analysis on a single slope solar still based on solar radiation intensity has been conducted by badran et al 2005 they concluded that the thermal efficiency and daily productivity of the solar still enhance with an increase in the intensity of solar radiation murugavel et al murugavel and srithar 2009 studied the impact of using an electrical resistance heater in the double slope solar still on the productivity of freshwater el sebaii 2004 investigated the impact of wind speed on the daily yield of freshwater for passive and active solar still by utilizing simulation technology and concluded that the daily yield rises with an increase in wind speed up to an ideal velocity beyond which the rise in production becomes meaningless the impact of using external air cooled condenser with solar still have been evaluated by ibrahim et al 2015 panchal et al 2019 carried out the detail analysis of single basin passive solar still coupled with evacuated tubes for the climate conditions of mahesana gujarat they have presented the annual performance of the said system and compared the system with the distillate output with other work mevada et al 2022 carried a review on applications of evacuated tubes collector to harness the solar energy in this review analysis they have found that evacuated tubes collector is most suitable apparatus for solar thermal applications additionally mevada et al 2021 performed experimental exergo economic and exergo environment analyses of evacuated tubes coupled solar still with condenser and fins panchal and awasthi 2017 investigated the performance of single slope single basin solar still integrated with evacuated tubes they have calculated water temperature inner glass cover temperature and distillate output for the said system under the climate conditions of mahesana gujarat 23 5880 n 72 3693 e considering 0 04 m depth and 6 months of time interval a detail study of evacuated tubes has been reported in the literature panchal et al 2020a 2020b patel et al 2020 singh et al 2020 reported experimental results that an enhancement of 16 2 and 29 7 in the productivity of freshwater and thermal efficiency respectively comparison with conventional solar still also illustrated the impact of collector s number on the life cycle conversion efficiency lcce of a conventional solar still desalination unit augmented with n identical of photovoltaic thermal compound parabolic concentrator collectors pvt cpcs it has been found that increasing the number of collectors improved the value of lcce experimental and theoretical analysis for conventional solar still coupled with solar parabolic trough collector and heat exchanger has been done by abdel rehim and lasheen 2007 they concluded that the amount of productivity was higher by 18 as compared to conventional solar still moreover the impact of form of condensing glass cover on the productivity of passive and fully covered pvt active solar still have been studied by mishra et al 2020 they concluded that at inclination 60 of conical shape of condensing glass cover with 0 01 m water depth and mass flow rate of 0 01 kg s the productivity was optimum and with increasing the depth of water the yield is got down in addition sampathkumar and senthilkumar 2012 investigated the performance of a solar distiller inserted with flat plate collector fpc experimentally further by augmented evacuated tube collector in the passive solar still investigated the performance of productivity at climatic conditions of mehsana gujarat sheeba et al 2015 moreover singh et al 2016 experimentally examined the performance of active solar still inserted with two hybrid photovoltaic collectors and found that the yield increased more compared to conventional solar still sampathkumar karuppusamy 2012 experimentally evaluated the effect of coupling a solar still with an evacuated tube collector on water productivity and concluded that the yield increased to 49 7 for solar still integrated with evacuated tube collector and 59 485 for solar still inserted with evacuated tube collector and black gravel also the performance of integrating a storage tank and flat plate collector with solar still have been examined by voropoulos et al 2001 and found that the productivity was doubled for a solar still unit incorporated with a storage tank comparison with conventional solar still from the study reported so far in the open literature it can be observed that plethora of work have been focused on the performance analysis of active solar still integrated with flat plate collector or solar dish system the conventional flat plate collector fpc mentioned in above literature is low temperature operating system due to more losses to the surrounding while the evacuated flat plate collector efpc is high operating temperature due to evacuated enclosure between top glass and the absorber plate it can also be found that the effect of single and double glass cover on the performance of efpc is seemed to be missing in the open literature however no work has been reported on the performance investigation of active solar still coupling with efpc yet in this regard the present study incorporates the above mentioned research gaps based on these gaps following objectives have been addressed in the present study that are shown below a modelling and performance of solar still integrated with evacuated flat plate collector with one cover glass ss efpc 1c and two cover glass ss efpc 2c have been carried out b hourly variation of basin water temperature and productivity of the fresh water total yield for the proposed system have been presented for typical day of march 2021 c detailed energy and exergy analyses of both the system as ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c have been evaluated and presented d detailed comparison between different configuration of the solar still namely conventional solar still ss solar still augmented with flat plate collector having one glass cover ss fpc 1c and having two glass cover ss fpc 2c have been shown for the climate condition of new delhi at 22nd of march 2021 2 description of the proposed system fig 1 shows the schematic plot of single slope solar still augmented with evacuated flat plate collector in this work conventional single slope glass cover solar still consist of galvanized iron sheet based basin with insulation the evacuated flat plate collector efpc consists of sheet in tube black absorber plate top glass cover insulating materials and housing cover the efpc is an improved technology of convention flat plate collector which consist vacuum environment between top glass cover and absorber plate unlike others the vacuum environment is advantageous for efpc because of elimination heat loss to surrounding due to conduction and convection thus the efpc can generates enhanced thermal energy for less surface area both systems namely conventional solar still and efpc coupled with each other with the help of suitable coupling as shown in fig 1 the auxiliary components of the proposed system are circulation pump distillate tank saline water tank valves insulated pipes etc the design parameters of the proposed system are mentioned in table 1 the integrated system is exposed to the solar radiation then conventional solar still and efpc both harness solar radiation the solar radiation intercepted by conventional solar still is known as passive heat gain while a solar thermal collector intercepts the solar radiation and connected with solar still is known as active heat gain thus the proposed system is operating under active mode in the proposed system the sunlight passes through the glass cover of the evacuated flat plate collector to the absorber plate that transfers the heat energy to the fluid passing through tubes therefore hot fluid is obtained at the outlet of efpc which is further feed to the basin of solar still meanwhile the solar radiation also passes through the glass cover of the solar still and heats the saline water stored in the basin in this way the saline water stored in the basin of solar still is heated in active as well as passive mode due to high thermal energy of saline water the water transforms into vapor and rises to condensing cover the vapor is condensed when approached to the cold glass condensing cover and condensate runs down through the slope of the glass cover to the freshwater reservoir the reaming saline water in the basin of solar still is feed to efpc continuously through circulation pump in closed loop as shown in fig 1 when level of saline water decreases in the basin then level of water maintained constant say 0 02 m for investigation purpose by storage tank on hourly basis the basin water depth of 0 02 m is considered due to sufficient latent heat and weight of water at that depth helps to reduce the time needed for evaporation of water due to these reasons the 0 02 m is taken in the present work also the proposed system is closed loop hence constant flow rate of water through the collector is considered and the amount of water evaporated as freshwater is replaced by feeding same amount of salt water stored in water tank in basin on hourly basis this maintain the constant water depth in the basin therefore the same operation is repeated during the whole day 3 thermal modeling of the proposed system all the components of the proposed conventional solar still integrated with efpc as shown in fig 1 are considered as thermal equipment which satisfy the basic energy balance for the simplification of the basic thermal energy balance equation across each component of the proposed model following assumptions are considered 1 fixed surfaces sloped toward the south is meaning surface azimuth angle is

as methodology that have been adopted to calculate the hourly calculation of productivity of freshwater energy and exergy efficiency for the proposed model step 1 the total solar radiation incident solar flux radiation and ambient air temperature on horizontal surface for a typical day in the march month 22nd march 2021 for new delhi have been made input to an excel and matlab program the climate data of weather has been possessed from indian meteorological department imd pune india the value of total solar radiation and incident solar flux radiation of solar still and efp collector for inclined surface at 28 62 n latitude has been computed by utilizing liu and jordan 1960 formula step 2 the value of the outlet fluid temperature of collector t f o basin water temperature t w inner outer glass temperature t g i t g o and absorber plate temperature t b of active solar still have been computed using eqs 2 and 6 and 9 11 respectively step 3 the rate of useful thermal energy gain has been calculated using eq 1 step 4 the hourly and daily yield of the proposed system has been computed with the help of eqs 18 and 22 respectively step 5 the hourly and daily thermal efficiency of passive and active solar still have been estimated by using eqs 23 26 while the hourly and daily exergy efficiency has been computed by using eqs 27 30 5 results and discussions the hourly variation of total solar radiation incident solar flux radiation and ambient temperature on a typical spring day in the march month on 22nd march 2021 of new delhi climatic condition has been shown in fig 3 from the plot of fig 3 it can be observed that from 7 00 a m till 12 00 p m the total solar radiation rises from 158 039 w m2 to 951 032 w m2 and then declines to zero w m2 at 18 00 p m due to sun set similarly the incident solar flux radiation slowly rises from 95 073 w m2 to 818 808 w m2 and then drop to zero in the evening in addition at 14 00 p m the peak value of ambient temperature has been registered with the value of 32 c whereas the low value is obtained as 13 c at 6 00 a m 4 shows the hourly variation of theoretical basin water temperature for passive conventional solar still and active solar still from fig 4 it is seen that the highest value of basin water temperature has been obtained for solar still integrated with evacuated flat plate collector while the lowest value for conventional solar still due to high thermal energy gain in former one furthermore it can also notice that the basin water temperature for each system gradually increases up to noon and then decrease slowly till the evening the maximum values of basin water temperature for ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are obtained as 65 58 c 86 59 c 92 28 c 102 23 c and 103 12 c respectively at local time 14 00 p m moreover it is inferred that the highest value of basin water temperature obtained in case of ss efpc 2c due to decrease in the convection and radiation heat losses because of two glass cover along with vacuum environment the hourly variation of average glass cover and absorber plate temperatures of passive and active solar still are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively from these figures the peak value of temperatures of glass cover and absorber plate have been recorded for ss efpc 2c configuration at local time 14 00 p m while for the conventional solar still having minimum average glass cover and absorber plate temperatures the average glass cover and absorber plate temperature for ss efpc 2c are recorded as 98 12 c and 106 6 c respectively whereas the temperature of conventional solar still are recorded as 55 17 c and 68 57 c respectively thus it can be concluded that the ss efpc 2c configuration has higher operating temperature in terms of average glass cover temperature and absorber plate temperature therefore the hourly variation of all operating temperatures namely outer glass cover inner glass cover absorber plate bottom surface and basin water temperatures of ss efpc 2c have also been investigated and plotted in fig 7 the trends of all operating temperatures of the ss efpc 2c configuration are as per our expectation the hourly variation of productivity of fresh water i e yield for all cases namely ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c have been illustrated in fig 8 it can be seen in the graph that the yield of all configuration gradually elevates up from 7 00 a m to 14 00 p m and then begins slowly decreasing to the end of the day however it is noticed that at the noon hour when the basin water temperature of active solar still systems is higher than 70 c the latent heat of water is changed causing jump in the productivity of freshwater in addition to this it is also evident from fig 8 that the ss efpc 2c system has the highest amount of productivity at 14 00 p m whereas the lowest value of yield of freshwater is obtained from conventional solar still as expected the maximum productivity of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are reported as 0 61 kg h 0 81 kg h 1 18 kg h 1 57 kg h and 1 68 kg h respectively at 14 00 furthermore fig 9 demonstrates the amount of daily productivity of fresh water for all different configuration of solar still from the graph of the figure it has been observed that the daily productivity of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are recorded as 7 59 kg day 10 12 kg day 12 75 kg day 17 45 kg day and 17 97 kg day respectively it can be concluded that the ss efpc 2c configuration can produce 136 37 and 77 57 higher daily yield of freshwater than conventional ss ss fpc 1c respectively therefore from the above discussion it can be inferred that ss efpc 2c is the best configuration and this is one of the key finding of the present study further the hourly variation of instantaneous energy and exergy efficiencies of all different configuration of solar still have been presented in figs 10 and 11 respectively the instantaneous energy and exergy efficiency of all different configuration of solar still progressively increase from 7 00 a m to 16 00 p m and attains the maximum value at 16 00 p m it is due to combine effect of solar intensity and ambient temperature during sunshine hours despite the total solar radiation decreasing from 12 00 p m till the end of the day i e 16 00 p m but the energy and exergy efficiency still raises because of increasing the latent heat of basin water later on the daily energy and exergy efficiency for all configuration of solar still has been plotted in fig 12 it is observed that the daily energy efficiency of conventional solar still is higher than from ss fpc 2c and ss fpc 1c it is due to fact that the operation area of conventional solar still is smaller than ss fpc 2c and ss fpc 1c hence thermal losses is also low however the energy efficiency of ss efpc 2c and ss efpc 1c are higher than conventional solar still because the negligible conduction and convection heat transfer coefficient due to vacuum environment of efpc the daily energy efficiency of ss ss fpc 1c ss fpc 2c ss efpc 1c and ss efpc 2c are 39 74 30 95 36 09 45 86 and 46
