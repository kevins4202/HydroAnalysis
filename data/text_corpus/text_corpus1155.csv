5775,common crustal igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks contain peroxy defects which remain dormant until the rock experiences stress upon deformation stress activated peroxy defects form highly reactive oxygen species ros at the rock water interface observed in both terrestrial and extraterrestrial rock samples the ros complex is formed upon rock fluid interaction when groundwater combines with the ros to produce hydrogen peroxide giving an indirect measure of the underlying rock stress and crustal deformation along active faults the average concentration of hydrogen peroxide from the sohna thermal spring water falling along the active sohna fault and geothermal field was measured to be 0 53 0 014 mg l similar average concentration was also recorded from borewell sample north of the spring 0 56 0 017 mg l within the same geothermal field lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide was recorded within samples collected from hard rock aquifers outside the geothermal field and the active fault zone 0 138 0 095 mg l the detailed analysis suggests that the presence of hydrogen peroxide is largely dependent on the circulation pattern through the interconnected fractures joints within the quartzite bedrock lying adjacent to the fault plane laboratory analysis results also show high hydrogen peroxide concentration within two borewell samples falling adjacent to the epicentre of a shallow microtremor event within the hard rock region falling alongside a lineament along the delhi hard rock mega fold rock water interaction post stress activation of peroxy defects and

royden et al 1997 scheuber and gonzalez 1999 wang et al 2001 several case studies across the globe searching for such premonitory signals for earthquake prediction have reported anomalous changes in

thus can elucidate the link between seismic stress and crustal rock deformation bolognesi 1997 andrén et al 2016 wästeby et al 2014 observations report that during the process of igneous rock formation water gets incorporated into the rock s mineral grains in the form of hydroxyl ions upon crystallisation from water laden magmas even within anhydrous mineral grains takeuchi et al 2005 this water gets incorporated into the anhydrous mineral grains quartz feldspars etc into such an electronic rearrangement which enables a distribution of single oh oh pairs and sometimes larger oh clusters

when igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks experience stress due to crustal deformation activation of phps lead to the production of currents when positive charge carriers flow from the stressed rock volume into the unstressed rock volume the flow of current rises with increase in stress on the unstressed rock volume freund and sornette 2007 laboratory simulations have shown that these positive holes can travel along stress gradients with speeds of 100 m s and over distances of meters in the field these positive holes are estimated to propagate in kilometres causing the rock mass to transmit current and behave like a battery freund 2002 2011 freund et al 2006 freund and freund 2015 freund and sornette 2007 grant et al 2011 further these simulations suggest that once the positive holes reach the rock water interface oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide takes place when the circuit is complete achieved by connecting a copper wire from the stressed end to the unstressed end of the rock balk et al 2009 when the potential difference is large the positive hole h turns into a highly reactive oxygen radical o chemically equivalent to o which oxidizes h2o to h2o2 according to eqs 4 6 balk et al 2009 4 o surface h2o oh surface oh 5 h3o e h2o ½ h2 6 oh oh h2o2 this h2o2 has been measured at nm scales in laboratory simulations involving the application of stress through steel pistons on a block of gabbro balk et al 2009 it was observed that the battery current started to flow as soon as a manually operated hydraulic press was loaded onto the rock the current increased rapidly reaching a maximum of 10na at 20 mpa corresponding to 10 of the compressive strength of the rock the ends of the rock mass were dipped in pools of water hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured upon the passage of current it was inferred that the stressed rock volume behaves as an anode from where h charge carriers flow out balk et al 2009 the concentration of peroxy defects in typical rock forming minerals and hence the number of h charge carriers in a given volume of rock are still poorly understood but it is estimated that the average peroxy concentration in igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks is 100 ppm batllo et al 1990 with every km3 having the potential to produce about 1013 c km 3 equivalent to a battery current of about 106 a flowing for 6 months studies have also shown that besides terrestrial rock samples freshly crushed basaltic soil and rock samples from martian and lunar crusts formed highly reactive radical species on the surfaces of the crushed samples once the rocks underwent severe mechanical stress upon grinding balk et al 2009 these radical species produced ros such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide ion o2 once the crushed rock was immersed in water hurowitz et al 2007 further hydrogen gas production has been associated with occurrence of small and large magnitude earthquakes king 1986 sato 1986 formed when freshly exposed rock surfaces react with water ito et al 1999 another study also reported the biogeochemical dark production of hydrogen peroxide in the groundwaters of an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the colorado river near rifle co yuan et al 2017 in the study the generation of highly reactive oxygen species such as oh radical at the oxic anoxic boundaries was inferred to be associated with a cascade of redox reactions involving the interconversion between metal species such as iron grant et al 2011 further reported the disappearance of european toad species bufo bufo from their spring mating and spawning grounds five days before the occurrence of a 6 3 l aquila earthquake in april 2006 the toads reappeared only after all the aftershocks ceased to occur after the primary earthquake this behaviour was inferred to have occurred as the toads picked up these chemical clues such as release of h2o2 and other oxidized products from the water the present study was therefore conducted by sampling geothermal spring and hard rock aquifers lying along fault zones and regions with microtremor epicentral clusters within major fault intersection zone to search for presence and anomalous changes in hydrogen peroxide concentration as an indirect measure of crustal deformation and rock stress further this study also attempts to validate through hydrochemical analysis of aquifers and spring samples along faults and fracture zones that a fairly qualitative estimation of rock stress and crustal deformation can be achieved by measuring the concentration of h2o2 and other physico chemical parameters 2 study area 2 1 seismotectonics of the region the study region is located within the states of haryana and delhi traversing along zones with a dense network of small and large active faults fractures and lineaments figs 1 and 2 falling within seismic zone iv categorized as high damage risk zone prone to the msk medvedev sponheuer karnik shaking intensity of 8 and above ancient and current seismicity records indicate that the mahendragarh dehradun subsurface fault mdssf axis of delhi sargodha ridge dsr and aravalli delhi fold axis are seismically most active zones within the north western indian region shukla et al 2007 prakash and shrivastava 2012 this seismicity is attributed to bending of the upper crust prior to underthrusting below the himalayas at the eurasian and indian convergent plate boundary molnar and lyon caen 1989 the seismic epicentral location maps of the region fig 3 show that several clusters of microtremor events ranging in magnitude between mw 2 3 are located at the boundary of rohtak and sonipat districts in haryana as well as in some parts of the national capital region of delhi the microtremor clusters for the seismic events occurring from 2000 to 2015 fall at the intersection of the mdssf and axis of dsr delhi lahore fault these clusters indicate that frequent microtremor events occur 3 magnitude in this region which is mainly attributed to the activation of different faults at one time or another 2 2 geology and geomorphology of the study region the seismic microtremor clusters fall within two geomorphic zones consisting of a hard rock region falling in the districts of gurugram faridabad and a part of delhi and within the alluvial region falling in the districts of rohtak sonipat and jhajjhar the geology of the area is characterized by the precambrian metasediments of the delhi supergroup with widespread occurrence of quartzites schists siliceous limestones slates and phyllites cinti et al 2009 singh 1996 the alluvial region comprises of polycyclic sequence of silt clay with gravel and fine to medium grained sand along with a few patches of aeolian windblown sand scattered within the alluvial plain the subsurface also contains a complex system of several interconnected faults and lineaments as depicted in the geological map of the region fig 4 the hard rock outcrop of the delhi fold belt within the study area encompassing delhi gurugram and faridabad districts contains numerous lineaments and fractures fig 5 a distinct n s oriented seismogenic fault known as the sohna fault associated with the himalayan orogenic movement runs from sohna to the delhi ridge existing below the alluvium in the vicinity of a thermal spring figs 5 and 6 sharma et al 2003 2 2 1 geology of sohna geothermal spring the geothermal field and thermal spring fall within the tectonic depression formed by the downward faulting of a central block lying between two anticlinal ridges belonging to the delhi belt fig 6 the spring is located at an altitude of 200 m from the mean sea level at the hinge region of the synformal fold within a tectonic depression pandey and negi 1995 thussu 2001 the temperature data suggests that the geothermal field extends over an area of 3900 m2 deb and ray 1971 the water emanates out of a fissure within the pre cambrian quartzite bedrock the region to the north and east of the spring is occupied by alluvium whereas the southern and western parts are covered by alwar quartzite of the delhi supergroup the alluvium on the east of the spring comprises of aquifers made up of sand with some silt and clay on the west of the spring the alluvium consists of gravel sand silt and clay and is devoid of good aquifers fig 7 deb and ray 1971 the quartzites of the anticlinal ridges are highly jointed and compacted with the joints occurring in two sets one lying perpendicular to the bedding plane and the other lying parallel the unique pattern of joints within the bed rock gives rise to rectangular blocks of quartzites providing passageways for the circulating water deb and ray 1971 chaudhary et al 1996 the water table of the region follows the topography with the wells lying close to the ridge to be of deeper origin the fractures and joints within the quartzite bedrock constitute the water bearing zone whereas the rest of the hard rock region has a poor capacity to store and transmit water bajpai and mahanta 2003 the water circulation drains from the western alluvium travelling through the pattern of fractures and joints till the hinge region after which it finally issues out through a fissure as a spring fig 8 the circulation pattern of the water therefore is inferred to be the main factor influencing the changes in the geochemistry of the spring water the quartzite bedrock of the geothermal field has a provenance dominated by evolved granitic rocks and consists of intercalations of muscovite schist kyanite schist and phyllite tripathi and rajamani 2003 quartzite is an intermediate to high grade metamorphic rock formed when quartz rich sandstone is exposed to high temperatures and pressures often along tectonic boundaries it is non foliated medium grained and almost entirely composed of quartz mineral chatterjee 1974 schist as well is produced by medium to high grade metamorphism consisting of mineral grains of quartz feldspar muscovite biotite and chlorite tripathi and rajamani 2003 phyllite on the other hand is a fine grained low grade metamorphic rock composed of mineral grains of muscovite chlorite biotite along with graphite and iron oxides chatterjee 1974 3 methodology 3 1 sampling the investigation was initiated by surveying the region through maps seismotectonic maps geological maps geomorphological maps depicting the features and terrain of the area in order to delineate zones for collection of water samples representative samples were then collected from aquifers at appropriate locations falling in the alluvial region within the seismic epicentral clusters as well as the region falling within the sohna geothermal field and surrounding hard rock area sampling was done in the premonsoon season april 2015 as well in the postmonsoon season december 2015 from borewells and handpumps the polypropylene sampling bottles were initially rinsed 2 3 times with the water being sampled to get a fresh representative sample of the aquifer the handpumps were initially pumped for 50 strokes to remove stagnant water within the iron pipes minimizing the impact of contamination in case of borewells the water was allowed to run for approximately 10 minutes before collecting the sample for the hard rock region outside the geothermal field 16 groundwater samples were collected in the premonsoon season and 27 samples were collected in the postmonsoon season surrounding the delhi fold axis and the hard rock aravalli outcrops at sohna fig 1 two samples each were collected from the geothermal spring water and the borewell 100 m north of the spring one sample each was also collected from the alluvium to the west and east of the sohna spring falling outside the geothermal field in the alluvial region 32 samples were collected in the premonsoon season and 20 samples were collected in the postmonsoon season from the aquifers along the linear transect as well as within the zone of the seismic epicentral clusters temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds measurements were done on field using thermometer and multiparameter handheld probe thermo fischer multi parameter testr 35 series the samples collected for cation analysis were preserved using conc hno3 ph 2 post collection the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm millipore filter paper and stored at 4 c until analysis was done the location for each sampling point was recorded by garmin global positioning system gps fig 1 thermal camera image of the exposed fractured hard rock was captured by flir thermal camera model c 2 to obtain the relative radiative temperatures of the exposed hard rock the samples for the analysis of hydrogen peroxide concentration were collected in amber high density polypropylene hdpe bottles which were kept airtight and immediately stored at 4 c after sample collection samples were collected in duplicates to increase the accuracy of the measured concentration of hydrogen peroxide filtration of the collected samples was avoided to prevent exposure to light 3 2 hydrochemical analysis samples were analysed for major ions na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl and total iron and silica in the laboratory using the standard methods apha 1995 and methodology outlined by diatloff and rengel 2001 the methodology used as well as the detection limits have been tabulated in supplementary table 5 samples were analysed for sulphate and hydrogen peroxide using uv visible spectrophotometer lambda 35 perkin elmer sodium potassium and calcium using flame photometer elico cl 378 magnesium and iron using atomic absorption spectrometer and chloride and alkalinity hco3 co3 by titration technique the data generated from the analysis is tabulated in supplementary tables 1 4 the hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured the same day in the laboratory using a simple and rapid spectrophotometric method based on the liberation of iodine in an acidic medium ph 2 3 equivalent to the hydrogen peroxide present in solution eq 8 sunil and narayana 2008 8 h2o2 2h 2i i2 2h2o the method involves the liberation of iodine which bleaches the blue colour of toluidine blue reagent absorption maximum at 628 nm into a colourless species standard stock solution of hydrogen peroxide was prepared by dilution of 30 reagent grade hydrogen peroxide sigma aldrich standards of known concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ranging from 2 to 14 μm were prepared by dilution of the stock solution which was standardized using titrimetric method jeffery et al 1995 other reagents used for the analysis consisted of 2 potassium iodide 0 01 toluidine blue indicator 2 m hydrochloric acid and 2 m sodium acetate solution the standard curve was generated by measuring the absorbance values of solutions with varying hydrogen peroxide concentrations at a wavelength of 628 nm against the reagent blank the decrease in absorbance compared to the reagent blank is directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide the mineral phases of the rock and soil samples collected from the sohna thermal spring site were analysed using x ray diffraction technique the samples were crushed and grinded using a pulveriser and passed through 200 μm mesh size the samples were then loaded on panalytical x pert pro the generated data was processed on x pert highscore software version 1 0a for identifying the mineralogical composition the 2 theta peaks of the xrd diffractogram were matched using the standards provided in lindholm 1987 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical parameters the statistical summary of the physicochemical parameters analysed for the hard rock aquifer samples and the alluvial aquifer samples in the premonsoon and postmonsoon season is tabulated in table 1 4 2 hydrochemical processes influencing major ion groundwater chemistry based on the plots of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater was derived from piper trilinear diagrams for both alluvial and hard rock aquifer samples fig 9 a and b in the premonsoon alluvial aquifer samples the groundwater type is of ca mg cl and ca hco3 cl in the postmonsoon alluvial aquifer samples the majority of the water type is of ca na hco3 cl type for the premonsoon and postmonsoon hard rock aquifer samples the water type is of ca mg cl whereas for the postmonsoon samples the major water type is ca cl 4 3 inference of the provenance of spring water through geochemical data the thermal spring water is ca cl water type with neutral in ph 7 and a relatively high salinity 1300 μs cm 1 which suggests a long circulation time among the alkali metals sodium is found to be the most abundant whereas calcium is dominant among the alkaline earth metals from the anions bicarbonate and chloride are abundant although the spring water sample has no iron but the groundwater sample collected from the borewell just north of the spring has high iron content 5 4 mg l table 2 a comparative summary of the hydrochemical constituents of the spring water sample and the borewell sample collected 100 m north of the spring lying within the same geothermal field has been tabulated in table 2 along with the water constituents from the sample collected from the western and eastern alluvial aquifers the average concentration of hydrogen peroxide from the sohna thermal spring water falling along the active sohna fault and geothermal field was measured to be 0 535 0 014 mg l lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide was recorded within samples collected from hard rock aquifers outside the geothermal field 0 138 0 095 mg l high ca 131 mg l content was recorded within the spring water samples the samples from the alluvium west of the spring also had comparable calcium ion concentration as the spring water 110 mg l whereas the eastern alluvium had a relatively higher calcium ion concentration 279 mg l as compared to the spring water the mg and cl ion concentrations also show comparable values as the western alluvial aquifer sample table 2 piper plot in fig 10 shows that the western alluvial sample has similar water facies as compared to the eastern alluvium sample further validating that the spring water sample is derived from the western alluvium as previously observed thussu 2001 therefore the spring water is inferred to be derived from the western alluvial aquifers mixing of shallow water with hot water during discharge has not been suggested as there are no shallow aquifers reported within the region high noble gas concentration such as helium 4he was reported at the sohna spring produced from α decay of natural uranium and thorium by cinti et al 2009 the high helium and high salinity indicates a very long residence time as well as fault activity within the crust the hydrochemical parameters suggest that the water from the alluvium west of the spring seeps into the ground and enters the hard rock fractures and joints at a depth of 915 m the water starts moving upward through the joints and fractures finally issuing out from the hinge region of the synformal fold fig 8 this suggests that the changes in the hydrochemical properties are largely dependent on the circulation pattern of the water through the interconnected fractures within the bedrock lying along the active sohna fault 4 4 evidence of hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen gas production at rock water interface the interaction of water with the stressed rock volume at the rock water interface is considered key to the production of hydrogen peroxide laboratory simulations have shown that at the rock water boundary the p hole o turns into a highly reactive oxygen species ros in the form of o radical which converts h2o into h2o2 balk et al 2009 according to the reaction for every two positive holes one h2o2 molecule is formed the closure of the battery circuit in the lab simulation was achieved by joining the stressed rock end to the unstressed rock end through a copper wire in the field the closure of the circuit can be achieved by the electrolytical conductivity of water across the rockbed which is represented here by the hard rock aquifer such as the sohna geothermal aquifer the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the water samples collected from the spring and from the borewell north of the spring was the highest as compared to the groundwater samples collected from the western and eastern alluvium as well as from the surrounding hard rock aquifers tables 1 and 2 apart from the stress activation of peroxy links and migration of positive holes within crystalline oxides and silicates evidence also suggests that redox reactions involving the splitting off of h2 to form peroxy anions occur within fused silica wherein o3sioh pairs are converted into h2 and peroxy links o3si oo sio3 kita et al 1982 molecular hydrogen h2 production also takes place due to charge transfer conversion of si oh pairs into si o o si and h2 eq 7 freund 1985 7 si oh ho si si o o si h2 this hydrogen production has been evidenced to be frictionally driven during rock fracturing associated with cataclastic rock mcmahon et al 2016 preseismic increases in h2 gas associated with nucleation process of stress corrosion mechanism have been reported within a deep nagashima well along the active yoro ise bay fault zone ito et al 1999 it has been reported that hydrogen gas generation increases with high frictional work associated with even small magnitude earthquakes m 3 hirose et al 2011 ito et al 1999 king 1986 sato 1986 laboratory experiments have shown that hydrogen gas is generated when freshly pulverized rocks react with water suggesting that exposed mineral surfaces formed by tectonic crustal deformation react with groundwater releasing h2 sugisaki et al 1983 detailed studies validate that the anomalous increase in hydrogen content associated with seismic events is the result of the reaction between groundwater and si and si o radicals post rock rupture along the active fault plane kravtsov and fridman 1974 mazor 1991 further the same mechanism is reported to form hydrogen peroxide along active faults when freshly exposed bedrock reacts with groundwater freund 1985 high concentration of dissolved hydrogen 0 188 cm3 stp l was reported in the sohna spring water samples by cinti et al 2009 therefore a longer circulation time of geothermal water through the interconnected fractures within the stressed quartzite bedrock and the simultaneous occurrence of small magnitude earthquakes could possibly lead to the observed increase in the dissolved hydrogen content thermal camera images of the exposed hard rock from the region show that the fractures joints have higher internal radiative temperatures as compared to the rest of the rock volume fig 11 a and b which suggests internal heat production possibly from frictional work acting along the fracture planes alternatively study discussing the dark production of hydrogen peroxide in the alluvial aquifer of rifle co suggests that the production of hydrogen peroxide is highly spatially variable governed by several processes such as dark biological production metal mediated oxidation of organic matter and cycling of metal species e g iron through a series of redox reactions yuan et al 2017 the absence of iron species in the thermal spring water sample suggests that the interconversion of fe2 to fe3 is not responsible for the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the spring water samples the production of hydrogen peroxide in the sohna spring water sample therefore seems to be dependent on the conversion of ros species o produced through the transfer of stress activated p holes within the subsurface rock a study by borda et al 2003 describes the production of hydrogen peroxide upon addition of pyrite fes2 to deoxygenated water the production of hydrogen peroxide is initiated by the conversion of fe iii to fe ii at sulfur deficient defect sites on pyrite surfaces resulting in the generation of a hydroxyl radical with a correspondingly high concentration of sulfate so4 2 in order to assess whether this process is active in the sohna spring site the mineral phases of the rock and soil sediments was done fig 12 a and b shows the xrd diffractogram of the rock sample analysis and nearby soil sediment analysis respectively of aravalli hard rock outcrop at sohna the peaks seen in this xrd diffractogram show that the prominent minerals consist of quartz and calcite with traces of chromium in the rock sample analysis supplementary table 6 according to the d spacing value other minor minerals were also identified by soil sediment analysis of the region the minerals were identified based on the d spacing values at 2 theta supplementary table 7 in both the xrd data for rock and soil sample analysis shown above pyrite fes2 has not been detected in the mineral composition therefore the role of pyrite and the reduction of fe iii to fe ii leading to the production of hydroxyl ion might not be a significant contributor of hydrogen peroxide in the groundwater in this study also if iron reduction was playing a role in the production of hydroxyl radical then iron would have been detected in the total iron concentration in the spring water samples further if the process of the formation of hydroxyl radical on pyrite surfaces is the dominant process leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide then sulphate concentration would be higher in the geothermal samples as compared to the western alluvial aquifer to discount the role of pyrite and redox conversion of iron as the source of hydrogen peroxide production we analysed the sulfate ion concentrations based on chloride to sulphate ratio cl so4 ratio the obtained ratios showed that the western alluvial aquifer sample showed sulphate enrichment relative to seawater cl so4 4 the ratio for the sohna thermal spring samples showed slight enrichment cl so4 6 whereas the eastern alluvial aquifer showed a ratio similar to that of seawater cl so4 7 this indicates that the sulphate concentration in the groundwater samples from the western alluvial aquifer is higher than the spring and the borewell samples north of the geothermal aquifer therefore the hydrogen peroxide concentration having being higher in the spring water samples indicates that the process of hydroxyl ion formation on pyrite surfaces is highly unlikely all the physico chemical analysis and seismic data point at two important deductions one that the region experiences continuous minor crustal deformation and therefore seismic stress is active as seen from the frequent microtremor activity secondly comparatively higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide measured in the geothermal water samples is associated with this crustal deformation and stress build up activating the peroxy defects within the bedrock along the fault zone the hydrogen gas and hydrogen peroxide production both are inferred to be the result of rock water interaction taking place due to constant availability of freshly exposed rock surface for aqueous chemical interaction along the active fault zone the physico chemical properties and the long circulation time through the interconnected fractures both suggest that the presence of hydrogen peroxide within the geothermal waters can be attributed to the stress activation of positive holes taking place upon rock deformation from microtremor events along lineaments and faults 4 5 hydrogen peroxide distribution linked to microtremor activity in the study region the spatial distribution map of hydrogen peroxide concentration was prepared for the study region in the premonsoon season april 2015 in order to observe correlation with the distribution of hydrogen peroxide and microtremor activity the spatial interpolation map for the alluvial region showed that the region with high peroxide concentration falls adjacent to the intersection zones of mdssf dsr and a lineament running ne sw fig 13 a according to the laboratory simulations it was inferred that the stress activated charge carriers can travel distances of kilometres in the field therefore any major seismic event in the far field himalayan tectonic convergent boundary can activate the faults such as the mdssf leading to observed changes within the seismic zones of the study region the distribution of hydrogen peroxide concentration ranges from 0 to 1 ppm in the premonsoon season further a region falling adjacent to the delhi mega fold having a distinct lineament along which the epicentre of a microtremor event was recorded on 13th april 2015 with a magnitude of 2 1 also shows high concentration of hydrogen peroxide within the samples collected on april 26th 2015 from the aquifers adjacent to the epicentre fig 13b the region close to the thermal spring water along the active sohna fault also shows comparatively higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide it is inferred that seismic stress build up and the seismic swarms in these zones correlate positively with the high hydrogen peroxide concentration the frequent microtremor activity leads to crustal deformation post stress build up intermittently when movement occurs along one or more faults and fractures resulting in fluctuations in the hydrogen peroxide concentration 6 conclusion the findings of this study support that reactive oxygen species potentially result from deformation of mineral defects from seismic stress and can be potential indicators of seismic activity however further research is required to validate these results continuous monitoring of hydrogen peroxide concentration within the geothermal field over extended periods of time should therefore be undertaken to monitor rock stress and the associated seismicity experienced in the form of microtremors or moderate to large magnitude earthquakes geothermal zones lying along active faults or deep hard rock aquifers can be explored in detail to infer premonitory earthquake signals by quantifying the relationship of seismicity derived from rock stress dependent on groundwater interactions by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide within geothermal waters especially springs falling along active fault boundaries the estimation of seismic stress can possibly be achieved accurate and timely estimation of this indirect measure of seismic stress and crustal deformation would require continuous monitoring of groundwater chemical properties this can further be employed for devising models for early warning system for disaster preparedness and reduction author contributions p s has prepared the final manuscript and conducted

when igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks experience stress due to crustal deformation activation of phps lead to the production of currents when positive charge carriers flow from the stressed rock volume into the unstressed rock volume the flow of current rises with increase in stress on the unstressed rock volume freund and sornette 2007 laboratory simulations have shown that these positive holes can travel along stress gradients with speeds of 100 m s and over distances of meters in the field these positive holes are estimated to propagate in kilometres causing the rock mass to transmit current and behave like a battery freund 2002 2011 freund et al 2006 freund and freund 2015 freund and sornette 2007 grant et al 2011 further these simulations suggest that once the positive holes reach the rock water interface oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide takes place when the circuit is complete achieved by connecting a copper wire from the stressed end to the unstressed end of the rock balk et al 2009 when the potential difference is large the positive hole h turns into a highly reactive oxygen radical o chemically equivalent to o which oxidizes h2o to h2o2 according to eqs 4 6 balk et al 2009 4 o surface h2o oh surface oh 5 h3o e h2o ½ h2 6 oh oh h2o2 this h2o2 has been measured at nm scales in laboratory simulations involving the application of stress through steel pistons on a block of gabbro balk et al 2009 it was observed that the battery current started to flow as soon as a manually operated hydraulic press was loaded onto the rock the current increased rapidly reaching a maximum of 10na at 20 mpa corresponding to 10 of the compressive strength of the rock the ends of the rock mass were dipped in pools of water hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured upon the passage of current it was inferred that the stressed rock volume behaves as an anode from where h charge carriers flow out balk et al 2009 the concentration of peroxy defects in typical rock forming minerals and hence the number of h charge carriers in a given volume of rock are still poorly understood but it is estimated that the average peroxy concentration in igneous and high grade metamorphic rocks is 100 ppm batllo et al 1990 with every km3 having the potential to produce about 1013 c km 3 equivalent to a battery current of about 106 a flowing for 6 months studies have also shown that besides terrestrial rock samples freshly crushed basaltic soil and rock samples from martian and lunar crusts formed highly reactive radical species on the surfaces of the crushed samples once the rocks underwent severe mechanical stress upon grinding balk et al 2009 these radical species produced ros such as hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide ion o2 once the crushed rock was immersed in water hurowitz et al 2007 further hydrogen gas production has been associated with occurrence of small and large magnitude earthquakes king 1986 sato 1986 formed when freshly exposed rock surfaces react with water ito et al 1999 another study also reported the biogeochemical dark production of hydrogen peroxide in the groundwaters of an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the colorado river near rifle co yuan et al 2017 in the study the generation of highly reactive oxygen species such as oh radical at the oxic anoxic boundaries was inferred to be associated with a cascade of redox reactions involving the interconversion between metal species such as iron grant et al 2011 further reported the disappearance of european toad species bufo bufo from their spring mating and spawning grounds five days before the occurrence of a 6 3 l aquila earthquake in april 2006 the toads reappeared only after all the aftershocks ceased to occur after the primary earthquake this behaviour was inferred to have occurred as the toads picked up these chemical clues such as release of h2o2 and other oxidized products from the water the present study was therefore conducted by sampling geothermal spring and hard rock aquifers lying along fault zones and regions with microtremor epicentral clusters within major fault intersection zone to search for presence and anomalous changes in hydrogen peroxide concentration as an indirect measure of crustal deformation and rock stress further this study also attempts to validate through hydrochemical analysis of aquifers and spring samples along faults and fracture zones that a fairly qualitative estimation of rock stress and crustal deformation can be achieved by measuring the concentration of h2o2 and other physico chemical parameters 2 study area 2 1 seismotectonics of the region the study region is located within the states of haryana and delhi traversing along zones with a dense network of small and large active faults fractures and lineaments figs 1 and 2 falling within seismic zone iv categorized as high damage risk zone prone to the msk medvedev sponheuer karnik shaking intensity of 8 and above ancient and current seismicity records indicate that the mahendragarh dehradun subsurface fault mdssf axis of delhi sargodha ridge dsr and aravalli delhi fold axis are seismically most active zones within the north western indian region shukla et al 2007 prakash and shrivastava 2012 this seismicity is attributed to bending of the upper crust prior to underthrusting below the himalayas at the eurasian and indian convergent plate boundary molnar and lyon caen 1989 the seismic epicentral location maps of the region fig 3 show that several clusters of microtremor events ranging in magnitude between mw 2 3 are located at the boundary of rohtak and sonipat districts in haryana as well as in some parts of the national capital region of delhi the microtremor clusters for the seismic events occurring from 2000 to 2015 fall at the intersection of the mdssf and axis of dsr delhi lahore fault these clusters indicate that frequent microtremor events occur 3 magnitude in this region which is mainly attributed to the activation of different faults at one time or another 2 2 geology and geomorphology of the study region the seismic microtremor clusters fall within two geomorphic zones consisting of a hard rock region falling in the districts of gurugram faridabad and a part of delhi and within the alluvial region falling in the districts of rohtak sonipat and jhajjhar the geology of the area is characterized by the precambrian metasediments of the delhi supergroup with widespread occurrence of quartzites schists siliceous limestones slates and phyllites cinti et al 2009 singh 1996 the alluvial region comprises of polycyclic sequence of silt clay with gravel and fine to medium grained sand along with a few patches of aeolian windblown sand scattered within the alluvial plain the subsurface also contains a complex system of several interconnected faults and lineaments as depicted in the geological map of the region fig 4 the hard rock outcrop of the delhi fold belt within the study area encompassing delhi gurugram and faridabad districts contains numerous lineaments and fractures fig 5 a distinct n s oriented seismogenic fault known as the sohna fault associated with the himalayan orogenic movement runs from sohna to the delhi ridge existing below the alluvium in the vicinity of a thermal spring figs 5 and 6 sharma et al 2003 2 2 1 geology of sohna geothermal spring the geothermal field and thermal spring fall within the tectonic depression formed by the downward faulting of a central block lying between two anticlinal ridges belonging to the delhi belt fig 6 the spring is located at an altitude of 200 m from the mean sea level at the hinge region of the synformal fold within a tectonic depression pandey and negi 1995 thussu 2001 the temperature data suggests that the geothermal field extends over an area of 3900 m2 deb and ray 1971 the water emanates out of a fissure within the pre cambrian quartzite bedrock the region to the north and east of the spring is occupied by alluvium whereas the southern and western parts are covered by alwar quartzite of the delhi supergroup the alluvium on the east of the spring comprises of aquifers made up of sand with some silt and clay on the west of the spring the alluvium consists of gravel sand silt and clay and is devoid of good aquifers fig 7 deb and ray 1971 the quartzites of the anticlinal ridges are highly jointed and compacted with the joints occurring in two sets one lying perpendicular to the bedding plane and the other lying parallel the unique pattern of joints within the bed rock gives rise to rectangular blocks of quartzites providing passageways for the circulating water deb and ray 1971 chaudhary et al 1996 the water table of the region follows the topography with the wells lying close to the ridge to be of deeper origin the fractures and joints within the quartzite bedrock constitute the water bearing zone whereas the rest of the hard rock region has a poor capacity to store and transmit water bajpai and mahanta 2003 the water circulation drains from the western alluvium travelling through the pattern of fractures and joints till the hinge region after which it finally issues out through a fissure as a spring fig 8 the circulation pattern of the water therefore is inferred to be the main factor influencing the changes in the geochemistry of the spring water the quartzite bedrock of the geothermal field has a provenance dominated by evolved granitic rocks and consists of intercalations of muscovite schist kyanite schist and phyllite tripathi and rajamani 2003 quartzite is an intermediate to high grade metamorphic rock formed when quartz rich sandstone is exposed to high temperatures and pressures often along tectonic boundaries it is non foliated medium grained and almost entirely composed of quartz mineral chatterjee 1974 schist as well is produced by medium to high grade metamorphism consisting of mineral grains of quartz feldspar muscovite biotite and chlorite tripathi and rajamani 2003 phyllite on the other hand is a fine grained low grade metamorphic rock composed of mineral grains of muscovite chlorite biotite along with graphite and iron oxides chatterjee 1974 3 methodology 3 1 sampling the investigation was initiated by surveying the region through maps seismotectonic maps geological maps geomorphological maps depicting the features and terrain of the area in order to delineate zones for collection of water samples representative samples were then collected from aquifers at appropriate locations falling in the alluvial region within the seismic epicentral clusters as well as the region falling within the sohna geothermal field and surrounding hard rock area sampling was done in the premonsoon season april 2015 as well in the postmonsoon season december 2015 from borewells and handpumps the polypropylene sampling bottles were initially rinsed 2 3 times with the water being sampled to get a fresh representative sample of the aquifer the handpumps were initially pumped for 50 strokes to remove stagnant water within the iron pipes minimizing the impact of contamination in case of borewells the water was allowed to run for approximately 10 minutes before collecting the sample for the hard rock region outside the geothermal field 16 groundwater samples were collected in the premonsoon season and 27 samples were collected in the postmonsoon season surrounding the delhi fold axis and the hard rock aravalli outcrops at sohna fig 1 two samples each were collected from the geothermal spring water and the borewell 100 m north of the spring one sample each was also collected from the alluvium to the west and east of the sohna spring falling outside the geothermal field in the alluvial region 32 samples were collected in the premonsoon season and 20 samples were collected in the postmonsoon season from the aquifers along the linear transect as well as within the zone of the seismic epicentral clusters temperature ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds measurements were done on field using thermometer and multiparameter handheld probe thermo fischer multi parameter testr 35 series the samples collected for cation analysis were preserved using conc hno3 ph 2 post collection the samples were filtered using 0 45 μm millipore filter paper and stored at 4 c until analysis was done the location for each sampling point was recorded by garmin global positioning system gps fig 1 thermal camera image of the exposed fractured hard rock was captured by flir thermal camera model c 2 to obtain the relative radiative temperatures of the exposed hard rock the samples for the analysis of hydrogen peroxide concentration were collected in amber high density polypropylene hdpe bottles which were kept airtight and immediately stored at 4 c after sample collection samples were collected in duplicates to increase the accuracy of the measured concentration of hydrogen peroxide filtration of the collected samples was avoided to prevent exposure to light 3 2 hydrochemical analysis samples were analysed for major ions na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 cl and total iron and silica in the laboratory using the standard methods apha 1995 and methodology outlined by diatloff and rengel 2001 the methodology used as well as the detection limits have been tabulated in supplementary table 5 samples were analysed for sulphate and hydrogen peroxide using uv visible spectrophotometer lambda 35 perkin elmer sodium potassium and calcium using flame photometer elico cl 378 magnesium and iron using atomic absorption spectrometer and chloride and alkalinity hco3 co3 by titration technique the data generated from the analysis is tabulated in supplementary tables 1 4 the hydrogen peroxide concentration was measured the same day in the laboratory using a simple and rapid spectrophotometric method based on the liberation of iodine in an acidic medium ph 2 3 equivalent to the hydrogen peroxide present in solution eq 8 sunil and narayana 2008 8 h2o2 2h 2i i2 2h2o the method involves the liberation of iodine which bleaches the blue colour of toluidine blue reagent absorption maximum at 628 nm into a colourless species standard stock solution of hydrogen peroxide was prepared by dilution of 30 reagent grade hydrogen peroxide sigma aldrich standards of known concentrations of hydrogen peroxide ranging from 2 to 14 μm were prepared by dilution of the stock solution which was standardized using titrimetric method jeffery et al 1995 other reagents used for the analysis consisted of 2 potassium iodide 0 01 toluidine blue indicator 2 m hydrochloric acid and 2 m sodium acetate solution the standard curve was generated by measuring the absorbance values of solutions with varying hydrogen peroxide concentrations at a wavelength of 628 nm against the reagent blank the decrease in absorbance compared to the reagent blank is directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide the mineral phases of the rock and soil samples collected from the sohna thermal spring site were analysed using x ray diffraction technique the samples were crushed and grinded using a pulveriser and passed through 200 μm mesh size the samples were then loaded on panalytical x pert pro the generated data was processed on x pert highscore software version 1 0a for identifying the mineralogical composition the 2 theta peaks of the xrd diffractogram were matched using the standards provided in lindholm 1987 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical parameters the statistical summary of the physicochemical parameters analysed for the hard rock aquifer samples and the alluvial aquifer samples in the premonsoon and postmonsoon season is tabulated in table 1 4 2 hydrochemical processes influencing major ion groundwater chemistry based on the plots of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 the hydrochemical facies of the groundwater was derived from piper trilinear diagrams for both alluvial and hard rock aquifer samples fig 9 a and b in the premonsoon alluvial aquifer samples the groundwater type is of ca mg cl and ca hco3 cl in the postmonsoon alluvial aquifer samples the majority of the water type is of ca na hco3 cl type for the premonsoon and postmonsoon hard rock aquifer samples the water type is of ca mg cl whereas for the postmonsoon samples the major water type is ca cl 4 3 inference of the provenance of spring water through geochemical data the thermal spring water is ca cl water type with neutral in ph 7 and a relatively high salinity 1300 μs cm 1 which suggests a long circulation time among the alkali metals sodium is found to be the most abundant whereas calcium is dominant among the alkaline earth metals from the anions bicarbonate and chloride are abundant although the spring water sample has no iron but the groundwater sample collected from the borewell just north of the spring has high iron content 5 4 mg l table 2 a comparative summary of the hydrochemical constituents of the spring water sample and the borewell sample collected 100 m north of the spring lying within the same geothermal field has been tabulated in table 2 along with the water constituents from the sample collected from the western and eastern alluvial aquifers the average concentration of hydrogen peroxide from the sohna thermal spring water falling along the active sohna fault and geothermal field was measured to be 0 535 0 014 mg l lower concentration of hydrogen peroxide was recorded within samples collected from hard rock aquifers outside the geothermal field 0 138 0 095 mg l high ca 131 mg l content was recorded within the spring water samples the samples from the alluvium west of the spring also had comparable calcium ion concentration as the spring water 110 mg l whereas the eastern alluvium had a relatively higher calcium ion concentration 279 mg l as compared to the spring water the mg and cl ion concentrations also show comparable values as the western alluvial aquifer sample table 2 piper plot in fig 10 shows that the western alluvial sample has similar water facies as compared to the eastern alluvium sample further validating that the spring water sample is derived from the western alluvium as previously observed thussu 2001 therefore the spring water is inferred to be derived from the western alluvial aquifers mixing of shallow water with hot water during discharge has not been suggested as there are no shallow aquifers reported within the region high noble gas concentration such as helium 4he was reported at the sohna spring produced from α decay of natural uranium and thorium by cinti et al 2009 the high helium and high salinity indicates a very long residence time as well as fault activity within the crust the hydrochemical parameters suggest that the water from the alluvium west of the spring seeps into the ground and enters the hard rock fractures and joints at a depth of 915 m the water starts moving upward through the joints and fractures finally issuing out from the hinge region of the synformal fold fig 8 this suggests that the changes in the hydrochemical properties are largely dependent on the circulation pattern of the water through the interconnected fractures within the bedrock lying along the active sohna fault 4 4 evidence of hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen gas production at rock water interface the interaction of water with the stressed rock volume at the rock water interface is considered key to the production of hydrogen peroxide laboratory simulations have shown that at the rock water boundary the p hole o turns into a highly reactive oxygen species ros in the form of o radical which converts h2o into h2o2 balk et al 2009 according to the reaction for every two positive holes one h2o2 molecule is formed the closure of the battery circuit in the lab simulation was achieved by joining the stressed rock end to the unstressed rock end through a copper wire in the field the closure of the circuit can be achieved by the electrolytical conductivity of water across the rockbed which is represented here by the hard rock aquifer such as the sohna geothermal aquifer the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the water samples collected from the spring and from the borewell north of the spring was the highest as compared to the groundwater samples collected from the western and eastern alluvium as well as from the surrounding hard rock aquifers tables 1 and 2 apart from the stress activation of peroxy links and migration of positive holes within crystalline oxides and silicates evidence also suggests that redox reactions involving the splitting off of h2 to form peroxy anions occur within fused silica wherein o3sioh pairs are converted into h2 and peroxy links o3si oo sio3 kita et al 1982 molecular hydrogen h2 production also takes place due to charge transfer conversion of si oh pairs into si o o si and h2 eq 7 freund 1985 7 si oh ho si si o o si h2 this hydrogen production has been evidenced to be frictionally driven during rock fracturing associated with cataclastic rock mcmahon et al 2016 preseismic increases in h2 gas associated with nucleation process of stress corrosion mechanism have been reported within a deep nagashima well along the active yoro ise bay fault zone ito et al 1999 it has been reported that hydrogen gas generation increases with high frictional work associated with even small magnitude earthquakes m 3 hirose et al 2011 ito et al 1999 king 1986 sato 1986 laboratory experiments have shown that hydrogen gas is generated when freshly pulverized rocks react with water suggesting that exposed mineral surfaces formed by tectonic crustal deformation react with groundwater releasing h2 sugisaki et al 1983 detailed studies validate that the anomalous increase in hydrogen content associated with seismic events is the result of the reaction between groundwater and si and si o radicals post rock rupture along the active fault plane kravtsov and fridman 1974 mazor 1991 further the same mechanism is reported to form hydrogen peroxide along active faults when freshly exposed bedrock reacts with groundwater freund 1985 high concentration of dissolved hydrogen 0 188 cm3 stp l was reported in the sohna spring water samples by cinti et al 2009 therefore a longer circulation time of geothermal water through the interconnected fractures within the stressed quartzite bedrock and the simultaneous occurrence of small magnitude earthquakes could possibly lead to the observed increase in the dissolved hydrogen content thermal camera images of the exposed hard rock from the region show that the fractures joints have higher internal radiative temperatures as compared to the rest of the rock volume fig 11 a and b which suggests internal heat production possibly from frictional work acting along the fracture planes alternatively study discussing the dark production of hydrogen peroxide in the alluvial aquifer of rifle co suggests that the production of hydrogen peroxide is highly spatially variable governed by several processes such as dark biological production metal mediated oxidation of organic matter and cycling of metal species e g iron through a series of redox reactions yuan et al 2017 the absence of iron species in the thermal spring water sample suggests that the interconversion of fe2 to fe3 is not responsible for the generation of hydrogen peroxide in the spring water samples the production of hydrogen peroxide in the sohna spring water sample therefore seems to be dependent on the conversion of ros species o produced through the transfer of stress activated p holes within the subsurface rock a study by borda et al 2003 describes the production of hydrogen peroxide upon addition of pyrite fes2 to deoxygenated water the production of hydrogen peroxide is initiated by the conversion of fe iii to fe ii at sulfur deficient defect sites on pyrite surfaces resulting in the generation of a hydroxyl radical with a correspondingly high concentration of sulfate so4 2 in order to assess whether this process is active in the sohna spring site the mineral phases of the rock and soil sediments was done fig 12 a and b shows the xrd diffractogram of the rock sample analysis and nearby soil sediment analysis respectively of aravalli hard rock outcrop at sohna the peaks seen in this xrd diffractogram show that the prominent minerals consist of quartz and calcite with traces of chromium in the rock sample analysis supplementary table 6 according to the d spacing value other minor minerals were also identified by soil sediment analysis of the region the minerals were identified based on the d spacing values at 2 theta supplementary table 7 in both the xrd data for rock and soil sample analysis shown above pyrite fes2 has not been detected in the mineral composition therefore the role of pyrite and the reduction of fe iii to fe ii leading to the production of hydroxyl ion might not be a significant contributor of hydrogen peroxide in the groundwater in this study also if iron reduction was playing a role in the production of hydroxyl radical then iron would have been detected in the total iron concentration in the spring water samples further if the process of the formation of hydroxyl radical on pyrite surfaces is the dominant process leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide then sulphate concentration would be higher in the geothermal samples as compared to the western alluvial aquifer to discount the role of pyrite and redox conversion of iron as the source of hydrogen peroxide production we analysed the sulfate ion concentrations based on chloride to sulphate ratio cl so4 ratio the obtained ratios showed that the western alluvial aquifer sample showed sulphate enrichment relative to seawater cl so4 4 the ratio for the sohna thermal spring samples showed slight enrichment cl so4 6 whereas the eastern alluvial aquifer showed a ratio similar to that of seawater cl so4 7 this indicates that the sulphate concentration in the groundwater samples from the western alluvial aquifer is higher than the spring and the borewell samples north of the geothermal aquifer therefore the hydrogen peroxide concentration having being higher in the spring water samples indicates that the process of hydroxyl ion formation on pyrite surfaces is highly unlikely all the physico chemical analysis and seismic data point at two important deductions one that the region experiences continuous minor crustal deformation and therefore seismic stress is active as seen from the frequent microtremor activity secondly comparatively higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide measured in the geothermal water samples is associated with this crustal deformation and stress build up activating the peroxy defects within the bedrock along the fault zone the hydrogen gas and hydrogen peroxide production both are inferred to be the result of rock water interaction taking place due to constant availability of freshly exposed rock surface for aqueous chemical interaction along the active fault zone the physico chemical properties and the long circulation time through the interconnected fractures both suggest that the presence of hydrogen peroxide within the geothermal waters can be attributed to the stress activation of positive holes taking place upon rock deformation from microtremor events along lineaments and faults 4 5 hydrogen peroxide distribution linked to microtremor activity in the study region the spatial distribution map of hydrogen peroxide concentration was prepared for the study region in the premonsoon season april 2015 in order to observe correlation with the distribution of hydrogen peroxide and microtremor activity the spatial interpolation map for the alluvial region showed that the region with high peroxide concentration falls adjacent to the intersection zones of mdssf dsr and a lineament running ne sw fig 13 a according to the laboratory simulations it was inferred that the stress activated charge carriers can travel distances of kilometres in the field therefore any major seismic event in the far field himalayan tectonic convergent boundary can activate the faults such as the mdssf leading to observed changes within the seismic zones of the study region the distribution of hydrogen peroxide concentration ranges from 0 to 1 ppm in the premonsoon season further a region falling adjacent to the delhi mega fold having a distinct lineament along which the epicentre of a microtremor event was recorded on 13th april 2015 with a magnitude of 2 1 also shows high concentration of hydrogen peroxide within the samples collected on april 26th 2015 from the aquifers adjacent to the epicentre fig 13b the region close to the thermal spring water along the active sohna fault also shows comparatively higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide it is inferred that seismic stress build up and the seismic swarms in these zones correlate positively with the high hydrogen peroxide concentration the frequent microtremor activity leads to crustal deformation post stress build up intermittently when movement occurs along one or more faults and fractures resulting in fluctuations in the hydrogen peroxide concentration 6 conclusion the findings of this study support that reactive oxygen species potentially result from deformation of mineral defects from seismic stress and can be potential indicators of seismic activity however further research is required to validate these results continuous monitoring of hydrogen peroxide concentration within the geothermal field over extended periods of time should therefore be undertaken to monitor rock stress and the associated seismicity experienced in the form of microtremors or moderate to large magnitude earthquakes geothermal zones lying along active faults or deep hard rock aquifers can be explored in detail to infer premonitory earthquake signals by quantifying the relationship of seismicity derived from rock stress dependent on groundwater interactions by measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide within geothermal waters especially springs falling along active fault boundaries the estimation of seismic stress can possibly be achieved accurate and timely estimation of this indirect measure of seismic stress and crustal deformation would require continuous monitoring of groundwater chemical

5776,having a realistic estimation of snow cover by conceptual hydrological models continues to challenge hydrologists the calibration of the free model parameters is an unavoidable step and the uncertainties resulting from the use of this optimal set remains a source of concern especially in forecasting applications and climate changes impact assessments this study seeks to improve the calibration of the conceptual hydrological model gr4j coupled with the cemaneige snow model in order to obtain a more realistic simulation of the snow water equivalent swe and to reduce the uncertainty of the free parameters the performance of the two models was tested over twelve snow dominated basins in southern quebec canada four calibration strategies were adopted and compared in the first two strategies the parameters were calibrated against observed streamflow alone using a local and a global algorithm in the third and fourth strategies the calibration of snow and hydrological parameters was performed against observed streamflow and snow water equivalent swe measured at snow course transects first separately and then with a multiobjective approach an ensemble of equifinal parameters was used to compare the capacity of the global and multiobjective algorithms to improve the parameters identifiability and to assess the impact of parameter equifinality on the temperature sensitivity of spring peak streamflow the large number of equifinal parameters found during calibration underscores the importance of structural non identifiability of the coupled gr4j cemaneige model the inclusion of snow observations within a multiobjective calibration improved the simulation of swe the identifiability of the parameters and their correlation with basins characteristics parameter equifinality caused a small but non negligible uncertainty in the simulated response of spring peak flow to warming temperatures parameter equifinality should be considered in climate impact studies in snow dominated basins where poorly constrained snow parameters can affect the temperature sensitivity of streamflow keywords hydrological model calibration equifinality temperature sensitivity snowmelt gr4j spring floods 1 introduction in snow affected basins the accumulation of snow in winter and the rapid melting during the warm period is the main source of the high spring streamflow aygün et al 2019 in these regions a good estimate of the amount of snow present in a basin before melting is the starting point for successful flood forecasting koster et al 2010 li et al 2019 and essential to understand the interannual variability of the magnitude and timing of snowmelt and peak discharge mazouz et al 2012 the temporal and spatial coverage of snow survey observations is usually considered to be too sparse to reliably estimate basin scale snow conditions dong 2018 and swe estimates from passive and active microwave remote sensing data still suffer problems in forested areas and regions with thick snow cover as well as in steep mountain terrain brown 2010 dong 2018 larue et al 2017 therefore hydrological models of different complexities have been mainly used to simulate the accumulation and melting of snow in basins and to estimate streamflow for operational purposes turcotte et al 2010 skaugen et al 2018 several rainfall runoff models have shown great ability to simulate runoff but in snow dominated basins a good streamflow simulation does not always guarantee a good representation of snow processes udnæs et al 2007 grusson et al 2015 accurate simulations of both river discharge and snow cover are desirable if these models are to be used to reliably forecast springtime floods koster et al 2010 li et al 2019 as well as to project potential impacts of climate change on snow hydrology troin et al 2016 model calibration is a necessary step to estimate the free parameters in conceptual models and many questions persist on how the uncertainties in the calibrated parameters impact streamflow forecasts as well as model based climate change projections several optimization algorithms were developed during the last decades duan et al 1992 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 gupta et al 2003 gupta et al 2006 moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 arsenault et al 2014 which have largely improved miscalibration problems i e the failure of the search algorithm to localize the exact mathematical optimum however overcalibration problems persist i e the optimal model parameters derived in calibration do not remain optimum over different periods due to observational noise affecting calibration model structural errors and the lack of information to properly calibrate the model parameters andréassian et al 2012 the lack of information can be climatic i e when the calibration period is too short to capture the diversity of climate conditions and hydrological behaviours this can cause a dependence of the optimized parameter values on the climatic conditions of the calibration period and compromise the transposability of the calibrated parameters to different climate conditions arsenault et al 2018 blasone 2007 brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2012 coron et al 2014 merz et al 2011 perrin 2000 seiller et al 2012 vos et al 2010 however even without this climatic dependence parameter uncertainty arises from the ill posed nature of calibration the information content or number of degrees of freedom available for calibration is often too restricted to allow finding a single or unambiguous solution as situation which leads to equifinality i e several sets of calibrated parameters can give a similar model performance beven 2006 parameter uncertainty due to equifinality is exacerbated by observation errors increased model complexity number of parameters and parameter interdependence and can significantly impact the transposability of model parameters in time and space arsenault and brissette 2014 beven 2006 beven and freer 2001 foulon and rousseau 2018 climate change studies relying on lumped or semi distributed conceptual models to project future hydrological conditions can be adversely affected by parameter uncertainty induced by equifinality previous studies have ranked parameter uncertainty behind the uncertainties associated with the choice of gcm emission scenario downscaling and hydrological model structure when projecting streamflow under climate change scenarios bennett et al 2012 chen et al 2011 kay et al 2009 poulin et al 2011 seiller and anctil 2014 teng et al 2011 wilby 2005 wilby and harris 2006 however other studies have shown that parameter equifinality represents a non negligible source of uncertainty in hydrological modelling especially when variables other than daily streamflow are considered such as soil moisture and groundwater her et al 2016 and snow water equivalent swe foulon and rousseau 2018 and suggested that it should be evaluated when performing climate change impact assessments in this respect future streamflow projections in snowmelt dependent catchments have been shown to be particularly sensitive to equifinality ficklin and barnhart 2014 which could be due to the large sensitivity of snowmelt runoff to air temperature barnett et al 2005 aygün et al 2019 making the modelled streamflow particularly sensitive to the snow parameters within hydrological models parameter uncertainty due to equifinality can be partly mitigated by improving the information content during calibration while the most common practice remains to calibrate hydrological models on streamflow alone auxiliary data such as groundwater levels seibert and mcdonnell 2002 madsen 2003 water chemistry son and sivapalan 2007 or snow observations parajka and blöschl 2008 are increasingly used to better constrain the calibration process and reduce parameter equifinality such auxiliary data or internal catchment measurements can be calibrated separately and sequentially hay et al 2006 fenicia et al 2007 in a hierarchical manner ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 kelleher et al 2017 or simultaneously bergström et al 2002 fenicia et al 2007 stisen et al 2018 within a multiobjective or multivariable calibration strategy aiming to find an acceptable trade off between different modelling objectives efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 multiobjective calibration is typically carried out using evolutionary algorithms that search for acceptable trade offs between objective functions and leads to a set of pareto optimal solutions or pareto sets for which an objective function cannot be improved without degrading the other s yapo et al 1998 in the context of snow dominated basins the parameters of the snow models are most often calibrated simultaneously with the hydrological parameters against observed discharge without considering any information about snow conditions e g lévesque et al 2008 rahman et al 2013 troin et al 2015 2016 valéry et al 2014a valéry et al 2014b however several studies have already shown the usefulness of including snow observations in the calibration of different models within a multiobjective approach to improve the simulation of swe duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 parajka et al 2007 most of these studies relied on remote sensing snow observations with snow cover area sca estimated by satellite sensors such as modis and landsat being the metric most often used to calibrate and validate snowmelt models duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 riboust et al 2019 roy et al 2010 warscher et al 2013 while remote sensing data has undeniable advantages for capturing spatio temporal patterns in sca frequent cloud cover and extensive forest cover can confound snow detection with optical satellite sensors in situ snow survey data on the other hand have rarely been used to constrain the calibration of hydrological models in snow affected catchments due to their punctual nature these data are more difficult to use for model calibration and validation especially in basins with very heterogeneous snow conditions such as in alpine areas however in basins with more subdued topography and more homogenous snow cover even limited point snow observations could still be useful to constrain hydrological models that include a distributed or semi distributed snowpack representation sparse in situ snow and ice mass balance data have already proven useful to calibrate and validate hydrological models in glacierized catchments finger et al 2011 2015 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 hanzer et al 2016 both remote sensing and in situ snow observations are also increasingly being assimilated within meteorological and hydrological forecast systems helmert et al 2018 however few studies have exploited snow survey data to calibrate conceptual hydrological models within a multiobjective framework turcotte et al 2007 used observations for the snow survey network in the quebec province of canada to independently calibrate the snow module parameters of the hydrotel hydrological model whitaker et al 2003 used snow survey observation to independently calibrate snow parameters for the dhsvm model in british columbia canada grusson et al 2015 used in situ manual snow measurements to validate but not calibrate semi distributed swe simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat model in the pyrenees france more recently tuo et al 2018 have shown that including swe measurement within a multiobjective calibration approach with the semi distributed swat model improved snow simulations in the upper adige river basin in italia the overall objective of this study is to test whether a simple conceptual hydrological model is capable to adequately simulate streamflow as well as snow cover in snow dominated basins and to address how the calibration strategy impacts parameter equifinality and the simulated sensitivity of springtime flood characteristics to air temperature specifically this study aims to improve snowpack simulation with a parsimonious hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 coupled to the snow model cemaneige valéry 2010 by considering available snow survey observations during model calibration for twelve snow dominated basins in the canadian province of québec we investigate different calibration strategies by i comparing the respective performance of local global and multiobjective algorithms for the twelve basins ii comparing how the calibration strategy improves the parameters identifiability iii assessing how parameter equifinality affects the modelled streamflow sensitivity to air temperature i e the impacts of choosing either a mathematically optimal parameter set versus several equifinal sets on the temperature sensitivity of springtime flood magnitude and timing which are two streamflow metrics of key importance to understand and evaluate hydrological risks in southern québec mazouz et al 2012 2 data and methods 2 1 study site and data twelve tributary basins of the st lawrence river in quebec were selected in this study fig 1 the choice was based on the length of observed discharge data 20 years the natural character of the hydrological regime of the rivers and especially the availability of snow measurement points inside or close to the studied basin basin area ranges between 358 and 4505 km2 and the land cover is dominated by forests 26 100 of the surface followed by agriculture 0 74 table 1 the basins are located within four homogeneous hydrological regions namely i the st lawrence northwest region batiscan bras du nord matawin on the north shore and characterized by a continental climate ii the st lawrence southwest region nicolet l acadie characterized by a mixed maritime and continental climate iii the st lawrence southeast region york beaurivage bécancour famine etchemin ouelle characterized by a mix of maritime and continental climate and iv the st lawrence northeast godbout characterized by a maritime climate assani et al 2010a assani et al 2010b mazouz et al 2013 daily historical discharge data measured at the basin outlets were obtained from the quebec center of water expertise cehq www cehq gouv qc ca table 2 the cehq maintains a permanent network of hydrometric stations in the province of quebec and provides quality controlled discharge data the climatic data used in this study were extracted from the 0 1 0 1 daily climate grids developed by the atmospheric environment information service simat in collaboration with the cehq bergeron 2015 the total daily precipitation solid and liquid and the minimum and maximum daily temperature at each grid point are estimated by spatial interpolation kriging of quality controlled observations recorded at a network of stations managed by the quebec climate monitoring program programme de surveillance du climat du québec psc and by the national hydropower company hydro québec continuous data are available for the period 1961 2015 and the interpolated climate grids are considered to be of good quality in the southern part of quebec given the high density of stations in this region bergeron 2015 root mean squared interpolation errors were estimated by cross validation and reported to be 4 mm for daily precipitation and 2 c and 3 c for maximum and minimum temperature respectively bergeron 2015 the snow observations come from the permanent snow survey network maintained by the ministry of environment and fight against climate change melcc 2008 survey sites are located in forested areas where the depth and density of snow is measured every two weeks during the winter and spring seasons measurements follow a standard protocol melcc 2008 at each survey site observations are made at 10 fixed points uniformly distributed along a 300 m long transect representative of the surrounding landscape snow depth is measured by probing with a snow tube at eight locations surrounding the fixed points and the results averaged density is measured by weighing the snow tube sample taken at the center of the fixed point and the result is multiplied by the mean snow depth to estimate swe at the point finally the mean swe at the site is obtained by averaging the swe measured at the 10 points along the transect errors on site averaged swe are not reported but federal snow tubes are known to overestimate swe typically by 0 to 11 dixon and boon 2012 thus the maximum relative error for site averaged swe is taken to be 11 the historical measurements of 12 survey sites located in or very close to the selected basins were used in this study table 2 2 2 models the gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier hydrological conceptual model perrin et al 2003 and the cemaneige snow model valéry 2010 were chosen in this study to simulate the snow cover and hydrology of the basins hydrological processes in the gr4j model have been simplified into two interconnected reservoirs the production function which determines the amount of water in the basin is represented by a soil reservoir with a maximum capacity 1 mm which is the first of four parameters to be calibrated the transfer function which determines the transfer of water in the water basin is represented by a routing reservoir which receives the quantity released by the production function and calculates a discharge according to its level of filling and its maximum 1 day retention capacity 3 mm which is a free parameter edijatno 1991 added a function to simulate water transit time to the routing reservoir to improve the simulation of flood peaks in which 90 of the water released by the production store is routed by a unit hydrograph to the routing reservoir while the remaining 10 contributes directly to flow and is routed only by a unit hydrograph the base of the unit hydrograph 4 mm day 1 is a free parameter the model was previously found to give poor simulations in basins with ephemeral flow regimes for this reason nascimento 1995 added a groundwater exchange function to both the routing reservoir and direct flow component which improved runoff simulations this exchange coefficient 2 mm day 1 can be negative losses to deep aquifers or positive inflow from aquifers and represents the maximum quantity of water that can be added to or release from the model flow component when the routing store level is full i e when it equals 3 perrin et al 2003 the version of gr4j from perrin 2000 is used in this study developed by valéry 2010 the cemaneige module simulates snow accumulation and melt in the basin with one snow reservoir for each of five altitude bands and has two free parameters the two internal states of the snowpack simulated are the snow storage snow water equivalent and the thermal state the snow storage is initiated at zero and increases over time after adding the solid fraction of the precipitation ps frac which is calculated as a function of minimum tmin and maximum tmax daily temperature following leavesley and stannard 1995 ps frac is set to one when tmax 0 and to zero when tmin 0 mixed precipitation occurs for all other conditions with ps frac 1 tmax tmax tmin the thermal state of the snowpack c determines the onset of melting and is calculated by a weighting coefficient 5 dimensionless which is a free parameter of the model to be calibrated and varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 describes a maximum thermal inertia of the snow compared to air temperature after the calculation of the snow storage and its thermal state the model calculates the potential melt which represents the maximum amount of snow that can melt using the degree day method the degree day factor 6 mm c 1 controls the potential melt and is a free parameter to be calibrated six parameters must then be calibrated for the coupled gr4j cemaneige model table 3 summarizes the description of these parameters the parameter ranges are based on previous studies perrin 2000 while those for the cemaneige model were chosen based on the work of valéry 2010 2 3 calibration strategies the choice of optimization algorithm and objective functions used for calibration have a great influence on the identification of the parameters and their uncertainty in addition to the structure of the model and the quality of input data the objective of improving the snow cover simulation with the gr4j cemaneige model and the identifiability of the parameters led us to consider four calibration strategies in which three algorithms local global and multiobjective were used for the first two strategies the calibration of the six gr4j cemaneige model parameters was made simultaneously using the observed discharge only with respectively a local step by step approach strategy 1 local and the global automatic algorithm shuffled complex evolution sce ua duan et al 1992 algorithm strategy 2 sce flow the local step by step optimization algorithm was used for the development and improvement of the two models by researchers at cemagref france perrin 2000 the global sce ua algorithm has been found to be the most efficient calibration algorithm for models with reduced complexity and small parameter space as shown by arsenault et al 2014 after comparing ten stochastic optimization methods the swe simulated by these two strategies was then compared with the whole swe record available at the snow survey point in or closest to the selected basins for the elevation band closest to the elevation of the snow survey point c f table 2 in the third strategy sce indep the four hydrological model parameters and the two snow parameters were calibrated separately the two snow parameters were calibrated independently on the entire observed swe records and subsequently prescribed as fixed parameters in the coupled gr4j cemaneige model the four hydrological parameters were next calibrated with the observed discharge using the global sce ua algorithm in the fourth and final multiobjective strategy multi the six model parameters were calibrated simultaneously with the observed swe and discharge using the multiobjective optimization algorithm amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 an optimum parameter set was chosen by manually identifying the knee point of the pareto front which has the shortest euclidian distance to the ideal solution i e the origin of the multiobjective space corresponding to no errors in both swe and discharge e g dumedah et al 2010 this point represents a balanced optimum solution e g madsen 2003 giving the best compromise between swe and discharge the performance of this optimum set was then compared with that of the other calibration strategies see table 4 a split sample test calibration method klemes 1986 was used to separate the observation record into two periods of calibration validation of approximately equal length table 2 the nash sutcliffe 1970 efficiency criterion nse was used as the evaluation criterion and calculated from the observed and simulated discharge nseq and from the swe measured at surveys point and that simulated by the model for the corresponding elevation band nseswe 1 nse q 1 t 1 n qo t qs t 2 t 1 n qo t qo t 2 2 nse swe 1 t 1 n sweo t swes t 2 t 1 n sweo t sweo t 2 where qo and qs are the observed and simulated discharge sweo and swes the observed and simulated snow water equivalent t is time in days and n is the number of daily observations used nse 1 indicates a perfect correspondence between simulations and observations nse 0 indicates that the model simulations have the same explanatory power as the mean of the observations and nse 0 indicates that the model is a worse predictor than the mean of the observations the nse emphasizes high flows since it is based on squared errors e g krause et al 2005 hence model performance will tend be biased towards springtime snowmelt floods which was deemed to be a desirable property of the objective function since snowmelt floods represent the annual peak flow in most years and basins and are of prime interest in this study this high flow bias property of the nse has however recently been questioned mizukami et al 2019 and the nse also has other known deficiencies gupta et al 2009 however the nse has a more straightforward interpretation than other popular metrics such as the kling gupta efficiency kge knoben et al 2019 and is still considered to be a good overall objective function in hydrological model simulation mccuen et al 2006 2 4 parameters equifinality automatic model calibration in recent years has been mostly carried out using global optimisation algorithms on discharge alone moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 or multiobjective calibration efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 hence only the calibration methods sce flow and multi were used in this step to study parameter equifinality iterations made by the algorithms during calibration until convergence were saved more than 6000 per basin for the sce ua algorithm the parameter sets yielding a nseq value within 1 of the optimal nse value were considered equifinal similarly for the multiobjective algorithm amalgam all parameter sets around the optimal point of the pareto front yielding nseq and nseswe within 1 of the optimal nse criteria were retained 2 5 parameter sensitivity analysis the dynamic identifiability analysis dynia method developed by wagener et al 2003 was used to investigate the parameter identifiability this method identifies the 10 best performing parameter values using monte carlo sampling within a prior uniform parameter distribution with prescribed limits c f table 3 and the rmse as objective function the marginal probability distribution of the parameter is then calculated in a moving time window set to 30 days here and used as an indicator of the strength of the conditioning and hence of the identifiability of the parameter wagener et al 2003 time varying sensitivity analysis tvsa was used also to investigate the most influential model parameters at each time step of the simulation and the consistency of the parameter s role and its period of influence with the physical behavior of the basin pianosi and wagener 2016 reusser and zehe 2011 the computationally fast and efficient fourier amplitude sensitivity test method fast was used as sensitivity test reusser et al 2011 2 6 sensitivity of flood characteristics to air temperature while top down scenario based hydrological impact assessments are most used to project climate change impacts on hydrology simpler sensitivity based or scenario neutral approaches are also useful to explore the sensitivity of key hydrological variables to climate aygün et al 2019 prudhomme et al 2010 we tested how parameter equifinality and the choice of a single optimal parameter set versus several equifinal sets impact the temperature sensitivity of streamflow as quantified with the coupled gr4j cémaneige model we focus here on the sensitivity of the average springtime peak streamflow qmax and its timing qmax t to a 2 c increase in mean air temperature which represents a plausible yet optimistic estimate of mean annual warming in southern quebec by 2050 under a moderate emission scenario ouranos 2015 historical temperature records were perturbed with 2 c and the model run using the equifinal and optimal sets derived from the sce flow and multi methods c f section 2 4 the sensitivity measures used δqmax is the percent difference between the mean historical springtime peak flow qmax and that projected under the warming perturbation qmax 2 c the same approach was used for the peak flow timing δqmax t in days the objective is to investigate the agreement between the optimal and equifinal parameter sets as well as the impact of the calibration strategy on the direction and magnitude of change of snowmelt induced peak streamflow which is an important hydrological indicator in southern quebec 3 results 3 1 models performance boxplots in fig 2 show the model performance for the 12 studied basins and the four calibration methods for both the calibration and validation periods the model calibrated with the first strategy local shows a good performance on discharge with a median nseq value of 85 in calibration and 79 in validation but a comparatively poor performance in swe simulation with a median nseswe of 50 obtained on the independent swe observations and significant scatter among basins fig 2a the calibration results with the global algorithm sce flow also show good streamflow simulations with a median nseq value of 84 in calibration similar to the first method but with an improved performance in validation median nseq 82 compared to the local method fig 2b the swe simulation is still weak with the sce flow method with the median nseswe increasing only slightly to 51 fig 2b but with a distribution spread comparable to the first local method in the third strategy sce indep the two cemaneige parameters were calibrated separately against the observed swe which improved significantly the calibrated nseswe with a median value of 58 and a more constrained distribution fig 2c this significant improvement in the nseswe criterion is however accompanied by a degradation of the streamflow simulations with the median nseq decreasing to 80 in calibration and 76 in validation this means that the introduction of two fixed snow parameters in the gr4j cemaneige model led to an over adjustment on the swe and a degradation of streamflow fig 2c the multiobjective strategy in which the nseq and nseswe are simultaneously optimized improved the swe simulations compared to calibrating on streamflow alone the median nseswe was 53 in calibration and 69 in validation over the full period the median nseswe was 57 and 75 of the basins had a nseswe greater than 47 in calibration and greater than 58 in validation without significantly degrading streamflow simulations fig 2d the simulation of swe is hence significantly improved for the two methods sce indep and multi in which the snow observations are used in calibration fig 2c d but the method sce indep degrades the streamflow simulations the multi method gives swe simulations comparable to the indep sce method but without significantly degrading streamflow simulations i e yielding a performance similar to the local and sce flow methods the best swe simulations using the indep and multi methods which use swe records in calibration were obtained for the famine beaurivage ouelle bécancour and bras de nord basins with a nseswe criterion above 65 while the poorest simulation were obtained for the godbout matawin and etchemin basins the poor simulation in these basins may be due to the survey sites being less representative of the basin which is an obvious limitation of using point observations to constrain the snow model fig 3 shows an example of swe simulations for two of these basins while the four calibration strategies yield comparatively good swe simulations in the bécancour basin fig 3a all methods yield comparatively poorer results in the etchemin basin but the indep and multi methods significantly improve swe simulation compared to calibration on streamflow alone local sce flow fig 3b the gr4j cémaneige reproduces well the mean daily hydrograph of each basin fig 4 as shown in fig 2 the local global and multi methods give comparable streamflow performances and only the indep methods degrades streamflow simulations green curves on fig 4 the simulated streamflow most deviates from observations in basins with a larger agricultural land use such as bécancour nicolet etchemin and l acadie fig 4 in order to better understand the differences in model performance among basins nseq values were correlated with basin characteristics c f table 1 as well as with the length of the calibration period which can significantly impact model performance when using split sample calibration validation schemes arsenault et al 2018 the non parametric spearman correlation test was used due to the small sample size and heterogeneous data distributions correlation heatmaps show a strong r 0 78 and significant p 0 05 relationship between model performance nseq in calibration and the agricultural cover in the basin fig 5 a a similar albeit positive correlation is seen between the calibrated nseq and the forest cover the mean basin elevation and mean basin slope to a lesser extent forests and agricultural fields are the dominant land cover types in the basins and are inversely correlated r 0 96 p 0 05 while the forest cover mean elevation and slope are also colinear r 0 69 to 0 79 p 0 05 because basins with greater forest cover occur on the more rugged canadian shield or in the appalachian mountains c f fig 1 the correlations between nseq and forest cover agriculture and elevation persist during the validation period fig 5b the length of the calibration period has no visible impact on model performance in calibration or validation as seen by the low and insignificant correlation coefficients in fig 5a b there is also no drastic difference among calibration methods in the relationship between model performance basin characteristics and calibration record length the negative relationships between model performance and agricultural cover in the basin fig 5c b illustrates the difficulty of the model to adjust to the more dynamic and variable flow conditions typical of these basins which is as also visible on the mean hydrographs in fig 4 3 2 parameter variations among basins and calibration methods the distribution of optimal parameters obtained for the 12 basins is different between the calibration strategies except for the parameter 4 base of unit hydrograph and 2 water table exchange which are more similar fig 6 the choice of calibration method does not seem to have a clear impact on the distribution of parameters among basins the parameter 1 maximum capacity of the soil reservoir approaches its lower limit in some basins while 3 the 1 day routing reservoir capacity approaches its upper limit notably for the third method sce indep in which the cemaneige parameters are separately calibrated on swe observations the degree day factor 6 determining the potential snowmelt is higher and more dispersed than for the other methods meanwhile 5 weighting coefficient of the thermal state which determines the onset of melting is minimized compared to the other methods which shows that the indep method adapts to site specific snow conditions the optimal parameters obtained by each calibration strategy differ with each other within a given basin fig 7 this shows that different optimal sets give the best simulation for each calibration method over the same period the optimum parameters for the four calibration methods often lie within the distribution of the pareto sets obtained by the multi method but also deviate frequently notably for the local and indep methods green and blue dots on fig 7 the optimum parameter set for the multi method is also frequently different from the median value of the pareto set most often the optimum parameter value for the multi method lies between those of the local or sce flow methods in one extreme and those of the indep method on the other the two parameters 2 and 4 are the only ones for which similar values are obtained from the four different calibration strategies figs 6 and 7 the values of the optimal parameter sets were correlated with basins characteristics as well as with the parameter values from the nearest basin spearman correlation heatmaps show little relationships between parameters and basin characteristics for all methods fig 8 however a moderate to strong inverse correlation emerge between and 3 the 1 day routing reservoir capacity and the agricultural cover and positive correlations with forest cover slope and elevation which is interpreted to result from the collinearity between these variables a decreased 1 day routing reservoir capacity in more agricultural catchments is consistent with the faster routing of water occurring in the less impermeable agricultural basins which often have compacted clay soils limiting infiltration including swe observation in the calibration process methods indep and multi results in interesting correlations emerging such as i a positive correlation r 0 80 p 0 05 between water cover mainly lakes and the 2 parameter and a negative correlation between the drainage density and 2 r 0 66 p 0 05 for the multi method consistent with increased groundwater contributions to streamflow in basins with greater lake surfaces and poor drainage ii a positive correlation r 0 64 0 72 between 4 base of unit hydrograph and basin area consistent with an increased response time in larger basin 3 3 parameter equifinality and interaction equifinality was studied using the sce flow and multi two calibration methods c f section 2 4 the distributions of equifinal parameters obtained for the 12 basins are narrow but with many extreme values for the sce flow method while the distributions for the multiobjective method are more homogeneous fig 9 the number of equifinal sets found for the sce flow method is very high and variable between basins therefore in order to converge mathematically with a very small change in the nash value 1 the maximum capacity of the soil reservoir 1 can for example vary from 200 to 450 mm for basin 1 batiscan similar variability is seen for the other basins fig 9a the calibration with the multiobjective algorithm reduced the number of equifinal parameters sets as well as their dispersion fig 9b the range i e the difference between the maximum and minimum parameter value was significantly reduced when using the multi method but no significant reduction was found in the interquartile range of the parameter distributions compared to the sce flow method fig 10 in brief the multi method resulted in a reduced number of equifinal sets and more homogenous parameter distributions than for the sce flow method figs 9 and 10 compensation between parameters can promote parameter equifinality when the calibration information is limited beven 2006 a strong negative correlation is found between the two reservoir parameters 1 the maximum soil reservoir capacity and 3 the routing reservoir capacity with a median correlation value of 0 7 and a moderate correlation between the two transfer parameters 3 and 4 base time unit hydrograph with a median value of 0 5 fig 11 a positive correlation is also visible between 1 and 2 which regulate the amount of water available in the basin with a median value of 0 4 fig 11a these correlations show the compensation occurring between the parameters which makes it difficult to converge toward an optimal set during the optimization this parameter correlation was significantly reduced when using the multi method fig 11b 3 4 identifiability analysis of gr4j cemaneige parameters the identifiability of the gr4j and cemaneige parameters was investigated in more details using the dynia and tvsa methods the analysis was only performed for the bécancour basin id 2 for the sake of brevity the temporal identifiability of the six parameters of the gr4j cemaneige model found by the dynia method is shown in fig 12 in these graphs the color scale represents the frequency distribution of the parameters for the 10 best performing simulations using the root mean squared error rmse as objective function a parameter becomes more identifiable during periods when the frequency distribution is narrower for the parameter 1 low values are more frequent before and during floods while high values are more frequent after the floods fig 12a there is no clear part in this parameter space that is identifiable in the best performing simulations which indicates that different values of this parameter give similar results in combination with the other parameters parameter 2 is a multiplicative parameter that regulates the volume of water in the basin the more positive its value the largest is the contribution of groundwater to the basin while more negative values increase deep percolation losses fig 12b shows that negative values are more frequent during low flow periods indicating large water losses to deep aquifers simulated by the model conversely high positive values of 2 are more frequent during floods this means that to simulate the high flows the model increases the supply from the water table while for low flows the model increases the loss to the water table the high sensitivity of 2 implies that this parameter is most influential to adjust the water volume in the basin which explains the difficulty of finding sensitive values conditioned on streamflow for the production store 1 the parameter 3 one day capacity of the routing reservoir is barely identifiable high values are more frequent during and before floods and decreases after floods but the overall identifiability is unclear fig 12c the identifiability of the parameters 4 base time of the unit hydrograph and 5 thermal coefficient of state of the snowpack is low since very different values of these parameters give similar results in combination with the remaining parameters fig 12d e parameter 6 degree day factor is somewhat identifiable during the melt period with values between 5 and 7 mm c 1 giving the best simulation fig 12f time varying sensitivity analysis fig 13 shows that the parameter 2 is the most influential except during spring pre flood periods when the snow parameters 5 and 6 of the cemaneige model also become influential whereas they have no influence on the rest of the period this confirms that the model behavior is consistent with the physical behavior of the basin in the spring the parameter 3 is most influential during low flow periods the sensitivity of 1 3 and 4 is not clear compared with 2 which predominantly controls the overall water balance while the remaining variations are controlled by the remaining parameters 3 5 impact of equifinality on the temperature sensitivity of peak flow the final objective of this study was to assess how parameter equifinality and the choice of a single optimal vs equifinal parameter set impact the characterisation of streamflow sensitivity to temperature there is a general agreement between all equifinal and optimal sets that springtime peak flow decreases in response to a 2 c warming in air temperature as all simulations display negative δqmax values fig 14 a b the distribution of δqmax values for a given basin reflects the uncertainty in the sensitivity of peak flow to warming resulting from equifinality alone for all basins and using the calibration strategy sce flow the impact of a 2 c temperature warming on qmax can thus be detected using the optimal parameter set red dots on fig 14a with a 99 uncertainty interval varying between 0 15 basin 10 to 0 85 basin 7 which is a rather low uncertainty however the distributions of sensitivities are not normal and when all the parameter sets including the numerous outliers are considered the uncertainty on δqmax can be much greater as much as 3 δqmax 14 to 20 for basin 7 ouelle the difference in uncertainties between basins can be explained by the dispersion of the equifinal parameters displayed in fig 9a basins with more uncertain temperature sensitivities basins 1 3 4 7 8 9 11 and 12 have more dispersed equifinal parameter distributions than basins with better constrained temperature sensitivities basins 2 5 6 and 10 this seems to be particularly the case for the temperature sensitive 5 coefficient of thermal state for snow and 6 degree day factor coefficients which are more dispersed for basins with more uncertain temperature sensitivities fig 14a uncertainties on δqmax are reduced when using the multi method compared to sce flow fig 14b in addition δqmax changes significantly between the two methods in some basins e g basin 3 6 and 10 with for example the median δqmax changing from 18 for the sce flow method to 31 5 using the multi method in basin 3 the different sensitivities between the two calibration methods can also be explained by the dispersion of the optimum fig 7 and equifinal fig 9 parameter sets obtained from the two calibration methods of most importance is the degree day factor 6 controlling potential melt basins where the temperature sensitivity is higher lower using the multi method relative to sce flow also have higher lower degree day factors 6 for the multi method compared to sce flow in fig 7 the multiobjective calibration method finds a compromise between the degree day factors independently calibrated on swe observations sce indep green dots on fig 7f and those calibrated on streamflow sce flow red dots on fig 7f and both are often quite different leading to significantly different temperature sensitivities there is a general agreement except for basin 12 that springtime peak flow would occur earlier by 8 days on average and up to 12 days for basin 1 in response to a 2 c temperature warming fig 14c d as for peak flow magnitude the uncertainty in the temperature sensitivity δqmaxt is decreased for the multi method compared to sce flow method differences in sensitivities between the two methods are less pronounced than for the magnitude but appear to result from the same aforementioned differences in parameter dispersions for basin 12 l acadie which is the southernmost basin studied fig 1 the change in peak flow timing detected using the optimal parameter set is positive using both calibration methods but the uncertainty due to equifinality when considering outliers is such that the direction of change in timing cannot be reliably detected for this basin for both sensitivity metrics δqmax and δqmax t the sensitivities derived with the optimum parameters sets red dots in fig 14 from both methods are often but not always close to the median of the distribution of equifinal sets differences in peak flow sensitivities among basins can be primarily related to differences in snowmelt rates calculated by cemaneige and to changing snowfall to total precipitation ratios with further modulations by water routing within the gr4j model the snowfall ratio decreases from an average std of 0 38 0 04 in the historical period to 0 33 0 04 for a 2 c temperature warming fig 14e f the southernmost l acadie basin id 12 has a markedly lower snowfall ratio differences in peak flow sensitivities δqmax among basins were found to be significantly correlated only with the degree day snowmelt parameter optimum 6 values for both the sce flow r 0 61 p 0 03 and multi r 0 84 p 0 01 methods while changes in snowfall amounts had no influence sce flow r 0 23 p 0 48 multi r 0 12 p 0 72 as for the differences in timing sensitivities δqmaxt a stronger correlation was found with changes in snowfall for sce flow r 0 77 p 0 01 than for the multi method r 0 52 p 0 08 hence inter basin differences in simulated peakflow sensitivity to warming are more strongly related to snowmelt rates parameterized by the 6 coefficient while the sensitivity of peakflow timing is more related to changing snowfall rates using the multi methods increased the dependence of δqmax on 6 compared to sce flow and decreased the dependence of δqmaxt on snowfall changes relative to sce flow method the ratio of rain on snow ros to total annual rainfall is 0 08 0 02 under present climate and decreases slightly to 0 06 0 02 under warmer temperatures fig 14e f ros processes are not explicitly represented in the gr4j cémaneige model and as such represent an unquantified source of uncertainty in the simulated response of peak flow to warming 4 discussion and conclusions 4 1 model performance this study introduced the use of snow survey observations to improve the calibration of the conceptual models gr4j and cemaneige while avoiding the difficulties related to snow cover satellites products in forested catchments four calibration strategies were tested with respect to streamflow and swe using local global and multi objective algorithms overall the calibration against observed streamflow in the first two methods yielded good streamflow simulations but poor simulations of swe the global algorithm sce ua yielded better streamflow simulations in validation than the local algorithm confirming previously reported results about the ability of this algorithm to find global optimal parameters unlike the local algorithms that depend on initial sets efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 despite this ability of the sce ua algorithm to find the global optima its performance in simulating swe was very similar to the local algorithm on the other hand the separate calibration of snow parameters on swe observations in the third method indep resulted in the best swe simulations among the four methods but a degradation of streamflow simulations compared to the first two methods while not drastic the degradation of streamflow simulations is still significant and likely caused by an over adjustment of the snow parameters on swe observations the multiobjective calibration against both observed streamflow and swe using the amalgam algorithm yielded swe simulations comparable to the indep method with only a small degradation of streamflow simulations compared to calibration on streamflow alone troin et al 2015 also used the same third strategy calibration against streamflow with the sce ua algorithm to test different combinations of seven snow models and three hydrological models including gr4j cemaneige in the mistassibi basin quebec and used four swe survey points to validate the simulated swe they found a good simulation of streamflow as well as a good performance for swe simulations with all model combinations including gr4j cemaneige nse 79 this disagreement with our results can be explained by the results shown in fig 2 while good swe simulations are found with this strategy for some basins overall this method does not give a good simulation of swe for the twelve basins compared with the independent and multiobjective calibration approaches these results underscore the importance of assessing general model performance on several basins overall the results of this study show that the additional information provided by the snow survey points improved the simulation of swe without significantly degrading streamflow simulations with the coupled gr4j cémaneige model while this type of snow data has been used before to validate swe simulated by conceptual hydrological models e g grusson et al 2015 troin et al 2015 they have only rarely been exploited for model calibration turcotte et al 2007 independently calibrated the snow module of the hydrotel model on swe observations in southern quebec the melting degree day factor was found to vary between 4 4 and 9 9 mm c 1 day 1 but due to the difficulty in interpolating this parameter spatially they calibrated a global coefficient 6 4 mm c 1 day 1 to be used in operational streamflow forecasts turcotte et al 2010 whitaker et al 2003 used a stepwise approach in calibrating the dhsvm model in which snow accumulation and melt parameters for clear cut and forested areas were optimized on snow course data independently of the runoff production parameters while these two studies used independent calibration of snow model parameters on swe they did not assess the impact of the calibration procedure on resulting streamflow simulations to our knowledge only the recent study by tuo et al 2018 assessed the difference between streamflow only calibration and multiobjective calibration in terms of their performance on both streamflow and swe simulations they calibrated the swat model on streamflow in the upper adige alpine basin italian alps and found generally poor swe simulations while multiobjective calibration greatly improved swe simulations and slightly improved streamflow simulations in the context of glacierized basins finger et al 2015 also showed that calibration against streamflow alone led to unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates our results are in good agreement with those of tuo et al 2018 but in our case the streamflow simulations were slightly degraded compared to calibration on streamflow alone while swe simulations improved contrary to tuo et al 2018 who used snow depth measured at 44 stations within the entire adige basin and converted to swe using a density parameterisation we used a more reliable yet sparser set of swe information based on a single snow course transect per basin as such our results show that sparse swe observations from permanent snow courses represent a useful internal catchment data source for model calibration in in non mountainous terrain on the other hand several previous studies have already shown the effectiveness of using remotely sensed snow cover data in several regions of the world for the calibration of hydrological models using a multiobjective approach duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 parajka et al 2007 roy et al 2010 of special interest is the recent study by riboust et al 2019 who used snow cover area sca from modis satellites in the calibration of the gr4j cemaneige model joint calibration of both discharge and sca improved the performances of sca simulations without degrading river runoff compared to calibration on discharge alone and the calibrated parameters where found to be more robust for simulating independent periods conversely calibrating the cemaneige model on sca alone gave mixed results on discharge their results while based on a different type of internal snow measurements are consistent with our findings based on snow survey data given the difficulties to derive swe and sca in regions with deep snowpacks dense forests and frequent clouds such as southern quebec bergeron et al 2014 brown 2010 sena et al 2016 our results show that including snow survey observations represents an alternative to improve the calibration of conceptual models in snow dominated basins this approach is however dependent on the level of spatial representativity of the snow survey data in regions with smooth topography like southern quebec snow conditions within a given basin are likely to vary primarily due to the land cover which alternates mostly between forested and open agricultural fields c f table 1 since snow courses are located in forests calibrating snow parameters on swe records in basins with mixed forests and agricultural fields could bias the snow simulations towards forest conditions we further explore this point in fig 15 where the change in performance of both streamflow and swe simulations nse for the indep and multi methods are calculated relative to global calibration on streamflow alone sce flow for completely forested catchments the gain in nseswe is comparable for both methods 0 20 fig 15a while the degradation in nseq is overall smaller for the multi method than for the indep method fig 15b a general increase in swe performance for both the indep and multi methods relative to sce flow is seen in response to an increasing agriculture faction in the basin fig 15a the larger gain in nseswe in agricultural catchments is due to the poorer performance of the sce flow method for swe as the snow parameters calibrated with this method may better reflect the mixed forest agricultural snow conditions in the catchment for streamflow there is no clear tendency but basins with a larger agricultural cover tend to have more degraded streamflow simulations for the indep method meanwhile no such trend is seen for the multi method for which the degradation of nseq is similar in range to that of the forested basins fig 15b hence calibrating snow parameters independently on swe records in basins with a mixed forest and agricultural landscape could indeed bias the parameters toward forest conditions and explain the more severe degradation in streamflow simulations however the multiobjective calibration seems to mostly alleviate this problem fig 15b and may as such represent the best way to use snow survey data in model calibration 4 2 equifinality and model structure uncertainty in this study we considered as equifinal parameters the iterations during the optimization by the sce ua and amalgam algorithms that gave the same optimal nash criteria within a small 1 difference the large number of equifinal sets and their dispersion for a 1 change in the objective function nse reveals the difficulty of the algorithm to converge toward a single clear optimum for the sce ua algorithm the maximum soil reservoir capacity 1 was found to be positively correlated with the exchange coefficient 2 and negatively correlated with the maximum capacity of the routing reservoir 3 fig 11 therefore these three parameters can play the same role to adjust the water balance in the basin as a given amount of water can be stored in the soil reservoir routing reservoir or infiltrated to the water table by the parameter 2 based on a sensitivity analysis lay 2006 found that the gr4j model is respectively more sensitive to the soil reservoir capacity 1 followed by the parameter of the unit hydrograph 4 the ground water exchange parameter 2 and the routing reservoir capacity 3 perrin 2000 previously reported a significant correlation between 2 and 1 and between 3 and 1 using multi calibration on several subsets for a large sample of 429 basins in france usa australia and brazil he explained this multiplicity of parameters by their dependence on the climatic conditions of the calibration period as already proposed by several other authors coron et al 2014 merz et al 2011 seiller et al 2012 vos et al 2010 the low identifiability of model parameters appears when parameters compensate each other analysis with the dynia method fig 12 confirms these results and shows that a clear range of identifiable parameter values is rarely found for all parameters except the surface groundwater exchange coefficient 2 as suggested by perrin 2000 the exchange parameter 2 can predominate over the soil reservoir 1 to adjust the basin water balance in the context of snow dominated basins among the two snow parameters 5 6 only the melt coefficient 6 was found to be somewhat identifiable and sensitive during the snowmelt period figs 12 13 highlighting once more the importance to constrain this parameter with internal snow observations the low identifiability and large compensation between the gr4j equifinal parameters demonstrated in this study may be at the origin of equifinality rather than the objective function or input data as proposed by others gupta and nearing 2014 kavetski and clark 2011 wagener and gupta 2005 in particular shin et al 2015 used several screening methods to check the identifiability of conceptual rainfall runoff models including the gr4j model and demonstrated that the main reason for parameters non identifiability is not the input data nor the objective function but rather the model structure they recommended fixing the parameters for which the model is more sensitive or adding new information such as snow or groundwater within a multiobjective approach to reduce the non uniqueness of parameters and improve their identifiability several studies have discussed the importance of multiobjective calibration strategies in order to constrain feasible parameters reduce equifinality and improve the parameter identifiability gupta et al 1998 tang et al 2006 wagener and gupta 2005 wagener et al 2003 among these her and seong 2018 used the amalgam algorithm and objective functions calculated on several streamflow criteria but without adding additional information and demonstrated that equifinality and uncertainty decrease when the number of objective functions considered increases this is consistent with our results which show that adding observed swe survey points to the amalgam algorithm reduced the number dispersion and correlation of equifinal sets figs 9 11 finally while only the 3 parameter 1 day capacity of the routing reservoir was found to correlate well with basins characteristics the inclusion of snow data in the calibration especially within using the multiobjective method allowed other correlations to emerge namely between 2 and the drainage density and surface water fraction in the basin as well as between 4 and basin area fig 8 as such adding snow survey data into the calibration helped to better constrain model parameters and their relations with basins characteristics suggesting future avenues for parameter regionalization based on a larger sample of basins interestingly no correlations were found between the parameters of a basin and those of its nearest neighbour contrary to the findings of oudin et al 2008 who found that regionalization based on spatial proximity was the best approach for a sample of 913 french basins 4 3 impacts of equifinality on peak flow response to warming temperatures the use of hydrological models under conditions different from those of the calibration period as in climate change impact assessment or for seasonal flood forecasting has always been confronted by problems of parameter uncertainty non stability and multiplicity in this study we evaluated the uncertainty that can result from using a single best numerical optimal solution rather than a set of equifinal parameters to quantify the temperature sensitivity of spring peak flow in snow dominated basins in several previous studies parameter uncertainty ranked last in order of importance in a climate change context bennett et al 2012 kay et al 2009 seiller and anctil 2014 teng et al 2011 wilby 2005 wilby and harris 2006 in this study changes in peak flow magnitude simulated by the gr4j cémaneige model in response to a 2 c perturbed temperature varied between 12 to 32 for the 12 studied basins and the maximum uncertainty due to equifinality was 3 while uncertainties were overall small they are not negligible and could affect climate change impacts assessments based on transient climate change scenarios more important perhaps is the significant difference in temperature sensitivity found between the sce flow and multi calibration methods in some basins fig 14 since the change in snowfall ratio in response to warming is the same for the two methods fig 14e f the difference in sensitivity between the two calibration methods is a direct outcome of the uncertainty on the snow parameters 5 and 6 this further emphasizes the need to better constrain snow parameters in conceptual models in order to project future hydrological behaviour under climate change in temperature sensitive snow dominated basins based on our results the use of conceptual models calibrated on observed streamflow alone and forced with climatic scenarios for the assessment of climate change impacts on snow cover and spring flow is not recommended credit authorship contribution

5776,having a realistic estimation of snow cover by conceptual hydrological models continues to challenge hydrologists the calibration of the free model parameters is an unavoidable step and the uncertainties resulting from the use of this optimal set remains a source of concern especially in forecasting applications and climate changes impact assessments this study seeks to improve the calibration of the conceptual hydrological model gr4j coupled with the cemaneige snow model in order to obtain a more realistic simulation of the snow water equivalent swe and to reduce the uncertainty of the free parameters the performance of the two models was tested over twelve snow dominated basins in southern quebec canada four calibration strategies were adopted and compared in the first two strategies the parameters were calibrated against observed streamflow alone using a local and a global algorithm in the third and fourth strategies the calibration of snow and hydrological parameters was performed against observed streamflow and snow water equivalent swe measured at snow course transects first separately and then with a multiobjective approach an ensemble of equifinal parameters was used to compare the capacity of the global and multiobjective algorithms to improve the parameters identifiability and to assess the impact of parameter equifinality on the temperature sensitivity of spring peak streamflow the large number of equifinal parameters found during calibration underscores the importance of structural non identifiability of the coupled gr4j cemaneige model the inclusion of snow observations within a multiobjective calibration improved the simulation of swe the identifiability of the parameters and their correlation with basins characteristics parameter equifinality caused a small but non negligible uncertainty in the simulated response of spring peak flow to warming temperatures parameter equifinality should be considered in climate impact studies in snow dominated basins where poorly constrained snow parameters can affect the temperature sensitivity of streamflow keywords hydrological model calibration equifinality temperature sensitivity snowmelt gr4j spring floods 1 introduction in snow affected basins the accumulation of snow in winter and the rapid melting during the warm period is the main source of the high spring streamflow aygün et al 2019 in these regions a good estimate of the amount of snow present in a basin before melting is the starting point for successful flood forecasting koster et al 2010 li et al 2019 and essential to understand the interannual variability of the magnitude and timing of snowmelt and peak discharge mazouz et al 2012 the temporal and spatial coverage of snow survey observations is usually considered to be too sparse to reliably estimate basin scale snow conditions dong 2018 and swe estimates from passive and active microwave remote sensing data still suffer problems in forested areas and regions with thick snow cover as well as in steep mountain terrain brown 2010 dong 2018 larue et al 2017 therefore hydrological models of different complexities have been mainly used to simulate the accumulation and melting of snow in basins and to estimate streamflow for operational purposes turcotte et al 2010 skaugen et al 2018 several rainfall runoff models have shown great ability to simulate runoff but in snow dominated basins a good streamflow simulation does not always guarantee a good representation of snow processes udnæs et al 2007 grusson et al 2015 accurate simulations of both river discharge and snow cover are desirable if these models are to be used to reliably forecast springtime floods koster et al 2010 li et al 2019 as well as to project potential impacts of climate change on snow hydrology troin et al 2016 model calibration is a necessary step to estimate the free parameters in conceptual models and many questions persist on how the uncertainties in the calibrated parameters impact streamflow forecasts as well as model based climate change projections several optimization algorithms were developed during the last decades duan et al 1992 efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 gupta et al 2003 gupta et al 2006 moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 arsenault et al 2014 which have largely improved miscalibration problems i e the failure of the search algorithm to localize the exact mathematical optimum however overcalibration problems persist i e the optimal model parameters derived in calibration do not remain optimum over different periods due to observational noise affecting calibration model structural errors and the lack of information to properly calibrate the model parameters andréassian et al 2012 the lack of information can be climatic i e when the calibration period is too short to capture the diversity of climate conditions and hydrological behaviours this can cause a dependence of the optimized parameter values on the climatic conditions of the calibration period and compromise the transposability of the calibrated parameters to different climate conditions arsenault et al 2018 blasone 2007 brigode et al 2013 coron et al 2012 coron et al 2014 merz et al 2011 perrin 2000 seiller et al 2012 vos et al 2010 however even without this climatic dependence parameter uncertainty arises from the ill posed nature of calibration the information content or number of degrees of freedom available for calibration is often too restricted to allow finding a single or unambiguous solution as situation which leads to equifinality i e several sets of calibrated parameters can give a similar model performance beven 2006 parameter uncertainty due to equifinality is exacerbated by observation errors increased model complexity number of parameters and parameter interdependence and can significantly impact the transposability of model parameters in time and space arsenault and brissette 2014 beven 2006 beven and freer 2001 foulon and rousseau 2018 climate change studies relying on lumped or semi distributed conceptual models to project future hydrological conditions can be adversely affected by parameter uncertainty induced by equifinality previous studies have ranked parameter uncertainty behind the uncertainties associated with the choice of gcm emission scenario downscaling and hydrological model structure when projecting streamflow under climate change scenarios bennett et al 2012 chen et al 2011 kay et al 2009 poulin et al 2011 seiller and anctil 2014 teng et al 2011 wilby 2005 wilby and harris 2006 however other studies have shown that parameter equifinality represents a non negligible source of uncertainty in hydrological modelling especially when variables other than daily streamflow are considered such as soil moisture and groundwater her et al 2016 and snow water equivalent swe foulon and rousseau 2018 and suggested that it should be evaluated when performing climate change impact assessments in this respect future streamflow projections in snowmelt dependent catchments have been shown to be particularly sensitive to equifinality ficklin and barnhart 2014 which could be due to the large sensitivity of snowmelt runoff to air temperature barnett et al 2005 aygün et al 2019 making the modelled streamflow particularly sensitive to the snow parameters within hydrological models parameter uncertainty due to equifinality can be partly mitigated by improving the information content during calibration while the most common practice remains to calibrate hydrological models on streamflow alone auxiliary data such as groundwater levels seibert and mcdonnell 2002 madsen 2003 water chemistry son and sivapalan 2007 or snow observations parajka and blöschl 2008 are increasingly used to better constrain the calibration process and reduce parameter equifinality such auxiliary data or internal catchment measurements can be calibrated separately and sequentially hay et al 2006 fenicia et al 2007 in a hierarchical manner ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 kelleher et al 2017 or simultaneously bergström et al 2002 fenicia et al 2007 stisen et al 2018 within a multiobjective or multivariable calibration strategy aiming to find an acceptable trade off between different modelling objectives efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 multiobjective calibration is typically carried out using evolutionary algorithms that search for acceptable trade offs between objective functions and leads to a set of pareto optimal solutions or pareto sets for which an objective function cannot be improved without degrading the other s yapo et al 1998 in the context of snow dominated basins the parameters of the snow models are most often calibrated simultaneously with the hydrological parameters against observed discharge without considering any information about snow conditions e g lévesque et al 2008 rahman et al 2013 troin et al 2015 2016 valéry et al 2014a valéry et al 2014b however several studies have already shown the usefulness of including snow observations in the calibration of different models within a multiobjective approach to improve the simulation of swe duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 parajka et al 2007 most of these studies relied on remote sensing snow observations with snow cover area sca estimated by satellite sensors such as modis and landsat being the metric most often used to calibrate and validate snowmelt models duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 riboust et al 2019 roy et al 2010 warscher et al 2013 while remote sensing data has undeniable advantages for capturing spatio temporal patterns in sca frequent cloud cover and extensive forest cover can confound snow detection with optical satellite sensors in situ snow survey data on the other hand have rarely been used to constrain the calibration of hydrological models in snow affected catchments due to their punctual nature these data are more difficult to use for model calibration and validation especially in basins with very heterogeneous snow conditions such as in alpine areas however in basins with more subdued topography and more homogenous snow cover even limited point snow observations could still be useful to constrain hydrological models that include a distributed or semi distributed snowpack representation sparse in situ snow and ice mass balance data have already proven useful to calibrate and validate hydrological models in glacierized catchments finger et al 2011 2015 ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 hanzer et al 2016 both remote sensing and in situ snow observations are also increasingly being assimilated within meteorological and hydrological forecast systems helmert et al 2018 however few studies have exploited snow survey data to calibrate conceptual hydrological models within a multiobjective framework turcotte et al 2007 used observations for the snow survey network in the quebec province of canada to independently calibrate the snow module parameters of the hydrotel hydrological model whitaker et al 2003 used snow survey observation to independently calibrate snow parameters for the dhsvm model in british columbia canada grusson et al 2015 used in situ manual snow measurements to validate but not calibrate semi distributed swe simulated by the soil and water assessment tool swat model in the pyrenees france more recently tuo et al 2018 have shown that including swe measurement within a multiobjective calibration approach with the semi distributed swat model improved snow simulations in the upper adige river basin in italia the overall objective of this study is to test whether a simple conceptual hydrological model is capable to adequately simulate streamflow as well as snow cover in snow dominated basins and to address how the calibration strategy impacts parameter equifinality and the simulated sensitivity of springtime flood characteristics to air temperature specifically this study aims to improve snowpack simulation with a parsimonious hydrological model gr4j perrin et al 2003 coupled to the snow model cemaneige valéry 2010 by considering available snow survey observations during model calibration for twelve snow dominated basins in the canadian province of québec we investigate different calibration strategies by i comparing the respective performance of local global and multiobjective algorithms for the twelve basins ii comparing how the calibration strategy improves the parameters identifiability iii assessing how parameter equifinality affects the modelled streamflow sensitivity to air temperature i e the impacts of choosing either a mathematically optimal parameter set versus several equifinal sets on the temperature sensitivity of springtime flood magnitude and timing which are two streamflow metrics of key importance to understand and evaluate hydrological risks in southern québec mazouz et al 2012 2 data and methods 2 1 study site and data twelve tributary basins of the st lawrence river in quebec were selected in this study fig 1 the choice was based on the length of observed discharge data 20 years the natural character of the hydrological regime of the rivers and especially the availability of snow measurement points inside or close to the studied basin basin area ranges between 358 and 4505 km2 and the land cover is dominated by forests 26 100 of the surface followed by agriculture 0 74 table 1 the basins are located within four homogeneous hydrological regions namely i the st lawrence northwest region batiscan bras du nord matawin on the north shore and characterized by a continental climate ii the st lawrence southwest region nicolet l

continental climate and iv the st lawrence northeast godbout characterized by a maritime climate assani et al 2010a assani et al 2010b mazouz et al 2013 daily historical discharge data measured at the basin outlets were obtained from the quebec center of water expertise cehq www cehq gouv qc ca table 2 the cehq maintains a permanent network of hydrometric stations in the province of quebec and provides quality controlled discharge data the climatic data used in this study were extracted from the 0 1 0 1 daily climate grids developed by the atmospheric environment information service simat in collaboration with the cehq bergeron 2015 the total daily precipitation solid and liquid and the minimum and maximum daily temperature at each grid point are estimated by spatial interpolation kriging of quality controlled observations recorded at a network of stations managed by the quebec climate monitoring program programme de surveillance du climat du québec psc and by the national hydropower company hydro québec continuous data are available for the period 1961 2015 and the interpolated climate grids are considered to be of good quality in the southern part of quebec given the high density of stations in this region bergeron 2015 root mean squared interpolation errors were estimated by cross validation and reported to be 4 mm for daily precipitation and 2 c and 3 c for maximum and minimum temperature respectively bergeron 2015 the snow observations come from the permanent snow survey network maintained by the ministry of environment and fight against climate change melcc 2008 survey sites are located in forested areas where the depth and density of snow is measured every two weeks during the winter and spring seasons measurements follow a standard protocol melcc 2008 at each survey site observations are made at 10 fixed points uniformly distributed along a 300 m long transect representative of the surrounding landscape snow depth is measured by probing with a snow tube at eight locations surrounding the fixed points and the results averaged density is measured by weighing the snow tube sample taken at the center of the fixed point and the result is multiplied by the mean snow depth to estimate swe at the point finally the mean swe at the site is obtained by averaging the swe measured at the 10 points along the transect errors on site averaged swe are not reported but federal snow tubes are known to overestimate swe typically by 0 to 11 dixon and boon 2012 thus the maximum relative error for site averaged swe is taken to be 11 the historical measurements of 12 survey sites located in or very close to the selected basins were used in this study table 2 2 2 models the gr4j modèle du génie rural à 4 paramètres journalier hydrological conceptual model perrin et al 2003 and the cemaneige snow model valéry 2010 were chosen in this study to simulate the snow cover and hydrology of the basins hydrological processes in the gr4j model have been simplified into two interconnected reservoirs the production function which determines the amount of water in the basin is represented by a soil reservoir with a maximum capacity 1 mm which is the first of four parameters to be calibrated the transfer function which determines the transfer of water in the water basin is represented by a routing reservoir which receives the quantity released by the production function and calculates a discharge according to its level of filling and its maximum 1 day retention capacity 3 mm which is a free parameter edijatno 1991 added a function to simulate water transit time to the routing reservoir to improve the simulation of flood peaks in which 90 of the water released by the production store is routed by a unit hydrograph to the routing reservoir while the remaining 10 contributes directly to flow and is routed only by a unit hydrograph the base of the unit hydrograph 4 mm day 1 is a free parameter the model was previously found to give poor simulations in basins with ephemeral flow regimes for this reason nascimento 1995 added a groundwater exchange function to both the routing reservoir and direct flow component which improved runoff simulations this exchange coefficient 2 mm day 1 can be negative losses to deep aquifers or positive inflow from aquifers and represents the maximum quantity of water that can be added to or release from the model flow component when the routing store level is full i e when it equals 3 perrin et al 2003 the version of gr4j from perrin 2000 is used in this study developed by valéry 2010 the cemaneige module simulates snow accumulation and melt in the basin with one snow reservoir for each of five altitude bands and has two free parameters the two internal states of the snowpack simulated are the snow storage snow water equivalent and the thermal state the snow storage is initiated at zero and increases over time after adding the solid fraction of the precipitation ps frac which is calculated as a function of minimum tmin and maximum tmax daily temperature following leavesley and stannard 1995 ps frac is set to one when tmax 0 and to zero when tmin 0 mixed precipitation occurs for all other conditions with ps frac 1 tmax tmax tmin the thermal state of the snowpack c determines the onset of melting and is calculated by a weighting coefficient 5 dimensionless which is a free parameter of the model to be calibrated and varies between 0 and 1 a value of 1 describes a maximum thermal inertia of the snow compared to air temperature after the calculation of the snow storage and its thermal state the model calculates the potential melt which represents the maximum amount of snow that can melt using the degree day method the degree day factor 6 mm c 1 controls the potential melt and is a free parameter to be calibrated six parameters must then be calibrated for the coupled gr4j cemaneige model table 3 summarizes the description of these parameters the parameter ranges are based on previous studies perrin 2000 while those for the cemaneige model were chosen based on the work of valéry 2010 2 3 calibration strategies the choice of optimization algorithm and objective functions used for calibration have a great influence on the identification of the parameters and their uncertainty in addition to the structure of the model and the quality of input data the objective of improving the snow cover simulation with the gr4j cemaneige model and the identifiability of the parameters led us to consider four calibration strategies in which three algorithms local global and multiobjective were used for the first two strategies the calibration of the six gr4j cemaneige model parameters was made simultaneously using the observed discharge only with respectively a local step by step approach strategy 1 local and the global automatic algorithm shuffled complex evolution sce ua duan et al 1992 algorithm strategy 2 sce flow the local step by step optimization algorithm was used for the development and improvement of the two models by researchers at cemagref france perrin 2000 the global sce ua algorithm has been found to be the most efficient calibration algorithm for models with reduced complexity and small parameter space as shown by arsenault et al 2014 after comparing ten stochastic optimization methods the swe simulated by these two strategies was then compared with the whole swe record available at the snow survey point in or closest to the selected basins for the elevation band closest to the elevation of the snow survey point c f table 2 in the third strategy sce indep the four hydrological model parameters and the two snow parameters were calibrated separately the two snow parameters were calibrated independently on the entire observed swe records and subsequently prescribed as fixed parameters in the coupled gr4j cemaneige model the four hydrological parameters were next calibrated with the observed discharge using the global sce ua algorithm in the fourth and final multiobjective strategy multi the six model parameters were calibrated simultaneously with the observed swe and discharge using the multiobjective optimization algorithm amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 an optimum parameter set was chosen by manually identifying the knee point of the pareto front which has the shortest euclidian distance to the ideal solution i e the origin of the multiobjective space corresponding to no errors in both swe and discharge e g dumedah et al 2010 this point represents a balanced optimum solution e g madsen 2003 giving the best compromise between swe and discharge the performance of this optimum set was then compared with that of the other calibration strategies see table 4 a split sample test calibration method klemes 1986 was used to separate the observation record into two periods of calibration validation of approximately equal length table 2 the nash sutcliffe 1970 efficiency criterion nse was used as the evaluation criterion and calculated from the observed and simulated discharge nseq and from the swe measured at surveys point and that simulated by the model for the corresponding elevation band nseswe 1 nse q 1 t 1 n qo t qs t 2 t 1 n qo t qo t 2 2 nse swe 1 t 1 n sweo t swes t 2 t 1 n sweo t sweo t 2 where qo and qs are the observed and simulated discharge sweo and swes the observed and simulated snow water equivalent t is time in days and n is the number of daily observations used nse 1 indicates a perfect correspondence between simulations and observations nse 0 indicates that the model simulations have the same explanatory power as the mean of the observations and nse 0 indicates that the model is a worse predictor than the mean of the observations the nse emphasizes high flows since it is based on squared errors e g krause et al 2005 hence model performance will tend be biased towards springtime snowmelt floods which was deemed to be a desirable property of the objective function since snowmelt floods represent the annual peak flow in most years and basins and are of prime interest in this study this high flow bias property of the nse has however recently been questioned mizukami et al 2019 and the nse also has other known deficiencies gupta et al 2009 however the nse has a more straightforward interpretation than other popular metrics such as the kling gupta efficiency kge knoben et al 2019 and is still considered to be a good overall objective function in hydrological model simulation mccuen et al 2006 2 4 parameters equifinality automatic model calibration in recent years has been mostly carried out using global optimisation algorithms on discharge alone moradkhani and sorooshian 2009 or multiobjective calibration efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 hence only the calibration methods sce flow and multi were used in this step to study parameter equifinality iterations made by the algorithms during calibration until convergence were saved more than 6000 per basin for the sce ua algorithm the parameter sets yielding a nseq value within 1 of the optimal nse value were considered equifinal similarly for the multiobjective algorithm amalgam all parameter sets around the optimal point of the pareto front yielding nseq and nseswe within 1 of the optimal nse criteria were retained 2 5 parameter sensitivity analysis the dynamic identifiability analysis dynia method developed by wagener et al 2003 was used to investigate the parameter identifiability this method identifies the 10 best performing parameter values using monte carlo sampling within a prior uniform parameter distribution with prescribed limits c f table 3 and the rmse as objective function the marginal probability distribution of the parameter is then calculated in a moving time window set to 30 days here and used as an indicator of the strength of the conditioning and hence of the identifiability of the parameter wagener et al 2003 time varying sensitivity analysis tvsa was used also to investigate the most influential model parameters at each time step of the simulation and the consistency of the parameter s role and its period of influence with the physical behavior of the basin pianosi and wagener 2016 reusser and zehe 2011 the computationally fast and efficient fourier amplitude sensitivity test method fast was used as sensitivity test reusser et al 2011 2 6 sensitivity of flood characteristics to air temperature while top down scenario based hydrological impact assessments are most used to project climate change impacts on hydrology simpler sensitivity based or scenario neutral approaches are also useful to explore the sensitivity of key hydrological variables to climate aygün et al 2019 prudhomme et al 2010 we tested how parameter equifinality and the choice of a single optimal parameter set versus several equifinal sets impact the temperature sensitivity of streamflow as quantified with the coupled gr4j cémaneige model we focus here on the sensitivity of the average springtime peak streamflow qmax and its timing qmax t to a 2 c increase in mean air temperature which represents a plausible yet optimistic estimate of mean annual warming in southern quebec by 2050 under a moderate emission scenario ouranos 2015 historical temperature records were perturbed with 2 c and the model run using the equifinal and optimal sets derived from the sce flow and multi methods c f section 2 4 the sensitivity measures used δqmax is the percent difference between the mean historical springtime peak flow qmax and that projected under the warming perturbation qmax 2 c the same approach was used for the peak flow timing δqmax t in days the objective is to investigate the agreement between the optimal and equifinal parameter sets as well as the impact of the calibration strategy on the direction and magnitude of change of snowmelt induced peak streamflow which is an important hydrological indicator in southern quebec 3 results 3 1 models performance boxplots in fig 2 show the model performance for the 12 studied basins and the four calibration methods for both the calibration and validation periods the model calibrated with the first strategy local shows a good performance on discharge with a median nseq value of 85 in calibration and 79 in validation but a comparatively poor performance in swe simulation with a median nseswe of 50 obtained on the independent swe observations and significant scatter among basins fig 2a the calibration results with the global algorithm sce flow also show good streamflow simulations with a median nseq value of 84 in calibration similar to the first method but with an improved performance in validation median nseq 82 compared to the local method fig 2b the swe simulation is still weak with the sce flow method with the median nseswe increasing only slightly to 51 fig 2b but with a distribution spread comparable to the first local method in the third strategy sce indep the two cemaneige parameters were calibrated separately against the observed swe which improved significantly the calibrated nseswe with a median value of 58 and a more constrained distribution fig 2c this significant improvement in the nseswe criterion is however accompanied by a degradation of the streamflow simulations with the median nseq decreasing to 80 in calibration and 76 in validation this means that the introduction of two fixed snow parameters in the gr4j cemaneige model led to an over adjustment on the swe and a degradation of streamflow fig 2c the multiobjective strategy in which the nseq and nseswe are simultaneously optimized improved the swe simulations compared to calibrating on streamflow alone the median nseswe was 53 in calibration and 69 in validation over the full period the median nseswe was 57 and 75 of the basins had a nseswe greater than 47 in calibration and greater than 58 in validation without significantly degrading streamflow simulations fig 2d the simulation of swe is hence significantly improved for the two methods sce indep and multi in which the snow observations are used in calibration fig 2c d but the method sce indep degrades the streamflow simulations the multi method gives swe simulations comparable to the indep sce method but without significantly degrading streamflow simulations i e yielding a performance similar to the local and sce flow methods the best swe simulations using the indep and multi methods which use swe records in calibration were obtained for the famine beaurivage ouelle bécancour and bras de nord basins with a nseswe criterion above 65 while the poorest simulation were obtained for the godbout matawin and etchemin basins the poor simulation in these basins may be due to the survey sites being less representative of the basin which is an obvious limitation of using point observations to constrain the snow model fig 3 shows an example of swe simulations for two of these basins while the four calibration strategies yield comparatively good swe simulations in the bécancour basin fig 3a all methods yield comparatively poorer results in the etchemin basin but the indep and multi methods significantly improve swe simulation compared to calibration on streamflow alone local sce flow fig 3b the gr4j cémaneige reproduces well the mean daily hydrograph of each basin fig 4 as shown in fig 2 the local global and multi methods give comparable streamflow performances and only the indep methods degrades streamflow simulations green curves on fig 4 the simulated streamflow most deviates from observations in basins with a larger agricultural land use such as bécancour nicolet etchemin and l acadie fig 4 in order to better understand the differences in model performance among basins nseq values were correlated with basin characteristics c f table 1 as well as with the length of the calibration period which can significantly impact model performance when using split sample calibration validation schemes arsenault et al 2018 the non parametric spearman correlation test was used due to the small sample size and heterogeneous data distributions correlation heatmaps show a strong r 0 78 and significant p 0 05 relationship between model performance nseq in calibration and the agricultural cover in the basin fig 5 a a similar albeit positive correlation is seen between the calibrated nseq and the forest cover the mean basin elevation and mean basin slope to a lesser extent forests and agricultural fields are the dominant land cover types in the basins and are inversely correlated r 0 96 p 0 05 while the forest cover mean elevation and slope are also colinear r 0 69 to 0 79 p 0 05 because basins with greater forest cover occur on the more rugged canadian shield or in the appalachian mountains c f fig 1 the correlations between nseq and forest cover agriculture and elevation persist during the validation period fig 5b the length of the calibration period has no visible impact on model performance in calibration or validation as seen by the low and insignificant correlation coefficients in fig 5a b there is also no drastic difference among calibration methods in the relationship between model performance basin characteristics and calibration record length the negative relationships between model performance and agricultural cover in the basin fig 5c b illustrates the difficulty of the model to adjust to the more dynamic and variable flow conditions typical of these basins which is as also visible on the mean hydrographs in fig 4 3 2 parameter variations among basins and calibration methods the distribution of optimal parameters obtained for the 12 basins is different between the calibration strategies except for the parameter 4 base of unit hydrograph and 2 water table exchange which are more similar fig 6 the choice of calibration method does not seem to have a clear impact on the distribution of parameters among basins the parameter 1 maximum capacity of the soil reservoir approaches its lower limit in some basins while 3 the 1 day routing reservoir capacity approaches its upper limit notably for the third method sce indep in which the cemaneige parameters are separately calibrated on swe observations the degree day factor 6 determining the potential snowmelt is higher and more dispersed than for the other methods meanwhile 5 weighting coefficient of the thermal state which determines the onset of melting is minimized compared to the other methods which shows that the indep method adapts to site specific snow conditions the optimal parameters obtained by each calibration strategy differ with each other within a given basin fig 7 this shows that different optimal sets give the best simulation for each calibration method over the same period the optimum parameters for the four calibration methods often lie within the distribution of the pareto sets obtained by the multi method but also deviate frequently notably for the local and indep methods green and blue dots on fig 7 the optimum parameter set for the multi method is also frequently different from the median value of the pareto set most often the optimum parameter value for the multi method lies between those of the local or sce flow methods in one extreme and those of the indep method on the other the two parameters 2 and 4 are the only ones for which similar values are obtained from the four different calibration strategies figs 6 and 7 the values of the optimal parameter sets were correlated with basins characteristics as well as with the parameter values from the nearest basin spearman correlation heatmaps show little relationships between parameters and basin characteristics for all methods fig 8 however a moderate to strong inverse correlation emerge between and 3 the 1 day routing reservoir capacity and the agricultural cover and positive correlations with forest cover slope and elevation which is interpreted to result from the collinearity between these variables a decreased 1 day routing reservoir capacity in more agricultural catchments is consistent with the faster routing of water occurring in the less impermeable agricultural basins which often have compacted clay soils limiting infiltration including swe observation in the calibration process methods indep and multi results in interesting correlations emerging such as i a positive correlation r 0 80 p 0 05 between water cover mainly lakes and the 2 parameter and a negative correlation between the drainage density and 2 r 0 66 p 0 05 for the multi method consistent with increased groundwater contributions to streamflow in basins with greater lake surfaces and poor drainage ii a positive correlation r 0 64 0 72 between 4 base of unit hydrograph and basin area consistent with an increased response time in larger basin 3 3 parameter equifinality and interaction equifinality was studied using the sce flow and multi two calibration methods c f section 2 4 the distributions of equifinal parameters obtained for the 12 basins are narrow but with many extreme values for the sce flow method while the distributions for the multiobjective method are more homogeneous fig 9 the number of equifinal sets found for the sce flow method is very high and variable between basins therefore in order to converge mathematically with a very small change in the nash value 1 the maximum capacity of the soil reservoir 1 can for example vary from 200 to 450 mm for basin 1 batiscan similar variability is seen for the other basins fig 9a the calibration with the multiobjective algorithm reduced the number of equifinal parameters sets as well as their dispersion fig 9b the range i e the difference between the maximum and minimum parameter value was significantly reduced when using the multi method but no significant reduction was found in the interquartile range of the parameter distributions compared to the sce flow method fig 10 in brief the multi method resulted in a reduced number of equifinal sets and more homogenous parameter distributions than for the sce flow method figs 9 and 10 compensation between parameters can promote parameter equifinality when the calibration information is limited beven 2006 a strong negative correlation is found between the two reservoir parameters 1 the maximum soil reservoir capacity and 3 the routing reservoir capacity with a median correlation value of 0 7 and a moderate correlation between the two transfer parameters 3 and 4 base time unit hydrograph with a median value of 0 5 fig 11 a positive correlation is also visible between 1 and 2 which regulate the amount of water available in the basin with a median value of 0 4 fig 11a these correlations show the compensation occurring between the parameters which makes it difficult to converge toward an optimal set during the optimization this parameter correlation was significantly reduced when using the multi method fig 11b 3 4 identifiability analysis of gr4j cemaneige parameters the identifiability of the gr4j and cemaneige parameters was investigated in more details using the dynia and tvsa methods the analysis was only performed for the bécancour basin id 2 for the sake of brevity the temporal identifiability of the six parameters of the gr4j cemaneige model found by the dynia method is shown in fig 12 in these graphs the color scale represents the frequency distribution of the parameters for the 10 best performing simulations using the root mean squared error rmse as objective function a parameter becomes more identifiable during periods when the frequency distribution is narrower for the parameter 1 low values are more frequent before and during floods while high values are more frequent after the floods fig 12a there is no clear part in this parameter space that is identifiable in the best performing simulations which indicates that different values of this parameter give similar results in combination with the other parameters parameter 2 is a multiplicative parameter that regulates the volume of water in the basin the more positive its value the largest is the contribution of groundwater to the basin while more negative values increase deep percolation losses fig 12b shows that negative values are more frequent during low flow periods indicating large water losses to deep aquifers simulated by the model conversely high positive values of 2 are more frequent during floods this means that to simulate the high flows the model increases the supply from the water table while for low flows the model increases the loss to the water table the high sensitivity of 2 implies that this parameter is most influential to adjust the water volume in the basin which explains the difficulty of finding sensitive values conditioned on streamflow for the production store 1 the parameter 3 one day capacity of the routing reservoir is barely identifiable high values are more frequent during and before floods and decreases after floods but the overall identifiability is unclear fig 12c the identifiability of the parameters 4 base time of the unit hydrograph and 5 thermal coefficient of state of the snowpack is low since very different values of these parameters give similar results in combination with the remaining parameters fig 12d e parameter 6 degree day factor is somewhat identifiable during the melt period with values between 5 and 7 mm c 1 giving the best simulation fig 12f time varying sensitivity analysis fig 13 shows that the parameter 2 is the most influential except during spring pre flood periods when the snow parameters 5 and 6 of the cemaneige model also become influential whereas they have no influence on the rest of the period this confirms that the model behavior is consistent with the physical behavior of the basin in the spring the parameter 3 is most influential during low flow periods the sensitivity of 1 3 and 4 is not clear compared with 2 which predominantly controls the overall water balance while the remaining variations are controlled by the remaining parameters 3 5 impact of equifinality on the temperature sensitivity of peak flow the final objective of this study was to assess how parameter equifinality and the choice of a single optimal vs equifinal parameter set impact the characterisation of streamflow sensitivity to temperature there is a general agreement between all equifinal and optimal sets that springtime peak flow decreases in response to a 2 c warming in air temperature as all simulations display negative δqmax values fig 14 a b the distribution of δqmax values for a given basin reflects the uncertainty in the sensitivity of peak flow to warming resulting from equifinality alone for all basins and using the calibration strategy sce flow the impact of a 2 c temperature warming on qmax can thus be detected using the optimal parameter set red dots on fig 14a with a 99 uncertainty interval varying between 0 15 basin 10 to 0 85 basin 7 which is a rather low uncertainty however the distributions of sensitivities are not normal and when all the parameter sets including the numerous outliers are considered the uncertainty on δqmax can be much greater as much as 3 δqmax 14 to 20 for basin 7 ouelle the difference in uncertainties between basins can be explained by the dispersion of the equifinal parameters displayed in fig 9a basins with more uncertain temperature sensitivities basins 1 3 4 7 8 9 11 and 12 have more dispersed equifinal parameter distributions than basins with better constrained temperature sensitivities basins 2 5 6 and 10 this seems to be particularly the case for the temperature sensitive 5 coefficient of thermal state for snow and 6 degree day factor coefficients which are more dispersed for basins with more uncertain temperature sensitivities fig 14a uncertainties on δqmax are reduced when using the multi method compared to sce flow fig 14b in addition δqmax changes significantly between the two methods in some basins e g basin 3 6 and 10 with for example the median δqmax changing from 18 for the sce flow method to 31 5 using the multi method in basin 3 the different sensitivities between the two calibration methods can also be explained by the dispersion of the optimum fig 7 and equifinal fig 9 parameter sets obtained from the two calibration methods of most importance is the degree day factor 6 controlling potential melt basins where the temperature sensitivity is higher lower using the multi method relative to sce flow also have higher lower degree day factors 6 for the multi method compared to sce flow in fig 7 the multiobjective calibration method finds a compromise between the degree day factors independently calibrated on swe observations sce indep green dots on fig 7f and those calibrated on streamflow sce flow red dots on fig 7f and both are often quite different leading to significantly different temperature sensitivities there is a general agreement except for basin 12 that springtime peak flow would occur earlier by 8 days on average and up to 12 days for basin 1 in response to a 2 c temperature warming fig 14c d as for peak flow magnitude the uncertainty in the temperature sensitivity δqmaxt is decreased for the multi method compared to sce flow method differences in sensitivities between the two methods are less pronounced than for the magnitude but appear to result from the same aforementioned differences in parameter dispersions for basin 12 l acadie which is the southernmost basin studied fig 1 the change in peak flow timing detected using the optimal parameter set is positive using both calibration methods but the uncertainty due to equifinality when considering outliers is such that the direction of change in timing cannot be reliably detected for this basin for both sensitivity metrics δqmax and δqmax t the sensitivities derived with the optimum parameters sets red dots in fig 14 from both methods are often but not always close to the median of the distribution of equifinal sets differences in peak flow sensitivities among basins can be primarily related to differences in snowmelt rates calculated by cemaneige and to changing snowfall to total precipitation ratios with further modulations by water routing within the gr4j model the snowfall ratio decreases from an average std of 0 38 0 04 in the historical period to 0 33 0 04 for a 2 c temperature warming fig 14e f the southernmost l acadie basin id 12 has a markedly lower snowfall ratio differences in peak flow sensitivities δqmax among basins were found to be significantly correlated only with the degree day snowmelt parameter optimum 6 values for both the sce flow r 0 61 p 0 03 and multi r 0 84 p 0 01 methods while changes in snowfall amounts had no influence sce flow r 0 23 p 0 48 multi r 0 12 p 0 72 as for the differences in timing sensitivities δqmaxt a stronger correlation was found with changes in snowfall for sce flow r 0 77 p 0 01 than for the multi method r 0 52 p 0 08 hence inter basin differences in simulated peakflow sensitivity to warming are more strongly related to snowmelt rates parameterized by the 6 coefficient while the sensitivity of peakflow timing is more related to changing snowfall rates using the multi methods increased the dependence of δqmax on 6 compared to sce flow and decreased the dependence of δqmaxt on snowfall changes relative to sce flow method the ratio of rain on snow ros to total annual rainfall is 0 08 0 02 under present climate and decreases slightly to 0 06 0 02 under warmer temperatures fig 14e f ros processes are not explicitly represented in the gr4j cémaneige model and as such represent an unquantified source of uncertainty in the simulated response of peak flow to warming 4 discussion and conclusions 4 1 model performance this study introduced the use of snow survey observations to improve the calibration of the conceptual models gr4j and cemaneige while avoiding the difficulties related to snow cover satellites products in forested catchments four calibration strategies were tested with respect to streamflow and swe using local global and multi objective algorithms overall the calibration against observed streamflow in the first two methods yielded good streamflow simulations but poor simulations of swe the global algorithm sce ua yielded better streamflow simulations in validation than the local algorithm confirming previously reported results about the ability of this algorithm to find global optimal parameters unlike the local algorithms that depend on initial sets efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 despite this ability of the sce ua algorithm to find the global optima its performance in simulating swe was very similar to the local algorithm on the other hand the separate calibration of snow parameters on swe observations in the third method indep resulted in the best swe simulations among the four methods but a degradation of streamflow simulations compared to the first two methods while not drastic the degradation of streamflow simulations is still significant and likely caused by an over adjustment of the snow parameters on swe observations the multiobjective calibration against both observed streamflow and swe using the amalgam algorithm yielded swe simulations comparable to the indep method with only a small degradation of streamflow simulations compared to calibration on streamflow alone troin et al 2015 also used the same third strategy calibration against streamflow with the sce ua algorithm to test different combinations of seven snow models and three hydrological models including gr4j cemaneige in the mistassibi basin quebec and used four swe survey points to validate the simulated swe they found a good simulation of streamflow as well as a good performance for swe simulations with all model combinations including gr4j cemaneige nse 79 this disagreement with our results can be explained by the results shown in fig 2 while good swe simulations are found with this strategy for some basins overall this method does not give a good simulation of swe for the twelve basins compared with the independent and multiobjective calibration approaches these results underscore the importance of assessing general model performance on several basins overall the results of this study show that the additional information provided by the snow survey points improved the simulation of swe without significantly degrading streamflow simulations with the coupled gr4j cémaneige model while this type of snow data has been used before to validate swe simulated by conceptual hydrological models e g grusson et al 2015 troin et al 2015 they have only rarely been exploited for model calibration turcotte et al 2007 independently calibrated the snow module of the hydrotel model on swe observations in southern quebec the melting degree day factor was found to vary between 4 4 and 9 9 mm c 1 day 1 but due to the difficulty in interpolating this parameter spatially they calibrated a global coefficient 6 4 mm c 1 day 1 to be used in operational streamflow forecasts turcotte et al 2010 whitaker et al 2003 used a stepwise approach in calibrating the dhsvm model in which snow accumulation and melt parameters for clear cut and forested areas were optimized on snow course data independently of the runoff production parameters while these two studies used independent calibration of snow model parameters on swe they did not assess the impact of the calibration procedure on resulting streamflow simulations to our knowledge only the recent study by tuo et al 2018 assessed the difference between streamflow only calibration and multiobjective calibration in terms of their performance on both streamflow and swe simulations they calibrated the swat model on streamflow in the upper adige alpine basin italian alps and found generally poor swe simulations while multiobjective calibration greatly improved swe simulations and slightly improved streamflow simulations in the context of glacierized basins finger et al 2015 also showed that calibration against streamflow alone led to unrealistic snow and glacier melt rates our results are in good agreement with those of tuo et al 2018 but in our case the streamflow simulations were slightly degraded compared to calibration on streamflow alone while swe simulations improved contrary to tuo et al 2018 who used snow depth measured at 44 stations within the entire adige basin and converted to swe using a density parameterisation we used a more reliable yet sparser set of swe information based on a single snow course transect per basin as such our results show that sparse swe observations from permanent snow courses represent a useful internal catchment data source for model calibration in in non mountainous terrain on the other hand several previous studies have already shown the effectiveness of using remotely sensed snow cover data in several regions of the world for the calibration of hydrological models using a multiobjective approach duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 parajka et al 2007 roy et al 2010 of special interest is the recent study by riboust et al 2019 who used snow cover area sca from modis satellites in the calibration of the gr4j cemaneige model joint calibration of both discharge and sca improved the performances of sca simulations without degrading river runoff compared to calibration on discharge alone and the calibrated parameters where found to be more robust for simulating independent periods conversely calibrating the cemaneige model on sca alone gave mixed results on discharge their results while based on a different type of internal snow measurements are consistent with our findings based on snow survey data given the difficulties to derive swe and sca in regions with deep snowpacks dense forests and frequent clouds such as southern quebec bergeron et al 2014 brown 2010 sena et al 2016 our results show that including snow survey observations represents an alternative to improve the calibration of conceptual models in snow dominated basins this approach is however dependent on the level of spatial representativity of the snow survey data in regions with smooth topography like southern quebec snow conditions within a given basin are likely to vary primarily due to the land cover which alternates mostly between forested and open agricultural fields c f table 1 since snow courses are located in forests calibrating snow parameters on swe records in basins with mixed forests and agricultural fields could bias the snow simulations towards forest conditions we further explore this point in fig 15 where the change in performance of both streamflow and swe simulations nse for the indep and multi methods are calculated relative to global calibration on streamflow alone sce flow for completely forested catchments the gain in nseswe is comparable for both methods 0 20 fig 15a while the degradation in nseq is overall smaller for the multi method than for the indep method fig 15b a general increase in swe performance for both the indep and multi methods relative to sce flow is seen in response to an increasing agriculture faction in the basin fig 15a the larger gain in nseswe in agricultural catchments is due to the poorer performance of the sce flow method for swe as the snow parameters calibrated with this method may better reflect the mixed forest agricultural snow conditions in the catchment for streamflow there is no clear tendency but basins with a larger agricultural cover tend to have more degraded streamflow simulations for the indep method meanwhile no such trend is seen for the multi method for which the degradation of nseq is similar in range to that of the forested basins fig 15b hence calibrating snow parameters independently on swe records in basins with a mixed forest and agricultural landscape could indeed bias the parameters toward forest conditions and explain the more severe degradation in streamflow simulations however the multiobjective calibration seems to mostly alleviate this problem fig 15b and may as such represent the best way to use snow survey data in model calibration 4 2 equifinality and model structure uncertainty in this study we considered as equifinal parameters the iterations during the optimization by the sce ua and amalgam algorithms that gave the same optimal nash criteria within a small 1 difference the large number of equifinal sets and their dispersion for a 1 change in the objective function nse reveals the difficulty of the algorithm to converge toward a single clear optimum for the sce ua algorithm the maximum soil reservoir capacity 1 was found to be positively correlated with the exchange coefficient 2 and negatively correlated with the maximum capacity of the routing reservoir 3 fig 11 therefore these three parameters can play the same role to adjust the water balance in the basin as a given amount of water can be stored in the soil reservoir routing reservoir or infiltrated to the water table by the parameter 2 based on a sensitivity analysis lay 2006 found that the gr4j model is respectively more sensitive to the soil reservoir capacity 1 followed by the parameter of the unit hydrograph 4 the ground water exchange parameter 2 and the routing reservoir capacity 3 perrin 2000 previously reported a significant correlation between 2 and 1 and between 3 and 1 using multi calibration on several subsets for a large sample of 429 basins in france usa australia and brazil he explained this multiplicity of parameters by their dependence on the climatic conditions of the calibration period as already proposed by several other authors coron et al 2014 merz et al 2011 seiller et al 2012 vos et al 2010 the low identifiability of model parameters appears when parameters compensate each other analysis with the dynia method fig 12 confirms these results and shows that a clear range of identifiable parameter values is rarely found for all parameters except the surface groundwater exchange coefficient 2 as suggested by perrin 2000 the exchange parameter 2 can predominate over the soil reservoir 1 to adjust the basin water balance in the context of snow dominated basins among the two snow parameters 5 6 only the melt coefficient 6 was found to be somewhat identifiable and sensitive during the snowmelt period figs 12 13 highlighting once more the importance to constrain this parameter with internal snow observations the low identifiability and large compensation between the gr4j equifinal parameters demonstrated in this study may be at the origin of equifinality rather than the objective function or input data as proposed by others gupta and nearing 2014 kavetski and clark 2011 wagener and gupta 2005 in particular shin et al 2015 used several screening methods to check the identifiability of conceptual rainfall runoff models including the gr4j model and demonstrated that the main reason for parameters non identifiability is not the input data nor the objective function but rather the model structure they recommended fixing the parameters for which the model is more sensitive or adding new information such as snow or groundwater within a multiobjective approach to reduce the non uniqueness of parameters and improve their identifiability several studies have discussed the importance of multiobjective calibration strategies in order to constrain feasible parameters reduce equifinality and improve the parameter identifiability gupta et al 1998 tang et al 2006 wagener and gupta 2005 wagener et al 2003 among these her and seong 2018 used the amalgam algorithm and objective functions calculated on several streamflow criteria but without adding additional information and demonstrated that equifinality and uncertainty decrease when the number of objective functions considered increases this is consistent with our results which show that adding observed swe survey points to the amalgam algorithm reduced the number dispersion and correlation of equifinal sets figs 9 11 finally while only the 3 parameter 1 day capacity of the routing reservoir was found to correlate well with basins characteristics the inclusion of snow data in the calibration especially within using the multiobjective method allowed other correlations to emerge namely between 2 and the drainage density and surface water fraction in the basin as well as between 4 and basin area fig 8 as such adding snow survey data into the calibration helped to better constrain model parameters and their relations with basins characteristics suggesting future avenues for parameter regionalization based on a larger sample of basins interestingly no correlations were found between the parameters of a basin and those of its nearest neighbour contrary to the findings of oudin et al 2008 who found that regionalization based on spatial proximity was the best approach for a sample of 913 french basins 4 3 impacts of equifinality on peak flow response to warming temperatures the use of hydrological models under conditions different from those of the calibration period as in climate change impact assessment or for seasonal flood forecasting has always been confronted by problems of parameter uncertainty non stability and multiplicity in this study we evaluated the uncertainty that can result from using a single best numerical optimal solution rather than a set of equifinal parameters to quantify the temperature sensitivity of spring peak flow in snow dominated basins in several previous studies parameter uncertainty ranked last in order of importance in a climate change context bennett et al 2012 kay et al 2009 seiller and anctil 2014 teng et al 2011 wilby 2005 wilby and harris 2006 in this study changes in peak flow magnitude simulated by the gr4j cémaneige model in response to a 2 c perturbed temperature varied between 12 to 32 for the 12 studied basins and the maximum uncertainty due to equifinality was 3 while uncertainties were overall small they are not negligible and could affect climate change impacts assessments based on transient climate change scenarios more important perhaps is the significant difference in temperature sensitivity found between the sce flow and multi calibration methods in some basins fig 14 since the change in snowfall ratio in response to warming is the same for the two methods fig 14e f the difference in sensitivity between the two calibration methods is a direct outcome of the uncertainty on the snow parameters 5 and 6 this further emphasizes the need to better constrain snow parameters in conceptual models in order to project future hydrological behaviour under climate change in temperature sensitive snow dominated basins based on our results the use of conceptual models calibrated on observed streamflow alone and forced with climatic scenarios for the assessment of climate change impacts on snow cover and spring flow is not recommended credit authorship contribution

5777,flood fed aquifers along the sandy lower reach of the kuiseb river sustain a 130 km long green belt of lush oases across the hyperarid namib desert this oasis is a year round source for water creating dense tall woodland along the narrow corridor of the ephemeral river valley which in turn supports human activity and fauna including during the long dry austral winters and multi year droughts occasional floods originating at the river s wetter headwaters travel 280 km downstream before recharging these aquifers we analyzed the flood aquifer vegetation dynamics at a site and along the river determining the relative impact of floods with diverse magnitude and frequency on downstream reaches we find that flood discharge that feeds the alluvial aquifers also affects vegetation dynamics along the river the downstream aquifers are fed only by the largest floods that allow the infrequent germination of plants mean annual recharge volume is too low to support the aquifers level these short term vegetation cycles of green up and then fast senescence in between floods are easily detected by satellite derived vegetation index this index identifies historical floods and their magnitudes in arid and hyperarid regions specifically it determines occurrences of large floods in headwater fed ephemeral namib streams as well as in other hyperarid regions our study reveals the

masl rainfall of 500 150 mm y 1 from north to south jacobson et al 1995 these rivers occasionally experience floods that cross the great escarpment and flow along the usually dry sandy riverbeds in

water for the vegetation this study focuses on the strong flood vegetation associations that will allow future identification of flood properties we first conduct our analysis at a scale of individual gaging station in order to establish the causes of the flood vegetation associations then we expand our analysis to the belt along the drier lower reaches of the kuiseb river our goals are 1 to examine the rainfall flood aquifer recharge association 2 to evaluate the combined hydrology ecology response to extreme wet seasons and large floods 3 to detect the seasonal to multi year riparian vegetation changes along this ephemeral hyperarid river 4 to test whether these vegetation changes along the kuiseb river can assist in evaluating first occurrences of floods and or sequence of floods and then even their relative magnitudes measured hydrological data since the 1950s along the kuiseb river together with our station based observations since 2005 provide the background to evaluate the long term eco hydrology of the river oasis in one of the driest deserts in the world 2 the kuiseb river environment 2 1 regional climatology whereas the origin of the namib desert aridity is related to the cold benguela current fig 1 the relatively wetter and higher inland areas are influenced by the latitudinal position of the convergence and the subtropical high pressure sihp and sahp zone as part of tropical circulation fig 2 generally during the austral summer the convergence zone shifts south from latitudes 8 10 s to 15 20 s therefore the sihp and sahp shifts south and the angola low brings equatorial moisture and or indian ocean moisture during exceptional conditions and rain to northern namibia and precipitation between september may although 85 of the rain occur between december april the convective storms precipitate 450 650 mm y 1 along the kunene river in northeastern namibia fig 1 to the south there is a gradual decrease in mean annual rainfall to 355 mm y 1 at the kuiseb river headwaters near windhoek and to 100 mm y 1 near the orange river along the coast of the atlantic ocean the cold water upwelled along the benguela current enforces dry and cold air which stabilizes the air masses and suppresses year round formation of precipitating clouds these processes generate the namib coastal desert we investigated the unusually wettest summer of 2010 11 with almost persistent rain spells from january to may these rain spells generated the record high seasonal flood volume and duration the peak discharge was only moderate this rainy season was characterized by more southern than normal position of the convergence that has affected central namibia and the kuiseb river headwaters rather than the regularly wetter north figs 1 and 2 the heavy seasonal precipitation 1200 1280 mm in windhoek during that season is the highest for the 130 years long record with mean annual rainfall of 355 mm this highest amount surpasses by far the second wettest season 770 mm table 1 appendix during this wet season 41 mm was measured in walvis bay excluding may 89 mm in swakopmund include may private station on the coast of the atlantic ocean with mean annual rain as low as 9 mm the moisture mostly penetrates these coastal areas in east to west direction from the high plateau down to the namib desert but also the result of unusual west to east

the main source for the river floods hattle 1985 characteristically occurring between january april 88 of the floods the plateau is characterized by gently sloping hills and open savanna across the great escarpment the elevation drops dramatically by about 1000 m down to the namib desert 700 m asl at the base of the escarpment the steep bedrock slopes combined with the lower rainfall 150 250 mm y 1 support more arid type plants from the foothills of the escarpment the rainfall gradually decreases to 10 mm y 1 along the coast of the atlantic ocean from the foothills of the great escarpment along the 150 km of its desert course the river forms the 200 m deep kuiseb river canyon fig 3 incised into the schist quartzite bedrock the canyon width ranges between 20 and 80 m mean width 35 and its gradient is 0 003 the riverbed is composed of alternating sections of shallow sand and gravel characterized by year round partially saturation and in some localities by wet quicksand and pools therefore in most years wildlife benefits from water availability throughout the dry austral winter this observation indicates potential flood attenuation but limited water loss during floods along the canyon section morin et al 2009 approximately 60 km upstream from the canyon end the gaub river 2900 km2 joins the kuiseb river fig 3 the total catchment area of the kuiseb river is 15 500 km2 on average the gaub river with its smaller and drier headwaters experiences four flood days per year greylingshof station 2490 km2 fig 3 in comparison with the average 15 flood days per year of the kuiseb river schlesien station 6530 km2 fig 3 the morphology of the gaub river canyon although somewhat narrower is similar to the kuiseb river canyon 3 data sources for the broad context of flood

frequency of large floods is about one flood every 30 years and that this frequency was generally maintained throughout for most of the palaeoflood record this flood palaeohydrology study also revealed 13 flood deposits dated since the beginning of the 20th century and additional 27 extreme floods that occurred over the last 800 years ago maximum peak discharges in the kuiseb and gaub river canyons are estimated at 1280 1390 m3s 1 and 545 720 m3 s 1 respectively grodek et al 2013 4 2 floods and transmission losses for each flood peak discharge along the kuiseb river reaches its maximum

contributing headwaters and the extremely dry namib desert source namibia ministry of agriculture the specific peak discharges in basins with watershed areas 50 km2 located at the higher and wetter headwaters is 1 2 4 m3s 1km 2 fig 4b the specific discharge is lower by an order of magnitude in catchments 100 km2 and is 0 2 m3s 1km 2 this sharp decrease in specific discharge is caused by a increasingly drier portions dominating the larger catchment areas and b transmission losses affected by their increasingly wider and sandy downstream channels fig 4c the 1960 2006 flood record table 1 and table 2 appendix morin et al 2009 indicates the occurrence of 134 floods in 46 years of these floods 131 in 43 years passed the downstream end of the kuiseb river canyon and reached the entry point of the oasis valley with a yearly average volume of 19 5 mm3 y 1 along the oasis floods volume diminishes gradually through transmission and aquifer recharge down to a yearly average volume of 6

1976 7 1983 4 rain average 300 mm y 1 in windhoek recharge of swartbank rooibank and others aquifers decreased by an order of magnitude from a total of 93 mm3 1968 9 1975 6 annual average 11 6 mm3 y 1

near zero flood discharge and recharge into the aquifers located near gobabeb and downstream for this interval 1979 80 1982 3 ward and breen 1983 also reported a drop in water table level and high mortalities of trees and herbivores all along the kuiseb river oases interesting observation is that the upper oasis valley was impacted most by the drought there mortality of faidherbia albida a spice of wetter regions reached 40 and that of tamarix usneoides surprisingly reached 75 even though it is a drought tolerant species of desert origin this mortality of the tamarix is probably the result of the additional inflow of saline water along the north edge of the oasis from the crystalline basement plateau during periods without flooding klaus et al 2008 eckardt et al 2013b usually such fresher floodwater recharge push and maintain the saline water away from the channel at the middle and downstream sections tree mortality was lower the survey of the number of the water ponds indicated that their number dramatically declined by 85 upstream and 100 downstream along the wide sandy oasis during the drought episode correlation between windhoek seasonal rainfall and seasonal flood volume is positive but not strong fig 6 a r2 0 40 and r2 0 61 with 2010 11 excluded and included respectively seasonal peak discharge and volume is relatively well correlated fig 6b r2 0 83 but when the 2010 11 flood is included the correlation it drops to r2 0 53 flood duration and peak discharge have a general positive trend but the correlation is rather poor 4 3 flood dune interaction the sharp boundary between the namib sand sea to the south and the gravel plains to the north of the kuiseb river fig 3 is governed by the long term flood dune interaction along the river the sand migrates north from the left bank of the river but when reaching the channel river floods carry it downstream ward and von brunn 1985 the rate of invading sand to the river valley was estimated at 0 8

windhoek fig 3 in the following hydrologic year january 1963 the highest flood on record 837 m3s 1 and 288 m3s 1 at schlesien and gobabeb respectively cleared the sand accumulated during the drought fig 7b it seems that subsequent moderate floods maintained the channel free of dunes e g the october 1977 photograph revisiting the site almost 30 years later in april 2005 following a single dry season 2004 5 indicates the establishment of a dune that partially covers the left bank bedrock a year later june 2006 following two floods in january 2006 in gobabeb 35 m3s 1 and 112 m3s 1 the bedrock fig 7b was re exposed and the invaded sand was delivered downstream the images dated to june 27 2010 fig 8 a and december 25 2014 fig 8b present the impact of the repeated floods occurring between january and march 2011 a vegetated side bar was eroded near gobabeb and a local change in the course of the active channel is noticeable 4 4 oasis morphology at the end of the canyon the kuiseb river cuts through the schist bedrock opens up and forms a 0 1 2 0 km wide braided sandy alluvial oasis valley with a gradient 0 001 the hydro geomorphology of this river section was intensively studied near gobabeb fig 9 a and b the typical cross section consists of two to three levels of wide floodplain terraces or accreted side bars related to different stages of floods up to 6 m above the channel bed these terraces are covered by relatively dense vegetation the highest terrace is flooded only during the rarest floods the narrow 50 m wide active channel is clear of vegetation at the selected cross section near gobabeb figs 9 10 the most frequent floods 50 m3s 1 are within the narrow active channels these are 113 39 years out of the total 134 analyzed floods over 46 years floods in the range of 100 150 m3s 1 discharge of 113 m3s 1 calibrated based on the 2 2006 flood by using hec ras reach the 1st terrace 8 floods in 46 years floods 150 m3s 1 cover most of the floodplain and bars 3 floods in 46 years floods 250 m3s 1 cover the entire floodplain terraces activate older floodplain channels and may alter locally the location of the active channel such discharge and stages occurred only during 27 days out of the total 730 flooding days in 46 years this very limited duration of flooding of the entire floodplain and bars over the last several decades indicates that on the decadal and longer time scales such high flood stages can produce only insignificant recharge the sand filling the permeable schist bedrock valley forms the oasis aquifer along the channel however this elongated alluvial aquifer is discontinuous it is divided to several compartments or sub aquifers along the channel by high near surface exposed bedrock the low capillary force of the sand 0 12 0 60 m hellwig 1973 limits the deeper water evaporation and therefore allows year round water availability which in turn supports dense vegetation including large leaf trees

floodplains produce pods and are a source of food for the fauna abrams et al 1997 transpiration losses by these trees are likely to affect the aquifer drawdown at an estimated rate of 0 7 m y 1 bate and walker 1993 none of these trees can utilize direct fog water schachtschneider and february 2010 eckardt et al 2013a exceptions are the endemic dune grass species stipagrostis sabulicola henschel and seely 2008 cross valley zonation of tree species is according to their water demand attributes fig 10 faidherbia albida 21 of the trees is a species of wetter regions it is growing only along the banks of the active channel farther away from the active channel acacia erioloba 44 dominates as its deep roots can sustain long drought farthest from the active channel tamarix usneoides 12 is a desert origin and drought resistant species other relatively common species are the euclea pseudebenus 12 and salvadora persica 11 the scour and fill dynamics in the active channel were documented along a transect at a a fig 9b near gobabeb in june 2005 four scour chains were placed across the channel each of these chains was positioned vertically down to four meters below the channel bed reaching the aquifer level at that time fig 11 stage a at the following wet season after the floods of january february 2006 34 and 112 m3 s 1 table 2 appendix we recovered three of the four chains for a perspective out of 134 floods along the kuiseb river since 1960 14 floods at gobabeb peaked within the range of 90 151 m3 s 1 only the two largest floods reach peaks of 288 and 433 m3 s 1 january 1963 and march 2000 respectively the maximum scour measured by these chains ranges between 0 40 and 0 63 m we suggest that this is the thickness of the active layer of the channel fig 11 stage b this scour limit is supported also by the water content recorded by a sensor placed in the vadose zone at 0 6 m below channel bed first this sensor remained untouched and unsaturated during the floods as scouring means a flowing sand and water it cannot occur under non saturated conditions saturation under the channel is achieved only upon a rise in the water table to the surface during the depositional stage of the floods 0 35 0 50 m of sand reburied the chains fig 11 stage c and the net measured scour is minimal 0 05 0 13 m probably within the variance expected from moving sand based on the freshest high water marks on the nearby trees the flood stage was 2 0 m above the active channel bed with calculated maximum possible peak discharge of 113 m3s 1 no significant changes were observed along riverbanks and the terraces near the a a cross section after the flood near the scour chains a pit was excavated to a depth of 2 30 m below channel bed which was the water table depth at that time fig 12 the pit reveals a distinct root rich zone at depths of 0 8 1 51 m below channel bed i e trees from the nearby bank send their roots to under the active channel or flood transported sediments down to the water table the grain size of the sediments in the pit is primarily sand 90 with a single granule pebble rich layer pebbles 1 cm at a depth of 2 0 m fig 13 the silt and clay fraction increase with depth up to 7 shallow auger samples were examined along three transects at uniform depth of 0 35 m the results show that the sand fraction is 85 at all 27 samples fig 13 4 5 aquifer dynamics recharge and stages the potential water storage of the aquifers along the upper narrower section of the oasis downstream end of the canyon to gobabeb fig 3 were estimated at 180 mm3 based on digitized valley width fig 4c water depth fig 14 and porosity of 0 4 morin et al 2009 and aquifer depth 15 50 m christelis and struckmeier 2011 this storage is replenished annually by 8 2 mm3

aquifer levels swartbank rooibank aquifer source the namibia water corporation ltd fig 14 shows the rate of changes in response to floods and dry intervals in response to flood the groundwater level depths rising rate is 0 12 0 36 and 0 68 m d 1 for groundwater level depths of 19 16 and 12 m respectively the rate of drawdown is also depending on the groundwater depth from 0 48 m y 1 for depth of 15 3 20 5 m up to 2 70 m y 1 when water table is at near surface levels 5 4 9 7 m deep at all levels the abstraction rate in swartbank rooibank aquifer is constant 4 6 mm3 y 1 and it is responsible for draw down of 0 11 0 16 m y 1 the rapid decline in groundwater when at the near surface level is explained by the direct evaporation additional flora that increase evapotranspiration and subsurface flow to the sides of the channel and downstream at gobabeb although with a narrower valley and smaller aquifer the drop rate in the groundwater level is similar to swartbank floods infiltrate the dry riverbed and down to the water table at a relatively constant rate of 69 104 mm h 1 based on gob4 fig 16 comparable with 80 120 mm h 1 based on dahan et al 2008 and the water content in the vadose zone rises from 5 dry riverbed to a maximum of 15 full saturation of this zone is achieved only by an upward rising of the water table level in the aquifer dahan et al 2008 during the first flood in the season e g 1 2006 under the driest vadose zone conditions aquifer level rising was delayed by about 2 5 days dahan et al 2008 based on these data we estimate a rate of downward flow of 80 mm h 1 water level was 4 7 m below channel bed at that time fig 15 and aquifer level rise at 57 mm h 1 with the continuation of the flood higher moisture in the vadose zone 15 and higher aquifer water level the response time was shortened to 30 min then down flow rate in the vadose zone and aquifer level rise increased to 174 mm h 1 and 261 mm h 1 respectively in addition two boreholes were monitored daily at the gobabeb aquifer gob4 in the active channel and gob6 located on the adjacent flood terrace wade project figs 10 and 16 they reveal an increase in aquifer level following floods at rates of 96 mm h 1 below the active channel and 21 mm h 1 under the terrace the ground water responses in gob4 and gob6 show a 1 10 days delay in water level rise under the floodplain relative to the channel the decline rates of the water level following the floods are similar for both boreholes this may reflect lateral movement of water during the recharge by the flood from the higher water level beneath the channel which probably forms a water mound because of longer duration and higher recharge rates towards the lower water level under the terrace and bars in the weeks following the flood these two levels equalize and fall together during the progress of the dry season the water quality in the aquifers degrades total dissolved solids tds 2000 10 000 mg l 1 this is the result of several processes

6 flood controlled vegetation dynamics along the lower kuiseb river as shown above e g figs 15 and 16 extreme floods can recharge the shallow and in part disconnected alluvial aquifers along almost the entire length of lower kuiseb river and raise water tables in places water table rises to near channel bed levels the recharge dahan et al 2008 figs 15 and 16 temporary high ground water levels and the freshening of water in this generally inhospitable hyperarid and hot desert have direct and immediate impact on the flora fig 17 the fast response to these processes is a widespread germination of seeds near and at the active channel and on the floodplains moser 2006 our direct observations also indicate a noticeable and widespread subsequent drying and dying of large portions of this vegetation this drying begins within weeks following the flood and can last as long as 2 3 seasons these episodes of green up and relatively fast senescence of the vegetation motivated our next step toward analyzing flood vegetation relationships we first conduct the analysis at a specific site to understand vegetation flood relations and then expand our analysis to the entire length of the lower kuiseb river using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi we use ndvi from modis to track this vegetation green up and senescence cycles along the kuiseb river because ndvi is sensitive to vegetation changes particularly in dry regions helman et al 2014a b we also examine whether ndvi can serve as a practical tool first to identify occurrences of large floods in such arid regions and then for determining their peak and or volume magnitudes at least relatively results show that ndvi from modis captures well vegetation dynamics along the river figs 18 and 19 table 2 typically floods occur between january april at the following months of may and june ndvi reaches its maximum value and decays into a minimum in the following september february wetter flood seasons may affect the rate of decay of the ndvi maintaining its value relatively high for a longer duration so the impact of the flood can be detected even later into march august of the next season along the oasis ndvi is high at the greener upper reaches of the lower kuiseb river when the larger floods do reach and recharge at the driest channel sites of swartbank and rooibank ndvi changes abruptly and the maximum ndvi values are well correlated with flood volumes following the wet seasons of 2005 6 and 2008 9 the higher flood volumes in january february increased the wetness in the alluvium and filled the aquifers this was followed by an increase in ndvi between may july the austral summer of 2010 11 december 2010 to mid may 2011 marks the record high of flow days 100 days and flood volume 160 mm3 the flood recharged the aquifers to the surface of the channel bed allowing rapid growth of the vegetation and seed germination ndvi responded with large peaks in may 2011 ndvi 0 3 0 38 and 0 49 for gobabeb swartbank and rooibank respectively these were the highest values in 2000 2016 the flood reached gobabeb on january 31 2011 and a few days later the swartbank pumping site in regular years the average ndvi maxima was 0 26 for mid june however in the wet season of 2010 11 the same value was reached two months earlier in mid april 2011 while maximum ndvi was documented in mid may table 2 rooibank ndvi 0 49 following the wet year of 2011 above normal ndvi baseline values were maintained for two consecutive years 5 discussion 5 1 floods and aquifer recharge the oasis along the lower kuiseb river exclusively depends on rare but distinctively long duration floods that originated on the higher and wetter headwaters these long duration floods are necessary to fill up the farthermost oasis aquifers therefore only seven years with extreme floods since 1960 are responsible for 55 of the total aquifer recharge table 2 appendix mean annual recharge volume 13 mm3 y 1 is by far too low to support the aquifers level thus there is a need for the largest floods exceeding volume of 25 mm3 y 1 to recover the aquifers from normal drought intervals these floods seem to be frequent enough to clear the river valley from the northward invading dunes this maintains the kuiseb river as the sharp boundary between the namib sand sea to the south and the gravel plains to the north for at least the last few millennia the area southwest of gobabeb toward the kuiseb river delta and walvis bay fig 9 preserve evidence of buried west oriented paleochannels indicating that dunes may have deflected the kuiseb river to the north in contrast the tsondab tsauchab and the duuwisib rivers all are located south of the kuiseb river currently terminate in pans blocked by the namib sand sea since at least the late pleistocene e g brook et al 2006 stone et al 2010 the shape of the elongated kuiseb river oasis is in part the result of these namib dunes migrating northward on top of the relatively permeable schist bedrock following extreme floods the near surface groundwater level and the direct evaporation from the river bed modern water abstraction evapotranspiration and other still speculated losses such as paleochannels and downstream flow towards the river delta e g bgr 1998 klaus et al 2008 affect the groundwater decline rate at lower groundwater levels the low capillary forces of sand 0 12 0 6 m hellwig 1973 practically prevent deeper water or moisture from fast direct evaporation in this dry and hot desert therefore the drawdown of the aquifer under lower water table stages is primarily the result of the evapotranspiration losses by the dense vegetation during severe long droughts recharge into the kuiseb river shallow aquifers at swartbank rooibank aquifers decreases by an order of magnitude e g from a total of 93 mm3 for the eight years of 1968 9 1975 6 down to a total of 7 4 mm3 for the subsequent eight years of 1976 7 1983 4 three of these years 1979 80 1981 2 show near zero recharge volumes along the oasis huntley 1985 during this hydroclimatic drought a high tree mortality was observed especially noticed along the upper oasis and less so in downstream reaches huntley 1985 based on our survey and the flood routing model of morin et al 2009 the aquifer of the upper reach is relatively small both narrow and shallow and therefore its dense and tall forest relies on the recharge generated by the usually more frequent floods in the reach just downstream of the canyon mouth this reach is characterized by 6 5 yearly average aquifer replenishment in comparison with only 1 2 at the swartbank and 0 7 at rooibank aquifer at the upper oasis reach frequent floods recharge the aquifers by fresh floodwater therefore the water quality in the aquifer under the active channel is best gradually decreasing towards the aquifer edges in turn this allows faidherbia albida a species of wetter regions to flourish in this desert environment on the terraces bordering the active channel and feed of the freshest water however this tree is also the most sensitive to the deterioration in water quality during droughts and therefore experience high mortality unexpected is the high mortality during drought intervals of the tamarix usneoides which is a highly arid saline tolerated tree species this species of tree grows away from the channel at the farther edge of the terraces relying on the poor quality or practically saline water we propose that during longer droughts there is a further deterioration of water salinity when groundwater level drops to a level that allows inflow of even more saline water from the crystalline basement rocks at the edge of the aquifer gravel plains fig 3 klaus et al 2008 eckardt et al 2013b therefore the trees do not survive and die out the acacia erioloba with its characteristic deep roots in dry sandy soils show almost no response to the drought in these upper reaches in contrast with this upper reach the swartbank rooibank reach is characterized by permanently dry conditions therefore drought tolerating tree species survive even the longer drought intervals we observed germination of other tree species along the active channel near gobabeb following the 2006 flood however their survival time was brief probably up to a few seasons for example the extremely wet 2010 11 season generated the longest flood duration and volume on record as recharge is highly dependent on flood duration morin et al 2009 the flood wetted the channel islands and low lying floodplain allowed a vast seed germination this flood also recharged the aquifers through the channel and groundwater levels reached the surface similar to the wet 2005 6 season two months later the entire length of the river valley showed a widespread increase in vegetation this was also detected by the highest ndvi during that specific season since 2000 fig 18 even at the downstream rooibank reach the ndvi reached 0 5 these high ndvi values were maintained for two consecutive years which was in accordance with the relatively high aquifer levels that probably pushed the saline water away from the channel edges then a rapid decline from near surface aquifer levels at rates of 0 2 0 5 mm h 1 1 7 4 3 m y 1 was followed closely by a decrease in ndvi back to its normal values after two consecutive years fig 18 this fast response of the vegetation to large floods and recharge indicate that high ground water levels especially in lower reaches affect the vegetation only by the high flood stage or by the exceptionally long duration of the flood that enables filling the aquifer later the roots of the newly germinating trees cannot follow down the rate of water level decline in addition the vegetation is likely affected by the inflowing saline water that overcomes the freshening by the flood recharge this causes a vast almost synchronous mortality of juvenile trees in the lower reaches at first a fast decline in near surface water levels is likely caused by direct evaporation then a further decline probably take place due to water losses via transpiration by the increased vegetation this may explain the observation of an expansive mortality of juvenile trees along the lower reaches near swartbank and rooibank of the kuiseb river with dense stands of relatively young dead trees that all seem to be of the same age later under lowered aquifer levels direct evaporation is limited and the evapotranspiration is reduced to minimum due to the decrease in the number of surviving trees in addition the lower hydraulic gradient limited horizontal flow down the aquifer this results in a decline in the rate of the lowering of the water table of the aquifer to 0 06 0 08 mm h 1 0 5 m y 1 similar lowering rates were recorded also below the active channel and the floodplain near gobabeb fig 14 floods over the dry kuiseb river channel bed recharge the aquifer in a relatively constant infiltration rate of 8 5 mm h 1 the wetting front which is characterized by up to 15 water content fig 15 dahan et al 2008 propagates down within and through the vadose zone full saturation and rising of the water table occur at a rate of 70 100 mm h 1 hence flow duration which in turn allows longer duration of recharge under the limited infiltration becomes the important factor in recharging the aquifer during floods in addition the slow recharge rate during the first flood in a season may indicate that recharge occurs only by floods longer than 2 5 days out of the 134 floods that occurred in 1960 1 2005 6 80 floods lasted 1 day based on the gobabeb record with a total 325 flood days i e with an average of seven flood days per year table 2 appendix the aquifer below the active channel in this gobabeb reach rises at a rate of 96 mm h 1 fig 16 under the floodplain terrace the groundwater when at 4 m starts to rise with a lag time ranging from 18 h to 10 days with rising rates exceeding only 21 mm h 1 when the aquifer level rises due to the progress of the flood the unsaturated zone gradually becomes saturated dissolving and releasing the preexisting soluble salts into the ground water amiaz et al 2011 after the flood evaporation and evapotranspiration reduce the aquifer level and degrade the quality of the water and salts deposit in the sediment above ground water fluvial processes in the active channel and the water level in the aquifer dictate the depth of the root rich layer that reaches the channel from the channel edge and floodplain fig 10 this layer is limited to depths of 0 8 1 5 m below the channel bed this is probably the optimum depth for the roots to survive higher roots are being affected by cut and fill cycles of the sediments in the channel bed during floods which reached a depth of 0 63 m during the 1 2 2006 flood long term scour depth of 0 5 1 3 m measured in ephemeral desert rivers israel lekach et al 2006 deeper roots are occasionally submerged for long enough duration by the relatively high aquifer levels fig 10 and therefore they do not survive 5 2 model of the aquifer recharge and decline summary fig 10 1 initial stage during the long dry winter direct evaporation from the active channel surfaces the dense vegetation evapotranspirational processes and the lateral flow cause decline in groundwater level at a rate of 5 0 5 m y 1 fig 14 depending on the exact level as the groundwater declines saline water from the subsurface of the gravel plains and from saline springs penetrates the aquifer and gradually degrades its water quality from the right bank towards the center 2 following the long dry winter summer convective storms over the high plateau generate floods that reach the oasis about two days later the first floodwater over the dry 5 moisture oasis riverbed starts propagating below the active channel down to the aquifer at a constant rate of 8 10 mm h 1 the wetting front increases the moisture of the vadose zone up to 15 which is still below saturation and reaches the groundwater more than two days later as measured in gobabeb in 2006 only then the groundwater starts increasing its level at a rate of 60 100 mm h 1 with the fresh floodwaters located just beneath the active channel the rising of the groundwater under the active channel generates a local water mound that pushes laterally the older and relatively saline water below the nearby terraces this is noticeable 2 10 days after the flood depending on the groundwater stage and distance from the active channel fig 16 3 the trees that are sensitive to saline water grow on the 1st terrace near the active channel where the groundwater is replenished more frequently by floods the less sensitive trees grow at a distance on the higher terraces 5 3 ndvi as a detector of flood occurrences as already discussed flood duration is the most important factor in recharging the aquifers in this arid environment and therefore influences and shows high correlation r2 0 87 with the ndvi the influence of extreme flood recharge events on the ndvi is particularly noticed along the drier downstream oasis section where the wider valley fig 4c and fewer arriving floods result in higher vegetation sensitivity with almost an instantaneous response of the vegetation to floods however as floods peaks volume infiltration transmission and duration are cross correlated they all influence the ndvi but with lower correlation low ndvi values are usually detected during drought and regular years while ndvi peaks to a maximum following an extreme flood at rooibank ndvi ranges between 0 12 and 0 5 in dry and flooding years respectively fig 17 table 2 at the upstream oasis section near the canyon mouth frequent floods recharge the aquifer and maintain a fresher water table this result in relatively permanent dense vegetation that respond only to drought years our results indicate that high ndvi values correspond with extreme duration and volume of flood peak discharge seems less important therefore ndvi determines occurrences of large floods reaching the lower kuiseb river and of a wet hydrological seasons and specific flooding transmission losses and recharge in the lower reaches determining the relative magnitudes of these floods is more difficult but possible b seasonal and multi year long droughts in the middle reaches and c multi year droughts in the upper reaches of streams crossing hyperarid regions this shows promise for indirect flood monitoring in remote arid and hyperarid areas elsewhere 5 4 global perspective most of the streams which cross the namib desert head at semiarid environments and at altitudes of 1000 2000 m such settings allow storms to generate rainfall runoff floods in contrast with snow or rain on snow of various magnitudes and durations permitting quite long transmitting flows downstream without being fed by additional discharge in tributaries heading in the hyperarid area therefore the specific peak discharge is significantly lower than elsewhere greenbaum et al 2006 amponsah et al 2018 such flood hydrology patterns are common in other streams of the arid and hyperarid world schick 1988 that are characterized by wetter headwaters and long channel experiencing no rainfall for example such discharge losses were reported in a the long stream flooding from monsoonal headwaters to the internal closed basins of australia e g knighton et al 2002 b the very long streams draining the atlas into the sahara e g dubief 1953 vanney 1960 c the western deserts of the united states e g enzel et al 1992 and d the sinai negev arabian streams all ungauged basins in these environments can be the target of the methodology presented here in addition ndvi based detection of large floods can be applied for the very rare floods in the driest areas of the atacama desert which experience the lower end of the mean annual rainfall of the namib this can be used also in the other ephemeral streams of the namib to detect individual basin and regional flood occurrences and flood frequency as we show in fig 20 ndvi has been shown to react to rainfall events in arid regions with a strong correlation to several plant related traits such as leaf development and biomass as well as biophysical process like evapotranspiration helman et al 2014a b 2015a b 2017 the above strong correlation between spectral based vegetation indices such as ndvi and vegetation dynamics as well as the global and continuous temporal coverage of satellites opens the opportunity for using these indices in remote and ungauged arid and hyperarid regions to show that this practice depicts a clear signal we present here the ndvi for the three rivers south of the kuiseb river draining into and blocked by the namib sand sea these tsondab tsauchab and duwisib rivers basins a c in fig 1 with catchment areas of 4400 6000 km2 are located 90 250 km south of the kuiseb river the lower rainfall in their headwaters see fig 1 increases the sensitivity of the vegetation along their courses and therefore floods are better detected by the time series of ndvi variability fig 20 6 conclusions the sand filled lower kuiseb river channel is an excellent long term aquifer water storage with relatively low capillary force in the sand and the permeable bedrock groundwater decline is accelerated by evapotranspiration in the extremely dry and hot namib desert the existence and spatial and temporal variabilities of the valley aquifers and their dependent green oasis along the lower kuiseb river rely on rare and extreme floods for example as low as seven floods are responsible for 55 of the total aquifer recharge during the five decades of 1960 1 2005 6 regularly occurring annual floods are insufficient to support the levels in the aquifers along the lower reaches of the kuiseb river the simple ndvi is a most sensitive indicator of occurrences of such extreme floods especially along the lower and commonly drier river reaches that respond only to such rare floods and wet years during extreme floods the water levels in the aquifers rise to near surface levels allowing for fast plant growth following its germination by the wetting of the channel and terraces during the subsequent 1 2 years green up was supported by the surface wetting and by the high aquifer levels this variability in the channels eco hydrology is recorded by the ndvi the link between flora response and extreme floods indicates that ndvi is a tool for recording the history of wet dry hydrological seasons or individual floods in remote ungauged basins the upstream oasis section benefits from the better aquifer conditions with an average yearly replenishment rate of 4 5 in comparison with only 0 9 replenishment downstream at swartbank rooibank over four years long droughts result in deterioration in water quality increased salinity lower aquifer water level sand incursion into the channel and high tree mortalities high mortality of trees of species of wetter origin is observed also along the upstream oasis section at the millennial to quaternary time scale rare floods are still frequent enough to clear the valley from the invading sand dunes advancing north the water transmitted by first flood of a season and flowing over the dry riverbed propagate down to the aquifer at an approximately constant rate of 8 5 mm h 1 and reaches the water table aquifer within 2 hrs therefore only longer floods approximately 40 of floods can affect aquifer levels throughout all the floods the entire vadose zone remains unsaturated with relatively low moisture content 10 to 15 the infiltration is regulated in part by the near surface sediments as the propagated water reaches down to the groundwater level the level starts rising at a rate of 70 100 mm h 1 and 200 mm h 1 during the subsequent floods in the same season full vadose zone saturation is achieved only by such rising of the groundwater the root layer below the active channel is constrained to depths of 0 8 to 1 5 m i e to survive the optimal depth for the roots must be below the active sand in the channel that undergoes cut and fill during floods 0 60 m and still not submerged by the groundwater credit authorship contribution statement tamir grodek conceptualization methodology validation visualization writing

5777,flood fed aquifers along the sandy lower reach of the kuiseb river sustain a 130 km long green belt of lush oases across the hyperarid namib desert this oasis is a year round source for water creating dense tall woodland along the narrow corridor of the ephemeral river valley which in turn supports human activity and fauna including during the long dry austral winters and multi year droughts occasional floods originating at the river s wetter headwaters travel 280 km downstream before recharging these aquifers we analyzed the flood aquifer vegetation dynamics at a site and along the river determining the relative impact of floods with diverse magnitude and frequency on downstream reaches we find that flood discharge that feeds the alluvial aquifers also affects vegetation dynamics along the river the downstream aquifers are fed only by the largest floods that allow the infrequent germination of plants mean annual recharge volume is too low to support the aquifers level these short term vegetation cycles of green up and then fast senescence in between floods are easily detected by satellite derived vegetation index this index identifies historical floods and their magnitudes in arid and hyperarid regions specifically it determines occurrences of large floods in headwater fed ephemeral namib streams as well as in other hyperarid regions our study reveals the

water for the vegetation this study focuses on the strong flood vegetation associations that will allow future identification of flood properties we first conduct our analysis at a scale of individual gaging station in order to establish the causes of the flood vegetation associations then we expand our analysis to the belt along the drier lower reaches of the kuiseb river our goals are 1 to examine the rainfall flood aquifer recharge association 2 to evaluate the combined hydrology ecology response to extreme wet seasons and large floods 3 to detect the seasonal to multi year riparian vegetation changes along this ephemeral hyperarid river 4 to test whether these vegetation changes along the kuiseb river can assist in evaluating first occurrences of floods and or sequence of floods and then even their relative magnitudes measured hydrological data since the 1950s along the kuiseb river together with our station based observations since 2005 provide the background to evaluate the long term eco hydrology of the river oasis in one of the driest deserts in the world 2 the kuiseb river environment 2 1 regional climatology whereas the origin of the namib desert aridity is related to the cold benguela current fig 1 the relatively wetter and higher inland areas are influenced by the latitudinal position of the convergence and the subtropical high pressure sihp and sahp zone as part of tropical circulation fig 2 generally during the austral summer the convergence zone shifts south from latitudes 8 10 s to 15 20 s therefore the sihp and sahp shifts south and the angola low brings equatorial moisture and or indian ocean moisture during exceptional conditions and rain to northern namibia and precipitation between september may although 85 of the rain occur between december april the convective storms precipitate 450 650 mm y 1 along the kunene river in northeastern namibia fig 1 to the south there is a gradual decrease in mean annual rainfall to 355 mm y 1 at the kuiseb river headwaters near windhoek and to 100 mm y 1 near the orange river along the coast of the atlantic ocean the cold water upwelled along the benguela current enforces dry and cold air which stabilizes the air masses and suppresses year round formation of precipitating clouds these processes generate the namib coastal desert we investigated the unusually wettest summer of 2010 11 with almost persistent rain spells from january to may these rain spells generated the record high seasonal flood volume and duration the peak discharge was only moderate this rainy season was characterized by more southern than normal position of the convergence that has affected central namibia and the kuiseb river headwaters rather than the regularly wetter north figs 1 and 2 the heavy seasonal precipitation 1200 1280 mm in windhoek during that season is the highest for the 130 years long record with mean annual rainfall of 355 mm this highest amount surpasses by far the second

along the 150 km of its desert course the river forms the 200 m deep kuiseb river canyon fig 3 incised into the schist quartzite bedrock the canyon width ranges between 20 and 80 m mean width 35 and its gradient is 0 003 the riverbed is composed of alternating sections of shallow sand and gravel characterized by year round partially saturation and in some localities by wet quicksand and pools therefore in most years wildlife benefits from water availability throughout the dry austral winter this observation indicates potential flood attenuation but limited water loss during floods along the canyon section morin et al 2009 approximately 60 km upstream from the canyon end the gaub river 2900 km2 joins the kuiseb river fig 3 the total catchment area of the kuiseb river is 15 500 km2 on

frequency of large floods is about one flood every 30 years and that this frequency was generally maintained throughout for most of the palaeoflood record this flood palaeohydrology study also revealed 13 flood deposits dated since the beginning of the 20th century and additional 27 extreme floods that occurred over the last 800 years ago maximum peak discharges in the kuiseb and gaub river canyons are estimated at 1280 1390 m3s 1 and 545 720 m3 s 1 respectively grodek et al 2013 4 2 floods and transmission losses for each flood peak discharge along the kuiseb river reaches its maximum

near zero flood discharge and recharge into the aquifers located near gobabeb and downstream for this interval 1979 80 1982 3 ward and breen 1983 also reported a drop in water table level and high mortalities of trees and herbivores all along the kuiseb river oases interesting observation is that the upper oasis valley was impacted most by the drought there mortality of faidherbia albida a spice of wetter regions reached 40 and that of tamarix usneoides surprisingly reached 75 even though it is a drought tolerant species of desert origin this mortality of the tamarix is probably the result of the additional inflow of saline water along the north edge of the oasis from the crystalline basement plateau during periods without flooding klaus et al 2008 eckardt et al 2013b usually such fresher floodwater recharge push and maintain the saline water away from the channel at the middle and downstream sections tree mortality was lower the survey of the number of the water ponds indicated that their number dramatically declined by 85 upstream and 100 downstream along the wide sandy oasis during the drought episode correlation between windhoek seasonal rainfall and seasonal flood volume is positive but not strong fig 6 a r2 0 40 and r2 0 61 with 2010 11 excluded and included respectively seasonal peak discharge and volume is relatively well correlated fig 6b r2 0 83 but when the 2010 11 flood is included the correlation it drops to r2 0 53 flood duration and peak discharge have a general positive trend but the correlation is rather poor 4 3 flood dune interaction the sharp boundary between the namib sand sea to the south and the gravel plains to the north of the kuiseb river fig 3 is governed by the long term flood dune interaction along the river the sand migrates north from the left bank of the river but when reaching the channel river floods carry it downstream ward and von brunn 1985 the rate of invading sand to the river valley was estimated at 0 8

october 1961 indicate that dunes advancing into the river valley probably occurred during the earlier 1958 9 1961 2 severe drought characterized by mean annual rainfall as low as 225 255 mm in windhoek fig 3 in the following hydrologic year january 1963 the highest flood on record 837 m3s 1 and 288 m3s 1 at schlesien and gobabeb respectively cleared the sand accumulated during the drought fig 7b it seems that subsequent moderate floods maintained the channel free of dunes e g the october 1977 photograph revisiting the site almost 30 years later in april 2005 following a single dry season 2004 5 indicates the establishment of a dune that partially covers the left bank bedrock a year later june 2006 following two floods in january 2006 in gobabeb 35 m3s 1 and 112 m3s 1 the bedrock fig 7b was re exposed and the invaded sand was delivered downstream the images dated to june 27 2010 fig 8 a and december 25 2014 fig 8b present the impact of the repeated floods occurring between january and march 2011 a vegetated side bar was eroded near gobabeb and a local change in the course of the active channel is noticeable 4 4 oasis morphology at the end of the canyon the kuiseb river cuts through the schist bedrock opens up and forms a 0 1 2 0 km wide braided sandy alluvial oasis valley with a gradient 0 001 the hydro geomorphology of this river section was intensively studied near gobabeb fig 9 a and b the typical cross section consists of two to three levels of wide floodplain terraces or accreted side bars related to different stages of floods up to 6 m above the channel bed these terraces are covered by relatively dense vegetation the highest terrace is flooded only during the rarest floods the narrow 50 m wide active channel is clear of vegetation at the selected cross section near gobabeb figs 9 10 the most frequent floods 50 m3s 1 are within the narrow active channels these are 113 39 years out of the total 134 analyzed floods over 46 years floods in the range of 100 150 m3s 1 discharge of 113 m3s 1 calibrated based on the 2 2006 flood by using hec ras reach the 1st terrace 8 floods in 46 years floods 150 m3s 1 cover most of the floodplain and bars 3 floods in 46 years floods 250 m3s 1 cover the entire floodplain terraces activate older floodplain channels and may alter locally the location of the active channel such discharge and stages occurred only during 27 days out of the total 730 flooding days in 46 years this very limited duration of flooding of the entire floodplain and bars over the last several decades indicates that on the decadal and longer time scales such high flood stages can produce only insignificant recharge the sand filling the permeable schist bedrock valley forms the oasis aquifer along the channel however this elongated alluvial aquifer is discontinuous it is divided to several compartments or sub aquifers along the channel by high near surface exposed bedrock the low capillary force of the sand 0 12 0 60 m hellwig 1973 limits the deeper water evaporation and therefore allows year round water availability which in turn supports dense vegetation including large leaf trees seely et al 1980 moser 2006 the trees comprise 75 80 of the vegetative biomass theron et al 1980 bate and walker 1993 wade 2006 schachtschneider and february 2010 improve nutrient content on the floodplains produce pods and are a source of food for the fauna abrams et al 1997 transpiration losses by these trees are likely to affect the aquifer drawdown at an estimated rate of 0 7 m y 1 bate and walker 1993 none of these trees can utilize direct fog water schachtschneider and february 2010 eckardt et al 2013a exceptions are the endemic dune grass species stipagrostis sabulicola henschel and seely 2008 cross valley zonation of tree species is according to their water demand attributes fig 10 faidherbia albida 21 of the trees is a species of wetter regions it is growing only along the banks of the active channel farther away from the active channel acacia erioloba 44 dominates as its deep roots can sustain long drought farthest from the active channel tamarix usneoides 12 is a desert origin and drought resistant species other relatively common species are the euclea pseudebenus 12 and salvadora persica 11 the scour and fill dynamics in the active channel were documented along a transect at a a fig 9b near gobabeb in june 2005 four scour chains were placed across the channel each of these chains was positioned vertically down to four meters below the channel bed reaching the aquifer level at that time fig 11 stage a at the following wet season after the floods of january february 2006 34 and 112 m3 s 1 table 2 appendix we recovered three of the four chains for a perspective out of 134 floods along the kuiseb river since 1960 14 floods at gobabeb peaked within the range of 90 151 m3 s 1 only the two largest floods reach peaks of 288 and 433 m3 s 1 january 1963 and march 2000 respectively the maximum scour measured by these chains ranges between 0 40 and 0 63 m we suggest that this is the thickness of the active layer of the channel fig 11 stage b this scour limit is supported also by the water content recorded by a sensor placed in the vadose zone at 0 6 m below channel bed first this sensor remained untouched and unsaturated during the floods as scouring means a flowing sand and water it cannot occur under non saturated conditions saturation under the channel is achieved only upon a rise in the water table to the surface during the depositional stage of the floods 0 35 0 50 m of sand reburied the chains fig 11 stage c and the net measured scour is minimal 0 05 0 13 m probably within the variance expected from moving sand based on the freshest high water marks on the nearby trees the flood stage was 2 0 m above the active channel bed with calculated maximum possible peak discharge of 113 m3s 1 no significant changes were observed along riverbanks and the terraces near the a a cross section after the flood near the scour chains a pit was excavated to a depth of 2 30 m below channel bed which was the water table depth at that time fig 12 the pit reveals a distinct root rich zone at depths of 0 8 1 51 m below channel bed i e trees from the nearby bank send their roots to under the active channel or flood transported sediments down to the water table the grain size of the sediments in the pit is primarily sand 90 with a single granule pebble rich layer pebbles 1 cm at a depth of 2 0 m fig 13 the silt and clay fraction increase with depth up to 7 shallow auger samples were examined along three transects at uniform depth of 0 35 m the results show that the sand fraction is 85 at all 27 samples fig 13 4 5 aquifer dynamics recharge and stages the potential water storage of the aquifers along the upper narrower section of the oasis downstream end of the canyon to gobabeb fig 3 were estimated at 180 mm3 based on digitized valley width fig 4c water depth fig 14 and porosity of 0 4 morin et al 2009 and aquifer depth 15 50 m christelis and struckmeier 2011 this storage is replenished annually by 8 2 mm3 of floodwater i e replenishment is 4 5 of estimated storage downstream at the larger production aquifers swartbank rooibank fig 3 the water storage is 670 mm3 with a mean annual replenishment of 5 8 mm3 i e 1 of estimated annual storage this downstream aquifer supplies 4 6 mm3 y 1 of water for domestic and mining activities source the namibia water corporation ltd monthly monitoring of the aquifer levels swartbank rooibank aquifer source the namibia water corporation ltd fig 14 shows the rate of changes in response to floods and dry intervals in response to flood the groundwater level depths rising rate is 0 12 0 36 and 0 68 m d 1 for groundwater level depths of 19 16 and 12 m respectively the rate of drawdown is also depending on the groundwater depth from 0 48 m y 1 for depth of 15 3 20 5 m up to 2 70 m y 1 when water table is at near surface levels 5 4 9 7 m deep at all levels the abstraction rate in swartbank rooibank aquifer is constant 4 6 mm3 y 1 and it is responsible for draw down of 0 11 0 16 m y 1 the rapid decline in groundwater when at the near surface level is explained by the direct evaporation additional flora that increase evapotranspiration and subsurface flow to the sides of the channel and downstream at gobabeb although with a narrower valley and smaller aquifer the drop rate in the groundwater level is similar to swartbank floods infiltrate the dry riverbed and down to the water table at a relatively constant rate of 69 104 mm h 1 based on gob4 fig 16 comparable with 80 120 mm h 1 based on dahan et al 2008 and the water content in the vadose zone rises from 5 dry riverbed to a maximum of 15 full saturation of this zone is achieved only by an upward rising of the water table level in the aquifer dahan et al 2008 during the first flood in the season e g 1 2006 under the driest vadose zone conditions aquifer level rising was delayed by about 2 5 days dahan et al 2008 based on these data we estimate a rate of downward flow of 80 mm h 1 water level was 4 7 m below channel bed at that time fig 15 and aquifer level rise at 57 mm h 1 with the continuation of the flood higher moisture in the vadose zone 15 and higher aquifer water level the response time was shortened to 30 min then down flow rate in the vadose zone and aquifer level rise increased to 174 mm h 1 and 261 mm h 1 respectively in addition two boreholes were monitored daily at the gobabeb aquifer gob4 in the active channel and gob6 located on the adjacent flood terrace wade project figs 10 and 16 they reveal an increase in aquifer level following floods at rates of 96 mm h 1 below the active channel and 21 mm h 1 under the terrace the ground water responses in gob4 and gob6 show a 1 10 days delay in water level rise under the floodplain relative to the channel the decline rates of the water level following the floods are similar for both boreholes this may reflect lateral movement of water during the recharge by the flood from the higher water level beneath the channel which probably forms a water mound because of longer duration and higher recharge rates towards the lower water level under the terrace and bars in the weeks following the flood these two levels equalize and fall together during the progress of the dry season the water quality in the aquifers degrades total dissolved solids tds 2000 10 000 mg l 1 this is the result of several processes direct evaporation from the active channel when water levels are near the surface evapotranspiration dissolution within the vadose zone shanyengana et al 2004 and saltwater intrusion from the gravel plains and valley margins day and seely 1988 fig 10 during floods the replenishment of the preexisting water reduces the tds values 500 mg l 1 electrical conductivity ec values at the aquifer underlying the active channel amiaz et al 2011 ranges between 0 8 and 1 1 ms cm 1 at the end of the dry season reach up to 1 3 ms cm 1 during the first flood bore of the season and is reduced to 0 6 ms cm 1 during the flow continuation and recession the ec values of the floodwater were 0 8 0 6 and 0 3 ms cm 1 at the bore peak flow and the flood recession respectively jacobson et al 2010 in a downstream direction along the river floodwater quality degrades from 0 3 0 7 to 1 0 ms cm 1 from the gaub river hydrometric station greylingshof to gobabeb and farther downstream respectively fig 3 4 6 flood controlled vegetation dynamics along the lower kuiseb river as shown above e g figs 15 and 16 extreme floods can recharge the shallow and in part disconnected alluvial aquifers along almost the entire length of lower kuiseb river and raise water tables in places water table rises to near channel bed levels the recharge dahan et al 2008 figs 15 and 16 temporary high ground water levels and the freshening of water in this generally inhospitable hyperarid and hot desert have direct and immediate impact on the flora fig 17 the fast response to these processes is a widespread germination of seeds near and at the active channel and on the floodplains moser 2006 our direct observations also indicate a noticeable and widespread subsequent drying and dying of large portions of this vegetation this drying begins within weeks following the flood and can last as long as 2 3 seasons these episodes of green up and relatively fast senescence of the vegetation motivated our next step toward analyzing flood vegetation relationships we first conduct the analysis at a specific site to understand vegetation flood relations and then expand our analysis to the entire length of the lower kuiseb river using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi we use ndvi from modis to track this vegetation green up and senescence cycles along the kuiseb river because ndvi is sensitive to vegetation changes particularly in dry regions helman et al 2014a b we also examine whether ndvi can serve as a practical tool first to identify occurrences of large floods in such arid regions and then for determining their peak and or volume magnitudes at least relatively results show that ndvi from modis captures well vegetation dynamics along the river figs 18 and 19 table 2 typically floods occur between january april at the following months of may and june ndvi reaches its maximum value and decays into a minimum in the following september february wetter flood seasons may affect the rate of decay of the ndvi maintaining its value relatively high for a longer duration so the impact of the flood can be detected even later into march august of the next season along the oasis ndvi is high at the greener upper reaches of the lower kuiseb river when the larger floods do reach and recharge at the driest channel sites of swartbank and rooibank ndvi changes abruptly and the maximum ndvi values are well correlated with flood volumes following the wet seasons of 2005 6 and 2008 9 the higher flood volumes in january february increased the wetness in the alluvium and filled the aquifers this was followed by an increase in ndvi between may july the austral summer of 2010 11 december 2010 to mid may 2011 marks the record high of flow days 100 days and flood volume 160 mm3 the flood recharged the aquifers to the surface of the channel bed allowing rapid growth of the vegetation and seed germination ndvi responded with large peaks in may 2011 ndvi 0 3 0 38 and 0 49 for gobabeb swartbank and rooibank respectively these were the highest values in 2000 2016 the flood reached gobabeb on january 31 2011 and a few days later the swartbank pumping site in regular years the average ndvi maxima was 0 26 for mid june however in the wet season of 2010 11 the same value was reached two months earlier in mid april 2011 while maximum ndvi was documented in mid may table 2 rooibank ndvi 0 49 following the wet year of 2011 above normal ndvi baseline values were maintained for two consecutive years 5 discussion 5 1 floods and aquifer recharge the oasis along the lower kuiseb river exclusively depends on rare but distinctively long duration floods that originated on the higher and wetter headwaters these long duration floods are necessary to fill up the farthermost oasis aquifers therefore only seven years with extreme floods since 1960 are responsible for 55 of the total aquifer recharge table 2 appendix mean annual recharge volume 13 mm3 y 1 is by far too low to support the aquifers level thus there is a need for the largest floods exceeding volume of 25 mm3 y 1 to recover the aquifers from normal drought intervals these floods seem to be frequent enough to clear the river valley from the northward invading dunes this maintains the kuiseb river as the sharp boundary between the namib sand sea to the south and the gravel plains to the north for at least the last few millennia the area southwest of gobabeb toward the kuiseb river delta and walvis bay fig 9 preserve evidence of buried west oriented paleochannels indicating that dunes may have deflected the kuiseb river to the north in contrast the tsondab tsauchab and the duuwisib rivers all are located south of the kuiseb river currently terminate in pans blocked by the namib sand sea since at least the late pleistocene e g brook et al 2006 stone et al 2010 the shape of the elongated kuiseb river oasis is in part the result of these namib dunes migrating northward on top of the relatively permeable schist bedrock following extreme floods the near surface groundwater level and the direct evaporation from the river bed modern water abstraction evapotranspiration and other still speculated losses such as paleochannels and downstream flow towards the river delta e g bgr 1998 klaus et al 2008 affect the groundwater decline rate at lower groundwater levels the low capillary forces of sand 0 12 0 6 m hellwig 1973 practically prevent deeper water or moisture from fast direct evaporation in this dry and hot desert therefore the drawdown of the aquifer under lower water table stages is primarily the result of the evapotranspiration losses by the dense vegetation during severe long droughts recharge into the kuiseb river shallow aquifers at swartbank rooibank aquifers decreases by an order of magnitude e g from a total of 93 mm3 for the eight years of 1968 9 1975 6 down to a total of 7 4 mm3 for the subsequent eight years of 1976 7 1983 4 three of these years 1979 80 1981 2 show near zero recharge volumes along the oasis huntley 1985 during this hydroclimatic drought a high tree mortality was observed especially noticed along the upper oasis and less so in downstream reaches huntley 1985 based on our survey and the flood routing model of morin et al 2009 the aquifer of the upper reach is relatively small both narrow and shallow and therefore its dense and tall forest relies on the recharge generated by the usually more frequent floods in the reach just downstream of the canyon mouth this reach is characterized by 6 5 yearly average aquifer replenishment in comparison with only 1 2 at the swartbank and 0 7 at rooibank aquifer at the upper oasis reach frequent floods recharge the aquifers by fresh floodwater therefore the water quality in the aquifer under the active channel is best gradually decreasing towards the aquifer edges in turn this allows faidherbia albida a species of wetter regions to flourish in this desert environment on the terraces bordering the active channel and feed of the freshest water however this tree is also the most sensitive to the deterioration in water quality during droughts and therefore experience high mortality unexpected is the high mortality during drought intervals of the tamarix usneoides which is a highly arid saline tolerated tree species this species of tree grows away from the channel at the farther edge of the terraces relying on the poor quality or practically saline water we propose that during longer droughts there is a further deterioration of water salinity when groundwater level drops to a level that allows inflow of even more saline water from the crystalline basement rocks at the edge of the aquifer gravel plains fig 3 klaus et al 2008 eckardt et al 2013b therefore the trees do not survive and die out the acacia erioloba with its characteristic deep roots in dry sandy soils show almost no response to the drought in these upper reaches in contrast with this upper reach the swartbank rooibank reach is characterized by permanently dry conditions therefore drought tolerating tree species survive even the longer drought intervals we observed germination of other tree species along the active channel near gobabeb following the 2006 flood however their survival time was brief probably up to a few seasons for example the extremely wet 2010 11 season generated the longest flood duration and volume on record as recharge is highly dependent on flood duration morin et al 2009 the flood wetted the channel islands and low lying floodplain allowed a vast seed germination this flood also recharged the aquifers through the channel and groundwater levels reached the surface similar to the wet 2005 6 season two months later the entire length of the river valley showed a widespread increase in vegetation this was also detected by the highest ndvi during that specific season since 2000 fig 18 even at the downstream rooibank reach the ndvi reached 0 5 these high ndvi values were maintained for two consecutive years which was in accordance with the relatively high aquifer levels that probably pushed the saline water away from the channel edges then a rapid decline from near surface aquifer levels at rates of 0 2 0 5 mm h 1 1 7 4 3 m y 1 was followed closely by a decrease in ndvi back to its normal values after two consecutive years fig 18 this fast response of the vegetation to large floods and recharge indicate that high ground water levels especially in lower reaches affect the vegetation only by the high flood stage or by the exceptionally long duration of the flood that enables filling the aquifer later the roots of the newly germinating trees cannot follow down the rate of water level decline in addition the vegetation is likely affected by the inflowing saline water that overcomes the freshening by the flood recharge this causes a vast almost synchronous mortality of juvenile trees in the lower reaches at first a fast decline in near surface water levels is likely caused by direct evaporation then a further decline probably take place due to water losses via transpiration by the increased vegetation this may explain the observation of an expansive mortality of juvenile trees along the lower reaches near swartbank and rooibank of the kuiseb river with dense stands of relatively young dead trees that all seem to be of the same age later under lowered aquifer levels direct evaporation is limited and the evapotranspiration is reduced to minimum due to the decrease in the number of surviving trees in addition the lower hydraulic gradient limited horizontal flow down the aquifer this results in a decline in the rate of the lowering of the water table of the aquifer to 0 06 0 08 mm h 1 0 5 m y 1 similar lowering rates were recorded also below the active channel and the floodplain near gobabeb fig 14 floods over the dry kuiseb river channel bed recharge the aquifer in a relatively constant infiltration rate of 8 5 mm h 1 the wetting front which is characterized by up to 15 water content fig 15 dahan et al 2008 propagates down within and through the vadose zone full saturation and rising of the water table occur at a rate of 70 100 mm h 1 hence flow duration which in turn allows longer duration of recharge under the limited infiltration becomes the important factor in recharging the aquifer during floods in addition the slow recharge rate during the first flood in a season may indicate that recharge occurs only by floods longer than 2 5 days out of the 134 floods that occurred in 1960 1 2005 6 80 floods lasted 1 day based on the gobabeb record with a total 325 flood days i e with an average of seven flood days per year table 2 appendix the aquifer below the active channel in this gobabeb reach rises at a rate of 96 mm h 1 fig 16 under the floodplain terrace the groundwater when at 4 m starts to rise with a lag time ranging from 18 h to 10 days with rising rates exceeding only 21 mm h 1 when the aquifer level rises due to the progress of the flood the unsaturated zone gradually becomes saturated dissolving and releasing the preexisting soluble salts into the ground water amiaz et al 2011 after the flood evaporation and evapotranspiration reduce the aquifer level and degrade the quality of the water and salts deposit in the sediment above ground water fluvial processes in the active channel and the water level in the aquifer dictate the depth of the root rich layer that reaches the channel from the channel edge and floodplain fig 10 this layer is limited to depths of 0 8 1 5 m below the channel bed this is probably the optimum depth for the roots to survive higher roots are being affected by cut and fill cycles of the sediments in the channel bed during floods which reached a depth of 0 63 m during the 1 2 2006 flood long term scour depth of 0 5 1 3 m measured in ephemeral desert rivers israel lekach et al 2006 deeper roots are occasionally submerged for long enough duration by the relatively high aquifer levels fig 10 and therefore they do not survive 5 2 model of the aquifer recharge and decline summary fig 10 1 initial stage during the long dry winter direct evaporation from the active channel surfaces the dense vegetation evapotranspirational processes and the lateral flow cause decline in groundwater level at a rate of 5 0 5 m y 1 fig 14 depending on the exact level as the groundwater declines saline water from the subsurface of the gravel plains and from saline springs penetrates the aquifer and gradually degrades its water quality from the right bank towards the center 2 following the long dry winter summer convective storms over the high plateau generate floods that reach the oasis about two days later the first floodwater over the dry 5 moisture oasis riverbed starts propagating below the active channel down to the aquifer at a constant rate of 8 10 mm h 1 the wetting front increases the moisture of the vadose zone up to 15 which is still below saturation and reaches the groundwater more than two days later as measured in gobabeb in 2006 only then the groundwater starts increasing its level at a rate of 60 100 mm h 1 with the fresh floodwaters located just beneath the active channel the rising of the groundwater under the active channel generates a local water mound that pushes laterally the older and relatively saline water below the nearby terraces this is noticeable 2 10 days after the flood depending on the groundwater stage and distance from the active channel fig 16 3 the trees that are sensitive to saline water grow on the 1st terrace near the active channel where the groundwater is replenished more frequently by floods the less sensitive trees grow at a distance on the higher terraces 5 3 ndvi as a detector of flood occurrences as already discussed flood duration is the most important factor in recharging the aquifers in this arid environment and therefore influences and shows high correlation r2 0 87 with the ndvi the influence of extreme flood recharge events on the ndvi is particularly noticed along the drier downstream oasis section where the wider valley fig 4c and fewer arriving floods result in higher vegetation sensitivity with almost an instantaneous response of the vegetation to floods however as floods peaks volume infiltration transmission and duration are cross correlated they all influence the ndvi but with lower correlation low ndvi values are usually detected during drought and regular years while ndvi peaks to a maximum following an extreme flood at rooibank ndvi ranges between 0 12 and 0 5 in dry and flooding years respectively fig 17 table 2 at the upstream oasis section near the canyon mouth frequent floods recharge the aquifer and maintain a fresher water table this result in relatively permanent dense vegetation that respond only to drought years our results indicate that high ndvi values correspond with extreme duration and volume of flood peak discharge seems less important therefore ndvi determines occurrences of large floods reaching the lower kuiseb river and of a wet hydrological seasons and specific flooding transmission losses and recharge in the lower reaches determining the relative magnitudes of these floods is more difficult but possible b seasonal and multi year long droughts in the middle reaches and c multi year droughts in the upper reaches of streams crossing hyperarid regions this shows promise for indirect flood monitoring in remote arid and hyperarid areas elsewhere 5 4 global perspective most of the streams which cross the namib desert head at semiarid environments and at altitudes of 1000 2000 m such settings allow storms to generate rainfall runoff floods in contrast with snow or rain on snow of various magnitudes and durations permitting quite long transmitting flows downstream without being fed by additional discharge in tributaries heading in the hyperarid area therefore the specific peak discharge is significantly lower than elsewhere greenbaum et al 2006 amponsah et al 2018 such flood hydrology patterns are common in other streams of the arid and hyperarid world schick 1988 that are characterized by wetter headwaters and long channel experiencing no rainfall for example such discharge losses were reported in a the long stream flooding from monsoonal headwaters to the internal closed basins of australia e g knighton et al 2002 b the very long streams draining the atlas into the sahara e g dubief 1953 vanney 1960 c the western deserts of the united states e g enzel et al 1992 and d the sinai negev arabian streams all ungauged basins in these environments can be the target of the methodology presented here in addition ndvi based detection of large floods can be applied for the very rare floods in the driest areas of the atacama desert which experience the lower end of the mean annual rainfall of the namib this can be used also in the other ephemeral streams of the namib to detect individual basin and regional flood occurrences and flood frequency as we show in fig 20 ndvi has been shown to react to rainfall events in arid regions with a strong correlation to several plant related traits such as leaf development and biomass as well as biophysical process like evapotranspiration helman et al 2014a b 2015a b 2017 the above strong correlation between spectral based vegetation indices such as ndvi and vegetation dynamics as well as the global and continuous temporal coverage of satellites opens the opportunity for using these indices in remote and ungauged arid and hyperarid regions to show that this practice depicts a clear signal we present here the ndvi for the three rivers south of the kuiseb river draining into and blocked by the namib sand sea these tsondab tsauchab and duwisib rivers basins a c in fig 1 with catchment areas of 4400 6000 km2 are located 90 250 km south of the kuiseb river the lower rainfall in their headwaters see fig 1 increases the sensitivity of the vegetation along their courses and therefore floods are better detected by the time series of ndvi variability fig 20 6 conclusions the sand filled lower kuiseb river channel is an excellent long term aquifer water storage with relatively low capillary force in the sand and the permeable bedrock groundwater decline is accelerated by evapotranspiration in the extremely dry and hot namib desert the existence and spatial and temporal variabilities of the valley aquifers and their dependent green oasis along the lower kuiseb river rely on rare and extreme floods for example as low as seven floods are responsible for 55 of the total aquifer recharge during the five decades of 1960 1 2005 6 regularly occurring annual floods are insufficient to support the levels in the aquifers along the lower reaches of the kuiseb river the simple ndvi is a most sensitive indicator of occurrences of such extreme floods especially along the lower and commonly drier river reaches that respond only to such rare floods and wet years during extreme floods the water levels in the aquifers rise to near surface levels allowing for fast plant growth following its germination by the wetting of the channel and terraces during the subsequent 1 2 years green up was supported by the surface wetting and by the high aquifer levels this variability in the channels eco hydrology is recorded by the ndvi the link between flora response and extreme floods indicates that ndvi is a tool for recording the history of wet dry hydrological seasons or individual floods in remote ungauged basins the upstream oasis section benefits from the better aquifer conditions with an average yearly replenishment rate of 4 5 in comparison with only 0 9 replenishment downstream at swartbank rooibank over four years long droughts result in deterioration in water quality increased salinity lower aquifer water level sand incursion into the channel and high tree mortalities high mortality of trees of species of wetter origin is observed also along the upstream oasis section at the millennial to quaternary time scale rare floods are still frequent enough to clear the valley from the invading sand dunes advancing north the water transmitted by first flood of a season and flowing over the dry riverbed propagate down to the aquifer at an approximately constant rate of 8 5 mm h 1 and reaches the water table aquifer within 2 hrs therefore only longer floods approximately 40 of floods can affect aquifer levels throughout all the floods the entire vadose zone remains unsaturated with relatively low moisture content 10 to 15 the infiltration is regulated in part by the near surface sediments as the propagated water reaches down to the groundwater level the level starts rising at a rate of 70 100 mm h 1 and 200 mm h 1 during the subsequent floods in the same season full vadose zone saturation is achieved only by such rising of the groundwater the root layer below the active channel is constrained to depths of 0 8 to 1 5 m i e to survive the optimal depth for the roots must be below the active sand in the channel that undergoes cut and fill during floods 0 60 m and still not submerged by the groundwater credit authorship contribution statement tamir grodek conceptualization methodology validation visualization writing

5778,flood is a very destructive natural disaster in the world which seriously threatens the safety of human life and property in this paper the most popular convolutional neural network cnn is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in shangyou county china the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows first the cnn technique is used for flood susceptibility mapping through two different cnn classification and feature extraction frameworks second three data presentation methods are designed in the cnn architecture to fit the two proposed frameworks to construct the proposed cnn based methods 13 flood triggering factors related to historical flood events in the study area were prepared the performance of these cnn based methods was evaluated using several objective criteria in comparison to the conventional support vector machine svm classifier experiments results demonstrate that all the cnn based methods can produce more reliable and practical flood susceptibility maps for example the proposed cnn based classifiers were 0 022 0 054 higher than svm in terms of area under the curve auc in addition in the classification process cnn based feature extraction can effectively improve the prediction capability of svm by 0 021 0 051 in terms of auc therefore the proposed cnn frameworks can help mitigate and manage floods keywords flood susceptibility mapping convolution neural network classification feature extraction china 1 introduction floods are one of the most common and catastrophic geo hazards that are poorly comprehended tehrany et al 2014a the severe impact of floods on natural ecosystems and human activities has greatly affected economic and social sustainability rahmati et al 2015 therefore it is essential to identify flood prone zones to prevent or mitigate adverse effects of flooding bathrellos et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 in the past few years various statistical and machine learning ml methods have been successfully applied in flood susceptibility mapping fsm bui et al 2019b mojaddadi et al 2017 statistical methods are mainly based on the assumption that historical flood events are closely related to flood predisposing factors including frequency ratio rahmati et al 2016 tehrany et al 2015a logistic regression youssef et al 2015a weights of evidence tehrany et al 2014b youssef et al 2015b analytic hierarchy process kazakis et al 2015 and multiple criteria decision liu et al 2018 santos et al 2019a santos et al 2019b wang et al 2019b recently ml techniques have been applied for flood prediction such as artificial neural network bui et al 2019a kia et al 2012 decision tree choubin et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 tehrany et al 2013 random forest rizeei et al 2018 and support vector machine svm choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014b tehrany et al 2015a tehrany et al 2015b in general when applying an ml method to solve a particular problem feature engineering is a critical step that obtains an appropriate feature representation from the raw data e g pixel values of the image prior to data modeling furthermore the performance of ml methods depends to a large extent on the representation of the raw data goodfellow et al 2016 in this sense ml methods cannot directly uncover instructive representations from raw data nor can they obtain new insights from these representations thus further improving predictive capability lecun et al 2015 more recently deep learning as one of the most popular ml techniques has received widespread attention because it is able to obtain reliable results comparable to or superior to conventional ml methods schmidhuber 2015 this technique includes a broad class of methods for computer vision signal processing and natural language processing with multiple network architectures graves et al 2013 hinton et al 2012 sutskever et al 2014 among various deep learning methods a convolutional neural network cnn with architecture inspired by biological visual perception can identify representation with extreme variability through convolutional and pooling layers wang et al 2019a gebrehiwot et al have successfully applied cnn to identify flood ranges using unmanned aerial vehicle data gebrehiwot et al 2019 moreover several feature engineering methods of correlation based information gain ratio and multi collinearity analysis have been used in flood susceptibility analysis bui et al 2019b khosravi et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 therefore since cnns can get rid of the tedious feature engineering steps and extract useful information directly from the original data they can play an important role in fsm although cnns are more accurate than the state of the art ml methods in many fields ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 salamon and bello 2017 simard et al 2003 yu et al 2017 few studies have applied this technique in fsm choosing mapping units is a key step for flood susceptibility modelling when applying the ml method in fsm grid cells pixels are commonly used mapping units that have the advantage of being easier to process bui et al 2019a das 2019a termeh et al 2018 essentially fsm is a binary classification task that determines whether a pixel will be a flood point and predicts its probability of occurrence in the fsm process each grid cell is considered as a feature vector that contains information about different triggering factors which can be processed by the ml methods therefore the entire study area can be regarded as a multi channel image where each channel represents a flood triggering factor layer which makes it possible to apply the cnn technique to flood susceptibility analysis in this paper the cnn framework is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in shangyou county china cnns can use different convolutional operations to extract various information from different data modalities the three main contributions of this paper are outlined as follows first to the best of our knowledge the application of cnn in fsm is still very rare we explore the feasibility of cnns in fsm in this study second two cnn frameworks for fsm are presented specifically for the first framework the cnn model is used directly as a classifier to assess flood susceptibility for the second framework cnn is integrated with the svm classifier in a hybrid manner 1 the cnn model is used to extract powerful and useful representation of flood triggering factors and 2 the svm classifier is selected for classification with the extracted features third three data presentation methods are designed in the cnn architecture to adapt to the classification and feature extraction in the fsm process to validate and compare the predictive capability of the proposed cnn based methods to svm several objective criteria of overall accuracy oa kappa coefficient k receiver operating characteristic roc and area under roc curve auc were used 2 study area and available data 2 1 study area shangyou county is located in the southern part of jiangxi province china and is in the northern hilly district of nanling the study site covers an area of approximately 1543 km2 between 25 42 n to 26 01 n and 114 00 e to 114 40 e the shangyou district has a total population of approximately 3 22 million and the elevation ranges between 110 and 1901 m above sea level fig 1 shangyou county is located in the southern subtropical zone and belongs to the humid monsoon climate zone in the subtropical hilly region in this study area the climate is mild rainfall is abundant sunshine is sufficient four seasons are distinct and the frost free period is long specifically the average annual rainfall during 1959 2014 ranged between 933 7 and 2147 6 mm according to the shangyou meteorological bureau the rainfall displays a great difference in spring and summer and the annual rainy season in the shangyou district is from april to august the average annual sunshine time is 1708 3 h which is an intermediate level in jiangxi province and the average annual temperature is 18 6 c moreover january and july are the coldest and hottest month with an average temperature of 2 7 and 38 c respectively vegetation coverage accounts for more than 95 of the study area mainly including farmland forests and grasslands meanwhile the study area is rich in water resources the annual average runoff of surface water in shangyou county is 3 52 billion cubic meters the groundwater is mainly loose pore water bedrock fissure water and underground hot water in short from a climate perspective the study area is rich in precipitation and extreme weather events as a result it is vulnerable to climatic factors that cause flooding 2 2 flood inventory mapping a flood inventory map records the locations of the inundated area and provides detailed information about the characteristics of historical flood events santos et al 2019a zazo et al 2018 in this study a flood inventory map with 108 historical flood events was provided by the jiangxi meteorological bureau 1 1 http www weather org cn and the department of civil affairs of jiangxi province 2 2 http www jxmzw gov cn as shown in fig 1 the locations of flood events were obtained through historical records extensive field surveys and visual interpretation of google earth images all the sampling points in fig 1 represent where the flood occurred and were used to produce training and validation sets 76 locations 70 were randomly selected for training whereas 32 locations 30 were used for validation moreover the same number of non flood locations 76 and 32 were randomly selected from the area free of flood to construct the training and validation sets 2 3 flood triggering factors according to the literature review arabameri et al 2019 khosravi et al 2019 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 and characteristics of the study area 13 flood triggering factors were selected for fsm including altitude aspect curvature slope stream power index spi sediment transport index sti and topographic wetness index twi lithology land use normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil distance to rivers and rainfall altitude is a frequently used flood triggering factor and lower altitudes are usually accompanied by higher river discharge bout and jetten 2018 sowmya et al 2015 wang et al 2016 aspect is the orientation or direction of the maximum slope of the terrain surface and influences hydrologic conditions because different orientations face different effects of precipitation and solar radiation bathrellos et al 2018 xu et al 2016 curvature describes the degree of distortion of the slope surface and reflects the morphology of the topography in a given area mojaddadi et al 2017 the curvature layer can be computed from digital elevation model dem data using the fourth order surface model zevenbergen and thorne 1987 slope directly affects surface runoff and vertical percolation since water flows from higher to lower altitude chaabani et al 2018 spi represents the performance of river sediment transport and fluvial channel erosion pamučar et al 2017 and is calculated as follows moore and wilson 1992 1 spi a s tan β where a s is the area of the basin and β is the slope gradient in degrees sti qualitatively explains the process of erosion and deposition tehrany et al 2015a and is calculated as follows moore et al 1993 2 sti a s 22 13 0 6 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where the parameters in eq 2 are defined the same as spi twi is a physical attribute that reflects the situation of geotechnical wetness chapi et al 2017 and is calculated as follows beven and kirkby 1979 3 twi ln α tan β where α and β represent the upslope area per unit contour length and the slope angle respectively lithology determines the geological engineering characteristics of the study area arabameri et al 2019 hong et al 2018b and the lithological classes of the study area are described in table 1 land use contributes to flood occurrence because it may alter flood runoff and sediment transport das 2019b rizeei et al 2018 ndvi can accurately display surface vegetation coverage liang et al 2017 and is calculated as follows 4 ndvi r nir r r r nir r r where r nir and r r represent the spectral reflectance acquired in near infrared region and in red region respectively different soil surface characteristics have diverse potential of water storage which significantly affect the water balance hong et al 2018a the distance to rivers indicates the distance from river networks which are the main pathways for flood discharge and expansion gigovíc et al 2017 gonzález arqueros et al 2018 qazi et al 2016 continuous rainfall events recharge basins and aquifers and thus the average annual rainfall was always considered as a flood triggering factor arnell and gosling 2016 tehrany et al 2015b the related information on all the triggering factors is listed in table 2 it should be noted that the land use factor was obtained by classifying a landsat 7 etm satellite image scene id le71220422001324sgs00 obtained on november 20 2001 using the maximum likelihood algorithm with an oa above 85 and the river networks were extracted from the topographic map and the distance to rivers factor was calculated using euclidean tool all the factor layers were converted into a raster format with a grid size of 30 30 m that corresponds to the spatial size of the dem data all the continuous factors were reclassified into categorical classes using arcgis software based on the previous studies chen 2019 gigović et al 2017 gonzález arqueros et al 2018 mojaddadi et al 2017 the characteristics of flood spatial distributions and the numerical range of these factors the reclassification maps of all the flood triggering factors are shown in fig 2 3 methodology the flowchart of the proposed methodology to identify flood susceptibility zones is illustrated in fig 3 specifically a flood inventory map and flood triggering factors are first prepared to construct training and validation sets then three data representation forms are used to train different dimensional cnn architectures next the trained cnn architectures are applied for classification and feature extraction in the fsm process finally the prediction results obtained by different cnn based methods are quantitatively evaluated using several objective criteria 3 1 svm svm can map original data into high dimensional feature space by using kernel functions cortes and vapnik 1995 and attempt to find an optimal hyperplane that separates true and false classes vapnik 1999 recently it has been widely used in flood susceptibility assessment choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014b tehrany et al 2015b assuming that a training set x x 1 x 2 x n r b n consists of two classes that denoted as l 1 1 the aim of svm is to ensure hyperplane margin maximization and error minimization the error minimization is expressed as follows 5 min w ξ i b 1 2 w 2 c i ξ i s t y i w ϕ x i b 1 ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 l where w is the weight vector b denotes the bias ξ i is the slack variables for non separable data and c denotes the penalty parameter the optimization 1 is solved as follows 6 max α i i 1 l α i 1 2 i 1 j 1 l α i α j y i y j k x x i s t 0 α i c i 1 l α i y i 0 where α i is lagrange multipliers and k x x i is the kernel function the decision function is written as follows 7 f x i 1 l α i y i k x x i b the svm with the radial basis function rbf kernel can achieve excellent performance in classification prediction tasks due to the following facts first the rbf kernel can map a sample to a higher dimensional space and the linear kernel function is essentially a special case of rbf meanwhile the kernel of rbf and sigmoid have similar performance with certain parameters second compared with the polynomial kernel function only a few parameters need to be modulated by rbf and the number of kernel function parameters directly influences the complexity of this function finally the rbf kernel has less numerical difficulties 3 2 data representations for cnns as a powerful technique cnn structures of different dimensions can be constructed to adapt to input data of different dimensions which can greatly affect final classification prediction results in addition the representation of raw data is crucial because cnn is based on the principle of locality li et al 2019 in this section three data representations will be introduced to fit the novel cnn architectures as illustrated in fig 4 initially 13 flood triggering factor layers are stacked together to build a multi channel image with a spatial resolution of 30 m which is regarded as input data for further data transformation to clarity the three data representations are briefly described as follows 1 for the one dimensional data form in fig 4 a each pixel vector is considered as an image with several flood triggering attributes hidden in each pixel specifically the input data consists of a set of column vectors whose length is determined by the number of flood triggering factors each element in the vector represents the corresponding flood predisposing factor s attribute value 2 as shown on the right side of fig 4 a the two dimensional data form is derived from one dimensional data the most critical issue is how to construct a bridge from a one dimensional vector to a two dimensional matrix in this study each pixel vector in the multi channel image is converted into an n n matrix in a specific way where n is the maximum between the number of flood triggering factors and the number of categories in which each factor is reclassified for example there are 13 flood triggering factors in the study area which are larger than the maximum categories 9 of the aspect and lithology factors thus a value of 13 is assigned to n then each value in the pixel vector one dimensional data is expanded into a row vector of length 13 specifically the fourth element of 6 the attribute value of the distance to rivers factor in the pixel vector is converted into a row vector of 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 in which the sixth and other elements of the vector are assigned values of 1 and 0 respectively finally all row vectors form a 13 13 matrix two dimensional data 3 in the case of three dimensional data each pixel and its adjacent pixels form a three dimensional window patch as shown in fig 4 b the patch has the same label as the current pixel assuming the window size is 5 each data sample is 13 5 5 3 3 cnn architectures cnns exhibiting robust performance in computer vision and image processing fields are basically multilayer feed forward neural networks that can automatically extract valuable features from raw data zhang et al 2018 the cnn architecture is mainly composed of an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer and the hidden layers consist of one or more convolutional and pooling layers ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 lecun et al 2015 the convolutional layer that consists of several convolution kernels iteratively extracts sophisticated and effective features from the original data canziani et al 2016 mallat 2016 the pooling sub sample layer is usually carried out after a convolutional layer to reduce the dimensionality of feature maps through a down sampling algorithm which can avoid overfitting and reduce computational cost chen et al 2016 moreover cnns have strong adaptive capability and can achieve excellent performance when facing different dimensional data shin et al 2016 in this section three different dimensional cnn architectures are developed for regional flood susceptibility analysis 3 3 1 1d cnn the 1d cnn structure is comprised of five layers of an input layer a convolutional layer a max pooling layer a fully connected layer and an output layer which was developed and trained using one dimensional data assuming that there are n flood triggering factors in the input data n convolutional kernels with a size of a 1 to filter the input data the resultant layer has n feature vectors each grid cell is connected to an a 1 neighborhood in the input vector a b 1 max pooling layer is immediately used after the first convolutional layer which can reduce the length of feature vectors a fully connected layer with k neural units follows the max pooling layer to reorganize the extracted representations finally m neural units are viewed as the output of the network fig 5 shows the architecture of 1d cnn 3 3 2 2d cnn the two dimensional cnn structure consists of two convolutional layers two max pooling layers and one fully connected layer assuming that the input data is an n n image and the first convolutional layer has n kernels with a size of a a which can produce n feature maps the size of feature maps is reduced by half with the depth remaining unchanged after applying a b b max pooling operation the resulting feature maps are sent to the second convolutional layer that has m kernels with a size of a a then the resultant m feature maps are sent to the second b b max pooling layer and a fully connected layer with k neural units are used to recognize these extracted features finally m neural units are regarded as the output of the 2d cnn architecture fig 6 shows the structure of 2d cnn 3 3 3 3d cnn the 3d cnn structure contains one convolutional layer one max pooling layer and two fully connected layers assuming that each input data can be represented as a c n n matrix n convolutional kernels with a size of a a a to filter the input data the resultant layer has n feature maps the b b b max pooling layer is used to reduce the size of feature maps by half then two fully connected layers with k neural units are used to reorganize the extracted information finally the output layer containing m neural units representing the final result of the whole network fig 7 shows the structure of 3d cnn 3 3 4 hyperparameters of cnn hyperparameters setting is a key step in building a cnn architecture lecun et al 2015 and this section illustrates some related hyperparameters specifically the sizes of the convolutional kernel and the pooling kernel determine the scale of the convolution and pooling operations respectively choi et al 2017 golik et al 2015 simard et al 2003 the activation function converts a linear relationship to a nonlinear relationship so that the neural network can approximate any nonlinear function audebert et al 2019 chen et al 2016 dahl et al 2013 mou et al 2017 the loss function is used to measure the degree of inconsistency between the predicted value and the true value chen et al 2014 james and stein 1992 nourani et al 2015 ranjbar et al 2018 singh 1997 in addition the optimizer is used to iteratively update parameters at different learning rates through a gradient descent algorithm hinton et al 2012 adagrad is a widely used optimizer because it can automatically adjust the learning rate based on the gradient value of the independent variable in each dimension thereby avoiding the problem of difficulty in adapting to the unified learning rate in all dimensions duchi et al 2011 paoletti et al 2018 schmidhuber 2015 the learning rate is critical to the training process because it controls the learning speed of the cnn architecture marmanis et al 2016 salamon and bello 2017 3 4 fsm using cnns cnns are characterized with local connections and sharing weights and their main advantage is to effectively extract spatial information and automatically optimized network parameters krizhevsky et al 2012 lecun et al 1998 to explore the predictive capability of the cnn framework two different perspectives of classification and feature extraction are proposed in flood susceptibility analysis specifically in the first perspective cnns are directly used as classifiers for fsm whereas in the second perspective a hybrid framework is developed by integrating cnns with the svm classifier and the cnns are used to extract more representative features from original data improving classical ml classifiers to achieve more effective prediction with these representative features 3 4 1 cnn classifiers as mentioned in section 3 2 and 3 3 cnns have achieved fairly good results in processing classification related tasks hu et al 2015 in the field of flood susceptibility assessment the main objective is to predict where a flood event will occur which can be treated as a binary classification process to label a given region with flood or non flood in this study the cnns are directly used as classifiers for regional flood spatial prediction the main steps of applying cnns for classification are summarized as follows first the original data are reformed according to the data representation methods previously mentioned in section 3 2 then a cnn structure is built based on the dimensionality of the reformed data after a series of convolutional and pooling operations the high level feature maps are extracted from the input data and then reorganized by a fully connected layer finally the reorganized feature vectors are converted to classification results using a nonlinear activation function for simplicity the generalized classification process using a cnn classifier with the 2d cnn architecture is shown in fig 8 3 4 2 integration of cnns and svm cnn is an effective ml technique that can discover new representations and relationships from the original data and these features are not easily uncovered through conventional methods bergen et al 2019 furthermore cnns can automatically extract image features including color shape texture and topological structures by using different combinations of neurons and learning rules which proved the great potential in feature extraction as well niu and suen 2012 in other fields the integration of cnns and svm has achieved promising results for example niu and suen niu and suen 2012 used a 2d cnn with five layers to extract features from mixed national institute of standards and technology data and applied svm for final classification also the hybrid method of cnn and svm was applied for microvascular morphological type recognition and hyperspectral image classification leng et al 2016 xue et al 2016 in this study different cnn structures are used to learn more suitable features from the original data based on this idea the main steps of integrating cnn and svm are summarized as follows first the original data is fed to the cnn structure in different dimensional styles then after several layers of convolution and pooling manipulations the hidden information of the input data is reorganized in the fully connected layer where the neural units are regarded as the extracted features in the following the svm classifier is trained using the extracted high level features finally this integrated framework is used to perform fsm specifically three different dimensional cnn feature extractors are proposed to learn high level features from the original data with the same structures mentioned in section 3 3 fig 9 illustrates the classification process using the 2d cnn architecture to extract features for an example 3 5 evaluation methods 3 5 1 feature evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of extracted features by cnns a similarity measure mean value of correlation coefficients among all the samples is used the greater the similarity of extracted features in the same class indicates that the input data is easier to discriminate for clarification the correlation coefficient is defined as follows goh et al 2007 8 ρ x 1 x 2 c x 1 x 2 d x 1 d x 2 where x 1 and x 2 represent two feature vectors c x 1 x 2 is a covariance matrix and d x 1 and d x 2 are the variance of x 1 and x 2 respectively 3 5 2 model evaluation recently the roc curve has been used to assess the performance of fsm models dano et al 2019 kazakis et al 2015 popovic et al 2018 specifically this curve is constructed using sensitivity on the y axis against 1 specificity on the x axis bradley 1997 moreover an auc value indicates the predictive capability as well choubin et al 2019 pamučar et al 2018b xia et al 2017 in particular an auc value of 1 indicates that there is a perfect spatial agreement between the observed and simulation data an auc value of 0 5 is the agreement that would be expected due to chance whereas a value of 0 considers a non informative result choubin et al 2019 fawcett 2006 tehrany et al 2014b in addition oa is another widely used criterion to assess the predictive performance of fsm models chapi et al 2017 hong et al 2018b rahmati et al 2016 and it is the proportion of the number of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels as follows 9 oa tp t n tp t n f p f n where tp true positive and tn true negative denote the number of flood and non flood grid cells that are correctly classified where fp false positive and fn false negative are the number of flood and non flood grid cells incorrectly classified respectively besides k is another powerful statistical criterion measuring the agreement or reliability between two raters pontius jr and millones 2011 for flood susceptibility assessment this criterion can evaluate the prediction accuracy of fsm models and a higher value implies better prediction khosravi et al 2018 mahmoud and gan 2018 this criterion is formulated as follows 10 κ p c p exp 1 p exp 11 p exp t p f n t p f p f p t n f n t n t p t n f n f p where p c is the proportion of samples that have been correctly classified and p exp means the expected probability of change agreement additionally a non parametric test of wilcoxon signed rank test was implemented to validate the statistical significance difference among different models wilcoxon et al 1970 the null hypothesis is based on the pre assumption that fsm models have no significance difference at a significance level of α 5 generally if the p value is smaller than 0 05 and the z value beyond the threshold of 1 96 the prior hypothesis is not true and rejected and the difference between two models is significant 4 results 4 1 building flood models and producing flood susceptibility maps in this subsection three different cnn architectures were constructed for classification and feature extraction in flood susceptibility analysis to this end three different dimensional training sets and validation sets were first prepared for subsequent cnn training and validation as described in section 3 3 then three different dimensional cnn structures were constructed and training sets of different dimensions were fed to the corresponding neural network with a certain number of iterations until the training process converges finally the trained cnn models were used for classification and feature extraction it should be noted that the window size is a key parameter for constructing a three dimensional data form therefore as shown in fig 10 analysis of window size is performed it can be observed that a 3d cnn model with a window size of 5 obtains the highest auc value in addition during the construction of the cnn structure the related hyperparameters were determined through a fine tuning step using the validation set referring to previous studies audebert et al 2019 hu et al 2014 maggiori et al 2017 shin et al 2016 table 3 reports all hyperparameters settings for different cnn architectures the aforementioned cnn structures were built in python under the keras framework 3 3 https keras io as the proposed cnn architectures were constructed and trained three cnn structures were applied to classification and feature extraction regarding cnns for classification 1d cnn 2d cnn and 3d cnn models were used to calculate the flood susceptibility index for each pixel for cnn for feature extraction the validity of the extracted features was evaluated using the similarity statistical index as shown in table 4 it can be observed that all the extracted features obtained by the 1d cnn 2d cnn and 3d cnn architectures have higher similarity than the original features which demonstrates that the extracted features are more efficient and easier to classify then the learned features were regarded as new representation vectors and sent to the svm model for classification and the susceptibility indexes were calculated by the hybrid methods of 1d cnn svm 2d cnn svm and 3d cnn svm after the susceptibility index of each grid cell in the study area was obtained by the fsm models these indices were automatically divided into five intervals of very low low moderate high and very high using the natural breaks jenks method jenks 1967 which has been widely used in the fsm process chapi et al 2017 dano et al 2019 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 the svm classifier with the rbf kernel is a robust method that has achieved good performance in fsm choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2015b zhao et al 2019 for comparison an svm classifier with the rbf kernel was used for fsm to demonstrate the effectiveness of a cnn based feature extractor the flood susceptibility maps produced by different cnn based methods and svm are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that very high susceptible zones have similar distributions and most floods are located in very high susceptible areas in order to quantitatively analyze the susceptibility maps the frequency of flood occurrence in the susceptible zones was analyzed and the results are shown in table 5 it can be observed that most floods are predicted in the high and very high susceptible areas and very few floods occur in very low susceptible areas which proves that there is relatively high consistency between historical flood events and susceptible zones for all the methods furthermore more than 80 of the historical flood events located in the very high susceptible areas confirmed the rationality of the flood susceptibility maps meanwhile all the cnn based methods achieved more reliable susceptibility maps because the frequency ratio of floods was higher than svm in the very high and high areas 4 2 model validation and comparison to evaluate the performance of all the methods the statistical criteria of oa and k were used as shown in table 6 it can be seen that all the cnn based methods achieved better performance than svm in terms of both oa and k for example the 1d cnn svm 2d cnn svm and 3d cnn svm methods were 1 57 4 69 and 0 0312 0 0937 higher than svm in terms of oa and k respectively moreover the 2d cnn svm method achieved the highest oa and k value among all the methods therefore the performance of svm can be further improved by using the features extracted by cnn fig 12 shows the roc curves of all the methods using the validation set experimental results demonstrated that all the cnn based methods had better prediction performance than svm in terms of auc specifically the highest auc value obtained by the 2d cnn method was 0 937 followed by 2d cnn svm 0 934 3d cnn 0 928 3d cnn svm 0 922 1d cnn 0 905 1d cnn svm 0 904 and svm 0 883 meanwhile when cnn was used for feature extraction in the classification process the auc value of svm can be increased by 0 021 0 051 furthermore the wilcoxon signed rank test was selected to verify the statistical difference between the proposed cnn based methods and the svm classifier when the significance level of p value is smaller than 0 05 and the z value exceeds 1 96 the difference between flood models is significant z values and the significant levels of different flood models are shown in table 7 it can be seen that all the comparative models are very different because the z value and p value of the significance level satisfy with the corresponding significant conditions mentioned in section 3 5 2 5 discussion it is a key prerequisite for preventing and reducing flood damage by conducting an appropriate fsm technique hong et al 2018a wang et al 2019b therefore it is necessary to explore the possibility of applying newly developed techniques in fsm in this paper the deep learning representative of cnn is considered for regional flood susceptibility analysis with a different perspective in shangyou county china as a popular and powerful technique cnn gradually shows great potential in classification prediction cnn architectures of different dimensions have been designed to solve various tasks with different data modalities lecun et al 2015 for example 1d cnn has been widely used for signal processing and sentence classification 2d cnn has been mainly used for image processing golik et al 2015 hu et al 2014 and 3d cnn has been developed for video related problems ji et al 2012 tran et al 2015 with regard to flood susceptibility analysis the sample in the study area is usually composed of a set of factor vectors in the form of one dimensional data chapi et al 2017 hong et al 2018a khosravi et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 and all the samples are input into the ml model for classification to fully explore the prediction capability of cnn in flood susceptibility assessment data forms of different dimensions were proposed to fit the corresponding cnn structure the one dimensional data form contains all the information about the flood triggering factors and 1d cnn architecture can take advantage of the local relationships between the flood triggering factors various flood triggering factors related to the morphological geological and hydrological conditions play a crucial role in constructing flood models mahmoud and gan 2018 rijal et al 2018 based on the fact that cnn has demonstrated the promising results in image processing anthimopoulos et al 2016 krizhevsky et al 2012 lecun et al 1998 a two dimensional data form is proposed to construct the cnn to analyze flood susceptibility in an image perspective this means that this data form can be regarded as a two dimensional extension of the feature vector by considering spatial information of the triggering factors as for the three dimensional data form it contains both attribute factor information and local terrain spatial information between pixels in a specific window it is significant for decision makers to produce reliable flood susceptibility maps to assess and prevent flood hazards termeh et al 2018 wang et al 2019c xia et al 2017 meanwhile it is a useful way to assess flood susceptibility maps using frequency analysis of flood occurrences in table 5 most floods occurred in the high and very high susceptible areas and few floods occurred in the very low susceptible areas which is consistent with previous studies bui et al 2019b chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 moreover the cnn based methods achieved a higher flood frequency than svm 89 81 reaching 92 59 97 22 in terms of the high and very high susceptible areas which proved that the cnn based methods can achieve more accurate and reliable susceptibility maps furthermore experimental results in table 6 and fig 12 demonstrated that all the proposed cnns obtained better results than svm in terms of oa k and auc svm learns the decision plane directly from the raw data while cnns can transform the raw data into useful representations that are important for model discrimination after convolution and pooling operations important features of input data are enhanced and irrelevant information is reduced furthermore the wilcoxon signed rank test in table 7 demonstrated that the statistical difference between the cnn based methods and svm is significant it was verified that the improvement in prediction accuracy brought by the cnn based methods is instructive for decision makers to consider adopting a novel cnn technique to obtain more accurate flood susceptibility maps in particular when the 2d cnn architecture was used directly as a classifier or feature extraction in the fsm process the reasons for obtaining the highest accuracy can be summarized as follows first as described in section 3 compared to the one dimensional data form the three dimensional data form contains not only attribute information but also local terrain spatial information however the three dimensional data form may contain redundant information that interferes with a classifier to distinguish true classification labels second the two dimensional data form not only makes the construction of the cnn network easier but also better displays the attribute information in the original data it should be noted in table 6 that some methods had the same oa and k values for example 1d cnn 3d cnn and 3d cnn svm obtained the same oa and k values of 84 38 and 0 6875 and 2d cnn and 1d cnn svm got the same oa and k values of 85 94 and 0 7188 respectively due to the very limited validation samples in addition the evaluation criteria of oa and k that mainly consider the final classification label may not accurately reflect the significant differences between the proposed fsm models but the roc curve technique is very sensitive to flood susceptibility indices therefore the roc curve and auc value can precisely show the reliable assessment results of the fsm methods which has been confirmed by other studies liu et al 2018 mukhametzyanov and pamucar 2018 pamučar et al 2018a zhao et al 2019 6 conclusions this paper studies the application of the cnn technique in fsm from two different perspectives in the case of shangyou county china first a spatial database containing 13 flood triggering factors and 108 historical flood events was prepared to construct the proposed methods the developed cnn architectures were then used to construct flood susceptibility models in two different ways of classification and feature extraction next flood susceptibility maps were obtained using the cnn based methods in comparison to svm finally several objective criteria of oa k roc and auc were used to compare and verify all the fsm methods the main conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 the proposed 1d cnn 2d cnn and 3d cnn classifiers achieved better prediction performance than svm in terms of auc which proves the superiority of the cnn frameworks 2 by using cnn for feature extraction the prediction capability of svm was effectively improved in particular the 2d cnn svm method achieved the highest accuracy in terms of oa k and auc 3 the proposed cnn based methods are expected to be used for flood disaster assessment and management meanwhile the application prospect of cnn can inspire more effective fsm techniques credit authorship contribution

5778,flood is a very destructive natural disaster in the world which seriously threatens the safety of human life and property in this paper the most popular convolutional neural network cnn is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in shangyou county china the main contributions of this study are summarized as follows first the cnn technique is used for flood susceptibility mapping through two different cnn classification and feature extraction frameworks second three data presentation methods are designed in the cnn architecture to fit the two proposed frameworks to construct the proposed cnn based methods 13 flood triggering factors related to historical flood events in the study area were prepared the performance of these cnn based methods was evaluated using several objective criteria in comparison to the conventional support vector machine svm classifier experiments results demonstrate that all the cnn based methods can produce more reliable and practical flood susceptibility maps for example the proposed cnn based classifiers were 0 022 0 054 higher than svm in terms of area under the curve auc in addition in the classification process cnn based feature extraction can effectively improve the prediction capability of svm by 0 021 0 051 in terms of auc therefore the proposed cnn frameworks can help mitigate and manage floods keywords flood susceptibility mapping convolution neural network classification feature extraction china 1 introduction floods are one of the most common and catastrophic geo hazards that are poorly comprehended tehrany et al 2014a the severe impact of floods on natural ecosystems and human activities has greatly affected economic and social sustainability rahmati et al 2015 therefore it is essential to identify flood prone zones to prevent or mitigate adverse effects of flooding bathrellos et al 2017 zhu et al 2015 in the past few years various statistical and machine learning ml methods have been successfully applied in flood susceptibility mapping fsm bui et al 2019b mojaddadi et al 2017 statistical methods are mainly based on the assumption that historical flood events are closely related to flood predisposing factors including frequency ratio rahmati et al 2016 tehrany et al 2015a logistic regression youssef et al 2015a weights of evidence tehrany et al 2014b youssef et al 2015b analytic hierarchy process kazakis et al 2015 and multiple criteria decision liu et al 2018 santos et al 2019a santos et al 2019b wang et al 2019b recently ml techniques have been applied for flood prediction such as artificial neural network bui et al 2019a kia et al 2012 decision tree choubin et al 2019 khosravi et al 2018 tehrany et al 2013 random forest rizeei et al 2018 and support vector machine svm choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014b tehrany et al 2015a tehrany et al 2015b in general when applying an ml method to solve a particular problem feature engineering is a critical step that obtains an appropriate feature representation from the raw data e g pixel values of the image prior to data modeling furthermore the performance of ml methods depends to a large extent on the representation of the raw data goodfellow et al 2016 in this sense ml methods cannot directly uncover instructive representations from raw data nor can they obtain new insights from these representations thus further improving predictive capability lecun et al 2015 more recently deep learning as one of the most popular ml techniques has received widespread attention because it is able to obtain reliable results comparable to or superior to conventional ml methods schmidhuber 2015 this technique includes a broad class of methods for computer vision signal processing and natural language processing with multiple network architectures graves et al 2013 hinton et al 2012 sutskever et al 2014 among various deep learning methods a convolutional neural network cnn with architecture inspired by biological visual perception can identify representation with extreme variability through convolutional and pooling layers wang et al 2019a gebrehiwot et al have successfully applied cnn to identify flood ranges using unmanned aerial vehicle data gebrehiwot et al 2019 moreover several feature engineering methods of correlation based information gain ratio and multi collinearity analysis have been used in flood susceptibility analysis bui et al 2019b khosravi et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 therefore since cnns can get rid of the tedious feature engineering steps and extract useful information directly from the original data they can play an important role in fsm although cnns are more accurate than the state of the art ml methods in many fields ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 salamon and bello 2017 simard et al 2003 yu et al 2017 few studies have applied this technique in fsm choosing mapping units is a key step for flood susceptibility modelling when applying the ml method in fsm grid cells pixels are commonly used mapping units that have the advantage of being easier to process bui et al 2019a das 2019a termeh et al 2018 essentially fsm is a binary classification task that determines whether a pixel will be a flood point and predicts its probability of occurrence in the fsm process each grid cell is considered as a feature vector that contains information about different triggering factors which can be processed by the ml methods therefore the entire study area can be regarded as a multi channel image where each channel represents a flood triggering factor layer which makes it possible to apply the cnn technique to flood susceptibility analysis in this paper the cnn framework is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in shangyou county china cnns can use different convolutional operations to extract various information from different data modalities the three main contributions of this paper are outlined as follows first to the best of our knowledge the application of cnn in fsm is still very rare we explore the feasibility of cnns in fsm in this study second two cnn frameworks for fsm are presented specifically for the first framework the cnn model is used directly as a classifier to assess flood susceptibility for the second framework cnn is integrated with the svm classifier in a hybrid manner 1 the cnn model is used to extract powerful and useful representation of flood triggering factors and 2 the svm classifier is selected for classification with the extracted features third three data presentation methods are designed in the cnn architecture to adapt to the classification and feature extraction in the fsm process to validate and compare the predictive capability of the proposed cnn based methods to svm several objective criteria of overall accuracy oa kappa coefficient k receiver operating characteristic roc and area under roc curve auc were used 2 study area and available data 2 1 study area shangyou county is located in the southern part of jiangxi province china and is in the northern hilly district of nanling the study site covers an area of approximately 1543 km2 between 25 42 n to 26 01 n and 114 00 e to 114 40 e the shangyou district has a total population of approximately 3 22 million and the elevation ranges between 110 and 1901 m above sea level fig 1 shangyou county is located in the southern subtropical zone and belongs to the humid monsoon climate zone in the subtropical hilly region in this study area the climate is mild rainfall is abundant sunshine is sufficient four seasons are distinct and the frost free period is long specifically the average annual rainfall during 1959 2014 ranged between 933 7 and 2147 6 mm according to the shangyou meteorological bureau the rainfall displays a great difference in spring and summer and the annual rainy season in the shangyou district is from april to august the average annual sunshine time is 1708 3 h which is an intermediate level in jiangxi province and the average annual temperature is 18 6 c moreover january and july are the coldest and hottest month with an average temperature of 2 7 and 38 c respectively vegetation coverage accounts for more than 95 of the study area mainly including farmland forests and grasslands meanwhile the study area is rich in water resources the annual average runoff of surface water in shangyou county is 3 52 billion cubic meters the groundwater is mainly loose pore water bedrock fissure water and underground hot water in short from a climate perspective the study area is rich in precipitation and extreme weather events as a result it is vulnerable to climatic factors that cause flooding 2 2 flood inventory mapping a flood inventory map records the locations of the inundated area and provides detailed information about the characteristics of historical flood events santos et al 2019a zazo et al 2018 in this study a flood inventory map with 108 historical flood events was provided by the jiangxi meteorological bureau 1 1 http www weather org cn and the department of civil affairs of jiangxi province 2 2 http www jxmzw gov cn as shown in fig 1 the locations of flood events were obtained through historical records extensive field surveys and visual interpretation of google earth images all the sampling points in fig 1 represent where the flood occurred and were used to produce training and validation sets 76 locations 70 were randomly selected for training whereas 32 locations 30 were used for validation moreover the same number of non flood locations 76 and 32 were randomly selected from the area free of flood to construct the training and validation sets 2 3 flood triggering factors according to the literature review arabameri et al 2019 khosravi et al 2019 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 and characteristics of the study area 13 flood triggering factors were selected for fsm including altitude aspect curvature slope stream power index spi sediment transport index sti and topographic wetness index twi lithology land use normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil distance to rivers and rainfall altitude is a frequently used flood triggering factor and lower altitudes are usually accompanied by higher river discharge bout and jetten 2018 sowmya et al 2015 wang et al 2016 aspect is the orientation or direction of the maximum slope of the terrain surface and influences hydrologic conditions because different orientations face different effects of precipitation and solar radiation bathrellos et al 2018 xu et al 2016 curvature describes the degree of distortion of the slope surface and reflects the morphology of the topography in a given area mojaddadi et al 2017 the curvature layer can be computed from digital elevation model dem data using the fourth order surface model zevenbergen and thorne 1987 slope directly affects surface runoff and vertical percolation since water flows from higher to lower altitude chaabani et al 2018 spi represents the performance of river sediment transport and fluvial channel erosion pamučar et al 2017 and is calculated as follows moore and wilson 1992 1 spi a s tan β where a s is the area of the basin and β is the slope gradient in degrees sti qualitatively explains the process of erosion and deposition tehrany et al 2015a and is calculated as follows moore et al 1993 2 sti a s 22 13 0 6 sin β 0 0896 1 3 where the parameters in eq 2 are defined the same as spi twi is a physical attribute that reflects the situation of geotechnical wetness chapi et al 2017 and is calculated as follows beven and kirkby 1979 3 twi ln α tan β where α and β represent the upslope area per unit contour length and the slope angle respectively lithology determines the geological engineering characteristics of the study area arabameri et al 2019 hong et al 2018b and the lithological classes of the study area are described in table 1 land use contributes to flood occurrence because it may alter flood runoff and sediment transport das 2019b rizeei et al 2018 ndvi can accurately display surface vegetation coverage liang et al 2017 and is calculated as follows 4 ndvi r nir r r r nir r r where r nir and r r represent the spectral reflectance acquired in near infrared region and in red region respectively different soil surface characteristics have diverse potential of water storage which significantly affect the water balance hong et al 2018a the distance to rivers indicates the distance from river networks which are the main pathways for flood discharge and expansion gigovíc et al 2017 gonzález arqueros et al 2018 qazi et al 2016 continuous rainfall events recharge basins and aquifers and thus the average annual rainfall was always considered as a flood triggering factor arnell and gosling 2016 tehrany et al 2015b the related information on all the triggering factors is listed in table 2 it should be noted that the land use factor was obtained by classifying a landsat 7 etm satellite image scene id le71220422001324sgs00 obtained on november 20 2001 using the maximum likelihood algorithm with an oa above 85 and the river networks were extracted from the topographic map and the distance to rivers factor was calculated using euclidean tool all the factor layers were converted into a raster format with a grid size of 30 30 m that corresponds to the spatial size of the dem data all the continuous factors were reclassified into categorical classes using arcgis software based on the previous studies chen 2019 gigović et al 2017 gonzález arqueros et al 2018 mojaddadi et al 2017 the characteristics of flood spatial distributions and the numerical range of these factors the reclassification maps of all the flood triggering factors are shown in fig 2 3 methodology the flowchart of the proposed methodology to identify flood susceptibility zones is illustrated in fig 3 specifically a flood inventory map and flood triggering factors are first prepared to construct training and validation sets then three data representation forms are used to train different dimensional cnn architectures next the trained cnn architectures are applied for classification and feature extraction in the fsm process finally the prediction results obtained by different cnn based methods are quantitatively evaluated using several objective criteria 3 1 svm svm can map original data into high dimensional feature space by using kernel functions cortes and vapnik 1995 and attempt to find an optimal hyperplane that separates true and false classes vapnik 1999 recently it has been widely used in flood susceptibility assessment choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2019 tehrany et al 2014b tehrany et al 2015b assuming that a training set x x 1 x 2 x n r b n consists of two classes that denoted as l 1 1 the aim of svm is to ensure hyperplane margin maximization and error minimization the error minimization is expressed as follows 5 min w ξ i b 1 2 w 2 c i ξ i s t y i w ϕ x i b 1 ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 l where w is the weight vector b denotes the bias ξ i is the slack variables for non separable data and c denotes the penalty parameter the optimization 1 is solved as follows 6 max α i i 1 l α i 1 2 i 1 j 1 l α i α j y i y j k x x i s t 0 α i c i 1 l α i y i 0 where α i is lagrange multipliers and k x x i is the kernel function the decision function is written as follows 7 f x i 1 l α i y i k x x i b the svm with the radial basis function rbf kernel can achieve excellent performance in classification prediction tasks due to the following facts first the rbf kernel can map a sample to a higher dimensional space and the linear kernel function is essentially a special case of rbf meanwhile the kernel of rbf and sigmoid have similar performance with certain parameters second compared with the polynomial kernel function only a few parameters need to be modulated by rbf and the number of kernel function parameters directly influences the complexity of this function finally the rbf kernel has less numerical difficulties 3 2 data representations for cnns as a powerful technique cnn structures of different dimensions can be constructed to adapt to input data of different dimensions which can greatly affect final classification prediction results in addition the representation of raw data is crucial because cnn is based on the principle of locality li et al 2019 in this section three data representations will be introduced to fit the novel cnn architectures as illustrated in fig 4 initially 13 flood triggering factor layers are stacked together to build a multi channel image with a spatial resolution of 30 m which is regarded as input data for further data transformation to clarity the three data representations are briefly described as follows 1 for the one dimensional data form in fig 4 a each pixel vector is considered as an image with several flood triggering attributes hidden in each pixel specifically the input data consists of a set of column vectors whose length is determined by the number of flood triggering factors each element in the vector represents the corresponding flood predisposing factor s attribute value 2 as shown on the right side of fig 4 a the two dimensional data form is derived from one dimensional data the most critical issue is how to construct a bridge from a one dimensional vector to a two dimensional matrix in this study each pixel vector in the multi channel image is converted into an n n matrix in a specific way where n is the maximum between the number of flood triggering factors and the number of categories in which each factor is reclassified for example there are 13 flood triggering factors in the study area which are larger than the maximum categories 9 of the aspect and lithology factors thus a value of 13 is assigned to n then each value in the pixel vector one dimensional data is expanded into a row vector of length 13 specifically the fourth element of 6 the attribute value of the distance to rivers factor in the pixel vector is converted into a row vector of 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 in which the sixth and other elements of the vector are assigned values of 1 and 0 respectively finally all row vectors form a 13 13 matrix two dimensional data 3 in the case of three dimensional data each pixel and its adjacent pixels form a three dimensional window patch as shown in fig 4 b the patch has the same label as the current pixel assuming the window size is 5 each data sample is 13 5 5 3 3 cnn architectures cnns exhibiting robust performance in computer vision and image processing fields are basically multilayer feed forward neural networks that can automatically extract valuable features from raw data zhang et al 2018 the cnn architecture is mainly composed of an input layer multiple hidden layers and an output layer and the hidden layers consist of one or more convolutional and pooling layers ghorbanzadeh et al 2019 lecun et al 2015 the convolutional layer that consists of several convolution kernels iteratively extracts sophisticated and effective features from the original data canziani et al 2016 mallat 2016 the pooling sub sample layer is usually carried out after a convolutional layer to reduce the dimensionality of feature maps through a down sampling algorithm which can avoid overfitting and reduce computational cost chen et al 2016 moreover cnns have strong adaptive capability and can achieve excellent performance when facing different dimensional data shin et al 2016 in this section three different dimensional cnn architectures are developed for regional flood susceptibility analysis 3 3 1 1d cnn the 1d cnn structure is comprised of five layers of an input layer a convolutional layer a max pooling layer a fully connected layer and an output layer which was developed and trained using one dimensional data assuming that there are n flood triggering factors in the input data n convolutional kernels with a size of a 1 to filter the input data the resultant layer has n feature vectors each grid cell is connected to an a 1 neighborhood in the input vector a b 1 max pooling layer is immediately used after the first convolutional layer which can reduce the length of feature vectors a fully connected layer with k neural units follows the max pooling layer to reorganize the extracted representations finally m neural units are viewed as the output of the network fig 5 shows the architecture of 1d cnn 3 3 2 2d cnn the two dimensional cnn structure consists of two convolutional layers two max pooling layers and one fully connected layer assuming that the input data is an n n image and the first convolutional layer has n kernels with a size of a a which can produce n feature maps the size of feature maps is reduced by half with the depth remaining unchanged after applying a b b max pooling operation the resulting feature maps are sent to the second convolutional layer that has m kernels with a size of a a then the resultant m feature maps are sent to the second b b max pooling layer and a fully connected layer with k neural units are used to recognize these extracted features finally m neural units are regarded as the output of the 2d cnn architecture fig 6 shows the structure of 2d cnn 3 3 3 3d cnn the 3d cnn structure contains one convolutional layer one max pooling layer and two fully connected layers assuming that each input data can be represented as a c n n matrix n convolutional kernels with a size of a a a to filter the input data the resultant layer has n feature maps the b b b max pooling layer is used to reduce the size of feature maps by half then two fully connected layers with k neural units are used to reorganize the extracted information finally the output layer containing m neural units representing the final result of the whole network fig 7 shows the structure of 3d cnn 3 3 4 hyperparameters of cnn hyperparameters setting is a key step in building a cnn architecture lecun et al 2015 and this section illustrates some related hyperparameters specifically the sizes of the convolutional kernel and the pooling kernel determine the scale of the convolution and pooling operations respectively choi et al 2017 golik et al 2015 simard et al 2003 the activation function converts a linear relationship to a nonlinear relationship so that the neural network can approximate any nonlinear function audebert et al 2019 chen et al 2016 dahl et al 2013 mou et al 2017 the loss function is used to measure the degree of inconsistency between the predicted value and the true value chen et al 2014 james and stein 1992 nourani et al 2015 ranjbar et al 2018 singh 1997 in addition the optimizer is used to iteratively update parameters at different learning rates through a gradient descent algorithm hinton et al 2012 adagrad is a widely used optimizer because it can automatically adjust the learning rate based on the gradient value of the independent variable in each dimension thereby avoiding the problem of difficulty in adapting to the unified learning rate in all dimensions duchi et al 2011 paoletti et al 2018 schmidhuber 2015 the learning rate is critical to the training process because it controls the learning speed of the cnn architecture marmanis et al 2016 salamon and bello 2017 3 4 fsm using cnns cnns are characterized with local connections and sharing weights and their main advantage is to effectively extract spatial information and automatically optimized network parameters krizhevsky et al 2012 lecun et al 1998 to explore the predictive capability of the cnn framework two different perspectives of classification and feature extraction are proposed in flood susceptibility analysis specifically in the first perspective cnns are directly used as classifiers for fsm whereas in the second perspective a hybrid framework is developed by integrating cnns with the svm classifier and the cnns are used to extract more representative features from original data improving classical ml classifiers to achieve more effective prediction with these representative features 3 4 1 cnn classifiers as mentioned in section 3 2 and 3 3 cnns have achieved fairly good results in processing classification related tasks hu et al 2015 in the field of flood susceptibility assessment the main objective is to predict where a flood event will occur which can be treated as a binary classification process to label a given region with flood or non flood in this study the cnns are directly used as classifiers for regional flood spatial prediction the main steps of applying cnns for classification are summarized as follows first the original data are reformed according to the data representation methods previously mentioned in section 3 2 then a cnn structure is built based on the dimensionality of the reformed data after a series of convolutional and pooling operations the high level feature maps are extracted from the input data and then reorganized by a fully connected layer finally the reorganized feature vectors are converted to classification results using a nonlinear activation function for simplicity the generalized classification process using a cnn classifier with the 2d cnn architecture is shown in fig 8 3 4 2 integration of cnns and svm cnn is an effective ml technique that can discover new representations and relationships from the original data and these features are not easily uncovered through conventional methods bergen et al 2019 furthermore cnns can automatically extract image features including color shape texture and topological structures by using different combinations of neurons and learning rules which proved the great potential in feature extraction as well niu and suen 2012 in other fields the integration of cnns and svm has achieved promising results for example niu and suen niu and suen 2012 used a 2d cnn with five layers to extract features from mixed national institute of standards and technology data and applied svm for final classification also the hybrid method of cnn and svm was applied for microvascular morphological type recognition and hyperspectral image classification leng et al 2016 xue et al 2016 in this study different cnn structures are used to learn more suitable features from the original data based on this idea the main steps of integrating cnn and svm are summarized as follows first the original data is fed to the cnn structure in different dimensional styles then after several layers of convolution and pooling manipulations the hidden information of the input data is reorganized in the fully connected layer where the neural units are regarded as the extracted features in the following the svm classifier is trained using the extracted high level features finally this integrated framework is used to perform fsm specifically three different dimensional cnn feature extractors are proposed to learn high level features from the original data with the same structures mentioned in section 3 3 fig 9 illustrates the classification process using the 2d cnn architecture to extract features for an example 3 5 evaluation methods 3 5 1 feature evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of extracted features by cnns a similarity measure mean value of correlation coefficients among all the samples is used the greater the similarity of extracted features in the same class indicates that the input data is easier to discriminate for clarification the correlation coefficient is defined as follows goh et al 2007 8 ρ x 1 x 2 c x 1 x 2 d x 1 d x 2 where x 1 and x 2 represent two feature vectors c x 1 x 2 is a covariance matrix and d x 1 and d x 2 are the variance of x 1 and x 2 respectively 3 5 2 model evaluation recently the roc curve has been used to assess the performance of fsm models dano et al 2019 kazakis et al 2015 popovic et al 2018 specifically this curve is constructed using sensitivity on the y axis against 1 specificity on the x axis bradley 1997 moreover an auc value indicates the predictive capability as well choubin et al 2019 pamučar et al 2018b xia et al 2017 in particular an auc value of 1 indicates that there is a perfect spatial agreement between the observed and simulation data an auc value of 0 5 is the agreement that would be expected due to chance whereas a value of 0 considers a non informative result choubin et al 2019 fawcett 2006 tehrany et al 2014b in addition oa is another widely used criterion to assess the predictive performance of fsm models chapi et al 2017 hong et al 2018b rahmati et al 2016 and it is the proportion of the number of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels as follows 9 oa tp t n tp t n f p f n where tp true positive and tn true negative denote the number of flood and non flood grid cells that are correctly classified where fp false positive and fn false negative are the number of flood and non flood grid cells incorrectly classified respectively besides k is another powerful statistical criterion measuring the agreement or reliability between two raters pontius jr and millones 2011 for flood susceptibility assessment this criterion can evaluate the prediction accuracy of fsm models and a higher value implies better prediction khosravi et al 2018 mahmoud and gan 2018 this criterion is formulated as follows 10 κ p c p exp 1 p exp 11 p exp t p f n t p f p f p t n f n t n t p t n f n f p where p c is the proportion of samples that have been correctly classified and p exp means the expected probability of change agreement additionally a non parametric test of wilcoxon signed rank test was implemented to validate the statistical significance difference among different models wilcoxon et al 1970 the null hypothesis is based on the pre assumption that fsm models have no significance difference at a significance level of α 5 generally if the p value is smaller than 0 05 and the z value beyond the threshold of 1 96 the prior hypothesis is not true and rejected and the difference between two models is significant 4 results 4 1 building flood models and producing flood susceptibility maps in this subsection three different cnn architectures were constructed for classification and feature extraction in flood susceptibility analysis to this end three different dimensional training sets and validation sets were first prepared for subsequent cnn training and validation as described in section 3 3 then three different dimensional cnn structures were constructed and training sets of different dimensions were fed to the corresponding neural network with a certain number of iterations until the training process converges finally the trained cnn models were used for classification and feature extraction it should be noted that the window size is a key parameter for constructing a three dimensional data form therefore as shown in fig 10 analysis of window size is performed it can be observed that a 3d cnn model with a window size of 5 obtains the highest auc value in addition during the construction of the cnn structure the related hyperparameters were determined through a fine tuning step using the validation set referring to previous studies audebert et al 2019 hu et al 2014 maggiori et al 2017 shin et al 2016 table 3 reports all hyperparameters settings for different cnn architectures the aforementioned cnn structures were built in python under the keras framework 3 3 https keras io as the proposed cnn architectures were constructed and trained three cnn structures were applied to classification and feature extraction regarding cnns for classification 1d cnn 2d cnn and 3d cnn models were used to calculate the flood susceptibility index for each pixel for cnn for feature extraction the validity of the extracted features was evaluated using the similarity statistical index as shown in table 4 it can be observed that all the extracted features obtained by the 1d cnn 2d cnn and 3d cnn architectures have higher similarity than the original features which demonstrates that the extracted features are more efficient and easier to classify then the learned features were regarded as new representation vectors and sent to the svm model for classification and the susceptibility indexes were calculated by the hybrid methods of 1d cnn svm 2d cnn svm and 3d cnn svm after the susceptibility index of each grid cell in the study area was obtained by the fsm models these indices were automatically divided into five intervals of very low low moderate high and very high using the natural breaks jenks method jenks 1967 which has been widely used in the fsm process chapi et al 2017 dano et al 2019 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 the svm classifier with the rbf kernel is a robust method that has achieved good performance in fsm choubin et al 2019 tehrany et al 2015b zhao et al 2019 for comparison an svm classifier with the rbf kernel was used for fsm to demonstrate the effectiveness of a cnn based feature extractor the flood susceptibility maps produced by different cnn based methods and svm are shown in fig 11 it can be seen that very high susceptible zones have similar distributions and most floods are located in very high susceptible areas in order to quantitatively analyze the susceptibility maps the frequency of flood occurrence in the susceptible zones was analyzed and the results are shown in table 5 it can be observed that most floods are predicted in the high and very high susceptible areas and very few floods occur in very low susceptible areas which proves that there is relatively high consistency between historical flood events and susceptible zones for all the methods furthermore more than 80 of the historical flood events located in the very high susceptible areas confirmed the rationality of the flood susceptibility maps meanwhile all the cnn based methods achieved more reliable susceptibility maps because the frequency ratio of floods was higher than svm in the very high and high areas 4 2 model validation and comparison to evaluate the performance of all the methods the statistical criteria of oa and k were used as shown in table 6 it can be seen that all the cnn based methods achieved better performance than svm in terms of both oa and k for example the 1d cnn svm 2d cnn svm and 3d cnn svm methods were 1 57 4 69 and 0 0312 0 0937 higher than svm in terms of oa and k respectively moreover the 2d cnn svm method achieved the highest oa and k value among all the methods therefore the performance of svm can be further improved by using the features extracted by cnn fig 12 shows the roc curves of all the methods using the validation set experimental results demonstrated that all the cnn based methods had better prediction performance than svm in terms of auc specifically the highest auc value obtained by the 2d cnn method was 0 937 followed by 2d cnn svm 0 934 3d cnn 0 928 3d cnn svm 0 922 1d cnn 0 905 1d cnn svm 0 904 and svm 0 883 meanwhile when cnn was used for feature extraction in the classification process the auc value of svm can be increased by 0 021 0 051 furthermore the wilcoxon signed rank test was selected to verify the statistical difference between the proposed cnn based methods and the svm classifier when the significance level of p value is smaller than 0 05 and the z value exceeds 1 96 the difference between flood models is significant z values and the significant levels of different flood models are shown in table 7 it can be seen that all the comparative models are very different because the z value and p value of the significance level satisfy with the corresponding significant conditions mentioned in section 3 5 2 5 discussion it is a key prerequisite for preventing and reducing flood damage by conducting an appropriate fsm technique hong et al 2018a wang et al 2019b therefore it is necessary to explore the possibility of applying newly developed techniques in fsm in this paper the deep learning representative of cnn is considered for regional flood susceptibility analysis with a different perspective in shangyou county china as a popular and powerful technique cnn gradually shows great potential in classification prediction cnn architectures of different dimensions have been designed to solve various tasks with different data modalities lecun et al 2015 for example 1d cnn has been widely used for signal processing and sentence classification 2d cnn has been mainly used for image processing golik et al 2015 hu et al 2014 and 3d cnn has been developed for video related problems ji et al 2012 tran et al 2015 with regard to flood susceptibility analysis the sample in the study area is usually composed of a set of factor vectors in the form of one dimensional data chapi et al 2017 hong et al 2018a khosravi et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 and all the samples are input into the ml model for classification to fully explore the prediction capability of cnn in flood susceptibility assessment data forms of different dimensions were proposed to fit the corresponding cnn structure the one dimensional data form contains all the information about the flood triggering factors and 1d cnn architecture can take advantage of the local relationships between the flood triggering factors various flood triggering factors related to the morphological geological and hydrological conditions play a crucial role in constructing flood models mahmoud and gan 2018 rijal et al 2018 based on the fact that cnn has demonstrated the promising results in image processing anthimopoulos et al 2016 krizhevsky et al 2012 lecun et al 1998 a two dimensional data form is proposed to construct the cnn to analyze flood susceptibility in an image perspective this means that this data form can be regarded as a two dimensional extension of the feature vector by considering spatial information of the triggering factors as for the three dimensional data form it contains both attribute factor information and local terrain spatial information between pixels in a specific window it is significant for decision makers to produce reliable flood susceptibility maps to assess and prevent flood hazards termeh et al 2018 wang et al 2019c xia et al 2017 meanwhile it is a useful way to assess flood susceptibility maps using frequency analysis of flood occurrences in table 5 most floods occurred in the high and very high susceptible areas and few floods occurred in the very low susceptible areas which is consistent with previous studies bui et al 2019b chapi et al 2017 khosravi et al 2018 moreover the cnn based methods achieved a higher flood frequency than svm 89 81 reaching 92 59 97 22 in terms of the high and very high susceptible areas which proved that the cnn based methods can achieve more accurate and reliable susceptibility maps furthermore experimental results in table 6 and fig 12 demonstrated that all the proposed cnns obtained better results than svm in terms of oa k and auc svm learns the decision plane directly from the raw data while cnns can transform the raw data into useful representations that are important for model discrimination after convolution and pooling operations important features of input data are enhanced and irrelevant information is reduced furthermore the wilcoxon signed rank test in table 7 demonstrated that the statistical difference between the cnn based methods and svm is significant it was verified that the improvement in prediction accuracy brought by the cnn based methods is instructive for decision makers to consider adopting a novel cnn technique to obtain more accurate flood susceptibility maps in particular when the 2d cnn architecture was used directly as a classifier or feature extraction in the fsm process the reasons for obtaining the highest accuracy can be summarized as follows first as described in section 3 compared to the one dimensional data form the three dimensional data form contains not only attribute information but also local terrain spatial information however the three dimensional data form may contain redundant information that interferes with a classifier to distinguish true classification labels second the two dimensional data form not only makes the construction of the cnn network easier but also better displays the attribute information in the original data it should be noted in table 6 that some methods had the same oa and k values for example 1d cnn 3d cnn and 3d cnn svm obtained the same oa and k values of 84 38 and 0 6875 and 2d cnn and 1d cnn svm got the same oa and k values of 85 94 and 0 7188 respectively due to the very limited validation samples in addition the evaluation criteria of oa and k that mainly consider the final classification label may not accurately reflect the significant differences between the proposed fsm models but the roc curve technique is very sensitive to flood susceptibility indices therefore the roc curve and auc value can precisely show the reliable assessment results of the fsm methods which has been confirmed by other studies liu et al 2018 mukhametzyanov and pamucar 2018 pamučar et al 2018a zhao et al 2019 6 conclusions this paper studies the application of the cnn technique in fsm from two different perspectives in the case of shangyou county china first a spatial database containing 13 flood triggering factors and 108 historical flood events was prepared to construct the proposed methods the developed cnn architectures were then used to construct flood susceptibility models in two different ways of classification and feature extraction next flood susceptibility maps were obtained using the cnn based methods in comparison to svm finally several objective criteria of oa k roc and auc were used to compare and verify all the fsm methods the main conclusions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 the proposed 1d cnn 2d cnn and 3d cnn classifiers achieved better prediction performance than svm in terms of auc which proves the superiority of the cnn frameworks 2 by using cnn for feature extraction the prediction capability of svm was effectively improved in particular the 2d cnn svm method achieved the highest accuracy in terms of oa k and auc 3 the proposed cnn based methods are expected to be used for flood disaster assessment and management meanwhile the application prospect of cnn can inspire more effective fsm techniques credit authorship contribution

5779,unifying the description of catchment hydrological partitioning across spatial and temporal scales has long been an important research topic within the hydrological community as an effort to that here we develop a conceptual water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis denoted pwbm and for the first time test the proportionality hypothesis using hydrologic observations across global catchments at varying time scales the pwbm has a transparent and parsimonious model structure with only two model parameters and requires precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index as model inputs to test pwbm we apply the model to simulate streamflow q evapotranspiration e and storage change δs in 22 large basins and 255 small basins globally and find an overall good model performance in reproducing all three water balance components at the daily only in small basins monthly seasonal annual and mean annual time scales compared with three other conceptual hydrological models developed for specific time scales the pwbm substantially outperforms the scs model at the daily scale and the abcd model at the monthly scale and performs similarly as the long standing budyko model at the mean annual scale in summary our study verifies the robustness of pwbm and offers convincing evidence regarding the applicability of the proportionality hypothesis for enhanced hydrological system understanding at multiple spatial and temporal scales keywords proportionality hypothesis catchment water balance multiscale modelling 1 introduction catchment hydrological partitioning the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow q evapotranspiration e and storage change δs underlies the complex interactions between climate hydrology vegetation soil geology and other land surface processes rodríguez iturbe 2000 trancoso et al 2016 troch et al 2013 an accurate quantification of hydrological partitioning is imperative for understanding catchment hydrological behaviors and provides the quantitative basis for water resources management oki and kanae 2006 troch et al 2015 as a result there has been continuous interest in developing methods to quantify hydrological partitioning across a range of spatial and temporal scales e g l vovich 1979 beven et al 1980 zhao 1992 liang et al 1994 burnash 1995 yang et al 1998 andréassian et al 2012 liu et al 2016 xing et al 2018 current methods to model hydrological partitioning can be broadly classified into two types i the bottom up or newtonian approach and ii the top down or darwinian approach compared with the bottom up approach that requires large data inputs and parameterization of individual processes the top down approach has attracted considerable attention within the hydrological community primarily due to its simplicity and transparency sivapalan et al 2003 andréassian et al 2016 donohue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2001 the top down approach analyzes the hydrologic behavior of a system without detailing individual processes and involves identifying simple and robust spatial and or temporal patterns in hydrologic behavior from observations and postulating a theory to connect the observed patterns with the processes that created them harman and troch 2014 as a result the top down approach often has a parsimonious model structure and parameterization to describe hydrological behaviors at the scale s of interest blöschl and sivapalan 1995 beven 2006 different spatial and or temporal patterns can emerge from hydrological behaviors at varying scales which can make the model structure scale dependent for example at the mean annual time scale budyko 1974 proposed a semi analytical model also known as the budyko model to quantify the relationship between the mean annual e ratio i e the ratio of e over p and the mean annual aridity index i e the ratio of potential evapotranspiration e p over p despite variations around the original budyko model being observed in subsequent studies e g milly 1994 potter et al 2005 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2007 2009 donohue et al 2007 2010 2012 williams et al 2012 the budyko model is used to represent the first order control of climate variability on catchment hydrological partitioning and applies globally roderick and farquhar 2011 roderick et al 2014 yang et al 2016a at the inter annual or intra annual scale the catchment water balance can be equally affected by climate spatio temporal variability water storage change and vegetation dynamics sivapalan et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 as a result the corresponding modelling approach must account for those factors and the interactions among them examples of such approaches include the classic two stage partitioning theory proposed by l vovich 1979 and the abcd conceptual hydrological model developed by thomas 1981 at the event scale hydrological partitioning is often primarily controlled by other factors in addition to those introduced above including rainfall intensity horton 1933 soil infiltration green and ampt 1911 soil storage capacity dunne and black 1970 slope and terrain beven and kirkby 1979 among others wang et al 2012 consequently various approaches based on different conceptualizations of hydrological processes were proposed to describe the streamflow generation process at the event scale for a specific catchment or region such as the topmodel originally developed for humid catchments beven and kirkby 1979 the xinanjiang model for humid catchments in southern china zhao 1992 and the scs model based on small rural catchments in the united states scs 1972 nevertheless despite that the controlling factors of hydrological partitioning vary greatly with temporal scales and study regions commonality exists among the behavior of hydrological partitioning across scales and serves as signatures from the co evolution of natural systems sivapalan 2005 newman et al 2006 gentine et al 2012 harman and troch 2014 trancoso et al 2016 2017 thus over the last 40 years there has been enduring interest to develop a generic theory to effectively unify the description of hydrological partitioning across spatial and temporal scales eagleson 1982 schymanski et al 2008 zehe et al 2010 inspiring progress was made by wang and tang 2014 who identified the theoretical commonality between three hydrological models at different temporal scales i e the budyko model at the mean annual scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the scs model at the daily scale using the proportionality hypothesis the proportionality hypothesis expresses the competition between different catchment functions and their symmetry identified in empirical functional representations of hydrological partitioning further studies were conducted to explore the optimality principle behind the proportionality hypothesis for example wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2016 claimed that the maximum entropy production mep theory was the optimality principle behind the proportionality hypothesis and developed a unified water balance model accordingly unfortunately this theoretical framework has not been applied in real hydrological modelling nor tested against hydrological observations this is partly because for example six parameters need to be quantified with only three equations in zhao et al s 2016 model potentially leading to the issue of over parameterization beven 1993 it is still unclear if a unified pattern exists at different scales that can be identified and modelled using the proportionality hypothesis and it is imperative to resolve this before assessing testing its underlying optimality principle thus our objectives were to i develop a multi scale catchment water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis termed as pwbm ii calibrate and validate pwbm with catchment observations globally at the daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual time scales iii compare the model performance of pwbm with other conceptual hydrological models developed for specific time scales and iv explore the sensitivities and characteristics of model parameters across temporal scales 2 methodology 2 1 the proportionality hypothesis the proportionality hypothesis used here expresses the competition between different catchment functions and their symmetry identified in empirical functional representations of hydrological partitioning poncea and shetty 1995 assuming the amount of available water is z which is partitioned into x and y over a specified time interval x has an upper bound denoted as x p whereas y increases with z in an unbound fashion then the competition between x and y would follow the proportionality formula 1 x x p y z if an initial value x 0 is allocated to x before the competition between x and y is calculated the partitioning is determined by 2 x x 0 x p x 0 y z x 0 this hypothesis has been successfully applied for modelling runoff at the event scale scs 1972 inter annual runoff variability thomas 1981 poncea and shetty 1995 and mean annual water balance wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 however in these conceptual hydrological models different model structures and parameters were developed for specific time scales consequently the applicability of the proportionality hypothesis to unify hydrologic behaviors across temporal scales is still not demonstrated and remains elusive 2 2 a multi scale catchment water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis as illustrated in fig 1 we consider the total available water for a catchment during period i as the cumulative precipitation during period i p i l and water storage at the beginning of period i s i 1 l the total available water is then partitioned into three components streamflow q i l evapotranspiration e i l and water storage at the end of the period s i l which can be described as 3 p i s i 1 q i e i s i in this process a portion of precipitation is available for direct evaporation evaporation of water intercepted by vegetation and retained at the soil surface wang and tang 2014 which is defined as the initial evaporation e 0 i l there may also some water retained at the surface ponding shi et al 2009 and is defined as the initial storage s 0 i l the remaining available water p i s i 1 e 0 i s 0 i is then partitioned into continuing evapotranspiration e c i l continuing soil storage s c i l and runoff q i l as precipitation increases continuing evapotranspiration is increasingly limited by atmospheric evaporative demand and asymptotically approaches a constant value of e p i e 0 i where e p i is the potential evapotranspiration during period i continuing soil storage is limited by continuing catchment storage capacity s p s 0 i where s p i is the catchment storage capacity and runoff is constrained by the available water p i s i 1 e 0 i s 0 i applying the proportionality hypothesis one can obtain 4 e i e 0 i e p i e 0 i s i s 0 i s p s 0 i q i p i s i 1 s 0 i e 0 i note eq 4 is consistent with the budyko model at the mean annual scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the scs model at the event scale see supplementary text s1 for details there are three parameters in eq 4 namely e 0 i s p and s 0 i defining μ i e 0 i e p i so that a dimensional parameter e 0 i will turn to be dimensionless μ i and eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 e i μ i e p i e p i μ i e p i s i s 0 i s p s 0 i q i p i s i 1 s 0 i μ i e p i as s 0 i is often much smaller than s p i e water ponded over the surface is usually much less than that stored in the entire soil zone it is reasonable to assume that s p s 0 i is a constant with this and further defining s p s p s 0 we have 6 e i μ i e pi e pi μ i e pi s i s 0 i s p q i p i s i 1 s 0 i μ i e pi finally combining eq 6 with the catchment water balance equation i e eq 3 and an additional equation for water storage change i e δ s i s i s 0 i s i 1 s 0 i the simplified proportionality based catchment water balance model termed as pwbm hereafter is expressed as 7 e i μ i e pi e pi μ i e pi s i s 0 i s p q i p i s i 1 s 0 i μ i e pi p i s i 1 q i e i s i δ s i s i s 0 i s i 1 s 0 i the above model i e eq 7 contains four equations with three parameters i e μ i s p and s 0 i among these three parameters s 0 i can be easily eliminated if we were to estimate δs i instead of s i as a result there are only two remaining parameters i e μ i and s p contained in the 4 equations which can be determined by calibrating the model against hydrological observations thus avoiding the equifinality problem beven 1993 parameter μ i i e μ i e 0 i e p i determines the relative importance of e p in the control of e additionally the value of μ i should range from 0 to 1 as e p i sets the upper limit of e 0 i the parameter e 0 is related to canopy interception and should consequently increase with vegetation coverage for given rainfall amount and intensity wang and tang 2014 using satellite derived leaf area index lai as a surrogate of vegetation coverage it follows that e 0 0 and μ 0 when lai 0 and e 0 e p and μ 1 when lai the beer s law type of function is then adopted to estimate μ i as a function of lai 8 μ i 1 e β lai i where β is a model parameter accounting for local effects e g rainfall intensity catchment slope and so on that modifies the μ lai relationship we further verified this relationship spatially and found that using μ estimated by eq 8 greatly improved model performance compared with fixed μ see supplementary text s2 for details 2 3 model verification to test pwbm we firstly applied the model to 22 global large catchments see section 3 1 for more information at a monthly time step the two model parameters i e s p and β for each catchment were determined by calibrating the model from 1984 to 1995 with the objective function to minimum the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated q then based on the calibrated parameters s p and β we simulated q e and δs for the validation period i e 1996 2006 furthermore to evaluate the model performance across temporal scales we respectively calibrated and validated pwbm at the seasonal i e january to march as the first season in a year and so on annual and mean annual scale i e sequential three year mean yang et al 2016b with similar procedures the calibration and validation periods are consistent at multi time scales additionally as it is entirely plausible for the model performance and parameters to change with spatial scales li et al 2013 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 trancoso et al 2016 2017 we also tested pwbm at 255 global small unimpaired catchments at multiple time scales i e daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual with the former half data used for calibration and the latter half data used for validation each small catchment contains 12 years continuous q observations see section 3 1 for

budyko models are compared in both 22 global large catchments fig 2 b and 255 global small catchments fig 2b whereas the scs model is only compared in 255 global small catchments with daily streamflow

of water balance components including precipitation evapotranspiration streamflow and water storage change for 32 major i e 200 000 km2 river catchments across the globe from 1984 through 2006 were provided by pan et al 2012 the water balance component dataset of pan et al 2012 represents an optimal combination of different data sources i e in situ observations remote sensing observations land surface model outputs and reanalysis products which has been considered as the best available water budget dataset to date li et al 2013 and are regarded as observations in the current study however as pwbm does not explicitly consider the effect of snow and or glacial melting on streamflow we excluded catchments located north of 60 n as a result only 22 of pan et al s 2012 32 catchments of were used herein fig 2a additionally daily streamflow observations at 255 small 1 480 13 662 km2 fig 2b unimpaired catchments from 1982 to 2010 across the globe south of 60 n were collected from four

wirada between csiro and australian bureau of meteorology iv model parameter estimation experiment mopex the selected catchments have at least 12 years continuous streamflow observations with the former half data i e longer than 6 years being used for model calibration and latter half for model validation to ensure the selected catchments are minimally affected by human activities the selected catchments must satisfy the following criteria i no significant forest gain or loss less than2 of the total catchment area or ii irrigated areas less than 2 or iii urban areas less than 2 or iv the absence of large dams defined as total reservoir capacity 10 of the mean annual catchment observed q areas of forest change were determined from hansen et al 2013 based on 30 meter landsat imagery

data were further aggregated by averaging and lumped for individual catchments 4 results 4 1 testing the pwbm at multiple scales 4 1 1 at global large catchments we first applied the model in 22 global large catchments at the monthly seasonal annual and mean annual time scales respectively averaged over the 22 catchments the model reasonably reproduces the monthly q series with nse at 0 42 rmse at 5 08 mm month 1 and rrmse at 30 3 on average for validation period fig 3 a for monthly e and δs pwbm performs even slightly better having an averaged nse and rrmse of 0 71 and 18 4 for simulated e and 0 79 and 16 4 for modeled δs note that we use the ratio of rmseδs over mean monthly p to calculate rrmseδs instead of the ratio of rmseδs over mean monthly δs as mean monthly δs over a long term would approach zero for the validation period the nse rmse and rrmse values for simulated q e and δs are all very close to those found for the calibration period suggesting the robustness of the model structure and stability of the model parameters to further illustrate the model performance from a time series prospective fig 4 shows the comparison of observed and simulated monthly time series of q e and δs in the yangzi river basin nile river basin and senegal river basin respectively and these catchments represent humid sub humid semi arid and arid climates it shows that the temporal dynamics of the three hydrological variables are generally well captured by the model except for that the model tends to slightly overestimate peak flows and underestimate e at the lower end for the nile and senegal river basins with the increase of time scale i e from monthly to the mean annual scale all three evaluation metrics for simulated q e and δs gradually decrease fig 3 lower rmse and rrmse suggest reduced overall simulation error as the time scale increases whereas a smaller nse value indicates a weakened model capacity to capture the temporal variations of the water balance components nevertheless the lower nse may also be caused by a lower temporal variability of observed hydrological variables at longer time scales as nse reflects more the aspect of temporal variability of a time series and is sensitive to extreme values nash and sutcliffe 1970 fig 5 shows the values of nse rmse and rrmse of simulated water balance components for individual catchments at the monthly scale similar spatial patterns of model performance were found for the seasonal and annual time scales supplementary figure s2 for simulated q lower nse and high rmse rrmse values are concentrated in high latitude regions i e the don ural danube volga and dnieper basin whereas lower nse values for simulated e are found in three tropical rainforest catchments i e the amazonas congo and mekong basin fig 5 nevertheless the mean rrmse of monthly simulated e for the three tropical rainforest catchments is only 11 2 which is even lower than the mean rrmse of 18 4 over all 22 large catchments for simulated δs it does not show any notable spatial pattern in all three metrics 4 1 2 at global small catchments using the small catchments distributed across the globe dataset we firstly test the model performance in simulating daily q at the 255 catchments with daily q observations their locations are provided in fig 2b as shown in fig 6 a there are 193 catchments 75 7 showing an nse value larger than zero during the calibration period with an averaged nse of 0 40 averaged rmse for daily q estimates during the calibration period are 34 8 mm month 1 fig 6b with 158 catchments 62 0 showing a rrmse lower than 100 similar with the results of the 22 large catchments fig 3 the model performance during the validation period shows only slight difference compared with that during the calibration period at the monthly scale 227 89 0 catchments show a positive nse value with 135 of them 50 showing an nse value higher than 0 5 for simulated q during the validation period fig 6d the mean positive nse of simulated q during the validation period is 0 49 averaged over all 255 small catchments the rmse and rrmse for monthly q are 18 9 mm month 1 and 47 0 respectively fig 6e and 6f during the validation period with 91 4 catchments showing monthly q rrmse lower than 100 the pwbm performs again better at longer time scales in the small catchments in terms of rmse and rrmse averaged over all small catchments the mean rmse and rrmse decreases to 14 1 mm month 1 and 38 2 at the seasonal scale 6 2 mm month 1 and 19 0 at the annual scale and 5 0 mm month 1 and 16 5 at the mean annual scale respectively fig 6 although we also find notable reductions in q nse at longer time scales fig 6g and 6j this as mentioned above may also be caused by the relative lower q temporal variability at longer time scales 4 2 comparison of pwbm with three other conceptual models at the global large catchments we compare the model performance between the pwbm with the abcd model at the monthly scale and the budyko model at the mean annual scale in simulating all three water balance components q e and δs results show that pwbm performs substantially better than the abcd model in simulating all three water balance components at the monthly scale with nse increased by 0 11 0 54 and 0 65 rmse decreased by 2 0 mm month 1 12 3 mm month 1 and 12 5 mm month 1 and rrmse decreased by 6 3 34 6 and 22 4 respectively fig 7 a c at the mean annual scale pwbm exhibits a similar performance compared with the budyko model with both rmse and rrmse of pwbm only slightly higher than those of the budyko model figs 7d and 9e at the global small catchments we compare the performance of pwbm in simulating q with the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the budyko model at the mean annual scale as shown in fig 8 a c pwbm performs much better than the scs model at the daily scale with a higher average nse 0 40 vs 0 23 and lower average rmse 34 8 mm month 1 vs 47 6 mm month 1 and rrmse 98 6 vs 138 1 similar improvements are also found in pwbm over the abcd model fig 8d f the average nse positive rmse and rrmse for pwbm q are 0 49 18 9 mm month 1 and 47 0 whereas the average nse positive rmse and rrmse for abcd q are 0 35 22 9 mm month 1 and 58 9 respectively in addition the number of catchments showing negative nse values reduces by 26 2 and 19 1 in pwbm compared with that in scs and abcd this suggests a much better performance of pwbm in capturing the observed q variability than the scs and abcd models at the mean annual scale again pwbm shows a comparable performance with the long standing budyko model fig 8g and h 4 3 multi scale model parameters two parameters s p and β see eqs 7 and 8 need to be determined when applying the model sensitivity analysis shows that the model results in particularly the simulation of q is much more sensitive to β than s p table 1 using the global 22 large catchments as an example a 50 change in β would lead to a change in monthly q by 40 70 whereas the same change in s p only leads to monthly q changes by 1 table 1 the model sensitivity to parameter changes also varies with time scales with q sensitivity to changes in β decreasing and q sensitivity to changes in s p increasing as time scale increases table 1 a similar pattern in the model sensitivity to changes of these two parameters across time scales is also seen in the simulation of e table 1 as for δs changes in s p and β both show very limited impacts on the model performance table 1 suggesting an important internal model attribute that errors in simulated q and e caused by parameter uncertainties may be largely canceled each other out and consequently leads to an insensitive δs modelling to both parameters fig 9 shows the calibrated parameters s p and β for each catchment at the four time scales it is found that not only the median value but also the spatial variability of parameters s p show an evident decreasing trend with increasing time scales the parameters s p has a median value of 1400 mm with an upper quartile of 4086 mm and a lower quartile of 620 mm at the monthly scale these three values respectively decrease to 660 mm 1476 mm and 410 mm at the mean annual scale similar with s p parameters β also reduces as the time scale increases with the median of β being 0 32 0 26 0 23 and 0 19 at the monthly seasonal annual and mean annual scale respectively 5 discussion previously catchment hydrologists have sought to develop organizing principles based on prior theories derived from physical and ecological sciences zehe et al 2010 eagleson 1982 schymanski et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 although these organizing principles have brought us comprehensive and new perspectives to understand hydrological systems they often suffer from the absence of verification across global bio climate using hydrological observations eagleson 1982 schymanski et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 in this study by developing a proportionality based multi scale catchment water balance model pwbm and verifying it with catchment observations globally at a range of time scales we provide the first comprehensive test of the proportionality hypothesis as an optimal principle that unifies catchment hydrological behavior for different time scales the present study contributes to top down hydrological modelling by developing a parsimonious model capable of reproducing catchment water balance at multi scales with the same model structure the top down approach is usually designed to interpret observed input output relationships in terms of internal characteristics and or processes occurring at certain scale harman and troch 2014 zhao et al 2016 thus a common consequential problem with previous top down hydrological modelling is the difficulty to generalize due to the absence of global perspective sivapalan et al 2003 here by invoking the proportionality hypothesis to generalize catchment hydrological partitioning behavior we provide a potential solution to this long standing problem in hydrological modelling it is noteworthy that the developed model herein shows good performance across both spatial i e large and small catchments and temporal i e daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual scales additionally although previous studies demonstrated the theoretical consistency between the proportionality hypothesis and other conceptual hydrological models developed for specific time scales zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2015 also see supplementary text s1 these models still perform quite differently in real hydrological model here we found that pwbm performs substantially better than the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and shows a comparable performance with the long standing budyko model at the mean annual scale when validated with hydrological observations figs 7 8 this is because that both scs and abcd models are essentially pwbm with simplifications during which some key processes may be overseen for example the influence of soil storage before a rainfall event on runoff generation is neglected in the scs model at the daily scale and the competing relationship between actual evapotranspiration and water storage is not made explicit in the abcd model at the monthly scale the better performance of pwbm implies that these processes are not negligible to understand and to model hydrological partitioning at these time scales the fact that there are only two model parameters i e s p and β also guarantee the transparency and parsimony of pwbm these two parameters represent the combined effects of catchment surface properties that affect catchment hydrological partitioning which are similar to the catchment surface parameter in the budyko model e g zhang et al 2001 potter et al 2005 donohue et al 2007 2012 parameter s p i e s p s p s 0 is mostly controlled by soil storage capacity s p as initial soil storage capacity s 0 is often much smaller than s p as s p decreases with the increase of time scale this suggests that the boundary of soil volume contributing to hydrological processes varies across time scales seibert et al 2003 spence 2007 at the intra annual scale groundwater storage and the groundwater surface water interaction may exert considerable impacts on the catchment water balance wang 2012 while these impacts on catchment water balance might be subtle as the time scale becomes longer i e annual or mean annual this is not explicitly considered in our model but implicitly reflected through parameter s p fig 9a parameter β is related with the initial catchment evapotranspiration i e canopy interception and water retained over the soil surface and the importance of e p in the control of e implying that both vegetation characteristics and soil properties can impact on β to verify this we further explore the relationship between β and a set of catchment properties and find that β is positively correlated with root zone storage capacity and negatively correlated with mean catchment slope rainfall intensity and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity supplementary figure s3 root zone storage capacity is jointly determined by effective rooting depth and water holding capacity both of which are generally larger in more humid regions loam soil with deeper effective rooting depth compared to more arid areas sandy soil with shallower effective rooting depth milly 1994 zhang et al 2001 this explains the positive relationship between root zone storage capacity and β by contrast steeper slope larger rainfall intensity and higher soil hydraulic conductivity all favor the generation of q with less e being produced for a fixed climate forcing i e same rainfall depth and e p beven and kirkby 1979 robinson et al 1995 yang et al 2007 consequently these three variables show a negative correlation with β in addition the value of parameter β shows a decreasing trend with the increase of time scales fig 9b suggesting that interception accounts for a higher proportion of total evapotranspiration at shorter time scales despite the overall good performance of pwbm across multiple spatial and temporal scales the model behavior does exhibit some spatial heterogeneity as shown in fig 5 a lower pwbm performance in simulating q was reported in four high latitude catchments i e the don ural danube volga and dnieper basin where mean annual air temperature is less than 5 a similar pattern of decreased model performance with decreasing air temperature is also found in global small catchments supplementary figure s4 in these high latitude catchments we find that the month with maximum q precedes the month with maximum p see examples provided in supplementary figure s5 this suggests that errors in estimated q are very likely due to ignoring the extra water input and energy consumption resulted from snow and or glacial melting in the model which would has considerable influence on the generation of q in such high latitude catchments barnett et al 2005 berghuijs et al 2014 however we also find this influence is reduced for long time scales supplementary figure s4 at the mean annual scale the effect of snow and or glacial melting on runoff is negligible when compared with other factors i e the amount of total precipitation whereas snow and or glacial melt may be the main water input for runoff generation for specific months or season immerzeel et al 2009 suzuki et al 2006 incorporating the effects of snow and or glacial melt into the current model remains a challenge for future research finally it is worth mentioning that the proportionality hypothesis is a mathematical expression of the competitive relationship between water balance components however the reason why the competition between hydrological processes at different time scales follow such a form as presented in eq 7 and 8 still remains unrevealed several theoretical explorations kleidon and schymanski 2008 paik and kumar 2010 westhoff et al 2014 regard the maximum entropy production mep theory as the foundation of the proportionality hypothesis ph as both i e mep and ph identify the commonality existing in the hydrological system wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 in this regard future studies are needed to explore the linkages between mep theory and the proportionality hypothesis to better understand the physical basis of the proportionality hypothesis 6 conclusion we developed a conceptual water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis pwbm and successfully simulated the catchment water balance at multiple time scales with the same model structure with only two model parameters i e s p and β needed in pwbm this guarantees its transparency and parsimony pwbm was tested in 22 large basins and 255 small basins globally at multi time scales i e daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual with overall good agreement between simulated and observed water balance components at these different time scales additionally we found that the model performance improved in terms of the root mean square error but degraded in regard to capturing the temporal hydrological variability as assessed with the nash sutcliffe efficiency index when the time scale increased nevertheless in terms of both rmse and nse pwbm performs substantially better than the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and shows a comparable performance with the long standing budyko model at the mean annual scale this study contributes to top down hydrological modelling by offering evidence on the applicability of the proportionality hypothesis at multiple spatial and temporal scales however

5779,unifying the description of catchment hydrological partitioning across spatial and temporal scales has long been an important research topic within the hydrological community as an effort to that here we develop a conceptual water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis denoted pwbm and for the first time test the proportionality hypothesis using hydrologic observations across global catchments at varying time scales the pwbm has a transparent and parsimonious model structure with only two model parameters and requires precipitation potential evapotranspiration and leaf area index as model inputs to test pwbm we apply the model to simulate streamflow q evapotranspiration e and storage change δs in 22 large basins and 255 small basins globally and find an overall good model performance in reproducing all three water balance components at the daily only in small basins monthly seasonal annual and mean annual time scales compared with three other conceptual hydrological models developed for specific time scales the pwbm substantially outperforms the scs model at the daily scale and the abcd model at the monthly scale and performs similarly as the long standing budyko model at the mean annual scale in summary our study verifies the robustness of pwbm and offers convincing evidence regarding the applicability of the proportionality hypothesis for enhanced hydrological system understanding at multiple spatial and temporal scales keywords proportionality hypothesis catchment water balance multiscale modelling 1 introduction catchment hydrological partitioning the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow q evapotranspiration e and storage change δs underlies the complex interactions between climate hydrology vegetation soil geology and other land surface processes rodríguez iturbe 2000 trancoso et al 2016 troch et al 2013 an accurate quantification of hydrological partitioning is imperative for understanding catchment hydrological behaviors and provides the quantitative basis for water resources management oki and kanae 2006 troch et al 2015 as a result there has been continuous interest in developing methods to quantify hydrological partitioning across a range of spatial and temporal scales e g l vovich 1979 beven et al 1980 zhao 1992 liang et al 1994 burnash 1995 yang et al 1998 andréassian et al 2012 liu et al 2016 xing et al 2018 current methods to model hydrological partitioning can be broadly classified into two types i the bottom up or newtonian approach and ii the top down or darwinian approach compared with the bottom up approach that requires large data inputs and parameterization of individual processes the top down approach has attracted considerable attention within the hydrological community primarily due to its simplicity and transparency sivapalan et al 2003 andréassian et al 2016 donohue et al 2012 liu et al 2016 yang et al 2016a zhang et al 2001 the top down approach analyzes the hydrologic behavior of a system without detailing individual processes and involves identifying simple and robust spatial and or temporal patterns in hydrologic behavior from observations and postulating a theory to connect the observed patterns with the processes that created them harman and troch 2014 as a result the top down approach often has a parsimonious model structure and parameterization to describe hydrological behaviors at the scale s of interest blöschl and sivapalan 1995 beven 2006 different spatial and or temporal patterns can emerge from hydrological behaviors at varying scales which can make the model structure scale dependent for example at the mean annual time scale budyko 1974 proposed a semi analytical model also known as the budyko model to quantify the relationship between the mean annual e ratio i e the ratio of e over p and the mean annual aridity index i e the ratio of potential evapotranspiration e p over p despite variations around the original budyko model being observed in subsequent studies e g milly 1994 potter et al 2005 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2007 2009 donohue et al 2007 2010 2012 williams et al 2012 the budyko model is used to represent the first order control of climate variability on catchment hydrological partitioning and applies globally roderick and farquhar 2011 roderick et al 2014 yang et al 2016a at the inter annual or intra annual scale the catchment water balance can be equally affected by climate spatio temporal variability water storage change and vegetation dynamics sivapalan et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2016 as a result the corresponding modelling approach must account for those factors and the interactions among them examples of such approaches include the classic two stage partitioning theory proposed by l vovich 1979 and the abcd conceptual hydrological model developed by thomas 1981 at the event scale hydrological partitioning is often primarily controlled by other factors in addition to those introduced above including rainfall intensity horton 1933 soil infiltration green and ampt 1911 soil storage capacity dunne and black 1970 slope and terrain beven and kirkby 1979 among others wang et al 2012 consequently various approaches based on different conceptualizations of hydrological processes were proposed to describe the streamflow generation process at the event scale for a specific catchment or region such as the topmodel originally developed for humid catchments beven and kirkby 1979 the xinanjiang model for humid catchments in southern china zhao 1992 and the scs model based on small rural catchments in the united states scs 1972 nevertheless despite that the controlling factors of hydrological partitioning vary greatly with temporal scales and study regions commonality exists among the behavior of hydrological partitioning across scales and serves as signatures from the co evolution of natural systems sivapalan 2005 newman et al 2006 gentine et al 2012 harman and troch 2014 trancoso et al 2016 2017 thus over the last 40 years there has been enduring interest to develop a generic theory to effectively unify the description of hydrological partitioning across spatial and temporal scales eagleson 1982 schymanski et al 2008 zehe et al 2010 inspiring progress was made by wang and tang 2014 who identified the theoretical commonality between three hydrological models at different temporal scales i e the budyko model at the mean annual scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the scs model at the daily scale using the proportionality hypothesis the proportionality hypothesis expresses the competition between different catchment functions and their symmetry identified in empirical functional representations of hydrological partitioning further studies were conducted to explore the optimality principle behind the proportionality hypothesis for example wang et al 2015 and zhao et al 2016 claimed that the maximum entropy production mep theory was the optimality principle behind the proportionality hypothesis and developed a unified water balance model accordingly unfortunately this theoretical framework has not been applied in real hydrological modelling nor tested against hydrological observations this is partly because for example six parameters need to be quantified with only three equations in zhao et al s 2016 model potentially leading to the issue of over parameterization beven 1993 it is still unclear if a unified pattern exists at different scales that can be identified and modelled using the proportionality hypothesis and it is imperative to resolve this before assessing testing its underlying optimality principle thus our objectives were to i develop a multi scale catchment water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis termed as pwbm ii calibrate and validate pwbm with catchment observations globally at the daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual time scales iii compare the model performance of pwbm with other conceptual hydrological models developed for specific time scales and iv explore the sensitivities and characteristics of model parameters across temporal scales 2 methodology 2 1 the proportionality hypothesis the proportionality hypothesis used here expresses the competition between different catchment functions and their symmetry identified in empirical functional representations of hydrological partitioning poncea and shetty 1995 assuming the amount of available water is z which is partitioned into x and y over a specified time interval x has an upper bound denoted as x p whereas y increases with z in an unbound fashion then the competition between x and y would follow the proportionality formula 1 x x p y z if an initial value x 0 is allocated to x before the competition between x and y is calculated the partitioning is determined by 2 x x 0 x p x 0 y z x 0 this hypothesis has been successfully applied for modelling runoff at the event scale scs 1972 inter annual runoff variability thomas 1981 poncea and shetty 1995 and mean annual water balance wang and tang 2014 wang et al 2015 however in these conceptual hydrological models different model structures and parameters were developed for specific time scales consequently the applicability of the proportionality hypothesis to unify hydrologic behaviors across temporal scales is still not demonstrated and remains elusive 2 2 a multi scale catchment water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis as illustrated in fig 1 we consider the total available water for a catchment during period i as the cumulative precipitation during period i p i l and water storage at the beginning of period i s i 1 l the total available water is then partitioned into three components streamflow q i l evapotranspiration e i l and water storage at the end of the period s i l which can be described as 3 p i s i 1 q i e i s i in this process a portion of precipitation is available for direct evaporation evaporation of water intercepted by vegetation and retained at the soil surface wang and tang 2014 which is defined as the initial evaporation e 0 i l there may also some water retained at the surface ponding shi et al 2009 and is defined as the initial storage s 0 i l the remaining available water p i s i 1 e 0 i s 0 i is then partitioned into continuing evapotranspiration e c i l continuing soil storage s c i l and runoff q i l as precipitation increases continuing evapotranspiration is increasingly limited by atmospheric evaporative demand and asymptotically approaches a constant value of e p i e 0 i where e p i is the potential evapotranspiration during period i continuing soil storage is limited by continuing catchment storage capacity s p s 0 i where s p i is the catchment storage capacity and runoff is constrained by the available water p i s i 1 e 0 i s 0 i applying the proportionality hypothesis one can obtain 4 e i e 0 i e p i e 0 i s i s 0 i s p s 0 i q i p i s i 1 s 0 i e 0 i note eq 4 is consistent with the budyko model at the mean annual scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the scs model at the event scale see supplementary text s1 for details there are three parameters in eq 4 namely e 0 i s p and s 0 i defining μ i e 0 i e p i so that a dimensional parameter e 0 i will turn to be dimensionless μ i and eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 e i μ i e p i e p i μ i e p i s i s 0 i s p s 0 i q i p i s i 1 s 0 i μ i e p i as s 0 i is often much smaller than s p i e water ponded over the surface is usually much less than that stored in the entire soil zone it is reasonable to assume that s p s 0 i is a constant with this and further defining s p s p s 0 we have 6 e i μ

supplementary text s2 for details 2 3 model verification to test pwbm we firstly applied the model to 22 global large catchments see section 3 1 for more information at a monthly time step the two model parameters i e s p and β for each catchment were determined by calibrating the model from 1984 to 1995 with the objective function to minimum the root mean square error rmse between observed and simulated q then based on the calibrated parameters s p and β we simulated q e and δs for the validation period i e 1996 2006 furthermore to evaluate the model performance across temporal scales we respectively calibrated and validated pwbm at the seasonal i e january to march as the first season in a year and so on annual and mean annual scale i e sequential three year mean yang et al 2016b with similar procedures the calibration and validation periods are consistent at multi time scales additionally as it is entirely plausible for the model performance and parameters to change with spatial scales li et al 2013 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 trancoso et al 2016 2017 we also tested pwbm at 255 global small unimpaired catchments at multiple time scales i e daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual with the former half data used for calibration and the latter half data used for validation each small catchment contains 12 years continuous q observations see section 3 1 for more information 2 4 comparison of pwbm with three other conceptual hydrological models additionally we compared the performance of pwbm with three other conceptual hydrological models including the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the budyko model at the mean annual scale the model structures and parameters needed in the three other conceptual hydrological models are provided in supplementary text s1 the periods and procedures of calibration and validation for these three models are the same with that described in section 2 3 for pwbm the abcd and budyko models are compared in both 22 global large catchments fig 2 b and 255 global small catchments fig 2b whereas the scs model is only compared in 255 global small catchments with daily streamflow observations fig 2b the performance of these three models and pwbm are assessed by three evaluation metrics krause et al 2005 i e the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 mccuen et al 2006 root mean square error rmse willmott and matsuura 2005 and relative root mean square error rrmse 3 data 3 1 water balance datasets at global catchments catchment average monthly time series of water balance components including precipitation evapotranspiration streamflow and water storage change for 32 major i e 200 000 km2 river catchments across the globe from 1984 through 2006 were provided by pan et al 2012 the water balance component dataset of pan et al 2012 represents an optimal combination of different data sources i e in situ observations remote sensing observations land surface model outputs and reanalysis products which has been considered as the best available water budget dataset to date li et al 2013 and are regarded as observations in the current study however as pwbm does not explicitly consider the effect of snow and or glacial melting on streamflow we excluded catchments located north of 60 n as a result only 22 of pan et al s 2012 32 catchments of were used herein fig 2a additionally daily streamflow observations at 255 small 1 480 13 662 km2 fig 2b unimpaired catchments from 1982 to 2010 across the globe south of 60 n were collected from four sources i global river discharge centre grdc http www bafg de grdc ii geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow gages ii database iii water information research and development alliance wirada between csiro and australian bureau of meteorology iv model parameter estimation experiment mopex the selected catchments have at least 12 years continuous streamflow observations with the former half data i e longer than 6 years being used for model calibration and latter half for model validation to ensure the selected catchments are minimally affected by human activities the selected catchments must satisfy the following criteria i no significant forest gain or loss less than2 of the total catchment area or ii irrigated areas less than 2 or iii urban areas less than 2 or iv the absence of large dams defined as total reservoir capacity 10 of the mean annual catchment observed q areas of forest change were determined from hansen et al 2013 based on 30 meter landsat imagery from 2000 through 2013 noting there is currently no other reliable high resolution global scale dataset on vegetation cover change from 1981 onwards irrigation areas were derived from the global map

meteorological data including air temperature wind speed surface pressure and specific humidity at a spatial resolution of 0 5 from 1982 to 2010 were obtained from the wfdei watch forcing data methodology applied to era interim data weedon et al 2014 global monthly net radiation from 1982 to 2010 at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 was provided by the multiscale synthesis and terrestrial

mswep version 1 dataset which represents an optimal combination of the highest quality p data sources available as a function of time scale and location beck et al 2017 monthly lai at a spatial resolution of 1 12 approximately 9 km from 1982 to 2010 was derived from zhu et al 2013 based on avhrr gimms 3 g ndvi data pinzon and tucker 2014 which has been shown to be the optimal avhrr ndvi dataset for tracking dynamics beck et al 2011 soil properties including saturated hydraulic conductivity and root zone storage capacity at 0 5 spatial resolution were acquired from the ornl daac spatial data access tool https doi org 10 3334 ornldaac 1388 land surface slope with 1 km spatial resolution was extracted from hydro1k dataset http lta cr usgs gov hydro1k as needed these gridded data were further aggregated by averaging and lumped for individual catchments 4 results 4 1 testing the pwbm at multiple scales 4 1 1 at global large catchments we first applied the model in 22 global large catchments at the monthly seasonal annual and mean annual time scales respectively averaged over the 22 catchments the model reasonably reproduces the monthly q series with nse at 0 42 rmse at 5 08 mm month 1 and rrmse at 30 3 on average for validation period fig 3 a for monthly e and δs pwbm performs even slightly better having an averaged nse and rrmse of 0 71 and 18 4 for simulated e and 0 79 and 16 4 for modeled δs note that we use the ratio of rmseδs over mean monthly p to calculate rrmseδs instead of the ratio of rmseδs over mean monthly δs as mean monthly δs over a long term would approach zero for the validation period the nse rmse and rrmse values for simulated q e and δs are all very close to those found for the calibration period suggesting the robustness of the model structure and stability of the model parameters to further illustrate the model performance from a time series prospective fig 4 shows the comparison of observed and simulated monthly time series of q e and δs in the yangzi river basin nile river basin and senegal river basin respectively and these catchments represent humid sub humid semi arid and arid climates it shows that the temporal dynamics of the three hydrological variables are generally well captured by the model except for that the model tends to slightly overestimate peak flows and underestimate e at the lower end for the nile and senegal river basins with the increase of time scale i e from monthly to the mean annual scale all three evaluation metrics for simulated q e and δs gradually decrease fig 3 lower rmse and rrmse suggest reduced overall simulation error as the time scale increases whereas a smaller nse value indicates a weakened model capacity to capture the temporal variations of the water balance components nevertheless the lower nse may also be caused by a lower temporal variability of observed hydrological variables at longer time scales as nse reflects more the aspect of temporal variability of a time series and is sensitive to extreme values nash and sutcliffe 1970 fig 5 shows the values of nse rmse and rrmse of simulated water balance components for individual catchments at the monthly scale similar spatial patterns of model performance were found for the seasonal and annual time scales supplementary figure s2 for simulated q lower nse and high rmse rrmse values are concentrated in high latitude regions i e the don ural danube volga and dnieper basin whereas lower nse values for simulated e are found in three tropical rainforest catchments i e the amazonas congo and mekong basin fig 5 nevertheless the mean rrmse of monthly simulated e for the three tropical rainforest catchments is only 11 2 which is even lower than the mean rrmse of 18 4 over all 22 large catchments for simulated δs it does not show any notable spatial pattern in all three metrics 4 1 2 at global small catchments using the small catchments distributed across the globe dataset we firstly test the model performance in simulating daily q at the 255 catchments with daily q observations their locations are provided in fig 2b as shown in fig 6 a there are 193 catchments 75 7 showing an nse value larger than zero during the calibration period with an averaged nse of 0 40 averaged rmse for daily q estimates during the calibration period are 34 8 mm month 1 fig 6b with 158 catchments 62 0 showing a rrmse lower than 100 similar with the results of the 22 large catchments fig 3 the model performance during the validation period shows only slight difference compared with that during the calibration period at the monthly scale 227 89 0 catchments show a positive nse value with 135 of them 50 showing an nse value higher than 0 5 for simulated q during the validation period fig 6d the mean positive nse of simulated q during the validation period is 0 49 averaged over all 255 small catchments the rmse and rrmse for monthly q are 18 9 mm month 1 and 47 0 respectively fig 6e and 6f during the validation period with 91 4 catchments showing monthly q rrmse lower than 100 the pwbm performs again better at longer time scales in the small catchments in terms of rmse and rrmse averaged over all small catchments the mean rmse and rrmse decreases to 14 1 mm month 1 and 38 2 at the seasonal scale 6 2 mm month 1 and 19 0 at the annual scale and 5 0 mm month 1 and 16 5 at the mean annual scale respectively fig 6 although we also find notable reductions in q nse at longer time scales fig 6g and 6j this as mentioned above may also be caused by the relative lower q temporal variability at longer time scales 4 2 comparison of pwbm with three other conceptual models at the global large catchments we compare the model performance between the pwbm with the abcd model at the monthly scale and the budyko model at the mean annual scale in simulating all three water balance components q e and δs results show that pwbm performs substantially better than the abcd model in simulating all three water balance components at the monthly scale with nse increased by 0 11 0 54 and 0 65 rmse decreased by 2 0 mm month 1 12 3 mm month 1 and 12 5 mm month 1 and rrmse decreased by 6 3 34 6 and 22 4 respectively fig 7 a c at the mean annual scale pwbm exhibits a similar performance compared with the budyko model with both rmse and rrmse of pwbm only slightly higher than those of the budyko model figs 7d and 9e at the global small catchments we compare the performance of pwbm in simulating q with the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and the budyko model at the mean annual scale as shown in fig 8 a c pwbm performs much better than the scs model at the daily scale with a higher average nse 0 40 vs 0 23 and lower average rmse 34 8 mm month 1 vs 47 6 mm month 1 and rrmse 98 6 vs 138 1 similar improvements are also found in pwbm over the abcd model fig 8d f the average nse positive rmse and rrmse for pwbm q are 0 49 18 9 mm month 1 and 47 0 whereas the average nse positive rmse and rrmse for abcd q are 0 35 22 9 mm month 1 and 58 9 respectively in addition the number of catchments showing negative nse values reduces by 26 2 and 19 1 in pwbm compared with that in scs and abcd this suggests a much better performance of pwbm in capturing the observed q variability than the scs and abcd models at the mean annual scale again pwbm shows a comparable performance with the long standing budyko model fig 8g and h 4 3 multi scale model parameters two parameters s p and β see eqs 7 and 8 need to be determined when applying the model sensitivity analysis shows that the model results in particularly the simulation of q is much more sensitive to β than s p table 1 using the global 22 large catchments as an example a 50 change in β would lead to a change in monthly q by 40 70 whereas the same change in s p only leads to monthly q changes by 1 table 1 the model sensitivity to parameter changes also varies with time scales with q sensitivity to changes in β decreasing and q sensitivity to changes in s p increasing as time scale increases table 1 a similar pattern in the model sensitivity to changes of these two parameters across time scales is also seen in the simulation of e table 1 as for δs changes in s p and β both show very limited impacts on the model performance table 1 suggesting an important internal model attribute that errors in simulated q and e caused by parameter uncertainties may be largely canceled each other out and consequently leads to an insensitive δs modelling to both parameters fig 9 shows the calibrated parameters s p and β for each catchment at the four time scales it is found that not only the median value but also the spatial variability of parameters s p show an evident decreasing trend with increasing time scales the parameters s p has a median value of 1400 mm with an upper quartile of 4086 mm and a lower quartile of 620 mm at the monthly scale these three values respectively decrease to 660 mm 1476 mm and 410 mm at the mean annual scale similar with s p parameters β also reduces as the time scale increases with the median of β being 0 32 0 26 0 23 and 0 19 at the monthly seasonal annual and mean annual scale respectively 5 discussion previously catchment hydrologists have sought to develop organizing principles based on prior theories derived from physical and ecological sciences zehe et al 2010 eagleson 1982 schymanski et al 2008 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 although these organizing principles have brought us comprehensive and new perspectives to understand hydrological systems they often suffer from the absence of verification across global bio climate using hydrological observations eagleson 1982 schymanski et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 in this study by developing a proportionality based multi scale catchment water balance model pwbm and verifying it with catchment observations globally at a range of time scales we provide the first comprehensive test of the proportionality hypothesis as an optimal principle that unifies catchment hydrological behavior for different time scales the present study contributes to top down hydrological modelling by developing a parsimonious model capable of reproducing catchment water balance at multi scales with the same model structure the top down approach is usually designed to interpret observed input output relationships in terms of internal characteristics and or processes occurring at certain scale harman and troch 2014 zhao et al 2016 thus a common consequential problem with previous top down hydrological modelling is the difficulty to generalize due to the absence of global perspective sivapalan et al 2003 here by invoking the proportionality hypothesis to generalize catchment hydrological partitioning behavior we provide a potential solution to this long standing problem in hydrological modelling it is noteworthy that the developed model herein shows good performance across both spatial i e large and small catchments and temporal i e daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual scales additionally although previous studies demonstrated the theoretical consistency between the proportionality hypothesis and other conceptual hydrological models developed for specific time scales zhao et al 2016 wang et al 2015 also see supplementary text s1 these models still perform quite differently in real hydrological model here we found that pwbm performs substantially better than the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and shows a comparable performance with the long standing budyko model at the mean annual scale when validated with hydrological observations figs 7 8 this is because that both scs and abcd models are essentially pwbm with simplifications during which some key processes may be overseen for example the influence of soil storage before a rainfall event on runoff generation is neglected in the scs model at the daily scale and the competing relationship between actual evapotranspiration and water storage is not made explicit in the abcd model at the monthly scale the better performance of pwbm implies that these processes are not negligible to understand and to model hydrological partitioning at these time scales the fact that there are only two model parameters i e s p and β also guarantee the transparency and parsimony of pwbm these two parameters represent the combined effects of catchment surface properties that affect catchment hydrological partitioning which are similar to the catchment surface parameter in the budyko model e g zhang et al 2001 potter et al 2005 donohue et al 2007 2012 parameter s p i e s p s p s 0 is mostly controlled by soil storage capacity s p as initial soil storage capacity s 0 is often much smaller than s p as s p decreases with the increase of time scale this suggests that the boundary of soil volume contributing to hydrological processes varies across time scales seibert et al 2003 spence 2007 at the intra annual scale groundwater storage and the groundwater surface water interaction may exert considerable impacts on the catchment water balance wang 2012 while these impacts on catchment water balance might be subtle as the time scale becomes longer i e annual or mean annual this is not explicitly considered in our model but implicitly reflected through parameter s p fig 9a parameter β is related with the initial catchment evapotranspiration i e canopy interception and water retained over the soil surface and the importance of e p in the control of e implying that both vegetation characteristics and soil properties can impact on β to verify this we further explore the relationship between β and a set of catchment properties and find that β is positively correlated with root zone storage capacity and negatively correlated with mean catchment slope rainfall intensity and soil saturated hydraulic conductivity supplementary figure s3 root zone storage capacity is jointly determined by effective rooting depth and water holding capacity both of which are generally larger in more humid regions loam soil with deeper effective rooting depth compared to more arid areas sandy soil with shallower effective rooting depth milly 1994 zhang et al 2001 this explains the positive relationship between root zone storage capacity and β by contrast steeper slope larger rainfall intensity and higher soil hydraulic conductivity all favor the generation of q with less e being produced for a fixed climate forcing i e same rainfall depth and e p beven and kirkby 1979 robinson et al 1995 yang et al 2007 consequently these three variables show a negative correlation with β in addition the value of parameter β shows a decreasing trend with the increase of time scales fig 9b suggesting that interception accounts for a higher proportion of total evapotranspiration at shorter time scales despite the overall good performance of pwbm across multiple spatial and temporal scales the model behavior does exhibit some spatial heterogeneity as shown in fig 5 a lower pwbm performance in simulating q was reported in four high latitude catchments i e the don ural danube volga and dnieper basin where mean annual air temperature is less than 5 a similar pattern of decreased model performance with decreasing air temperature is also found in global small catchments supplementary figure s4 in these high latitude catchments we find that the month with maximum q precedes the month with maximum p see examples provided in supplementary figure s5 this suggests that errors in estimated q are very likely due to ignoring the extra water input and energy consumption resulted from snow and or glacial melting in the model which would has considerable influence on the generation of q in such high latitude catchments barnett et al 2005 berghuijs et al 2014 however we also find this influence is reduced for long time scales supplementary figure s4 at the mean annual scale the effect of snow and or glacial melting on runoff is negligible when compared with other factors i e the amount of total precipitation whereas snow and or glacial melt may be the main water input for runoff generation for specific months or season immerzeel et al 2009 suzuki et al 2006 incorporating the effects of snow and or glacial melt into the current model remains a challenge for future research finally it is worth mentioning that the proportionality hypothesis is a mathematical expression of the competitive relationship between water balance components however the reason why the competition between hydrological processes at different time scales follow such a form as presented in eq 7 and 8 still remains unrevealed several theoretical explorations kleidon and schymanski 2008 paik and kumar 2010 westhoff et al 2014 regard the maximum entropy production mep theory as the foundation of the proportionality hypothesis ph as both i e mep and ph identify the commonality existing in the hydrological system wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 in this regard future studies are needed to explore the linkages between mep theory and the proportionality hypothesis to better understand the physical basis of the proportionality hypothesis 6 conclusion we developed a conceptual water balance model based on the proportionality hypothesis pwbm and successfully simulated the catchment water balance at multiple time scales with the same model structure with only two model parameters i e s p and β needed in pwbm this guarantees its transparency and parsimony pwbm was tested in 22 large basins and 255 small basins globally at multi time scales i e daily monthly seasonal annual and mean annual with overall good agreement between simulated and observed water balance components at these different time scales additionally we found that the model performance improved in terms of the root mean square error but degraded in regard to capturing the temporal hydrological variability as assessed with the nash sutcliffe efficiency index when the time scale increased nevertheless in terms of both rmse and nse pwbm performs substantially better than the scs model at the daily scale the abcd model at the monthly scale and shows a comparable performance with the long standing budyko model at the mean annual scale this study contributes to top down hydrological modelling by offering evidence on the applicability of the proportionality hypothesis at multiple spatial and temporal scales however
