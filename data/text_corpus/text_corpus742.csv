3710,street flooding is problematic in urban areas where impervious surfaces such as concrete brick and asphalt prevail impeding the infiltration of water into the ground during rain events water ponds and rise to levels that cause considerable economic damage and physical harm previous urban flood studies and models have evaluated the factors contributing to street flooding such as precipitation slope elevation and the drainage network yet due to the complexity of the interconnectedness of these factors and lack of available data difficulty remains in ascertaining the localized areas prone to and experiencing street flooding thus residents and city management of problem areas are unaware and unable to prepare for street flooding events this study presents an evaluation of new york city s 311 street flooding reports via an inference model as a way to detect the zip codes where street flooding is prevalent the potential explanatory variables for street flooding complaints were precipitation amounts and 311 sewer back up water arising from home drains as a result of rainfall manhole overflow water arising from manhole covers on the street and catch basin a clogged basin preventing rainwater from entering storm drains complaints using stage iv radar precipitation data and 311 sewer reports spanning a 10 year period a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression analysis with an embedded zero inflation model is used to detect the variables statistically significant as predictors of flood complaint counts specific to each zip code the model is also tested using an out of sample prediction scheme by training it with the detected explanatory variables precipitation was found to be a predictor in 81 of the zip codes for the infrastructural variables manhole overflow complaints were significant to street flood complaints in 21 of the zip codes back up complaints were significant in 41 of the zip codes and catch basin complaints were significant in 47 of the zip codes thus for an appreciable number of zip codes infrastructural complaints were found to be predictors of street flooding complaints this is the first study of its kind to investigate the infrastructural contributions of street flooding by 311 analysis thereby identifying factors of street flooding aside from precipitation leading contributions of the study include the demonstration of infrastructural impact towards the occurrence of street flooding and also the circumscription to the zip code and borough levels allowing for tailored preventative actions in critical areas keywords street flooding complaints rainfall infrastructure complaints urban hydrologic issues statistical learning new york city 311 complaints urban flooding street flooding negative binomial lasso catch basin issues extremes 1 introduction flooding events result in multiple fatalities and considerable property losses each year particularly within the urban environment the effects are pronounced urban watersheds lined with impervious surfaces such as concrete asphalt and stone have a limited amount of infiltration and recharge during heavy rainfall thus surface flow dominates the hydrological response serrano 2010 also as the drainage system becomes overwhelmed water overflows as runoff and pluvial flooding or what is commonly known as street flooding occurs furthermore as urban areas are densely populated the consequences of flooding are oftentimes more severe than those of coastal or tidal flooding events indeed for a given storm more economic damage and injuries have been shown to occur in urban areas as opposed to rural areas sharif yates roberts mueller 2006 for example the national weather service nws reported that in 2014 a single urban flooding event in detroit michigan resulted in 1 8 billion of direct damages representing 60 of the total flood damages for that year in the united states nws 2020a in addition in a study by the chicago s center for neighborhood technology cnt the economic costs of urban flooding for the densely populated area of cook county illinois totaled more than 773 million over a five year period cnt 2020 thus due to the unique physical and social characteristics of an urban area flooding has acute impact the modeling of street flooding has the potential to reduce the economic and social effects of severe storms in urban developments specifically the estimation and projection of flooded areas has great benefit as it allows for the implementation of early warnings which in turn provides people with the opportunity to take shelter and perform preventative measures in recent years urban models based on a variety of methodologies including cellular automata image processing and physically based systems have been introduced guidolin et al 2016 lo wu lin hsu 2015 generally these models include analyses of rainfall infiltration and the sewer system in urban flood simulations it is common to evaluate extended surcharge and other aspects of the drainage network by dual drainage modeling which incorporates the interaction between surface flow and the sewer flow of surcharged sewer systems djordjević prodanović maksimović 1999 distinctly extended surcharge occurs when water is held under pressure within a sewer system during a rain event thereby preventing the surface water to enter the drainage system or causing the water from the drainage system to escape to the surface schmitt thomas ettrich 2004 within the united states the most widely used flood forecasting model is the flash flood guidance of the nws which offers a deterministic physically based hydrologic model utilizing real time radar and satellite precipitation estimates ntelekos georgakakos krajewski 2006 world meteorological organization 2020 thus as shown there are various models and the ongoing research demonstrates the interest of emergency management to produce an effective model customized to the metropolitan area while the production of urban flood models particularly physically based models is in continuum nonetheless there are obstacles for instance the nws model may forecast floods yet it does not consider urban factors also the nws and other models incorporate rainfall however they do not include some infrastructural factors such as back up flooding moreover with the building of a flood forecasting model other hurdles including cost effectiveness and data availability present specifically in older metropolitan cities the design of the drainage system is oftentimes unavailable al suhili et al 2019 for instance zahura et al found that physics based models such as tuflow also suffered impairments by insufficient drainage data zahura et al 2020 in addition urban flood forecasting models including flash flood models have the distinct challenge with the validation of accuracy for example flash floods are often caused by severe storms occurring only within six hours of rainfall nws 2020b hence there is a difficulty in quantifying measurements in the brief timespan urban flood forecasting models at timescales longer than that of the flash floods also have limitations as they might not be benchmarked with real observations consequently there is a hinderance in the comparison of model results with the physical system therefore there is a need for a low cost empirical data driven analysis which would illuminate the exact urban areas flooded during a rain event in addition to providing insight into the specific sewer infrastructure issues within those areas accounts by persons directly experiencing street flooding may resolve some of the issues and provide clarity into the occurrence extent and driving mechanisms of street flooding particular to an urban place in new york city nyc there is a platform referred to as 311 where residents business owners and visitors are able to file issue reports to the nyc government via phone website or social media minkoff 2016 for instance an observer who notices street flooding may enter the nyc 311 website and input the description nature address and date and time of the occurrence these filings by new yorkers are invaluable as the 311 complaints via catch basin manhole and sewer back up reports offer infrastructural insight into the response of nyc sewer system of which available drainage data is insufficient moreover street flooding reports may serve an additional benefit as time date and exact location of a complaint is listed the 311 street flooding complaints may serve as tool for urban flooding model validation as a model s prediction of flooding in an area may be supported by an analysis of the local reports thus the data provided by 311 is a way to understand the causes and effects of street flooding this study presents an inference model which highlights the key climate and infrastructural variables that govern street floods in nyc of nyc the 311 complaints are aggregated over seven days weekly time scale and to the zip code level street flooding reports are taken as the response variable whereas precipitation amounts sewer back up manhole overflow and catch basin reports serve as predictors or explanatory variables utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression analysis tibshirani 1996 with an embedded zero inflation zi model per zip code the variables effecting street flooding complaints are selected by identifying the climate and infrastructural issues areas prone to street flooding and their particular vulnerabilities are revealed thereby providing direction and clarity for city management and forecasters furthermore such an analysis complements the physical modeling endeavors and provides tools of validation there have been a few studies of which crowd sourcing was applied in flood analyses in one such paper sadler et al flood severity had been analyzed and the data reported by residents and individual observers was utilized to provide an inference model as sadler et al delved extensively into environmental factors such as water table level and rainfall intensity sadler et al 2018 this study differs by reviewing infrastructural factors such as issues involving the drainage network and external catch basins additionally there have also been flood analyses which have specifically used the nyc 311 format for instance kelleher and mcphillips employed nyc 311 complaints to explore the relationships between topographic indices and pluvial flooding kelleher mcphillips 2020 while the study highlights the value of citizen reports as a validation tool it however does not analyze 311 street flood complaints in regards to climatic or drainage sources in another study by smith and rodriguez street flooding complaints were used to investigate topographic issues in addition to serving as a validation method for a proposed rainfall dataset smith rodriguez 2017 yet as only street flooding and highway flooding complaints were compiled the infrastructural related 311 complaints were not assessed in contrast to previous research this study is unique in its evaluation of sewer related issues and their effect on street flooding the paper is outlined in the following manner in section 2 the study area and data processing are described relative information on nyc is set forth with a focus on the climatic and topographic elements population density borough and sewershed delineations and drainage networks next the data collection of the 311 complaints and radar precipitation is discussed along with the tools and methods involved with the pre processing section 3 offers the methodology of the analysis there is an evaluation of the quantity and frequency of complaints at the zip code and borough levels in the methodology section the lasso zi is introduced as well along with the negative binomial generalized linear regression model nbglm zi where the prior identifies the infrastructural and climatic predictors which feeds into the latter for out of sample oos predictions in section 4 the results of the model are presented including the mapping and tabulations of coefficients variability and error determinations and their implications are discussed and interpreted finally in section 6 summary and major conclusions are presented 2 study area and data 2 1 study area nyc is located in the northeastern united states at the coast of the atlantic ocean it is markedly impervious and populous which makes it an ideal study area for urban flooding spanning only 800 square kilometers nyc has the highest population of any u s city and it also has the greatest density united states census bureau 2012 moreover dissimilar to other u s cities nyc is comprised of five boroughs each representing a separate county queens brooklyn manhattan bronx and staten island of the boroughs queens and brooklyn have the highest populations at approximately 2 200 000 and 2 500 000 people respectively manhattan with approximately 1 500 000 residents has the highest population density bronx has approximately 1 300 000 residents and staten island is the least populous at 470 000 residents united states census bureau 2020 in regards to ground topography approximately 72 of the land area of nyc is covered with impervious surfaces city of new york 2020a a map of percentage impervious surfaces is shown in fig 1 a concerning the climate of nyc the classification is humid subtropical nws 2020c according to köppen geiger climate subdivisions the mean daily temperature is 13 c and the yearly rainfall in nyc is roughly 1270 mm nws 2020d annually the mean number of days with precipitation of 0 254 mm or higher is 120 days national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2020 and the mean number of days with precipitation of 25 4 mm or higher is 13 14 days state of new york 2020 in new york and areas of the northeast annual precipitation is uniformly distributed petersen devineni sankarasubramanian 2012 according to the new york state climate hazards profile nyc has experienced between 90 and 102 severe storms between the years 1960 through 2014 and the subsequent costs ranged between 4 to 17 million state of new york 2020 in addition due to climate change it is projected that precipitation extremes are expected to increase in the future gonzález et al 2019 with respect to infrastructure the catch basins of nyc connect the storm water to the underground sewer system a map of the number of catch basins per square kilometer is shown in fig 1b of the sewer connections there are two types of drainage systems in nyc combined sewer system and separate storm sewer system the separate storm sewer system uses separate pipes one pipe to carry wastewater to the wastewater plant and a different pipe to carry stormwater to the waterways city of new york 2020b most of nyc is comprised of the combined sewer system which uses a single pipe to transport both wastewater and stormwater to a wastewater treatment plant city of new york 2020b servicing drainage areas ranging from 13 to 102 square kilometers there are fourteen wastewater treatment plants which are also known as sewersheds city of new york 2020c in addition for the combined sewer system when there is heavy rainfall and capacity is exceeded overflows occur and a portion of the water discharges to a combined sewer outfall and enters a waterway state of new york 2020 2 2 nyc 311 platform the nyc 311 sewer complaints data may be accessed via the nyc open data website data cityofnewyork us where data is available from january 1 2010 onwards the complaints are geocoded with the latitude and longitude of the location from where the complainant had stated the issue had taken place the date and time the complaints are also recorded through 311 a person may file a complaint and categorize sewer complaint as follows street flooding sf to report flooding or ponding on a street sewer back up bu to report during heavy rainfall or flooding water arising from a toilet sink drain or bathtub drain manhole overflow mo to report a manhole overflowing with water or sewage or catch basin cb to report a clogged or damaged catch basin for sewer back ups it shows a relationship between the private drains and the public sewer system as back up flooding occurs when either the height of the water in the public pipes are greater than that of the gravity inlets inside the private property or when the inlet level of the storm drains are below the water level of the sewer schmitt thomas ettrich 2004 regarding manhole issues the overflowing of a manhole signifies surcharge as water from the sewer system has travelled to the surface thus mo complaints may be indicative of infrastructural issues lastly as catch basins are the grates allowing for the collection of storm water cb reports provide useful knowledge to street flooding behavior if catch basins are blocked or malformed in certain areas surface water level increases and this may be indicative of city maintenance problems 2 3 radar data the national center for atmospheric research ncar earth observing laboratory eol website offers ncep emc 4km gridded data grib stage iv datasets where hourly 6 hour 12 hour 24 hour totals of millimeter precipitation amounts are available from years 2001 through 2020 as the stage iv data is unable to adjust for severe snow events the data in the northeastern united states include only rainfall data hamidi et al 2017 from the eol website 24 hour radar precipitation data from years 2010 through 2019 were ordered the thiessen polygon method viessman lewis 2003 was employed with each radar point as center to aggregate the gridded radar precipitation data available at the 4 km by 4 km resolution to the zip code resolution with the use of the thiessen polygon method of arc gis pro a weighted average of radar points within a zip code boundary was calculated then the rainfall amount per zip code was determined using this weighted average the data was finally aggregated to the weekly time scale i e total precipitation in millimeters per week prcp 2 4 data collection processing and preliminary analysis sewer complaints data using 311 reports from january 1 2010 through december 2019 were downloaded from the nyc open data government website the data was geo aggregated to the zip code level and only the issues relating to street flooding were extracted in addition to account for possible lags in the occurrence of an event and the report of the issue weekly sums of each complaint were calculated a reason for lags is that a person may take time to report an issue this may be especially true in urban areas where warm season rainstorms producing short duration heavy rainfall oftentimes take place in the evenings gonzález et al 2019 also there may be lags between the rain event and the occurrence of street flooding such as for instance when the drainage system becomes more overwhelmed with debris as time passes since the exact detection of the lag that measures the difference between the time of the event s and the time of the complaint s may be arduous for simplicity a weekly timescale sunday to saturday was decided as the unit of temporal aggregation for all the variables it is assumed that a week is not far removed to have lost the influence of precipitation resulting in street flooding complaints the same is true for infrastructure complaints where the infrastructure complaints within a week are assumed the possible antecedents of the street flooding complaints that week another measure taken was to ensure that the same complainant was not reporting a specific location repeatedly by the mechanism of the 311 website a complainant may report the same location more than once in a day to see whether a location was reported more than once in a day the sf mo bu and cb complaints over the ten year period were processed for their uniqueness the 311 data lists each complaint as a row containing latitude and longitude location coordinates only the unique location coordinates were retained in this study of the raw 311 data from january 1 2010 through december 31 2019 there were 25 574 sf 6 042 mo 137 974 bu and 85 607 cb total collective reports and it was determined that 25 378 99 2 5 687 94 1 128 751 93 3 and 82 191 96 0 were unique respectively zip code borough and catch basin shapefiles were downloaded from nyc open data and processed via arcgis pro after all data was processed 174 zip codes 530 weeks of precipitation totals and 311 sf bu cb mo complaint totals over the ten year period from january 1 2010 through december 31 2019 were used for analysis before the development of the model a complaint frequency analysis was conducted per zip code the number of sf complaints over 10 years were computed and examined fig 2 the median of total complaints per zip code was 87 with 1300 being the max and zero being the minimum the histogram fig 2a shows that the majority of zip codes reported under 200 complaints during the 10 year period 136 zip codes 78 to illustrate the zip codes most frequently reporting sf complaints the average of the total complaint for all zip codes were taken average total complaints 139 and the zip codes with a total complaint value greater than the average of 139 complaints were identified fig 2b presents a map of the total complaints per zip code where the zip codes that have total complaints greater than the average total complaints are highlighted the illustration shows staten island lower brooklyn and queens as having the highest frequencies of sf reports per borough the number of complaints per 10 000 people are 98 4 44 5 24 6 15 8 and 13 3 for staten island queens brooklyn manhattan and bronx respectively 3 methodology the nyc department of environmental protection identifies increased precipitation blocked catch basin grates and surcharged sewers leading to sewer back ups as major causes of flooding in nyc city of new york 2020d with a yearly average precipitation of 1270 mm nyc experiences significant precipitation through the year with little intra annual variations however there is a considerable spatial variation within nyc hamidi et al 2017 which may result in localized street flooding blocked catch basin grates may also lead to street flooding intense storms may push leaves and litter onto catch basins where they could mold into mats and obstruct the basins blocked catch basins prevent rainwater from entering the storm sewer thereby causing street flooding frequently during intense rainfall events the combined volume of stormwater and wastewater exceeds the sewer system s capacity under such circumstances the excess stormwater remains in the streets leading to flooding the hypothesis of this study is that the climatic and infrastructural issues are statistically significant predictors of the response 311 sf complaints precipitation the climatic feature is the primary cause of flooding in addition sewer surcharge as indicated by back up and manhole overflow issues or the blockage of stormwater drains by catch basins also contribute to street flooding for variable identification a lasso zi which imposes a penalty function cancelling out the coefficients of less important variables was implemented the lasso method shares the usual model assumptions concerning the nature of the relationship between response variable and the explanatory variables but adds an important l1 constraint to the regression coefficients in least squares optimization the result is the inevitable shrinkage of certain coefficients to zero allowing the lasso technique to enjoy advantageous properties of ridge regression and best subset selection tibshirani 1996 hastie tibshirani and friedman 2001 then a zi generalized linear modeling framework was used to perform oos predictions using an eight two year training and testing data set as to show the variability in the sf complaints using prcp cb complaints bu complaints and mo complaints since the sf complaints data is discrete and since the counts per week are being measured a negative binomial model was employed as the link function the negative binomial model is a generalization of the poisson regression models that accounts for overdispersion lawless 1987 for variable selection the multicollinearity adjusted adaptive lasso for zero inflated count regression amazonn package in r was used the algorithm allows for the implementation of lasso with a zi nbglm element mallick 2018 by shrinking the coefficients of the predictors or tuning the coefficients to zero lasso creates a subset of the predictors that have the most effect on the response allowing for more interpretable results and higher prediction accuracy tibshirani 1996 and zi models accommodate excess zeroes of which the nbglm cannot by providing a two component model a point mass at zero and a poisson geometric or negative binomial zeileis kleiber jackman 2008 as the 311 count data is discrete and there are many weeks with zero complaints the lasso with a zi nbglm was appropriate the nbglm part of the model with y as the response variable with the four predictors for each zip code i is shown here 1 y it n b p it r i where 2 p it r i r i λ it λ it e β i 0 β i 1 precip it β i 2 cb it β i 3 bu it β i 4 mo it 3 equation 1 shows that the weekly aggregated street flooding complaints in each zip code y it is modeled as a negative binomial distribution with a success parameter p it and an overdispersion parameter r i the success parameter p it relates to the rate of occurrence λ it equation 2 which is informed by a regression on the precipitation precip it and infrastructure covariates cb it bu it mo it equation 3 β i 0 is the regression intercept for zip code i and β i 1 β i 2 β i 3 β i 4 are the regression slopes representing the sensitivity of the street flooding complaints to precipitation precip it catch basin complaints cb it sewer back up complaints bu it and manhole overflow complaints mo it respectively these model parameters are estimated using a maximum likelihood approach in r version 4 0 4 friedman et al 2010 the explained variance pseudo r2 of the nbglm which is estimated as 1 l 0 l β 2 n where l 0 l β is the ratio of the likelihood of the null model to the fitted model and n is the sample size demonstrates the extent to which the model explains the variability in the response cox and snell 1989 as the 311 complaint data was discrete the fit index for a redefined pseudo r2 proposed by nagelkerke nagelkerke 1991 was utilized this redefined measure normalizes the model pseudo r2 to the maximum possible achievable using the likelihood ratio estimate for the oos predictions eight years were used as training data and two years as testing data using a k fold cross validation technique the training data consisted of eight years of the sf bu cb mo and prcp weekly data with the remaining two years serving as the testing set the years were randomly shuffled such that the training set may consist of a different eight grouping of years between 2010 through 2019 and a subsequent different two year grouping of the testing set using the lasso selected variables the model is trained by the influence of the predictors towards the outcome sf during the eight not necessarily consecutive years predictions of sf based on the observed predictors for the two years are then conducted using the trained nbglm zi model for the nine zip codes where lasso did not select a significant predictor a standard nbglm is utilized without lasso selection to obtain predicted values the predicted sf values are then compared to the actual sf values for each random selection of training and testing sets simulations were run 100 times and the mean arctangent absolute percentage error maape values were determined per zip code maape accommodates data with zero values by the application of slope as an angle as opposed to slope as a ratio kim and kim 2016 maape 1 106 t 1 106 a r c t a n o t p t o t f o r t 1 2 106 4 o represents the observed sf weekly complaints for the two year period 106 weeks and p represents the predicted sf values by the equation it is seen that a closer value between the observed and predicted would result in a value closer to zero and a larger difference between the observed and predicted would result in a value converging to π 2 radians in summary the modeling framework has the following steps 1 for each zip code statistically significant predictors are identified by the use of the multicollinearity adjusted adaptive lasso implemented with the zi nbglm 2 the statistically significant predictors by zip code are reported as the most important features for understanding street floods in that zip code 3 a zi nbglm is trained using the lasso inferred variables for each zip code and the model s efficacy is tested using oos predictions against the held out data this final step provides additional robustness to the model and its selection 4 results and discussion 4 1 the circumstance of nyc street flooding by citizen imported data this study first maps the locations where street flooding is often reported when examining the total sf reports over the 10 year period the presence of flooding is highest in staten island lower brooklyn and various zip codes in queens the complaints are localized to the zip code level to allow for a tailored insight into the areas where street flooding occurs the most as this would be necessary for flood forecasting at the neighborhood or street level as each borough represents a separate county within nyc this study included a localization to the borough level as well in addition an examination of the reports at the broader borough level is also beneficial to stakeholders and policy makers as borough boards are able to create bylaws and plans in this consideration staten island and queens are of special interest per 10 000 residents staten island has the most complaints which is roughly double the complaints of queens the second highest frequency borough likewise queens has almost twice the complaints of brooklyn which follows in third moreover as a 311 complaint by its nature is citizen reported street flooding is not only occurring but is also adversely felt by the residents especially those in staten island and queens 4 2 response to predictors and their significance the regression analysis provides a selection of predictors and the degree of their influence in fig 3 the zip code level significant explanatory variables were based on the inference of the regression coefficients β i 1 β i 2 β i 3 β i 4 the strength of the association e β i 1 for infrastructure and precipitation covariates are expressed as percentage change in the expected weekly counts per unit change in the explanatory variable and it is shown in the graduated color scheme the zip codes designated in white did not have the variable selected as predictor by lasso the intercept from the model β i 0 for each zip code is also shown in fig 3e plotted as e β i 0 as expected there is similarity to the frequency map as the intercept exhibits an upward shift with more complaints thus insight into the behavior of the predictors is gained by the regression coefficients the spatial variability of the predictors is also observed there was a total of 165 zip codes of the 174 zip codes in the study where at least one predictor was selected by lasso prcp was selected in 141 zip codes of which 55 12 28 20 and 26 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively bu was selected in 72 zip codes of which 29 6 17 9 and 11 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively cb was selected in 82 zip codes of which 25 9 20 8 and 20 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively mo was selected in 37 zip codes of which 17 2 4 5 and 9 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively of the variables prcp was an explanatory variable in the most zip codes followed by cb bu is the third most represented explanatory variable lastly mo is shown as an explanatory variable in the least amount of zip codes thus while climatic and infrastructural variability have high selection there are also notable differences among zip codes to further examine the spatial variability of the boroughs each selected predictor s breakdown by borough is determined in table 1 for each predictor where significance is found the percent of zip codes in each borough is shown in addition table 1 shows the ratio of the mean exponent of the β of each selected predictor of borough to the mean exponent of the β for nyc as total bt ratio a measure to understand the expected sensitivity of a borough relative to the expected sensitivity of nyc for each of the explanatory variables a bt ratio greater than 1 signifies that the borough experiences a stronger reaction greater increase in sf complaints when the lasso selected predictor either cb bu mo or prcp experiences an increase in complaints or in the case of prcp amounts than that of nyc on average a ratio lower than 1 signifies that the borough experiences a weaker reaction by the table the selected predictor and strength of association is shown at the borough level and compared to the overall findings of nyc plausibly sf complaints may not be a comprehensive portrayal of the occurrence of street flooding in nyc as certain zip codes or boroughs may have residents with greater proclivities towards addressing concerns yet the selection of the predictor prcp in 82 of the zip codes table 1 demonstrate that in the majority of nyc zip codes the sf reports are consistent with and heavily affected by rain events in addition the lasso selection of the other predictors as affecting sf reports further strengthens the validity of the 311 platform as an accurate portrayal rainfall occurrence and effects if reports were being made haphazardly a connection between an infrastructural element and street flooding would not be found by lasso therefore while there may be additional factors affecting residents complaints there is sufficient accuracy in the 311 complaint filings as the connection between the predictors and sf reporting found by the model further validify the platform 4 3 analysis of model parameters an analysis of model parameters also provide insight into the different occurrences among boroughs when looking at the analysis it shows that although there are areas with a high frequency of sf reports these areas do not necessarily have the greatest rate of sf report increase when its predictor experiences an increase this lack of sharp increases in sf compared to the increases in the lasso selected variables cb bu mo or p coupled with a high frequency of complaints indicating active engagement on the 311 platform may signal a chronic problem in those areas of which the residents appear to experience street flooding during moderate conditions due to low beta values and subsequently file more complaints indeed this is evident especially in staten island examining fig 2b 10 of 12 staten island zip codes have a high frequency of reports yet when looking at the infrastructural variables of significance in fig 3 b d none of the zip codes have beta percentages in the highest quantile table 1 thus while bu and cb specifically show significance in 50 and 75 of the staten island zip codes respectively an increase in those complaints do not trigger the greatest increase in sf as compared to zip codes in other boroughs interestingly one such borough is manhattan manhattan has only two zip codes with total complaints slightly greater than the average total complaints for nyc in total when looking at fig 2b yet for instance in fig 3c and table 1 manhattan has cb as predictor in 48 of the zip codes where at least eight zip codes are ranked in the highest quantile group based on sensitivity it may be inferred that the residents are not reporting 311 complaints specifically sf reports as shown in the frequency analysis excessively in manhattan however when there is a cb report sf reports are strongly influenced this is apparent for bu in manhattan as well and in bronx cb and mo with high bt ratios table 1 respectively also behave in a similar manner to manhattan finally it can be seen that zip codes have different sensitivities as shown in the fig 3 maps this also supports the notion that zip codes suffer from varying infrastructural issues at varying extents when a predictor is selected the parameter analysis provides information regarding the severity of the effect and at this study s localized level an average area of 2 75 square kilometers per zip code problem areas are pinpointed 4 4 variable importance 4 4 1 catch basin cb catch basin infrastructural issues are of noteworthiness since they directly lead to street flooding if they are not working properly catch basins are also an external component of the drainage network therefore the public has direct access to the basins and are able to assist or damage them consequently an outreach effort by nyc to the residents may be of help one such partnership exists in newark nj where there is a program called adopt a catch basin city of newark 2021 the program offers residents the opportunity to use an arcgis solutions mapping platform to select a catch basin to adopt they care for the basin cleaning and removing debris then they are also encouraged to paint and decorate the basin city of newark 2021 in this study cb was selected as a predictor in almost half of the nyc zip codes in total while similar to the frequency trend staten island had the highest percentage of zip codes at 75 where cb was selected as a predictor queens and brooklyn followed at 42 and 54 respectively finally there were also many zip codes in manhattan where cb was selected as a predictor 48 despite manhattan having a low number of total complaints furthermore in manhattan the difference between zip codes with prcp selected as a predictor 60 to the number with cb selected 48 was smallest of the boroughs it is possible to infer that the contrast of model results from one borough such as manhattan to the others highlights specific issues within the zones when looking at the map of impervious surface percentage fig 1a it is seen that manhattan has the highest percentage of impervious surfaces thus a possible theory for cb in manhattan having a high bt ratio and selection percentage is that the storm runoff may be carrying trash into the stormwater drains thereby clogging the catch basins specifically manhattan has more active construction sites than any other borough city of new york 2020 and waste from sites are a contributing factor to runoff debris in urban areas environmental protection agency 2003 overall for an infrastructural category cb complaints were selected as predictors in a large number of zip codes this is an impactful finding as it indicates that oftentimes when one person observes and reports a street flooding event there is another person observing and reporting water ponding from a clogged catch basin within that time period 4 4 2 sewer back ups bu and manhole overflows mo concerning bu when looking at fig 3b there appears to be a noticeable shift inland when comparing the areas to those of cb selected predictor as shown in fig 3c for bronx the results were similar to the other boroughs in regards to bu selection whereas for cb the bronx had a much lower number of zip codes showing significance also manhattan appears to have the lowest bu issues aside from location bu performed similarly to cb with 41 of zip codes having the variable selected as a predictor for zip codes experiencing explanatory power from a combined prcp with bu or mo issues it signifies a chaotic condition where it is not only raining and the streets are flooded but internal drains are being overwhelmed and working in reverse order an internal drainage issue may not be as easily remedied as with catch basins where maintenance and public awareness may have a positive effect however areas shown on the maps where bu and mo issues are signified should be investigated monitored or modeled as it may facilitate long term planning improvements it has been theorized that a difference between the topographic wetness index concerning flood reports of staten island and manhattan is due to the type of construction of the combined sewer overflow system in manhattan compared to that of the separate sewer system in staten island kelleher mcphillips 2020 however with the inclusion of all boroughs the results in this paper show that the zip codes in brooklyn which are mostly comprised of the combined sewer system have back up issues as a predictor of street flooding in 46 of its zip codes when reviewing the open sewer atlas data open sewer atlas nyc 2021 a web resource directed from the nyc open data website city of new york 2020e 80 of the zip codes in this study are within the combined sewer system when reviewing the results of this study 81 of the zip codes with bu as a selector are located in a combined sewer system thus there appears to be no difference in nyc between the combined sewer system and separate sewer system in regards to sf reporting finally concerning manhole overflow complaints there is significance in few zip codes as these areas are variously located throughout nyc there is indication that the sewer issues are area specific localized to the manhole level the mapping of these particular zip codes would be of aid to city management in the investigation of issues within the internal drainage network 4 4 3 precipitation prcp as expected prcp is the primary driver of street flooding prcp is shown as an explanatory variable in 81 of the zip codes regarding the beta results street flooding reports respond greatest to changes in precipitation in staten island and brooklyn however many zip codes in queens and bronx also exhibit strong increases to street flooding complaints due to increases in precipitation amounts fig 3a highlights the zip codes prone to dramatic increases in street flooding as thus particularly in those areas precautions may necessary to take in the advent of a forecasted severe rain event our future modeling will include rainfall intensity in addition to duration as they are key elements in flash flooding nws 2020e 4 5 explained variability pseudo r2 and maape determinations were used for an understanding of variability to illustrate the dependence of explained variability on the number of complaints pseudo r2 values were mapped against total complaints in fig 4 in addition the pseudo r2 values are depicted in table 2 and mapped in fig 5 to show an aspect of variability as an additional measure of variability maape values determined from the observed and predicted values by the oos predictions are illustrated in fig 6 5 model limitations there were factors which appeared to affect the pseudo r2 and maape values the mean pseudo r2 determined by the nbglm was 0 14 boroughs such as staten island brooklyn and queens had pseudo r2 values greater than the mean at 0 22 0 16 and 0 15 respectively table 2 as fig 4 highlights pseudo r2 values trend greater when there are a higher number of sf complaints similarly it is seen that lower maape values lower errors as shown in fig 6 occur in the zip codes with greater total of sf complaints thus if the model were to be constructed on a larger grid scale or if there was more data on the street flooding complaints the pseudo r2 values would increase and the oos predictions would have improved results however this study sought a localized scale as to identify problem areas an additional insight gathered from the increase in variability due to low complaints is that the promotion of crowd sourced platforms is important this study was limited by date range the 311 data is available from 2010 onwards and if the data had been collected earlier there would have been more complaints this research may have also been limited by low resident participation as the study indicates infrastructural complaints oftentimes are in relation with sf complaints increasing awareness to residents and visitors of nyc especially when there is forecasted precipitation would facilitate modeling endeavors it is essential to not just model the capacity and include the locations of the drainage network but the assessment of the performance capability or current conditions of the network needs presence thus encouraging residents to file reports when a sewer related issue occurs will be beneficial as shown the model experienced limitations due to the small scale in addition the model would benefit by increased resident participation future research could include a predictive model of which the findings of this inference model will lend insight into this future study could also include rainfall intensity as it is a key element in runoff furthermore as the data have been aggregated to weekly values a study utilizing a smaller range may have certain benefits similarly a sewershed aggregated or city aggregated analysis would enable the better incorporation of spatial covariates and provide insights about its spatial variability an example of such city aggregated model is presented in the appendix table a1 the results of the nbglm conducted for nyc in whole including topographical elements such as slope and elevation in addition to population cb bu and elevation were found to be statistically significant and the pseudo r2 was found to be 0 53 6 summary and conclusions with the advent of social media and smart phones crowd sourcing has become an effective tool for scientists to access data which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain this study has found insights regarding street flooding in nyc one of the largest metropolitan cities in the world moreover as the analysis was performed at the zip code level problem areas were identified allowing for tailored interventions while other papers have examined 311 street flooding reports this is the first of its kind to include the infrastructural components of sewer back ups catch basin complications and manhole overflows these factors were investigated as explanatory variables of the response street flooding reports the data which included radar precipitation estimates were modeled via lasso regression with the potentially significant predictors fed into a negative binomial generalized regression model where the resulting coefficients were analyzed allowing for the interpretation of each predictor s significance finally this paper conducted a geographical breakdown of total street flooding complaints highlighting areas with the highest frequencies major conclusions are drawn from this study first citizen reports are a valuable aid in detecting hydrological issues and offer first hand insight into problematic areas second the model illustrates that while precipitation amounts are the largest factor in street flooding back up and catch basin issues are also major contributors this is not a comprehensive predictive model however the pinpointed potential problem areas may give a starting point for agencies when installing sensors or close circuit television footage finally as infrastructural categories show significance there is a potential for street flooding to be controlled in nyc by governmental actions while there may not be actions to prevent the rainfall amounts improving the internal and external components of the drainage network will reduce some of the physical and economic impacts of street flooding in metropolitan areas 7

3710,street flooding is problematic in urban areas where impervious surfaces such as concrete brick and asphalt prevail impeding the infiltration of water into the ground during rain events water ponds and rise to levels that cause considerable economic damage and physical harm previous urban flood studies and models have evaluated the factors contributing to street flooding such as precipitation slope elevation and the drainage network yet due to the complexity of the interconnectedness of these factors and lack of available data difficulty remains in ascertaining the localized areas prone to and experiencing street flooding thus residents and city management of problem areas are unaware and unable to prepare for street flooding events this study presents an evaluation of new york city s 311 street flooding reports via an inference model as a way to detect the zip codes where street flooding is prevalent the potential explanatory variables for street flooding complaints were precipitation amounts and 311 sewer back up water arising from home drains as a result of rainfall manhole overflow water arising from manhole covers on the street and catch basin a clogged basin preventing rainwater from entering storm drains complaints using stage iv radar precipitation data and 311 sewer reports spanning a 10 year period a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression analysis with an embedded zero inflation model is used to detect the variables statistically significant as predictors of flood complaint counts specific to each zip code the model is also tested using an out of sample prediction scheme by training it with the detected explanatory variables precipitation was found to be a predictor in 81 of the zip codes for the infrastructural variables manhole overflow complaints were significant to street flood complaints in 21 of the zip codes back up complaints were significant in 41 of the zip codes and catch basin complaints were significant in 47 of the zip codes thus for an appreciable number of zip codes infrastructural complaints were found to be predictors of street flooding complaints this is the first study of its kind to investigate the infrastructural contributions of street flooding by 311 analysis thereby identifying factors of street flooding aside from precipitation leading contributions of the study include the demonstration of infrastructural impact towards the occurrence of street flooding and also the circumscription to the zip code and borough levels allowing for tailored preventative actions in critical areas keywords street flooding complaints rainfall infrastructure complaints urban hydrologic issues statistical learning new york city 311 complaints urban flooding street flooding negative binomial lasso catch basin issues extremes 1 introduction flooding events result in multiple fatalities and considerable property losses each year particularly within the urban environment the effects are pronounced urban watersheds lined with impervious surfaces such as concrete asphalt and stone have a limited amount of infiltration and recharge during heavy rainfall thus surface flow dominates the hydrological response serrano 2010 also as the drainage system becomes overwhelmed water overflows as runoff and pluvial flooding or what is commonly known as street flooding occurs furthermore as urban areas are densely populated the consequences of flooding are oftentimes more severe than those of coastal or tidal flooding events indeed for a given storm more economic damage and injuries have been shown to occur in urban areas as opposed to rural areas sharif yates roberts mueller 2006 for example the national weather service nws reported that in 2014 a single urban flooding event in detroit michigan resulted in 1 8 billion of direct damages representing 60 of the total flood damages for that year in the united states nws 2020a in addition in a study by the chicago s center for neighborhood technology cnt the economic costs of urban flooding for the densely populated area of cook county illinois totaled more than 773 million over a five year period cnt 2020 thus due to the unique physical and social characteristics of an urban area flooding has acute impact the modeling of street flooding has the potential to reduce the economic and social effects of severe storms in urban developments specifically the estimation and projection of flooded areas has great benefit as it allows for the implementation of early warnings which in turn provides people with the opportunity to take shelter and perform preventative measures in recent years urban models based on a variety of methodologies including cellular automata image processing and physically based systems have been introduced guidolin et al 2016 lo wu lin hsu 2015 generally these models include analyses of rainfall infiltration and the sewer system in urban flood simulations it is common to evaluate extended surcharge and other aspects of the drainage network by dual drainage modeling which incorporates the interaction between surface flow and the sewer flow of surcharged sewer systems djordjević prodanović maksimović 1999 distinctly extended surcharge occurs when water is held under pressure within a sewer system during a rain event thereby preventing the surface water to enter the drainage system or causing the water from the drainage system to escape to the surface schmitt thomas ettrich 2004 within the united states the most widely used flood forecasting model is the flash flood guidance of the nws which offers a deterministic physically based hydrologic model utilizing real time radar and satellite precipitation estimates ntelekos georgakakos krajewski 2006 world meteorological organization 2020 thus as shown there are various models and the ongoing research demonstrates the interest of emergency management to produce an effective model customized to the metropolitan area while the production of urban flood models particularly physically based models is in continuum nonetheless there are obstacles for instance the nws model may forecast floods yet it does not consider urban factors also the nws and other models incorporate rainfall however they do not include some infrastructural factors such as back up flooding moreover with the building of a flood forecasting model other hurdles including cost effectiveness and data availability present specifically in older metropolitan cities the design of the drainage system is oftentimes unavailable al suhili et al 2019 for instance zahura et al found that physics based models such as tuflow also suffered impairments by insufficient drainage data zahura et al 2020 in addition urban flood forecasting models including flash flood models have the distinct challenge with the validation of accuracy for example flash floods are often caused by severe storms occurring only within six hours of rainfall nws 2020b hence there is a difficulty in quantifying measurements in the brief timespan urban flood forecasting models at timescales longer than that of the flash floods also have limitations as they might not be benchmarked with real observations consequently there is a hinderance in the comparison of model results with the physical system therefore there is a need for a low cost empirical data driven analysis which would illuminate the exact urban areas flooded during a rain event in addition to providing insight into the specific sewer infrastructure issues within those areas accounts by persons directly experiencing street flooding may resolve some of the issues and provide clarity into the occurrence extent and driving mechanisms of street flooding particular to an urban place in new york city nyc there is a platform referred to as 311 where residents business owners and visitors are able to file issue reports to the nyc government via phone website or social media minkoff 2016 for instance an observer who notices street flooding may enter the nyc 311 website and input the description nature address and date and time of the occurrence these filings by new yorkers are invaluable as the 311 complaints via catch basin manhole and sewer back up reports offer infrastructural insight into the response of nyc sewer system of which available drainage data is insufficient moreover street flooding reports may serve an additional benefit as time date and exact location of a complaint is listed the 311 street flooding complaints may serve as tool for urban flooding model validation as a model s prediction of flooding in an area may be supported by an analysis of the local reports thus the data provided by 311 is a way to understand the causes and effects of street flooding this study presents an inference model which highlights the key climate and infrastructural variables that govern street floods in nyc of nyc the 311 complaints are aggregated over seven days weekly time scale and to the zip code level street flooding reports are taken as the response variable whereas precipitation amounts sewer back up manhole overflow and catch basin reports serve as predictors or explanatory variables utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso regression analysis tibshirani 1996 with an embedded zero inflation zi model per zip code the variables effecting street flooding complaints are selected by identifying the climate and infrastructural issues areas prone to street flooding and their particular vulnerabilities are revealed thereby providing direction and clarity for city management and forecasters furthermore such an analysis complements the physical modeling endeavors and provides tools of validation there have been a few studies of which crowd sourcing was applied in flood analyses in one such paper sadler et al flood severity had been analyzed and the data reported by residents and individual observers was utilized to provide an inference model as sadler et al delved extensively into environmental factors such as water table level and rainfall intensity sadler et al 2018 this study differs by reviewing infrastructural factors such as issues involving the drainage network and external catch basins additionally there have also been flood analyses which have specifically used the nyc 311 format for instance kelleher and mcphillips employed nyc 311 complaints to explore the relationships between topographic indices and pluvial flooding kelleher mcphillips 2020 while the study highlights the value of citizen reports as a validation tool it however does not analyze 311 street flood complaints in regards to climatic or drainage sources in another study by smith and rodriguez street flooding complaints were used to investigate topographic issues in addition to serving as a validation method for a proposed rainfall dataset smith rodriguez 2017 yet as only street flooding and highway flooding complaints were compiled the infrastructural related 311 complaints were not assessed in contrast to previous research this study is unique in its evaluation of sewer related issues and their effect on street flooding the paper is outlined in the following manner in section 2 the study area and data processing are described relative information on nyc is set forth with a focus on the climatic and topographic elements population density borough and sewershed delineations and drainage networks next the data collection of the 311 complaints and radar precipitation is discussed along with the tools and methods involved with the pre processing section 3 offers the methodology of the analysis there is an evaluation of the quantity and frequency of complaints at the zip code and borough levels in the methodology section the lasso zi is introduced as well along with the negative binomial generalized linear regression model nbglm zi where the prior identifies the infrastructural and climatic predictors which feeds into the latter for out of sample oos predictions in section 4 the results of the model are presented including the mapping and tabulations of coefficients variability and error determinations and their implications are discussed and interpreted finally in section 6 summary and major conclusions are presented 2 study area and data 2 1 study area nyc is located in the northeastern united states at the coast of the atlantic ocean it is markedly impervious and populous which makes it an ideal study area for urban flooding spanning only 800 square kilometers nyc has the highest population of any u s city and it also has the greatest density united states census bureau 2012 moreover dissimilar to other u s cities nyc is comprised of five boroughs each representing a separate county queens brooklyn manhattan bronx and staten island of the boroughs queens and brooklyn have the highest populations at approximately 2 200 000 and 2 500 000 people respectively manhattan with approximately 1 500 000 residents has the highest population density bronx has approximately 1 300 000 residents and staten island is the least populous at 470 000 residents united states census bureau 2020 in regards to ground topography approximately 72 of the land area of nyc is covered with impervious surfaces city of new york 2020a a map of percentage impervious surfaces is shown in fig 1 a concerning the climate of nyc the classification is humid subtropical nws 2020c according to köppen geiger climate subdivisions the mean daily temperature is 13 c and the yearly rainfall in nyc is roughly 1270 mm nws 2020d annually the mean number of days with precipitation of 0 254 mm or higher is 120 days national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2020 and the mean number of days with precipitation of 25 4 mm or higher is 13 14 days state of new york 2020 in new york and areas of the northeast annual precipitation is uniformly distributed petersen devineni sankarasubramanian 2012 according to the new york state climate hazards profile nyc has experienced between 90 and 102 severe storms between the years 1960 through 2014 and the subsequent costs ranged between 4 to 17 million state of new york 2020 in addition due to climate change it is projected that precipitation extremes are expected to increase in the future gonzález et al 2019 with respect to infrastructure the catch basins of nyc connect the storm water to the underground sewer system a map of the number of catch basins per square kilometer is shown in fig 1b of the sewer connections there are two types of drainage systems in nyc combined sewer system and separate storm sewer system the separate storm sewer system uses separate pipes one pipe to carry wastewater to the wastewater plant and a different pipe to carry stormwater to the waterways city of new york 2020b most of nyc is comprised of the combined sewer system which uses a single pipe to transport both wastewater and stormwater to a wastewater treatment plant city of new york 2020b servicing drainage areas ranging from 13 to 102 square kilometers there are fourteen wastewater treatment plants which are also known as sewersheds city of new york 2020c in addition for the combined sewer system when there is heavy rainfall and capacity is exceeded overflows occur and a portion of the water discharges to a combined sewer outfall and enters a waterway state of new york 2020 2 2 nyc 311 platform the nyc 311 sewer complaints data may be accessed via the nyc open data website data cityofnewyork us where data is available from january 1 2010 onwards the complaints are geocoded with the latitude and longitude of the location from where the complainant had stated the issue had taken place the date and time the complaints are also recorded through 311 a person may file a complaint and categorize sewer complaint as follows street flooding sf to report flooding or ponding on a street sewer back up bu to report during heavy rainfall or flooding water arising from a toilet sink drain or bathtub drain manhole overflow mo to report a manhole overflowing with water or sewage or catch basin cb to report a clogged or damaged catch basin for sewer back ups it shows a relationship between the private drains and the public sewer system as back up flooding occurs when either the height of the water in the public pipes are greater than that of the gravity inlets inside the private property or when the inlet level of the storm drains are below the water level of the sewer schmitt thomas ettrich 2004 regarding manhole issues the overflowing of a manhole signifies surcharge as water from the sewer system has travelled to the surface thus mo complaints may be indicative of infrastructural issues lastly as catch basins are the grates allowing for the collection of storm water cb reports provide useful knowledge to street flooding behavior if catch basins are blocked or malformed in certain areas surface water level increases and this may be indicative of city maintenance problems 2 3 radar data the national center for atmospheric research ncar earth observing laboratory eol website offers ncep emc 4km gridded data grib stage iv datasets where hourly 6 hour 12 hour 24 hour totals of millimeter precipitation amounts are available from years 2001 through 2020 as the stage iv data is unable to adjust for severe snow events the data in the northeastern united states include only rainfall data hamidi et al 2017 from the eol website 24 hour radar precipitation data from years 2010 through 2019 were ordered the thiessen polygon method viessman lewis 2003 was employed with each radar point as center to aggregate the gridded radar precipitation data available at the 4 km by 4 km resolution to the zip code resolution with the use of the thiessen polygon method of arc gis pro a weighted average of radar points within a zip code boundary was calculated then the rainfall amount per zip code was determined using this weighted average the data was finally aggregated to the weekly time scale i e total precipitation in millimeters per week prcp 2 4 data collection processing and preliminary analysis sewer complaints data using 311 reports from january 1 2010 through december 2019 were downloaded from the nyc open data government website the data was geo aggregated to the zip code level and only the issues relating to street flooding were extracted in addition to account for possible lags in the occurrence of an event and the report of the issue weekly sums of each complaint were calculated a reason for lags is that a person may take time to report an issue this may be especially true in urban areas where warm season rainstorms producing short duration heavy rainfall oftentimes take place in the evenings gonzález et al 2019 also there may be lags between the rain event and the occurrence of street flooding such as for instance when the drainage system becomes more overwhelmed with debris as time passes since the exact detection of the lag that measures the difference between the time of the event s and the time of the complaint s may be arduous for simplicity a weekly timescale sunday to saturday was decided as the unit of temporal aggregation for all the variables it is assumed that a week is not far removed to have lost the influence of precipitation resulting in street flooding complaints the same is true for infrastructure complaints where the infrastructure complaints within a week are assumed the possible antecedents of the street flooding complaints that week another measure taken was to ensure that the same complainant was not reporting a specific location repeatedly by the mechanism of the 311 website a complainant may report the same location more than once in a day to see whether a location was reported more than once in a day the sf mo bu and cb complaints over the ten year period were processed for their uniqueness the 311 data lists each complaint as a row containing latitude and longitude location coordinates only the unique location coordinates were retained in this study of the raw 311 data from january 1 2010 through december 31 2019 there were 25 574 sf 6 042 mo 137 974 bu and 85 607 cb total collective reports and it was determined that 25 378 99 2 5 687 94 1 128 751 93 3 and 82 191 96 0 were unique respectively zip code borough and catch basin shapefiles were downloaded from nyc open data and processed via arcgis pro after all data was processed 174 zip codes 530 weeks of precipitation totals and 311 sf bu cb mo complaint totals over the ten year period from january 1 2010 through december 31 2019 were used for analysis before the development of the model a complaint frequency analysis was conducted per zip code the number of sf complaints over 10 years were computed and examined fig 2 the median of total complaints per zip code was 87 with 1300 being the max and zero being the minimum the histogram fig 2a shows that the majority of zip codes reported under 200 complaints during the 10 year period 136 zip codes 78 to illustrate the zip codes most frequently reporting sf complaints the average of the total complaint for all zip codes were taken average total complaints 139 and the zip codes with a total complaint value greater than the average of 139 complaints were identified fig 2b presents a map of the total complaints per zip code where the zip codes that have total complaints greater than the average total complaints are highlighted the illustration shows staten island lower brooklyn and queens as having the highest frequencies of sf reports per borough the number of complaints per 10 000 people are 98 4 44 5 24 6 15 8 and 13 3 for staten island queens brooklyn manhattan and bronx respectively 3 methodology the nyc department of environmental protection identifies increased precipitation blocked catch basin grates and surcharged sewers leading to sewer back ups as major causes of flooding in nyc city of new york 2020d with a yearly average precipitation of 1270 mm nyc experiences significant precipitation through the year with little intra annual variations however there is a considerable spatial variation within nyc hamidi et al 2017 which may result in localized street flooding blocked catch basin grates may also lead to street flooding intense storms may push leaves and litter onto catch basins where they could mold into mats and obstruct the basins blocked catch basins prevent rainwater from entering the storm sewer thereby causing street flooding frequently during intense rainfall events the combined volume of stormwater and wastewater exceeds the sewer system s capacity under such circumstances the excess stormwater remains in the streets leading to flooding the hypothesis of this study is that the climatic and infrastructural issues are statistically significant predictors of the response 311 sf complaints precipitation the climatic feature is the primary cause of flooding in addition sewer surcharge as indicated by back up and manhole overflow issues or the blockage of stormwater drains by catch basins also contribute to street flooding for variable identification a lasso zi which imposes a penalty function cancelling out the coefficients of less important variables was implemented the lasso method shares the usual model assumptions concerning the nature of the relationship between response variable and the explanatory variables but adds an important l1 constraint to the regression coefficients in least squares optimization the result is the inevitable shrinkage of certain coefficients to zero allowing the lasso technique to enjoy advantageous properties of ridge regression and best subset selection tibshirani 1996 hastie tibshirani and friedman 2001 then a zi generalized linear modeling framework was used to perform oos predictions using an eight two year training and testing data set as to show the variability in the sf complaints using prcp cb complaints bu complaints and mo complaints since the sf complaints data is discrete and since the counts per week are being measured a negative binomial model was employed as the link function the negative binomial model is a generalization of the poisson regression models that accounts for overdispersion lawless 1987 for variable selection the multicollinearity adjusted adaptive lasso for zero inflated count regression amazonn package in r was used the algorithm allows for the implementation of lasso with a zi nbglm element mallick 2018 by shrinking the coefficients of the predictors or tuning the coefficients to zero lasso creates a subset of the predictors that have the most effect on the response allowing for more interpretable results and higher prediction accuracy tibshirani 1996 and zi models accommodate excess zeroes of which the nbglm cannot by providing a two component model a point mass at zero and a poisson geometric or negative binomial zeileis kleiber jackman 2008 as the 311 count data is discrete and there are many weeks with zero complaints the lasso with a zi nbglm was appropriate the nbglm part of the model with y as the response variable with the four predictors for each zip code i is shown here 1 y it n b p it r i where 2 p it r i r i λ it λ it e β i 0 β i 1 precip it β i 2 cb it β i 3 bu it β i 4 mo it 3 equation 1 shows that the weekly aggregated street flooding complaints in each zip code y it is modeled as a negative binomial distribution with a success parameter p it and an overdispersion parameter r i the success parameter p it relates to the rate of occurrence λ it equation 2 which is informed by a regression on the precipitation precip it and infrastructure covariates cb it bu it mo it equation 3 β i 0 is the regression intercept for zip code i and β i 1 β i 2 β i 3 β i 4 are the regression slopes representing the sensitivity of the street flooding complaints to precipitation precip it catch basin complaints cb it sewer back up complaints bu it and manhole overflow complaints mo it respectively these model parameters are estimated using a maximum likelihood approach in r version 4 0 4 friedman et al 2010 the explained variance pseudo r2 of the nbglm which is estimated as 1 l 0 l β 2 n where l 0 l β is the ratio of the likelihood of the null model to the fitted model and n is the sample size demonstrates the extent to which the model explains the variability in the response cox and snell 1989 as the 311 complaint data was discrete the fit index for a redefined pseudo r2 proposed by nagelkerke nagelkerke 1991 was utilized this redefined measure normalizes the model pseudo r2 to the maximum possible achievable using the likelihood ratio estimate for the oos predictions eight years were used as training data and two years as testing data using a k fold cross validation technique the training data consisted of eight years of the sf bu cb mo and prcp weekly data with the remaining two years serving as the testing set the years were randomly shuffled such that the training set may consist of a different eight grouping of years between 2010 through 2019 and a subsequent different two year grouping of the testing set using the lasso selected variables the model is trained by the influence of the predictors towards the outcome sf during the eight not necessarily consecutive years predictions of sf based on the observed predictors for the two years are then conducted using the trained nbglm zi model for the nine zip codes where lasso did not select a significant predictor a standard nbglm is utilized without lasso selection to obtain predicted values the predicted sf values are then compared to the actual sf values for each random selection of training and testing sets simulations were run 100 times and the mean arctangent absolute percentage error maape values were determined per zip code maape accommodates data with zero values by the application of slope as an angle as opposed to slope as a ratio kim and kim 2016 maape 1 106 t 1 106 a r c t a n o t p t o t f o r t 1 2 106 4 o represents the observed sf weekly complaints for the two year period 106 weeks and p represents the predicted sf values by the equation it is seen that a closer value between the observed and predicted would result in a value closer to zero and a larger difference between the observed and predicted would result in a value converging to π 2 radians in summary the modeling framework has the following steps 1 for each zip code statistically significant predictors are identified by the use of the multicollinearity adjusted adaptive lasso implemented with the zi nbglm 2 the statistically significant predictors by zip code are reported as the most important features for understanding street floods in that zip code 3 a zi nbglm is trained using the lasso inferred variables for each zip code and the model s efficacy is tested using oos predictions against the held out data this final step provides additional robustness to the model and its selection 4 results and discussion 4 1 the circumstance of nyc street flooding by citizen imported data this study first maps the locations where street flooding is often reported when examining the total sf reports over the 10 year period the presence of flooding is highest in staten island lower brooklyn and various zip codes in queens the complaints are localized to the zip code level to allow for a tailored insight into the areas where street flooding occurs the most as this would be necessary for flood forecasting at the neighborhood or street level as each borough represents a separate county within nyc this study included a localization to the borough level as well in addition an examination of the reports at the broader borough level is also beneficial to stakeholders and policy makers as borough boards are able to create bylaws and plans in this consideration staten island and queens are of special interest per 10 000 residents staten island has the most complaints which is roughly double the complaints of queens the second highest frequency borough likewise queens has almost twice the complaints of brooklyn which follows in third moreover as a 311 complaint by its nature is citizen reported street flooding is not only occurring but is also adversely felt by the residents especially those in staten island and queens 4 2 response to predictors and their significance the regression analysis provides a selection of predictors and the degree of their influence in fig 3 the zip code level significant explanatory variables were based on the inference of the regression coefficients β i 1 β i 2 β i 3 β i 4 the strength of the association e β i 1 for infrastructure and precipitation covariates are expressed as percentage change in the expected weekly counts per unit change in the explanatory variable and it is shown in the graduated color scheme the zip codes designated in white did not have the variable selected as predictor by lasso the intercept from the model β i 0 for each zip code is also shown in fig 3e plotted as e β i 0 as expected there is similarity to the frequency map as the intercept exhibits an upward shift with more complaints thus insight into the behavior of the predictors is gained by the regression coefficients the spatial variability of the predictors is also observed there was a total of 165 zip codes of the 174 zip codes in the study where at least one predictor was selected by lasso prcp was selected in 141 zip codes of which 55 12 28 20 and 26 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively bu was selected in 72 zip codes of which 29 6 17 9 and 11 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively cb was selected in 82 zip codes of which 25 9 20 8 and 20 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively mo was selected in 37 zip codes of which 17 2 4 5 and 9 zip codes were located in queens staten island brooklyn bronx and manhattan respectively of the variables prcp was an explanatory variable in the most zip codes followed by cb bu is the third most represented explanatory variable lastly mo is shown as an explanatory variable in the least amount of zip codes thus while climatic and infrastructural variability have high selection there are also notable differences among zip codes to further examine the spatial variability of the boroughs each selected predictor s breakdown by borough is determined in table 1 for each predictor where significance is found the percent of zip codes in each borough is shown in addition table 1 shows the ratio of the mean exponent of the β of each selected predictor of borough to the mean exponent of the β for nyc as total bt ratio a measure to understand the expected sensitivity of a borough relative to the expected sensitivity of nyc for each of the explanatory variables a bt ratio greater than 1 signifies that the borough experiences a stronger reaction greater increase in sf complaints when the lasso selected predictor either cb bu mo or prcp experiences an increase in complaints or in the case of prcp amounts than that of nyc on average a ratio lower than 1 signifies that the borough experiences a weaker reaction by the table the selected predictor and strength of association is shown at the borough level and compared to the overall findings of nyc plausibly sf complaints may not be a comprehensive portrayal of the occurrence of street flooding in nyc as certain zip codes or boroughs may have residents with greater proclivities towards addressing concerns yet the selection of the predictor prcp in 82 of the zip codes table 1 demonstrate that in the majority of nyc zip codes the sf reports are consistent with and heavily affected by rain events in addition the lasso selection of the other predictors as affecting sf reports further strengthens the validity of the 311 platform as an accurate portrayal rainfall occurrence and effects if reports were being made haphazardly a connection between an infrastructural element and street flooding would not be found by lasso therefore while there may be additional factors affecting residents complaints there is sufficient accuracy in the 311 complaint filings as the connection between the predictors and sf reporting found by the model further validify the platform 4 3 analysis of model parameters an analysis of model parameters also provide insight into the different occurrences among boroughs when looking at the analysis it shows that although there are areas with a high frequency of sf reports these areas do not necessarily have the greatest rate of sf report increase when its predictor experiences an increase this lack of sharp increases in sf compared to the increases in the lasso selected variables cb bu mo or p coupled with a high frequency of complaints indicating active engagement on the 311 platform may signal a chronic problem in those areas of which the residents appear to experience street flooding during moderate conditions due to low beta values and subsequently file more complaints indeed this is evident especially in staten island examining fig 2b 10 of 12 staten island zip codes have a high frequency of reports yet when looking at the infrastructural variables of significance in fig 3 b d none of the zip codes have beta percentages in the highest quantile table 1 thus while bu and cb specifically show significance in 50 and 75 of the staten island zip codes respectively an increase in those complaints do not trigger the greatest increase in sf as compared to zip codes in other boroughs interestingly one such borough is manhattan manhattan has only two zip codes with total complaints slightly greater than the average total complaints for nyc in total when looking at fig 2b yet for instance in fig 3c and table 1 manhattan has cb as predictor in 48 of the zip codes where at least eight zip codes are ranked in the highest quantile group based on sensitivity it may be inferred that the residents are not reporting 311 complaints specifically sf reports as shown in the frequency analysis excessively in manhattan however when there is a cb report sf reports are strongly influenced this is apparent for bu in manhattan as well and in bronx cb and mo with high bt ratios table 1 respectively also behave in a similar manner to manhattan finally it can be seen that zip codes have different sensitivities as shown in the fig 3 maps this also supports the notion that zip codes suffer from varying infrastructural issues at varying extents when a predictor is selected the parameter analysis provides information regarding the severity of the effect and at this study s localized level an average area of 2 75 square kilometers per zip code problem areas are pinpointed 4 4 variable importance 4 4 1 catch basin cb catch basin infrastructural issues are of noteworthiness since they directly lead to street flooding if they are not working properly catch basins are also an external component of the drainage network therefore the public has direct access to the basins and are able to assist or damage them consequently an outreach effort by nyc to the residents may be of help one such partnership exists in newark nj where there is a program called adopt a catch basin city of newark 2021 the program offers residents the opportunity to use an arcgis solutions mapping platform to select a catch basin to adopt they care for the basin cleaning and removing debris then they are also encouraged to paint and decorate the basin city of newark 2021 in this study cb was selected as a predictor in almost half of the nyc zip codes in total while similar to the frequency trend staten island had the highest percentage of zip codes at 75 where cb was selected as a predictor queens and brooklyn followed at 42 and 54 respectively finally there were also many zip codes in manhattan where cb was selected as a predictor 48 despite manhattan having a low number of total complaints furthermore in manhattan the difference between zip codes with prcp selected as a predictor 60 to the number with cb selected 48 was smallest of the boroughs it is possible to infer that the contrast of model results from one borough such as manhattan to the others highlights specific issues within the zones when looking at the map of impervious surface percentage fig 1a it is seen that manhattan has the highest percentage of impervious surfaces thus a possible theory for cb in manhattan having a high bt ratio and selection percentage is that the storm runoff may be carrying trash into the stormwater drains thereby clogging the catch basins specifically manhattan has more active construction sites than any other borough city of new york 2020 and waste from sites are a contributing factor to runoff debris in urban areas environmental protection agency 2003 overall for an infrastructural category cb complaints were selected as predictors in a large number of zip codes this is an impactful finding as it indicates that oftentimes when one person observes and reports a street flooding event there is another person observing and reporting water ponding from a clogged catch basin within that time period 4 4 2 sewer back ups bu and manhole overflows mo concerning bu when looking at fig 3b there appears to be a noticeable shift inland when comparing the areas to those of cb selected predictor as shown in fig 3c for bronx the results were similar to the other boroughs in regards to bu selection whereas for cb the bronx had a much lower number of zip codes showing significance also manhattan appears to have the lowest bu issues aside from location bu performed similarly to cb with 41 of zip codes having the variable selected as a predictor for zip codes experiencing explanatory power from a combined prcp with bu or mo issues it signifies a chaotic condition where it is not only raining and the streets are flooded but internal drains are being overwhelmed and working in reverse order an internal drainage issue may not be as easily remedied as with catch basins where maintenance and public awareness may have a positive effect however areas shown on the maps where bu and mo issues are signified should be investigated monitored or modeled as it may facilitate long term planning improvements it has been theorized that a difference between the topographic wetness index concerning flood reports of staten island and manhattan is due to the type of construction of the combined sewer overflow system in manhattan compared to that of the separate sewer system in staten island kelleher mcphillips 2020 however with the inclusion of all boroughs the results in this paper show that the zip codes in brooklyn which are mostly comprised of the combined sewer system have back up issues as a predictor of street flooding in 46 of its zip codes when reviewing the open sewer atlas data open sewer atlas nyc 2021 a web resource directed from the nyc open data website city of new york 2020e 80 of the zip codes in this study are within the combined sewer system when reviewing the results of this study 81 of the zip codes with bu as a selector are located in a combined sewer system thus there appears to be no difference in nyc between the combined sewer system and separate sewer system in regards to sf reporting finally concerning manhole overflow complaints there is significance in few zip codes as these areas are variously located throughout nyc there is indication that the sewer issues are area specific localized to the manhole level the mapping of these particular zip codes would be of aid to city management in the investigation of issues within the internal drainage network 4 4 3 precipitation prcp as expected prcp is the primary driver of street flooding prcp is shown as an explanatory variable in 81 of the zip codes regarding the beta results street flooding reports respond greatest to changes in precipitation in staten island and brooklyn however many zip codes in queens and bronx also exhibit strong increases to street flooding complaints due to increases in precipitation amounts fig 3a highlights the zip codes prone to dramatic increases in street flooding as thus particularly in those areas precautions may necessary to take in the advent of a forecasted severe rain event our future modeling will include rainfall intensity in addition to duration as they are key elements in flash flooding nws 2020e 4 5 explained variability pseudo r2 and maape determinations were used for an understanding of variability to illustrate the dependence of explained variability on the number of complaints pseudo r2 values were mapped against total complaints in fig 4 in addition the pseudo r2 values are depicted in table 2 and mapped in fig 5 to show an aspect of variability as an additional measure of variability maape values determined from the observed and predicted values by the oos predictions are illustrated in fig 6 5 model limitations there were factors which appeared to affect the pseudo r2 and maape values the mean pseudo r2 determined by the nbglm was 0 14 boroughs such as staten island brooklyn and queens had pseudo r2 values greater than the mean at 0 22 0 16 and 0 15 respectively table 2 as fig 4 highlights pseudo r2 values trend greater when there are a higher number of sf complaints similarly it is seen that lower maape values lower errors as shown in fig 6 occur in the zip codes with greater total of sf complaints thus if the model were to be constructed on a larger grid scale or if there was more data on the street flooding complaints the pseudo r2 values would increase and the oos predictions would have improved results however this study sought a localized scale as to identify problem areas an additional insight gathered from the increase in variability due to low complaints is that the promotion of crowd sourced platforms is important this study was limited by date range the 311 data is available from 2010 onwards and if the data had been collected earlier there would have been more complaints this research may have also been limited by low resident participation as the study indicates infrastructural complaints oftentimes are in relation with sf complaints increasing awareness to residents and visitors of nyc especially when there is forecasted precipitation would facilitate modeling endeavors it is essential to not just model the capacity and include the locations of the drainage network but the assessment of the performance capability or current conditions of the network needs presence thus encouraging residents to file reports when a sewer related issue occurs will be beneficial as shown the model experienced limitations due to the small scale in addition the model would benefit by increased resident participation future research could include a predictive model of which the findings of this inference model will lend insight into this future study could also include rainfall intensity as it is a key element in runoff furthermore as the data have been aggregated to weekly values a study utilizing a smaller range may have certain benefits similarly a sewershed aggregated or city aggregated analysis would enable the better incorporation of spatial covariates and provide insights about its spatial variability an example of such city aggregated model is presented in the appendix table a1 the results of the nbglm conducted for nyc in whole including topographical elements such as slope and elevation in addition to population cb bu and elevation were found to be statistically significant and the pseudo r2 was found to be 0 53 6 summary and conclusions with the advent of social media and smart phones crowd sourcing has become an effective tool for scientists to access data which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain this study has found insights regarding street flooding in nyc one of the largest metropolitan cities in the world moreover as the analysis was performed at the zip code level problem areas were identified allowing for tailored interventions while other papers have examined 311 street flooding reports this is the first of its kind to include the infrastructural components of sewer back ups catch basin complications and manhole overflows these factors were investigated as explanatory variables of the response street flooding reports the data which included radar precipitation estimates were modeled via lasso regression with the potentially significant predictors fed into a negative binomial generalized regression model where the resulting coefficients were analyzed allowing for the interpretation of each predictor s significance finally this paper conducted a geographical breakdown of total street flooding complaints highlighting areas with the highest frequencies major conclusions are drawn from this study first citizen reports are a valuable aid in detecting hydrological issues and offer first hand insight into problematic areas second the model illustrates that while precipitation amounts are the largest factor in street flooding back up and catch basin issues are also major contributors this is not a comprehensive predictive model however the pinpointed potential problem areas may give a starting point for agencies when installing sensors or close circuit television footage finally as infrastructural categories show significance there is a potential for street flooding to be controlled in nyc by governmental actions while there may not be actions to prevent the rainfall amounts improving the internal and external components of the drainage network will reduce some of the physical and economic impacts of street flooding in metropolitan areas 7

3711,stream temperature is a significant indicator for biodiversity and ecosystem health of stream ecosystem the impacts of glacier melt processes on stream temperature such as the cooling effect have not been explicitly considered in process based models which limit model capability in simulating stream temperature in glacierized cold regions we coupled a temperature index based glacier melt model with the swat equilibrium temperature model to overcome this limitation the coupled model was tested and applied in the upper athabasca river basin in western canada to simulate daily streamflow and stream temperature it showed a good performance for stream temperature simulation with percent bias pbias less than 5 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 values greater than 0 85 the impact of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation was investigated by turning the melt model on and off the results illustrate that the coupled model accurately reproduces the impacts of glacier melt by simulating higher streamflow and lower stream temperature during the melt season in particular the progressive reduction in the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature from headwater to downstream was well represented finally the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature under climate change was assessed by the scenario simulations this analysis revealed that an increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would alleviate the average and peak stream temperature increase during the melt season while a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would ultimately aggravate the stream temperature increase therefore the impact of glacier melt runoff should be explicitly considered in process based models to accurately model stream temperature and predict future climate change impact on the thermal regime in the glacierized watersheds the model coupling framework developed in this study could be a useful tool for simulating stream temperature in glacierized watersheds keywords equilibrium temperature model coupling swat model thermal regime 1 introduction stream temperature is a fundamental physical property of the stream ecosystem and a key indicator of overall ecosystem health caissie 2006 webb et al 2008 it affects water density conductivity ph saturated dissolved oxygen concentration and biochemical reaction rates zhu et al 2019 it plays an important ecological role in controlling the life and habitat of aquatic species eaton et al 1995 mohseni et al 1998 especially fishes a fish species has a preferred water temperature range with a maximum tolerance temperature any change of stream temperature regime would impact the life cycle and habitat of fish species kwak et al 2017 du et al 2019 stream temperature is a collective effect of controlling factors related to meteorological conditions watershed characteristics and hydrological processes ficklin et al 2012 especially air temperature is one of the important factors for stream temperature and temperatures of other water bodies alizadeh et al 2018 since it impacts the heat transport process between water surface and atmosphere the stream temperature regimes have been and will continue to be changed by anthropogenic activities including land use and climate change which alter the meteorological and hydrological conditions du et al 2018 therefore it is vital to model stream temperature to project the changes in stream temperature regimes under varying hydrological meteorological and climate conditions glacier melt runoff has important control on stream temperature regime in cold region watersheds because it has a moderating impact on stream temperature in summer when the glacier melt runoff elevates with the rising air temperature moore 2006 also any change in glacier melt runoff would result in a change in streamflow and thus the heat capacity milner et al 2017 since there is an inverse relationship between streamflow and stream temperature reflecting a positive relationship between thermal capacity and streamflow volume webb et al 2003 van vliet et al 2013 in other words when streamflow increases stream temperature decreases because of an increase in thermal capacity some studies investigated the impact of glaciers on stream temperature in different cold region watersheds based on the measurements of stream temperature in different parts of the watersheds and the cooling effects of the glacier melt on stream temperature during the summer melt season were found blaen et al 2013 cadbury et al 2008 williamson et al 2019 for example uehlinger et al 2003 investigated the thermal dynamics of roseg river in swaziland based on temperature records of 23 sites from june 1997 to may 1998 and found that stream temperatures rapidly increased in the spring followed by a moderate decrease in summer due to the seasonal glacier melt runoff contribution fellman et al 2014 used continuous stream temperature measurements water isotope samples and multiple linear regression models to investigate the glacier coverage impacts on stream temperature in coastal watersheds of southeast alaska and they found that the cooling effect in the summer is equivalent to a decline of 1 1 c for each 10 increase in glacier coverage similarly gao et al 2017 investigated stream temperature dynamics in nam co basin southern tibetan plateau china using stream temperature observations glacier mass balance observations and the linear regression models and found that mean stream temperatures of glacier fed streams were much lower than those of non glacier rivers and that when glacier melt runoff contributed more than 50 of streamflow glaciers played a significant role on the stream temperature process based and statistical models are two major types of models for stream temperature predictions du et al 2018 a process based model is usually based on energy balance while a statistical model employs regression techniques between stream temperature and meteorological variables previous studies have shown that hydrological processes and runoff composition have substantial impacts on stream temperature regime and thus the impacts from the hydrological processes need to be included in the process based models for simulating stream temperature du et al 2020a ficklin et al 2012 morales marín et al 2019b in particular in glacierized catchments glacier melt runoff and its impacts on stream temperature should be included in the process based models to more accurately simulate fluctuating seasonal stream temperatures several past studies have successfully integrated glacier melt and runoff processes with watershed hydrological modeling for streamflow simulation in the cold region watersheds chen et al 2017 shrestha et al 2015 for example konz and seibert 2010 incorporated glacier ice melt and accumulation processes based on degree day factor into the hbv hydrologiskabyrånsvattenavdelning hydrological model they demonstrated that the uncertainties of streamflow simulations were considerably reduced after combining glacier mass balance and discharge observations compared to using only discharge data for model calibrations in the manas river basin in northwest china luo et al 2013 incorporated an algorithm for glacier melt and mass balance into the soil and water assessment tool swat model based on a dynamic hydrological response unit hru approach and the enhanced model showed good simulation performance for daily streamflow and water balance zhao et al 2015 integrated a degree day glacier melt algorithm into the variable infiltration capacity vic model and good performance for monthly flow simulation in the kunma like river catchment was also obtained by the extended vic model in addition scenario analyses suggest that reductions in glacier area would result in less glacier melt runoff in summer and river runoff would decline accordingly while a wide range of empirical and model based studies have been developed to assess the dynamics of glacier melt mass balance and runoff the impacts of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature have not been explicitly considered in the process based hydrological models to the best of our knowledge this gap in the literature limits the ability of existing models to accurately predict stream temperatures in glacierized regions previously we developed a stream temperature model based on the widely used swat model by incorporating an equilibrium temperature approach du et al 2018 the swat equilibrium temperature model swat etm considers the impacts of key hydrological processes including surface runoff snowmelt runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow as well as water depth dynamics collectively these processes reflect the impacts of runoff composition and streamflow volume on stream temperature du et al 2020a the swat etm has been successfully calibrated and validated in three different watersheds in the cold region of north america and can simulate the cooling effect of snowmelt runoff on stream temperature du et al 2019 du et al 2020a however the impact of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature has not yet been incorporated in the swat etm mountain glaciers are important and sensitive indicators of climate change and they are a significant source of water for downstream users on different time scales hagg et al 2013 in the 20th century mean annual air temperature has risen significantly which resulted in accelerated mountain glacier retreat around the world azam et al 2018 bolch 2007 clarke et al 2015 zemp et al 2019 in the future glacier retreats will likely continue to accelerate as air temperatures rise due to climate change glacier melts and retreats substantially influence hydrological regimes and water quality e g increasing sediment loads in glacier fed watersheds they also result in geomorphic hazards including outburst floods and debris flows moore et al 2009 li et al 2018 hydrological models have predicted that glacial retreat under climate change would result in an initial increase in streamflow in near future due to atmospheric warming and a faster melt rate but it would be followed by a decrease in streamflow as the glacier sources diminish in the distant future bliss et al 2014 fellman et al 2014 for example huss et al 2008 predicted future runoff in three highly glacierized alpine watersheds using a glacio hydrological model with a temperature index melt and accumulation module showing an initial increase in annual runoff followed by an overall reduction below current levels in addition to increased melt glacier retreat was also predicted by all climate scenarios with glacier area shrinking significantly gan et al 2015 predicted the impacts of climate change on the glacier dynamics and runoff generation in the naryn river basin in central asia using a glacier enhanced swat hydrological model the results showed that the glacier area would shrink in the future mainly caused by the changes in air temperature and glacier melt runoff will first increase and then decrease after reaching its peak in 2040 in sum the impacts of climate change on glacier melt runoff and the effects of glacier melt changes on flow regimes in the cold region watershed have been studied based on different hydrological and glacier melt models however the impacts of glacier melt changes on stream temperature regimes resulting from future climate change have not yet been thoroughly investigated in the future stream temperatures in mountainous and cold regions will likely increase due to rising air temperatures and more intense heat transfers between the water and atmosphere holsinger et al 2014 punzet et al 2012 tung et al 2006 the objectives of this study are threefold firstly we aim to explicitly account for the impact of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature by coupling a glacier melt runoff model with the swat etm model secondly we use the coupled model to predict daily stream temperature in the upper athabasca river basin a large glacier fed catchment in western canada to understand and investigate the impact of glacier melt runoff on the thermal regimes of the upstream and downstream regions finally the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature in a changing climate is investigated using scenario analysis based on the calibrated coupled model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the athabasca river basin arb originates from the columbia icefield in jasper national park and travels about 1300 km northeast across alberta before flowing into lake athabasca in western canada this study focuses on the upper arb above the hinton hydrometric station fig 1 with an area of about 9760 km2 the elevation ranges from 960 m to 3645 m with a mean elevation of 1919 m in upper arb forest is the dominating land cover accounting for about 62 of the upper arb area and glaciers with an area coverage of 253 4 km2 account for 2 7 of the total land area in the study watershed there are two hydrometric stations jasper and hinton operated by the water survey of canada since the 1960s fig 1 the mean annual discharge of these two monitoring stations is 2 8 109 m3 and 5 5 109 m3 respectively there is also a long term water quality station athabasca river at old entrance town site left bank close to hinton station fig 1 maintained by alberta environment and parks which measures the stream temperature carbon nutrients and other water quality variables on a monthly basis the stream temperature measured at this station from 2006 to 2018 ranges from 0 2 c in the winter to 21 3 c in the summer 2 2 hydrological model setup in upper athabasca river basin the required spatial datasets for swat etm model setup are a digital elevation model dem landuse and soil data maps the upper arb is delineated into 54 sub basins based on a 0 75 arc second 18 7 m resolution digital elevation model data from natural resources canada https open canada ca data en dataset 7f245e4d 76c2 4caa 951a 45d1d2051333 the 2010 landuse map with the resolution of 30 m 30 m from agriculture and agri food canada aafc http www agr gc ca atlas landu was used the glacier outlines of the study watershed are derived from the randolph glacier inventory rgi v6 0 which includes outlines of the majority of glaciers in the world rgi consortium 2017 the aafc map was then overlaid with the glacier map to define glaciers as a single landuse type the 1 1 million scale soil map from the aafc cordeiro et al 2018 was used as model input to setup the soil database a slope map is derived from the dem and divided into three groups breaks at 20 and 50 to define the hydrological response units hrus ten different landuse classes including glacier and 11 different soil types were defined according to the maps in addition a threshold of 0 5 and 5 for land use soil and slope respectively were used to define hrus and a total of 1565 hrus were obtained for the study watershed the 0 threshold for land use was used to ensure the model was not losing any glacier units daily meteorological data were then fed into the model we used precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature data from 6 stations as recorded by environmental and climate change canada https climate weather gc ca in addition wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation from 12 stations from the climate forecast system reanalysis dile and srinivasan 2014 dataset were also used as model input 2 3 swat equilibrium temperature model the swat equilibrium temperature swat etm model developed by du et al 2018 incorporated the equilibrium temperature approach into swat model to simulate heat transfer processes at the water air interface in the model it reflects the influence of air temperature solar radiation wind speed and stream water depth on the heat transfer processes in addition it considers the impacts of different runoff components including surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and snowmelt on stream temperature generally there are three steps for simulating stream temperature firstly the temperature of the local subbasin is calculated using a basic mixing model of the volumes and temperatures of different runoff components secondly the initial stream temperature before calculating heat transfer is calculated as a weighted average of streamflow contributions within the local sub basin and the upstream contribution lastly the stream temperature is calculated by simulating heat transfer between air and water to change the initial stream temperature this change is calculated based on the equilibrium temperature approach more details about the model processes can be found in du et al 2018 and du et al 2019 2 4 glacier melt model in this study glacier melt runoff was modeled using a classical temperature index model shea 2010 which simulates the melt runoff using air temperature with an empirical degree day factor at a daily time scale the separated degree day factors are used for ice and snow the melt runoff from a glacier is modeled as 1 m k s i t a t 0 t a t 0 0 t a t 0 where m is the melt runoff water equivalent mm day 1 ks is the degree day factor for snow mm c 1 day 1 ki is the degree day factor for ice mm c 1 day 1 ta is mean daily air temperature c t0 is the threshold temperature for melt to occur which assumed to be 0 c here in this study the model is driven by daily air temperature t a and precipitation the glaciers in upper arb were divided into six elevation bands and the precipitation and air temperatures were adjusted for each band using the lapse rates and the elevation differences the two parameters ks and ki are calibrated based on the measured melt runoff with the ranges obtained from the literature we downscaled the near surface air temperatures and precipitation data of the meteorological reference stations to each glacier site and their elevation bands using the mean vertical lapse rate vertical precipitation gradient and precipitation scaling factor we delineated 16 elevation bands for the athabasca glacier and computed temperature and precipitation using a reference climate station see eq 2 to account for the orographic forcing of moist air masses which typically produces increased precipitation with elevation shea et al 2015 we updated precipitation data at each elevation band see eq 3 for these climate data processing three parameters including of lr ppar and prate were evaluated through model calibration processes based on the measured melt runoff 2 t i t t ref l r z i z ref where t i t is the daily t average temperature in ⁰c at each elevation band i t ref in ⁰c is the daily average temperature at the reference station lr c m 1 is the vertical temperature lapse rate z i z ref is the elevation difference

precipitation at the reference station mm based on which the data were extrapolated to different elevation bands p para is precipitation correction factor unit less which accounts for underestimation of the precipitation on the glacier surface p rate is vertical precipitation gradient mm m 1 and is assumed to increase linearly with elevation 2 5 coupling glacier melt model with swat etm a schematic representation of coupling glacier melt model with swat etm model is presented in fig 2 to couple the glacier melt model with swat etm the outputs of the glacier melt runoff model were mapped onto the headwater sub basins with glacier hrus an additional input file was created to store the glacier melt runoff of the headwater sub basins with glaciers and a new sub routine was added to the swat etm source code release version 664 to read this file next the glacier melt runoff was used as surface runoff in these glacier hrus and lateral flow from soil layers and groundwater flow were set to zero for these hrus for stream temperature simulation the glacier melt runoff was used based on the basic mixing model as a runoff component in addition to surface runoff lateral flow groundwater and snowmelt when calculating the temperature of the local sub basin du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 in this study we assumed a temperature of 0 1 c for glacier melt runoff since similar previous studies have shown that water temperature near a glacial source is close to 0 c fellman et al 2014 the water temperature of the local sub basin is calculated as 4 tw l o c a l t snow s u b

temperature of the streamflow from upstream subbasin s and qoutlet is the streamflow discharge at the subbasin outlet the final temperature tw is modeled based on the temperature change caused by the

the water depth m and tt is the travel time of stream water day 1 water depth and travel time were calculated based on swat channel routing module by considering the hydromorphometrical characteristics including channel width slope length roughness coefficient so the impacts of hydromorphometrical characteristics on stream temperature were also considered by the swat etm model 2 6 model calibration and validation we used melt discharge observations at sunwapta station obtained from the alberta environment and parks to calibrate and validate the model for glacier melt runoff the daily melt runoff from 2006 to 2018 was obtained by converting the high temporal resolution from 5 to 30 min discharge measurements to calibrate the model at a daily time scale the model calibration period was from 2006 to 2012 7 years and the 2013 2018 period 6 years was used for model validation then the coupled model was used for simulating streamflow and stream temperatures for a 16 year period from 2003 to 2018 the first three years 2003 2005 were used as a warm up period to minimize the impact of initial conditions the same calibration and validation periods were used in the melt runoff model we first calibrated the hydrological processes using the observed daily streamflow in jasper and hinton hydrometric stations then we calibrated stream temperature parameters based on the coupled glacier swat etm model and observed daily stream temperature at the water quality station fig 1 the frequency of the stream temperature sampling is about once a month and there are 156 measurements in total during the 13 years in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as the objective function for model calibration and percentage biases pbias and coefficient of determination r2 were also used as two other measures of model performance pbias measures the average deviation of model simulations from the observations r2 ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of the total variance in the observed data explained by the model simulation nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 and indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line the equations for nse r2 and pbias are as follows 7 nse 1 t 1 n y obs t y sim t 2 t 1 n y obs t yobs 2 8 r 2 t 1 n y sim t ysi m y obs t yobs t 1 n y sim t ysi m 2 t 1 n y sim t ysi m 2 2 9 pbias t 1 n y sim t y obs t t 1 n y obs t 100 where yt sim is the simulated value at a time unit t yt obs is the observed value at a time unit t n is the total data number ysi m is the mean observed value for the simulated period and yobs is the mean simulated value of the simulated period in addition we qualitatively assessed the model performances based on evaluation criteria for watershed models summarized by moriasi et al 2015 which rates the model performance from unsatisfactory to very good based on a range of model performance measures in addition we used the global sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2007a from swat cup to conduct parameter sensitivity analysis in this study specifically parameter sensitivities were quantified by calculating the following multiple regression equation which used the regression between parameter values generated by the latin hypercube and the objective function values 10 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function α and β are two regression coefficients bi is the calibrated value of i th parameter and m is the number of calibrated parameters a t test is then used to identify the relative significance of each parameter with a p value 0 1 indicating a parameter as sensitive in this study parameter sensitivity ranking was given based on the p value of each parameter two thousand samples were used for each parameter to conduct the sensitivity analysis and nse was used as the objective function in eq 8 the initial upper and lower limits of each parameter were determined based on swat manual and former studies using swat in this region shrestha et al 2017 faramarziet al 2015 in addition we also conducted uncertainty analysis for stream temperature simulation based on swat cup the 95 prediction uncertainty band obtained from the sufi 2 algorithm of swat cup was used to quantify the simulation uncertainties the simulation uncertainties were assessed by the p factor and r factor the p factor is the percentage of the observed data bracketed by the 95 uncertainty band and the r factor is the normalized width of the band 3 results and discussions 3 1 glacier melt streamflow and stream temperature simulations calibration parameters for the melt model and elevation parameters for weather data distribution were initially collected from an extensive literature review for alps himalayas scandinavia and greenland glaciers the most reasonable initial values were considered for model calibration based on reported values and expert opinion for the study region table 1 shows the descriptions initial ranges and calibrated values for the glacier melt model the comparison between daily simulated and observed melt runoff at sunwapta station showed that the glacier melt model achieved good performance fig 3 c the model performance statistics table 2 also indicate a good simulation performance with a pbias r2 and nse of 2 2 0 89 and 0 89 for the calibration periods and 4 4 0 86 and 0 85 for the validation periods respectively the streamflow calibration results indicated an overall slight under estimation shown by the positive pbias values according to the evaluation criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the streamflow simulation in jasper station was assessed as good for the calibration and validation periods based on three different measures in table 1 for hinton station the streamflow simulation was assessed as satisfactory for calibration and validation periods based on the three different statistic measures the evaluation criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2015 are the same for monthly and daily time scales but it is commonly recognized that increasing temporal simulation resolution from monthly to daily scale often leads to poorer performance therefore the model performance of daily streamflow simulation in the arb could be considered as good the comparison results of simulated and observed daily streamflow for two hydrometric stations in upper arb suggest that the coupled model captured the temporal variability of observed streamflow for both stations fig 3a and b however there were some underestimations for peak flow particularly for the validation period of the hinton station in downstream since most of the peak flow at jasper station in the mid reach was well represented the underestimations of peak flow in downstream are likely not caused by the glacier melt model also previous studies have shown that it is not uncommon for swat and other hydrological models to underestimate peak flow hoang et al 2019 eum et al 2017 morales marín et al 2019a due to uncertainties from input climate data especially for precipitation and temperature in mountainous regions zarehmehrjardy et al 2020 du et al 2020b the sensitivity ranking and calibrated results of hydrological parameters in the two stations of arb show that precipitation lapse rate and the channel manning s n value were the two most sensitive parameters at both stations table 3 moreover the air temperature lapse rate was one of the sensitive parameters for upper arb which ranks fourth and third for jasper and hinton station respectively the large elevation ranges 960 3645 m present in the upper arb explain the sensitivity of these two lapse rates it also indicates precipitation and air temperature varied significantly in this mountainous headwater region and the density of meteorological stations is important for hydrological modelling in the mountainous watershed this is in agreement with previous work citing the large degree of spatiotemporal uncertainty in the mountainous watersheds of western canada as compared to watersheds in the foothills and plain due to climate data scarcity zarehmehrjardy et al 2020 it s worth menthioning that the temperature lapse rate is usually negative as the air temperature decreases with the increase of the elevation while the positive temperature lapse rate with altitude may be possible over short altitudinal ranges in specific topographic conditions the positive temperature lapse rate in the downstream of the upper arb may reflect the uncertainty of observed air temperature and the correlation of different model parameters may also result in the positive lapse rate the channel manning s n value was the most sensitive parameter because it affects the channel routing process and thus the daily hydrograph moreover the surface runoff lag coefficient for landscape routing in sub basins was also a very sensitive parameter however these two routing parameters were not sensitive in a previous study conducted for hydrological modeling in the athabasca river basin using the swat model shrestha et al 2017 this is because their model was calibrated using the monthly flow it indicates that routing parameters and processes are important for controlling daily hydrograph which should be included when calibrating the swat model at a daily time scale the other sensitive hydrology parameters in this study include the parameter for surface runoff yield cn2 snowmelt smtmp and soil water dynamics sol k as indicated in table 3 comparison of periodic simulated and observed stream temperatures indicates that the coupled model has an overall good performance for simulating daily stream temperatures of different magnitudes fig 4 a and could capture the monthly and seasonal variations of the observations fig 4b table 4 shows the model performance statistics for daily stream temperature at athabasca river at the old entrance town site left bank station which is close to the hinton hydrometric station for different simulation periods the pbias values are less than 5 and the r2 and nse values are greater than 0 85 we used the evaluation criteria for streamflow modeling suggested by moriasi et al 2015 as a reference to qualitatively assess the stream temperature simulation performance since there is no evaluation criterion for stream temperature modeling the model statistics values shown in table 4 are all assessed as very good for different simulation periods based on three different performance statistics furthermore we also compared the stream temperature simulation performance to other studies using processed based stream temperature models at a watershed scale morales marín et al 2019a morales marín et al 2019b yearsley 2012 cao et al 2016 which further demonstrated that the coupled model had a very good performance for simulating stream temperature in upper arb table 5 shows the stream temperature parameters for upper arb with sensitivity ranking and calibrated values there are five calibrated parameters for the swat etm model and four of them were identified as sensitive based on the global parameter sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameter is the additive parameter for the water air heat transfer process another heat transfer related parameter λmkt ranks third in the sensitivity ranking with p value close to 0 it indicates the heat transfer process at the water air interface is important in governing the stream temperature dynamics in the upper arb the other two sensitive parameters are the daily air temperature lag and runoff mixing coefficient which reflect the importance of the impacts of hydrological processes on stream temperature in the upper arb our previous study for stream temperature modeling in the elbow river watershed in southern alberta western canada also showed that runoff composition and hydrological processes play significant roles in controlling stream temperature dynamics du et al 2020a a mixing model was used in swat etm to represent different runoff components with different temperature signatures and glacier melt runoff was incorporated based on a temperature index model in this study hence the model reflects the impacts of total runoff composition on stream temperature the stream water depth dynamics are also considered for heat transfer processes in the model reflecting streamflow volume impacts in addition the 95 predictive uncertainty 95ppu band for stream temperature was shown in fig 5 the p factor of the 95ppu band was 0 50 indicating 50 of the measured data was bracketed by the uncertainty band the r factor for stream temperature uncertainty was 0 70 in this study and a r factor less than 1 0 indicates a model has an acceptable prediction uncertainty estimation according to abbaspour et al 2007b 3 2 impacts of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation to investigate the impacts of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature modeling we compared swat etm model simulation results with and without coupling the melt runoff model for different regions of the upper arb based on the calibrated model we present our results for upper middle and downstream outlets of the study area the selected sub basin in the upstream is fed by athabasca glacier with 14 of its area covered by glaciers the jasper and hinton stations were selected to represent the mid reach and downstream parts of the study watershed fig 1 the 7 day moving average of simulated streamflow in different regions of upper arb with and without coupling the glacier melt model suggests that more realistic elevated streamflow simulation during the glacier melt season may to october was obtained by the coupled model compared with the original swat model fig 6 on average glacier melt runoff during melt season accounted for 61 6 43 1 and 34 4 of the total flow in this season for the headwater mid reach and downstream sub basins respectively it indicates that glacier melt runoff is an important water source in the upper arb and the changes in glacier melt runoff would substantially affect the water availability in the region therefore streamflow during the melt season is likely to be underestimated if glacier melt runoff processes are not considered in watershed hydrological modeling previous studies have shown that the hydrological model without coupling glacier melt processes could achieve acceptable streamflow simulations however this model success results in unrealistic calibrated parameter values see for example vaghefi et al 2019 which brings about model uncertainties and unreliable representation of watershed hydrological processes in previous studies in the athabasca river basin different hydrological models such as swat and vic have been used for streamflow modeling shrestha et al 2017 eum et al 2017 although these two studies achieved relatively good performances for streamflow simulation hinton station in the upper arb the glacier melt runoff processes were not considered which led to uncertainties for the representation of hydrological processes in addition the impacts of future climate change on water quantity and flow regime predicted in these studies ignored the contributions from glacier melt which could lead to significant uncertainties in climate change impact projections moore et al 2009 stahl et al 2008 this was also pointed out in earlier studies as the absence of glacier melt processes in the vic hydrological model was a possible reason for the underestimation of peak flow eum et al 2017 therefore glacier melt runoff processes should be explicitly considered and simulated for hydrological modeling and projections in the glacierized watersheds the annual average stream temperatures simulated by the coupled model during melt season in headwater mid reach and downstream sub basins were 1 4 1 1 and 1 0 c lower than those simulated by swat etm without coupling the glacier processes this indicates that the coupled model successfully represents the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature as demonstrated by previous empirical studies based on stream temperature monitoring slemmons et al 2013 williamson et al 2019 another reason for the lower stream temperature simulated by the coupled model during the melt season is that coupling the glacier melt model results in a greater streamflow simulation that decreases the stream temperature this reflects the inverse relationship between streamflow and stream temperature because of the positive relationship between thermal capacity and streamflow volume webb et al 2003 van vliet et al 2013 fig 7 also indicates that the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff gets weaker from headwater to downstream and our coupled model was able to represent the spatial variations of the cooling effects in the study watershed therefore the stream temperature during the melt season would be overestimated if the impacts of glacier melt runoff were not considered in addition accurate stream temperature simulation is the basis of the water quality modeling since stream temperature affects the in situ biogeochemical reactions and transformation rates du et al 2018 punzet et al 2012 the original swat model uses a linear equation based on air temperature to simulate stream temperature with fixed coefficients neitsch et al 2011 which can cause remarkable uncertainties in stream temperature and water quality modeling the swat etm model coupled with the glacier melt model is able to reflect the impacts of different runoff components including surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow snowmelt and glacier melt runoff and it provides an effective and comprehensive basis for watershed stream temperature and water quality modeling to explore the factors affecting the stream temperature regimes in the arb we also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing melt runoff and air temperature by 10 based on the calibrated coupled model the results showed that when air temperature increases by 10 stream temperature would increase by 0 24 0 41 and 0 57 for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions respectively however stream temperature would decrease by 0 20 0 36 and 0 53 respectively for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions when air temperature decreases by 10 in addition stream temperature would decrease by 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions respectively when melt runoff increases by 10 however stream temperature would increase by 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions respectively when melt runoff decreases by 10 the sensitivity analysis indicated that air temperature has more impact on stream temperature since it directly affects the heat transfer intensity and water yield however our results presented in the previous two paragraphs also indicated that the model would substantially underestimate streamflow and overestimate stream temperature if the impacts of glacier melt processes were not included in the model in addition the hydrological and hydromorphometrical variables such as surface runoff and channel water depth also substantially the stream temperature regimes previous studies showed that water depth has an inverse relationship with stream temperature and a change for water depth by 50 would change the stream temperature by about 0 3 du et al 2018 moreover snowmelt runoff in the cold region watershed has a similar impact on stream temperature as surface runoff despite the fact that snowmelt runoff is smaller in volume compared to surface runoff du et al 2020a 3 3 the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature in a changing climate in this study we combined air temperature increase and glacier melt runoff changes to conduct scenario analysis for the changes of stream temperature regime in upstream mid reach and downstream of upper arb previous studies showed that mean air temperature was projected to increase by 2 3 in the near future and 2 5 5 4 in the distant future in the arb shrestha et al 2017 hence we used two air temperature increase scenarios as 2 and 4 for near and distant future respectively previous studies for predicting climate change impacts on glacier melt runoff showed that the glacier area would shrink in the future mainly caused by the air temperature increase and glacier melt runoff will first increase because of faster melt rate and then decrease due to the shrink of glacier source area bliss et al 2014 gan et al 2015 therefore a 2 c increase in air temperature and a 20 increase in glacier melt runoff because of faster melt rate were used for the scenario in the near future in addition a 4 c increase in air temperature and a 20 decrease in glacier melt runoff due to glacier sources reduction were used for the scenario analysis in the distant future fig 8 shows the 7 day moving average of stream temperature in the near future under climate change scenarios for different regions in upper arb it indicates that an increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would off set the stream temperature increase caused by the rising air temperature this is because the increase in glacier melt runoff elevates the cooling effect and thermal capacity due to increasing streamflow the alleviating effect is more evident in the headwater than in the mid reach and downstream region and it could attenuate the increasing peak stream temperatures in summer caused by the rising air temperature a 2 c air temperature increase in the headwater would increase the average and peak temperature during melt season by 0 8 and 1 3 c in contrast a 20 increase in glacier melt runoff would alleviate the increase in average and peak stream temperatures by 0 14 and 0 13 c in the headwater fig 9 shows the 7 day moving average of stream temperature in the distant future under climate change scenarios for different regions in upper arb it suggests that a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would aggravate the increase of stream temperature in summer due to the rising air temperature especially for the headwater region a 4 c air temperature increase in the headwater region would increase the average and peak temperature during melt season by 1 9 and 2 8 c in comparison a 20 decrease in glacier melt runoff would aggravate the increase in average and peak stream temperature by 0 21 and 0 49 c in the headwater a previous study showed that the increase of peak stream temperature in summer could threaten the life of fish species because the fish would begin to die once the stream temperature exceeds the upper tolerance temperatures gutierre et al 2016 therefore the impacts of glacier melt on stream temperature should be considered when predicting climate change impact on stream temperature regime in the glacierized watershed in the cold region in addition the changes in glacier melt runoff could also affect in stream water quality dynamics by affecting biogeochemical reaction rates and some water quality indicators e g dissolved oxygen for example there is an inverse relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen and the projected increase in stream temperature in the distant future caused by rising air temperature as well as the projected declining glacier melt runoff could lead to the decrease of in stream dissolved oxygen which can be harmful for aquatic species ficklin et al 2013 du et al 2019 3 4 limitations and future studies a temperature index based model with elevation bands was used to simulate glacier melt runoff and it was coupled with the swat etm model for stream temperature modeling assessment and projection of the effect of glacier changes on the hydrological regime of the glacierized basins demand a comprehensive simulation of glacier mass balance melt and the evolution considering their interactions and feedbacks over time and space naz et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 assessment of glacier dynamics is based on a wide range of approaches from simple volume area v a scaling approach bliss et al 2014 to a more robust numerical 3 d ice flow simulation methods zekollari et al 2019 our study has opted for the v a approach due to data scarcity at a large scale while robust simulation approaches are subject to a lack of high resolution measurements especially at large regional scales the availability of such data would have reduced the uncertainty in our melt modeling for future projections moreover a simple scenario analysis was used to investigate the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature in a changing climate climate projections from different general or regional circulation models hawkins and sutton 2009 could be fed into the glacier mass model and swat etm model in a future study to provide more comprehensive predictions for future stream temperature regimes in the upper arb this study used a two step calibration process since the glacier melt model was loosely coupled with the swat etm model the best simulation from parameter calibration of the glacier melt model was used as the input of the swat etm model which has limited the parameter equifinality issue to some extent for coupling the melt model and swta etm model however there is still parameter equifinality for the model coupling framework since three different variables melt runoff streamflow and stream temperature are modeled with lots of different parameters in addition to affecting in stream reaction rates by impacting stream temperature the glacier melt runoff also affects the in stream water quality by exporting pollution loadings from the landscape to the streams this is because glaciers act as a legacy storage tank for the chemicals e g nitrogen dissolved organic matter and pesticides from atmosphere deposition slemmons et al 2013 these deposited chemicals could potentially be washed off and transported by the glacier melt runoff therefore a water quality module for glacier should be developed and incorporated into watershed models for water quality simulation and their future projections in the glacierized watersheds 4 conclusion in order to investigate the impacts of glacier melt on stream temperatures a temperature index glacier melt runoff model was coupled with a swat equilibrium temperature model to reflect the impacts of glacier melt processes on stream temperature the coupled model was used to simulate daily streamflow and stream temperature in the upper athabasca river basin the daily streamflow and periodic daily stream temperature were well simulated according to the model performance measures and visual comparisons based on the calibrated model the impacts of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation were investigated with and without coupling the melt model with swat the impacts from glacier melt were successfully represented in the coupled model by simulating higher streamflow and lower stream temperature during the melt season the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature showed a decreasing trend from headwater to downstream since the glaciers concentrate in the upstream the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature under climate change was analyzed by combing air temperature and glacier melt runoff changes to conduct scenario analysis due to the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff the increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would alleviate the average and peak stream temperature increase during the melt season while a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would aggravate the stream temperature increase therefore the impact of glacier melt runoff should be explicitly considered to accurately model stream temperature and predict future climate

3711,stream temperature is a significant indicator for biodiversity and ecosystem health of stream ecosystem the impacts of glacier melt processes on stream temperature such as the cooling effect have not been explicitly considered in process based models which limit model capability in simulating stream temperature in glacierized cold regions we coupled a temperature index based glacier melt model with the swat equilibrium temperature model to overcome this limitation the coupled model was tested and applied in the upper athabasca river basin in western canada to simulate daily streamflow and stream temperature it showed a good performance for stream temperature simulation with percent bias pbias less than 5 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 values greater than 0 85 the impact of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation was investigated by turning the melt model on and off the results illustrate that the coupled model accurately reproduces the impacts of glacier melt by simulating higher streamflow and lower stream temperature during the melt season in particular the progressive reduction in the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature from headwater to downstream was well represented finally the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature under climate change was assessed by the scenario simulations this analysis revealed that an increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would alleviate the average and peak stream temperature increase during the melt season while a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would ultimately aggravate the stream temperature increase therefore the impact of glacier melt runoff should be explicitly considered in process based models to accurately model stream temperature and predict future climate change impact on the thermal regime in the glacierized watersheds the model coupling framework developed in this study could be a useful tool for simulating stream temperature in glacierized watersheds keywords equilibrium temperature model coupling swat model thermal regime 1 introduction stream temperature is a fundamental physical property of the stream ecosystem and a key indicator of overall ecosystem health caissie 2006 webb et al 2008 it affects water density conductivity ph saturated dissolved oxygen concentration and biochemical reaction rates zhu et al 2019 it plays an important ecological role in controlling the life and habitat of aquatic species eaton et al 1995 mohseni et al 1998 especially fishes a fish species has a preferred water temperature range with a maximum tolerance temperature any change of stream temperature regime would impact the life cycle and habitat of fish species kwak et al 2017 du et al 2019 stream temperature is a collective effect of controlling factors related to meteorological conditions watershed characteristics and hydrological processes ficklin et al 2012 especially air temperature is one of the important factors for stream temperature and temperatures of other water bodies alizadeh et al 2018 since it impacts the heat transport process between water surface and atmosphere the stream temperature regimes have been and will continue to be changed by anthropogenic activities including land use and climate change which alter the meteorological and hydrological conditions du et al 2018 therefore it is vital to model stream temperature to project the changes in stream temperature regimes under varying hydrological meteorological and climate conditions glacier melt runoff has important control on stream temperature regime in cold region watersheds because it has a moderating impact on stream temperature in summer when the glacier melt runoff elevates with the rising air temperature moore 2006 also any change in glacier melt runoff would result in a change in streamflow and thus the heat capacity milner et al 2017 since there is an inverse relationship between streamflow and stream temperature reflecting a positive relationship between thermal capacity and streamflow volume webb et al 2003 van vliet et al 2013 in other words when streamflow increases stream temperature decreases because of an increase in thermal capacity some studies investigated the impact of glaciers on stream temperature in different cold region watersheds based on the measurements of stream temperature in different parts of the watersheds and the cooling effects of the glacier melt on stream temperature during the summer melt season were found blaen et al 2013 cadbury et al 2008 williamson et al 2019 for example uehlinger et al 2003 investigated the thermal dynamics of roseg river in swaziland based on temperature records of 23 sites from june 1997 to may 1998 and found that stream temperatures rapidly increased in the spring followed by a moderate decrease in summer due to the seasonal glacier melt runoff contribution fellman et al 2014 used continuous stream temperature measurements water isotope samples and multiple linear regression models to investigate the glacier coverage impacts on stream temperature in coastal watersheds of southeast alaska and they found that the cooling effect in the summer is equivalent to a decline of 1 1 c for each 10 increase in glacier coverage similarly gao et al 2017 investigated stream temperature dynamics in nam co basin southern tibetan plateau china using stream temperature observations glacier mass balance observations and the linear regression models and found that mean stream temperatures of glacier fed streams were much lower than those of non glacier rivers and that when glacier melt runoff contributed more than 50 of streamflow glaciers played a significant role on the stream temperature process based and statistical models are two major types of models for stream temperature predictions du et al 2018 a process based model is usually based on energy balance while a statistical model employs regression techniques between stream temperature and meteorological variables previous studies have shown that hydrological processes and runoff composition have substantial impacts on stream temperature regime and thus the impacts from the hydrological processes need to be included in the process based models for simulating stream temperature du et al 2020a ficklin et al 2012 morales marín et al 2019b in particular in glacierized catchments glacier melt runoff and its impacts on stream temperature should be included in the process based models to more accurately simulate fluctuating seasonal stream temperatures several past studies have successfully integrated glacier melt and runoff processes with watershed hydrological modeling for streamflow simulation in the cold region watersheds chen et al 2017 shrestha et al 2015 for example konz and seibert 2010 incorporated glacier ice melt and accumulation processes based on degree day factor into the hbv hydrologiskabyrånsvattenavdelning hydrological model they demonstrated that the uncertainties of streamflow simulations were considerably reduced after combining glacier mass balance and discharge observations compared to using only discharge data for model calibrations in the manas river basin in northwest china luo et al 2013 incorporated an algorithm for glacier melt and mass balance into the soil and water assessment tool swat model based on a dynamic hydrological response unit hru approach and the enhanced model showed good simulation performance for daily streamflow and water balance zhao et al 2015 integrated a degree day glacier melt algorithm into the variable infiltration capacity vic model and good performance for monthly flow simulation in the kunma like river catchment was also obtained by the extended vic model in addition scenario analyses suggest that reductions in glacier area would result in less glacier melt runoff in summer and river runoff would decline accordingly while a wide range of empirical and model based studies have been developed to assess the dynamics of glacier melt mass balance and runoff the impacts of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature have not been explicitly considered in the process based hydrological models to the best of our knowledge this gap in the literature limits the ability of existing models to accurately predict stream temperatures in glacierized regions previously we developed a stream temperature model based on the widely used swat model by incorporating an equilibrium temperature approach du et al 2018 the swat equilibrium temperature model swat etm considers the impacts of key hydrological processes including surface runoff snowmelt runoff lateral flow and groundwater flow as well as water depth dynamics collectively these processes reflect the impacts of runoff composition and streamflow volume on stream temperature du et al 2020a the swat etm has been successfully calibrated and validated in three different watersheds in the cold region of north america and can simulate the cooling effect of snowmelt runoff on stream temperature du et al 2019 du et al 2020a however the impact of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature has not yet been incorporated in the swat etm mountain glaciers are important and sensitive indicators of climate change and they are a significant source of water for downstream users on different time scales hagg et al 2013 in the 20th century mean annual air temperature has risen significantly which resulted in accelerated mountain glacier retreat around the world azam et al 2018 bolch 2007 clarke et al 2015 zemp et al 2019 in the future glacier retreats will likely continue to accelerate as air temperatures rise due to climate change glacier melts and retreats substantially influence hydrological regimes and water quality e g increasing sediment loads in glacier fed watersheds they also result in geomorphic hazards including outburst floods and debris flows moore et al 2009 li et al 2018 hydrological models have predicted that glacial retreat under climate change would result in an initial increase in streamflow in near future due to atmospheric warming and a faster melt rate but it would be followed by a decrease in streamflow as the glacier sources diminish in the distant future bliss et al 2014 fellman et al 2014 for example huss et al 2008 predicted future runoff in three highly glacierized alpine watersheds using a glacio hydrological model with a temperature index melt and accumulation module showing an initial increase in annual runoff followed by an overall reduction below current levels in addition to increased melt glacier retreat was also predicted by all climate scenarios with glacier area shrinking significantly gan et al 2015 predicted the impacts of climate change on the glacier dynamics and runoff generation in the naryn river basin in central asia using a glacier enhanced swat hydrological model the results showed that the glacier area would shrink in the future mainly caused by the changes in air temperature and glacier melt runoff will first increase and then decrease after reaching its peak in 2040 in sum the impacts of climate change on glacier melt runoff and the effects of glacier melt changes on flow regimes in the cold region watershed have been studied based on different hydrological and glacier melt models however the impacts of glacier melt changes on stream temperature regimes resulting from future climate change have not yet been thoroughly investigated in the future stream temperatures in mountainous and cold regions will likely increase due to rising air temperatures and more intense heat transfers between the water and atmosphere holsinger et al 2014 punzet et al 2012 tung et al 2006 the objectives of this study are threefold firstly we aim to explicitly account for the impact of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature by coupling a glacier melt runoff model with the swat etm model secondly we use the coupled model to predict daily stream temperature in the upper athabasca river basin a large glacier fed catchment in western canada to understand and investigate the impact of glacier melt runoff on the thermal regimes of the upstream and downstream regions finally the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature in a changing climate is investigated using scenario analysis based on the calibrated coupled model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the athabasca river basin arb originates from the columbia icefield in jasper national park and travels about 1300 km northeast across alberta before flowing into lake athabasca in western canada this study focuses on the upper arb above the hinton hydrometric station fig 1 with an area of about 9760 km2 the elevation ranges from 960 m to 3645 m with a mean elevation of 1919 m in upper arb forest is the dominating land cover accounting for about 62 of the upper arb area and glaciers with an area coverage of 253 4 km2 account for 2 7 of the total land area in the study watershed there are two hydrometric stations jasper and hinton operated by the water survey of canada since the 1960s fig 1 the mean annual discharge of these two monitoring stations is 2 8 109 m3 and 5 5 109 m3 respectively there is also a long term water quality station athabasca river at old entrance town site left bank close to hinton station fig 1 maintained by alberta environment and parks which measures the stream temperature carbon nutrients and other water quality variables on a monthly basis the stream temperature measured at this station from 2006 to 2018 ranges from 0 2 c in the winter to 21 3 c in the summer 2 2 hydrological model setup in upper athabasca river basin the required spatial datasets for swat etm model setup are a digital elevation model dem landuse and soil data maps the upper arb is delineated into 54 sub basins based on a 0 75 arc second 18 7 m resolution digital elevation model data from natural resources canada https open canada ca data en dataset 7f245e4d 76c2 4caa 951a 45d1d2051333 the 2010 landuse map with the resolution of 30 m 30 m from agriculture and agri food canada aafc http www agr gc ca atlas landu was used the glacier outlines of the study watershed are derived from the randolph glacier inventory rgi v6 0 which includes outlines of the majority of glaciers in the world rgi consortium 2017 the aafc map was then overlaid with the glacier map to define glaciers as a single landuse type the 1 1 million scale soil map from the aafc cordeiro et al 2018 was used as model input to setup the soil database a slope map is derived from the dem and divided into three groups breaks at 20 and 50 to define the hydrological response units hrus ten different landuse classes including glacier and 11 different soil types were defined according to the maps in addition a threshold of 0 5 and 5 for land use soil and slope respectively were used to define hrus and a total of 1565 hrus were obtained for the study watershed the 0 threshold for land use was used to ensure the model was not losing any glacier units daily meteorological data were then fed into the model we used precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature data from 6 stations as recorded by environmental and climate change canada https climate weather gc ca in addition wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation from 12 stations from the climate forecast system reanalysis dile and srinivasan 2014 dataset were also used as model input 2 3 swat equilibrium temperature model the swat equilibrium temperature swat etm model developed by du et al 2018 incorporated the equilibrium temperature approach into swat model to simulate heat transfer processes at the water air interface in the model it reflects the influence of air temperature solar radiation wind speed and stream water depth on the heat transfer processes in addition it considers the impacts of different runoff components including surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow and snowmelt on stream temperature generally there are three steps for simulating stream temperature firstly the temperature of the local subbasin is calculated using a basic mixing model of the volumes and temperatures of different runoff components secondly the initial stream temperature before calculating heat transfer is calculated as a weighted average of streamflow contributions within the local sub basin and the upstream contribution lastly the stream temperature is calculated by simulating heat transfer between air and water to change the initial stream temperature this change is calculated based on the equilibrium temperature approach more details about the model processes can be found in du et al 2018 and du et al 2019 2 4 glacier melt model in this study glacier melt runoff was modeled using a classical temperature index model shea 2010 which simulates the melt runoff using air temperature with an empirical degree day factor at a daily time scale the separated degree day factors are used for ice and snow the melt runoff from a glacier is modeled as 1 m k s i t a t 0 t a t 0 0 t a t 0 where m is the melt runoff water equivalent mm day 1 ks is the degree day factor for snow mm c 1 day 1 ki is the degree day factor for ice mm c 1 day 1 ta is mean daily air temperature c t0 is the threshold temperature for melt to occur which assumed to be 0 c here in this study the model is driven by daily air temperature t a and precipitation the glaciers in upper arb were divided into six elevation bands and the precipitation and air temperatures were adjusted for each band using the lapse rates and the elevation differences the two parameters ks and ki are calibrated based on the measured melt runoff with the ranges obtained from the literature we downscaled the near surface air temperatures and precipitation data of the meteorological reference stations to each glacier site and their elevation bands using the mean vertical lapse rate vertical precipitation gradient and precipitation scaling factor we delineated 16 elevation bands for the athabasca glacier and computed temperature and precipitation using a reference climate station see eq 2 to account for the orographic forcing of moist air masses which typically produces increased precipitation with elevation shea et al 2015 we updated precipitation data at each elevation band see eq 3 for these climate data processing three parameters including of lr ppar and prate were evaluated through model calibration processes based on the measured melt runoff 2 t i t t ref l r z i z ref where t i t is the daily t average temperature in ⁰c at each elevation band i t ref in ⁰c is the daily average temperature at the reference station lr c m 1 is the vertical temperature lapse rate z i z ref is the elevation difference

precipitation at the reference station mm based on which the data were extrapolated to different elevation bands p para is precipitation correction factor unit less which accounts for underestimation of the precipitation on the glacier surface p rate is vertical precipitation gradient mm m 1 and is assumed to increase linearly with elevation 2 5 coupling glacier melt model with swat etm a schematic representation of coupling glacier melt model with swat etm model is presented in fig 2 to couple the glacier melt model with swat etm the outputs of the glacier melt runoff model were mapped onto the headwater sub basins with glacier hrus an additional input file was created to store the glacier melt runoff of the headwater sub basins with glaciers and a new sub routine was added to the swat etm source code release version 664 to read this file next the glacier melt runoff was used as surface runoff in these glacier hrus and lateral flow from soil layers and groundwater flow were set to zero for these hrus for stream temperature simulation the glacier melt runoff was used based on the basic mixing model as a runoff component in addition to surface runoff lateral flow groundwater and snowmelt when calculating the temperature of the local sub basin du et al 2018 ficklin et al 2012 in this study we assumed a temperature of 0 1 c for glacier melt runoff since similar previous studies have shown that water temperature near a glacial source is close to 0 c fellman et al 2014 the water temperature of the local sub basin is calculated as 4 tw l o c a l t snow s u b

the upstream water temperature to simulate the initial temperature tw initial as follows 5 t w i n i t i a l t w u p q outlet s u b w y l d t w l o c a l s u b w y l d q outlet where tw up is the temperature of the streamflow from upstream subbasin s and qoutlet is the streamflow discharge at the subbasin outlet the final temperature tw is modeled based on the temperature change caused by the heat transfer process calculated by the equilibrium temperature approach as follows 6 t w t w i n i t i a l k t t air η slr k t t w i n i t i a l ρ w c ρ w h t t where kt is the overall heat exchange

the water depth m and tt is the travel time of stream water day 1 water depth and travel time were calculated based on swat channel routing module by considering the hydromorphometrical characteristics including channel width slope length roughness coefficient so the impacts of hydromorphometrical characteristics on stream temperature were also considered by the swat etm model 2 6 model calibration and validation we used melt discharge observations at sunwapta station obtained from the alberta environment and parks to calibrate and validate the model for glacier melt runoff the daily melt runoff from 2006 to 2018 was obtained by converting the high temporal resolution from 5 to 30 min discharge measurements to calibrate the model at a daily time scale the model calibration period was from 2006 to 2012 7 years and the 2013 2018 period 6 years was used for model validation then the coupled model was used for simulating streamflow and stream temperatures for a 16 year period from 2003 to 2018 the first three years 2003 2005 were used as a warm up period to minimize the impact of initial conditions the same calibration and validation periods were used in the melt runoff model we first calibrated the hydrological processes using the observed daily streamflow in jasper and hinton hydrometric stations then we calibrated stream temperature parameters based on the coupled glacier swat etm model and observed daily stream temperature at the water quality station fig 1 the frequency of the stream temperature sampling is about once a month and there are 156 measurements in total during the 13 years in this study nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was used as the objective function for model calibration and percentage biases pbias and coefficient of determination r2 were also used as two other measures of model performance pbias measures the average deviation of model simulations from the observations r2 ranges from 0 to 1 and represents the proportion of the total variance in the observed data explained by the model simulation nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 and indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated data fits the 1 1 line the equations for nse r2 and pbias are as follows 7 nse 1 t 1 n y obs t y sim t 2 t 1 n y obs t yobs 2 8 r 2 t 1 n y sim t ysi m y obs t yobs t 1 n y sim t ysi m 2 t 1 n y sim t ysi m 2 2 9 pbias t 1 n y sim t y obs t t 1 n y obs t 100 where yt sim is the simulated value at a time unit t yt obs is the observed value at a time unit t n is the total data number ysi m is the mean observed value for the simulated period and yobs is the mean simulated value of the simulated period in addition we qualitatively assessed the model performances based on evaluation criteria for watershed models summarized by moriasi et al 2015 which rates the model performance from unsatisfactory to very good based on a range of model performance measures in addition we used the global sensitivity analysis abbaspour et al 2007a from swat cup to conduct parameter sensitivity analysis in this study specifically parameter sensitivities were quantified by calculating the following multiple regression equation which used the regression between parameter values generated by the latin hypercube and the objective function values 10 g α i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function α and β are two regression coefficients bi is the calibrated value of i th parameter and m is the number of calibrated parameters a t test is then used to identify the relative significance of each parameter with a p value 0 1 indicating a parameter as sensitive in this study parameter sensitivity ranking was given based on the p value of each parameter two thousand samples were used for each parameter to conduct the sensitivity analysis and nse was used as the objective function in eq 8 the initial upper and lower limits of each parameter were determined based on swat manual and former studies using swat in this region shrestha et al 2017 faramarziet al 2015 in addition we also conducted uncertainty analysis for stream temperature simulation based on swat cup the 95 prediction uncertainty band obtained from the sufi 2 algorithm of swat cup was used to quantify the simulation uncertainties the simulation uncertainties were assessed by the p factor and r factor the p factor is the percentage of the observed data bracketed by the 95 uncertainty band and the r factor is the normalized width of the band 3 results and discussions 3 1 glacier melt streamflow and stream temperature simulations calibration parameters for the melt model and elevation parameters for weather data distribution were initially collected from an extensive literature review for alps himalayas scandinavia and greenland glaciers the most reasonable initial values were considered for model calibration based on reported values and expert opinion for the study region table 1 shows the descriptions initial ranges and calibrated values for the glacier melt model the comparison between daily simulated and observed melt runoff at sunwapta station showed that the glacier melt model achieved good performance fig 3 c the model performance statistics table 2 also indicate a good simulation performance with a pbias r2 and nse of 2 2 0 89 and 0 89 for the calibration periods and 4 4 0 86 and 0 85 for the validation periods respectively the streamflow calibration results indicated an overall slight under estimation shown by the positive pbias values according to the evaluation criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2015 the streamflow simulation in jasper station was assessed as good for the calibration and validation periods based on three different measures in table 1 for hinton station the streamflow simulation was assessed as satisfactory for calibration and validation periods based on the three different statistic measures the evaluation criteria suggested by moriasi et al 2015 are the same for monthly and daily time scales but it is commonly recognized that increasing temporal simulation resolution from monthly to daily scale often leads to poorer performance therefore the model performance of daily streamflow simulation in the arb could be considered as good the comparison results of simulated and observed daily streamflow for two hydrometric stations in upper arb suggest that the coupled model captured the temporal variability of observed streamflow for both stations fig 3a and b however there were some underestimations for peak flow particularly for the validation period of the hinton station in downstream since most of the peak flow at jasper station in the mid reach was well represented the underestimations of peak flow in downstream are likely not caused by the glacier melt model also previous studies have shown that it is not uncommon for swat and other hydrological models to underestimate peak flow hoang et al 2019 eum et al 2017 morales marín et al 2019a due to uncertainties from input climate data especially for precipitation and temperature in mountainous regions zarehmehrjardy et al 2020 du et al 2020b the sensitivity ranking and calibrated results of hydrological parameters in the two stations of arb show that precipitation lapse rate and the channel manning s n value were the two most sensitive parameters at both stations table 3 moreover the air temperature lapse rate was one of the sensitive parameters for upper arb which ranks fourth and third for jasper and hinton station respectively the large elevation ranges 960 3645 m present in the upper arb explain the sensitivity of these two lapse rates it also indicates precipitation and air temperature varied significantly in this mountainous headwater region and the density of meteorological stations is important for hydrological modelling in the mountainous watershed this is in agreement with previous work citing the large degree of spatiotemporal uncertainty in the mountainous watersheds of western canada as compared to watersheds in the foothills and plain due to climate data scarcity zarehmehrjardy et al 2020 it s worth menthioning that the temperature lapse rate is usually negative as the air temperature decreases with the increase of the elevation while the positive temperature lapse rate with altitude may be possible over short altitudinal ranges in specific topographic conditions the positive temperature lapse rate in the downstream of the upper arb may reflect the uncertainty of observed air temperature and the correlation of different model parameters may also result in the positive lapse rate the channel manning s n value was the most sensitive parameter because it affects the channel routing process and thus the daily hydrograph moreover the surface runoff lag coefficient for landscape routing in sub basins was also a very sensitive parameter however these two routing parameters were not sensitive in a previous study conducted for hydrological modeling in the athabasca river basin using the swat model shrestha et al 2017 this is because their model was calibrated using the monthly flow it indicates that routing parameters and processes are important for controlling daily hydrograph which should be included when calibrating the swat model at a daily time scale the other sensitive hydrology parameters in this study include the parameter for surface runoff yield cn2 snowmelt smtmp and soil water dynamics sol k as indicated in table 3 comparison of periodic simulated and observed stream temperatures indicates that the coupled model has an overall good performance for simulating daily stream temperatures of different magnitudes fig 4 a and could capture the monthly and seasonal variations of the observations fig 4b table 4 shows the model performance statistics for daily stream temperature at athabasca river at the old entrance town site left bank station which is close to the hinton hydrometric station for different simulation periods the pbias values are less than 5 and the r2 and nse values are greater than 0 85 we used the evaluation criteria for streamflow modeling suggested by moriasi et al 2015 as a reference to qualitatively assess the stream temperature simulation performance since there is no evaluation criterion for stream temperature modeling the model statistics values shown in table 4 are all assessed as very good for different simulation periods based on three different performance statistics furthermore we also compared the stream temperature simulation performance to other studies using processed based stream temperature models at a watershed scale morales marín et al 2019a morales marín et al 2019b yearsley 2012 cao et al 2016 which further demonstrated that the coupled model had a very good performance for simulating stream temperature in upper arb table 5 shows the stream temperature parameters for upper arb with sensitivity ranking and calibrated values there are five calibrated parameters for the swat etm model and four of them were identified as sensitive based on the global parameter sensitivity analysis the most sensitive parameter is the additive parameter for the water air heat transfer process another heat transfer related parameter λmkt ranks third in the sensitivity ranking with p value close to 0 it indicates the heat transfer process at the water air interface is important in governing the stream temperature dynamics in the upper arb the other two sensitive parameters are the daily air temperature lag and runoff mixing coefficient which reflect the importance of the impacts of hydrological processes on stream temperature in the upper arb our previous study for stream temperature modeling in the elbow river watershed in southern alberta western canada also showed that runoff composition and hydrological processes play significant roles in controlling stream temperature dynamics du et al 2020a a mixing model was used in swat etm to represent different runoff components with different temperature signatures and glacier melt runoff was incorporated based on a temperature index model in this study hence the model reflects the impacts of total runoff composition on stream temperature the stream water depth dynamics are also considered for heat transfer processes in the model reflecting streamflow volume impacts in addition the 95 predictive uncertainty 95ppu band for stream temperature was shown in fig 5 the p factor of the 95ppu band was 0 50 indicating 50 of the measured data was bracketed by the uncertainty band the r factor for stream temperature uncertainty was 0 70 in this study and a r factor less than 1 0 indicates a model has an acceptable prediction uncertainty estimation according to abbaspour et al 2007b 3 2 impacts of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation to investigate the impacts of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature modeling we compared swat etm model simulation results with and without coupling the melt runoff model for different regions of the upper arb based on the calibrated model we present our results for upper middle and downstream outlets of the study area the selected sub basin in the upstream is fed by athabasca glacier with 14 of its area covered by glaciers the jasper and hinton stations were selected to represent the mid reach and downstream parts of the study watershed fig 1 the 7 day moving average of simulated streamflow in different regions of upper arb with and without coupling the glacier melt model suggests that more realistic elevated streamflow simulation during the glacier melt season may to october was obtained by the coupled model compared with the original swat model fig 6 on average glacier melt runoff during melt season accounted for 61 6 43 1 and 34 4 of the total flow in this season for the headwater mid reach and downstream sub basins respectively it indicates that glacier melt runoff is an important water source in the upper arb and the changes in glacier melt runoff would substantially affect the water availability in the region therefore streamflow during the melt season is likely to be underestimated if glacier melt runoff processes are not considered in watershed hydrological modeling previous studies have shown that the hydrological model without coupling glacier melt processes could achieve acceptable streamflow simulations however this model success results in unrealistic calibrated parameter values see for example vaghefi et al 2019 which brings about model uncertainties and unreliable representation of watershed hydrological processes in previous studies in the athabasca river basin different hydrological models such as swat and vic have been used for streamflow modeling shrestha et al 2017 eum et al 2017 although these two studies achieved relatively good performances for streamflow simulation hinton station in the upper arb the glacier melt runoff processes were not considered which led to uncertainties for the representation of hydrological processes in addition the impacts of future climate change on water quantity and flow regime predicted in these studies ignored the contributions from glacier melt which could lead to significant uncertainties in climate change impact projections moore et al 2009 stahl et al 2008 this was also pointed out in earlier studies as the absence of glacier melt processes in the vic hydrological model was a possible reason for the underestimation of peak flow eum et al 2017 therefore glacier melt runoff processes should be explicitly considered and simulated for hydrological modeling and projections in the glacierized watersheds the annual average stream temperatures simulated by the coupled model during melt season in headwater mid reach and downstream sub basins were 1 4 1 1 and 1 0 c lower than those simulated by swat etm without coupling the glacier processes this indicates that the coupled model successfully represents the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature as demonstrated by previous empirical studies based on stream temperature monitoring slemmons et al 2013 williamson et al 2019 another reason for the lower stream temperature simulated by the coupled model during the melt season is that coupling the glacier melt model results in a greater streamflow simulation that decreases the stream temperature this reflects the inverse relationship between streamflow and stream temperature because of the positive relationship between thermal capacity and streamflow volume webb et al 2003 van vliet et al 2013 fig 7 also indicates that the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff gets weaker from headwater to downstream and our coupled model was able to represent the spatial variations of the cooling effects in the study watershed therefore the stream temperature during the melt season would be overestimated if the impacts of glacier melt runoff were not considered in addition accurate stream temperature simulation is the basis of the water quality modeling since stream temperature affects the in situ biogeochemical reactions and transformation rates du et al 2018 punzet et al 2012 the original swat model uses a linear equation based on air temperature to simulate stream temperature with fixed coefficients neitsch et al 2011 which can cause remarkable uncertainties in stream temperature and water quality modeling the swat etm model coupled with the glacier melt model is able to reflect the impacts of different runoff components including surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow snowmelt and glacier melt runoff and it provides an effective and comprehensive basis for watershed stream temperature and water quality modeling to explore the factors affecting the stream temperature regimes in the arb we also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing melt runoff and air temperature by 10 based on the calibrated coupled model the results showed that when air temperature increases by 10 stream temperature would increase by 0 24 0 41 and 0 57 for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions respectively however stream temperature would decrease by 0 20 0 36 and 0 53 respectively for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions when air temperature decreases by 10 in addition stream temperature would decrease by 0 02 0 04 and 0 05 for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions respectively when melt runoff increases by 10 however stream temperature would increase by 0 03 0 04 and 0 05 for the headwater mid reach and downstream regions respectively when melt runoff decreases by 10 the sensitivity analysis indicated that air temperature has more impact on stream temperature since it directly affects the heat transfer intensity and water yield however our results presented in the previous two paragraphs also indicated that the model would substantially underestimate streamflow and overestimate stream temperature if the impacts of glacier melt processes were not included in the model in addition the hydrological and hydromorphometrical variables such as surface runoff and channel water depth also substantially the stream temperature regimes previous studies showed that water depth has an inverse relationship with stream temperature and a change for water depth by 50 would change the stream temperature by about 0 3 du et al 2018 moreover snowmelt runoff in the cold region watershed has a similar impact on stream temperature as surface runoff despite the fact that snowmelt runoff is smaller in volume compared to surface runoff du et al 2020a 3 3 the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature in a changing climate in this study we combined air temperature increase and glacier melt runoff changes to conduct scenario analysis for the changes of stream temperature regime in upstream mid reach and downstream of upper arb previous studies showed that mean air temperature was projected to increase by 2 3 in the near future and 2 5 5 4 in the distant future in the arb shrestha et al 2017 hence we used two air temperature increase scenarios as 2 and 4 for near and distant future respectively previous studies for predicting climate change impacts on glacier melt runoff showed that the glacier area would shrink in the future mainly caused by the air temperature increase and glacier melt runoff will first increase because of faster melt rate and then decrease due to the shrink of glacier source area bliss et al 2014 gan et al 2015 therefore a 2 c increase in air temperature and a 20 increase in glacier melt runoff because of faster melt rate were used for the scenario in the near future in addition a 4 c increase in air temperature and a 20 decrease in glacier melt runoff due to glacier sources reduction were used for the scenario analysis in the distant future fig 8 shows the 7 day moving average of stream temperature in the near future under climate change scenarios for different regions in upper arb it indicates that an increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would off set the stream temperature increase caused by the rising air temperature this is because the increase in glacier melt runoff elevates the cooling effect and thermal capacity due to increasing streamflow the alleviating effect is more evident in the headwater than in the mid reach and downstream region and it could attenuate the increasing peak stream temperatures in summer caused by the rising air temperature a 2 c air temperature increase in the headwater would increase the average and peak temperature during melt season by 0 8 and 1 3 c in contrast a 20 increase in glacier melt runoff would alleviate the increase in average and peak stream temperatures by 0 14 and 0 13 c in the headwater fig 9 shows the 7 day moving average of stream temperature in the distant future under climate change scenarios for different regions in upper arb it suggests that a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would aggravate the increase of stream temperature in summer due to the rising air temperature especially for the headwater region a 4 c air temperature increase in the headwater region would increase the average and peak temperature during melt season by 1 9 and 2 8 c in comparison a 20 decrease in glacier melt runoff would aggravate the increase in average and peak stream temperature by 0 21 and 0 49 c in the headwater a previous study showed that the increase of peak stream temperature in summer could threaten the life of fish species because the fish would begin to die once the stream temperature exceeds the upper tolerance temperatures gutierre et al 2016 therefore the impacts of glacier melt on stream temperature should be considered when predicting climate change impact on stream temperature regime in the glacierized watershed in the cold region in addition the changes in glacier melt runoff could also affect in stream water quality dynamics by affecting biogeochemical reaction rates and some water quality indicators e g dissolved oxygen for example there is an inverse relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen and the projected increase in stream temperature in the distant future caused by rising air temperature as well as the projected declining glacier melt runoff could lead to the decrease of in stream dissolved oxygen which can be harmful for aquatic species ficklin et al 2013 du et al 2019 3 4 limitations and future studies a temperature index based model with elevation bands was used to simulate glacier melt runoff and it was coupled with the swat etm model for stream temperature modeling assessment and projection of the effect of glacier changes on the hydrological regime of the glacierized basins demand a comprehensive simulation of glacier mass balance melt and the evolution considering their interactions and feedbacks over time and space naz et al 2014 clarke et al 2015 assessment of glacier dynamics is based on a wide range of approaches from simple volume area v a scaling approach bliss et al 2014 to a more robust numerical 3 d ice flow simulation methods zekollari et al 2019 our study has opted for the v a approach due to data scarcity at a large scale while robust simulation approaches are subject to a lack of high resolution measurements especially at large regional scales the availability of such data would have reduced the uncertainty in our melt modeling for future projections moreover a simple scenario analysis was used to investigate the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature in a changing climate climate projections from different general or regional circulation models hawkins and sutton 2009 could be fed into the glacier mass model and swat etm model in a future study to provide more comprehensive predictions for future stream temperature regimes in the upper arb this study used a two step calibration process since the glacier melt model was loosely coupled with the swat etm model the best simulation from parameter calibration of the glacier melt model was used as the input of the swat etm model which has limited the parameter equifinality issue to some extent for coupling the melt model and swta etm model however there is still parameter equifinality for the model coupling framework since three different variables melt runoff streamflow and stream temperature are modeled with lots of different parameters in addition to affecting in stream reaction rates by impacting stream temperature the glacier melt runoff also affects the in stream water quality by exporting pollution loadings from the landscape to the streams this is because glaciers act as a legacy storage tank for the chemicals e g nitrogen dissolved organic matter and pesticides from atmosphere deposition slemmons et al 2013 these deposited chemicals could potentially be washed off and transported by the glacier melt runoff therefore a water quality module for glacier should be developed and incorporated into watershed models for water quality simulation and their future projections in the glacierized watersheds 4 conclusion in order to investigate the impacts of glacier melt on stream temperatures a temperature index glacier melt runoff model was coupled with a swat equilibrium temperature model to reflect the impacts of glacier melt processes on stream temperature the coupled model was used to simulate daily streamflow and stream temperature in the upper athabasca river basin the daily streamflow and periodic daily stream temperature were well simulated according to the model performance measures and visual comparisons based on the calibrated model the impacts of glacier melt runoff on streamflow and stream temperature simulation were investigated with and without coupling the melt model with swat the impacts from glacier melt were successfully represented in the coupled model by simulating higher streamflow and lower stream temperature during the melt season the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff on stream temperature showed a decreasing trend from headwater to downstream since the glaciers concentrate in the upstream the role of glacier melt runoff affecting stream temperature under climate change was analyzed by combing air temperature and glacier melt runoff changes to conduct scenario analysis due to the cooling effect of glacier melt runoff the increase in glacier melt runoff in the near future would alleviate the average and peak stream temperature increase during the melt season while a decrease in glacier melt runoff in the distant future would aggravate the stream temperature increase therefore the impact of glacier melt runoff should be explicitly considered to accurately model stream temperature and predict future climate

3712,transport effectiveness te of a discharge is defined as the product of the frequency of discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate maximization of te function helps in finding the effective discharge qe which is responsible for the transfer of the majority of sediments over a prolonged period this approach to determine qe is famously known as magnitude frequency analysis mfa conventionally mfa involves the construction of the te function by assuming i a location specific probability density function pdf for discharge and ii power law relationship between discharge and sediment transport rate there have been attempts in the past to derive expressions for qe by assuming positively skewed pdfs for discharge the present study proposes a modified approach to estimate te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets which alleviates the limitation of assuming a location specific pdf the approach involves the transformation of discharge data through box cox transformation and subsequently performing mfa to determine qe an expression for the analytical solution of te based qe is derived for the proposed framework of mfa the robustness of the approach is established through a simulation study by generating discharge data using lognormal gamma and log pearson type iii distributions in this study the influence of the hysteresis effect was investigated for total as well as seasonal datasets according to the considerations of the rising and falling stages for 14 stream gauges in south indian rivers the analysis is performed by using the suspended sediment load and discharge data whereas the bedload has been excluded subsequently the estimates of qe based on the proposed approach q e pa were computed considering various sediment rating curves fitted for total seasonal stage and season stage based datasets finally the variation of q e pa with various catchment descriptors was examined keywords transport effectiveness effective discharge magnitude frequency analysis box cox transformation south indian rivers hysteresis 1 introduction excessive sediment transport has many adverse implications for the environment and mankind they include i deterioration of the quality of surface water resources ii unstable river channels i e change of course of the river iii reduced design life of reservoirs and dams singh et al 2005 auel and boes 2011 kondolf et al 2014 schleiss et al 2016 many researchers in the past have investigated the interaction between flood events and corresponding sediment transport for various river basins across the globe e g wolman and miller 1960 nash 1994 sichingabula 1999 lenzi et al 2006 ma et al 2010 wolman and miller 1960 pioneered the work related to the assessment of sediment transport during flood events the flood event transferring most of the sediments was referred to as a dominant discharge wolman and miller 1960 benson and thomas 1966 later andrews 1980 was the first to describe this dominant discharge as effective discharge which is a discharge responsible for transportation of most of the sediment load through the river network over a long period effective discharge qe can be useful for modelling long term sediment loads water quality parameters ecological processes and landscape evolution rates and patterns e g sichingabula 1999 doyle et al 2005 doyle and shields 2008 many researchers have shown a consistent correspondence between qe and bank full discharge in rivers e g wolman and miller 1960 andrews 1980 torizzo and pitlick 2004 magnitude frequency analysis mfa provides a mathematical framework to determine qe e g nash 1994 biedenharn and thorne 1994 sichingabula 1999 torizzo and pitlick 2004 roy and sinha 2014 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 in mfa the transport effectiveness te function of discharge i e flood is constructed by taking a product of its probability density function pdf and corresponding sediment transport rate finally the estimate of qe at a location can be determined by maximizing the te function with respect to discharge at that location it has been observed that the recurrence interval of qe tends to range from a few days to a couple of years e g wolman and miller 1960 benson and thomas 1966 andrews 1980 nash 1994 sichingabula 1999 emmett and wolman 2001 vogel et al 2003 introduced the concept of half load discharge which is the discharge responsible for the transfer of half of the long term sediment load doyle and shields 2008 developed an alternative discharge metric i e functional equivalent discharge qfed as a representative constant discharge that transports the same long term sediment load generated by the complete frequency distribution of discharge later basso et al 2015 studied the diversity of qfed with reference to the underlying heterogeneity of flow regimes by linking the functional equivalent ratio i e the ratio between qfed and mean discharge to the empirical exponent of sediment power law relationship and discharge variability resulting from climatic and landscape drivers from the indian context the literature review suggests that very few attempts were made to perform mfa for indian rivers roy and sinha 2014 carried out a study on the ganga river where they computed te based qe for suspended sediment transport at a monthly timescale zakwan et al 2018 also calculated the qe for suspended sediment transport at 15 stations on the ganga river using a mean and rating curve approach recently maheshwari and chavan 2019 demonstrated the utility of mfa to arrive at qe estimates based on daily and monthly discharge data at 30 gauges in four major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery basins flowing through the indian peninsular region the estimates of qe based on mfa can be sensitive to the location specific variability in the probability distribution of river discharge and the complexity in sediment transport dynamics due to the presence of the hysteresis effect further few past studies also examined the dependence between the estimates of qe on the hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers 1 1 influence of location specific variability in the probability distribution on te based qe conventionally mfa involves the construction of te function by assuming log normally distributed discharge data e g wolman and miller 1960 nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 past research has shown that the assumption of log normally distributed discharge data is generally not valid for most of the cases e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 researchers have found that other positively skewed continuous probability distributions might be useful for fitting daily discharge data in mfa e g nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 goodwin 2004 archfield et al 2007 quader et al 2008 segura and pitlick 2010 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 goodwin 2004 found that the qe estimate is sensitive to the frequency distribution of discharge data he considered various continuous frequency distributions such as normal n lognormal ln gamma g pearson type iii p3 and log pearson type iii lp3 to determine analytical solutions for te based qe for red river and russian river in the usa the study revealed that the discharge data predominantly follow either ln or g distribution quader et al 2008 found that for 25 small southern ontario streams drainage area ranging from 0 58 km2 to 1550 km2 a mixed exponential distribution model provides the most reliable estimates of qe when the exponent of sediment rating curve is less than 2 and for higher values of the exponent i e greater than 2 a g distribution based model was found to be the most suitable further klonsky and vogel 2011 used kernel density estimator kde for fitting discharge data recorded at 15 u s geological survey sampling locations to alleviate the dependence of mfa on the approximation of the probability distribution of discharge data however they found that the construction of te function from kde based pdf and sediment transport rate led to jagged te function whenever there is high variability in discharge cvd and sediment load cvs i e high values of coefficient of variation of discharge and sediment load jagged te function results in subjective and questionable estimates of qe the discussion above signifies the need to alleviate the limitation regarding the use of location specific probability distribution of discharge in conventional te based qe 1 2 influence of hysteresis effect due to the complex dynamics of sediment transport on te based qe the mechanism of sediment transport through natural rivers has been observed to get influenced by the unsteady discharges which are responsible for the cause of the hysteresis effect e g heidel 1956 arnborg et al 1967 axelsson 1967 walling 1974 kung and chiang 1977 wood 1977 brownlie 1981 vansickle and beschta 1983 shi et al 1985 hassan and church 2000 quader and guo 2009 gunsolus and binns 2017 juez et al 2018 plumb et al 2019 in the case of natural rivers the hysteretic behaviour observed during a hydrological event can be witnessed in the form of alterations in the sediment rating curve due to a lag in time between the peak discharge of a hydrograph and the peak rate of sediment transport of the corresponding sedimentograph williams 1989 classified the hysteresis effect based on sediment concentration c discharge q relationship as class i single valued line class ii clockwise loop class iii counterclockwise or anticlockwise loop class iv single valued line plus loop and class v figure eight a detailed discussion about the classification of the hysteresis effect is provided in table s1 of the supplementary material researchers have noted the fluctuations in the sediment rating curve i e c q relationship resulting from the hysteresis effect due to seasonal variation in the sediment carrying capacity of the discharge in the case of rivers fed by ice fields e g nordin 1985 hickin 1989 syvitski and alcott 1995 syvitski et al 2000 singh et al 2005 walling 1977 attempted to study the influence of the seasonal hysteresis determined based on rising and falling stages of discharges on the scatter of rating curve data for the creedy river in england it was observed that grouping the rating curve data according to seasonal variation and stage tendency resulted in reliable rating relations following walling 1977 nash 1994 examined the presence of seasonal hysteresis in sediment transport through 55 us rivers goswami 1985 found hysteresis in the relation between daily discharge and sediment concentration at pandu and ranaghat in the brahmaputra river he found that the repetitive pattern of the rise and fall of discharge and sediment load in the river is associated with the seasonal pattern of monsoonal precipitation and the freeze thaw cycle of himalayan snows sichingabula 1999 explored the effects of hysteresis on the estimation of qe due to the stage tendency alone however there is a dearth of attempts to study the effect of hysteresis on qe due to both seasonal variation and stage tendency in the sediment rating relationship 1 3 influence of hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers on te based qe the estimates of qe has been observed to get influenced by the hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers i e catchment descriptors as these characteristics tend to govern landscape evolution rates and patterns ecological processes water quality parameters and long term sediment loads e g sichingabula 1999 ali and de boer 2007 klonsky and vogel 2011 roy and sinha 2014 sichingabula 1999 related class based qe to the drainage area of the catchment with a very high coefficient of determination r2 0 99 further klonsky and vogel 2011 found a marginal correlation between qe and drainage area for 15 catchments in the united states us ali and de boer 2007 observed that the slope is inversely proportional to the magnitude of qe for the transport of sediments in natural catchments discharge magnitude i e the applied stress must exceed a threshold i e critical stress value wolman and miller 1960 thus higher discharge magnitudes are required to transport suspended sediments in larger catchments high slopes of headwater catchments i e upstream catchments facilitate the transfer of sediments which assist in carrying a considerable amount of sediments over time with a lesser magnitude of discharge e g syvitski et al 2000 ali and de boer 2007 the influence of hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers on te based qe has not been explored for indian catchments 1 4 study goals in this paper we aim to propose a modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets which involves transforming the discharge data by using one parameter box cox transformation e g box and cox 1964 an analytical expression for te based qe under the framework of the proposed approach is derived in this paper the robustness of the approach is established through a simulation study by generating discharge data from various distributions considered in mfa furthermore the proposed approach is applied to estimate qe for 14 catchments in 4 major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery we also study the influence of the hysteresis effect due to seasonal variation and stage tendency in the sediment rating curve on qe finally we examine the dependence between qe and various catchment descriptors 2 background on approaches to te based qe magnitude frequency analysis mfa provides a mathematical framework to determine qe by maximizing te function te of a given discharge q is the product of the frequency of discharge f q and corresponding sediment transport rate s in general q is assumed to follow lognormal ln distribution whereas s corresponding to q exhibits a power law relationship with q q q represents the random variable for daily discharge and q denotes the values taken by q 1 s a q b where a and b are the parameters i e coefficient and exponent of the power law relationship nash 1994 assumed log normally distributed discharge data having a probability density function as 2 f ln q 1 β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 where ln q is the log transformed discharge α and β are the mean and standard deviation of the log transformed discharge respectively the expression eq 3 for the te function can be obtained by taking the product of eqs 1 and 2 3 te a q b β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 nash 1994 derived qe by maximizing the te function with respect to q q the equation for qe is shown in eq 4 4 q e exp b β 2 α later goodwin 2004 derived analytical solutions for te based qe by considering various continuous probability distributions e g normal lognormal gamma pearson and log pearson type iii distribution to fit the discharge data details about the expressions for probability density function pdf te function and qe can be found in goodwin 2004 later klonsky and vogel 2011 introduced a non parametric approach to determine te based qe based on a kernel density function they assumed the gaussian kernel with a fixed width smoothing parameter h i e bandwidth to describe the frequency distribution of discharge data at 15 us geological survey sites however they found that the presence of high values of the coefficient of variations of discharge data cvd and coefficient of variation of sediment loads cvs caused the jagged te function the jagged te function makes it difficult to determine a reliable estimate of qe further details can be found in klonsky and vogel 2011 3 modified approach to te based qe in this paper we aim to propose a modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets the approach utilizes one parameter box cox transformation e g box and cox 1964 to transform the observed discharge data in order to achieve discharge normalization and variance stabilization this kind of strategy has been found effective in many applications in the field of hydrology e g chander et al 1978 kuczera 1983 jain and singh 1986 bates and campbell 2001 thyer et al 2002 yang et al 2007 engeland et al 2010 wang et al 2012 in the present study the box cox transformation strategy is used to derive an analytical expression for te based qe the steps involved in the proposed approach pa to determine te based qe are as follows 1 define λmin and λmax respectively as the lower and the upper bound for a power function parameter λj for box cox transformation of raw discharge data where j 1 2 m in this study λmin and λmax were chosen as 1 and 1 respectively and the increment for the iteration was chosen to be 0 0001 here j ranges from 1 to m 20 000 2 initialize λj λmin and use it to transform the discharge data 3 the transformed data vector pj corresponding to λj can be obtained using eq 5 5 p j q i λ j 1 λ j i f λ j 0 ln q i i f λ j 0 f o r i 1 n where the subscript i denotes ith discharge data and n represents the total length of data 4 pj can be assumed to follow a normal n distribution construct a log likelihood function lj for each λj value based on eq 6 6 l j α p β p 2 λ j n 2 ln 2 π n 2 ln β p 2 1 2 i 1 n q λ j 1 λ j α p 2 β p 2 where αp and βp are the mean and standard deviation of pj the procedure to determine lj value corresponding to λj and parameters αp and βp is provided in appendix a 5 if j m then increment j j 1 and repeat steps 3 to 4 to obtain lj value if j m then proceed to step 6 6 construct the profile of lj with respect to λj determine optimal power function parameter λopt from all λj for which lj attains maximum value 7 transform raw discharge data to a data vector p by considering λopt as given by eq 7 7 p q i λ opt 1 λ opt i f λ opt 0 ln q i i f λ opt 0 f o r i 1 n 8 p can be assumed to have normal

p 2 2 1 λ opt 4 evaluation of the modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets prerequisite to the application of the modified approach to te based qe on the real world catchments its effectiveness was evaluated through a monte carlo simulation experiment for the simulation of daily discharge and corresponding suspended sediment transport rate the parameters were adopted from table s2 of the supplementary material given by nash 1994 which provides information on 55 u s rivers generation of daily discharge data was carried out by assuming that the discharges exhibit various probability distribution functions based on the recommendations from past research u s water resources council 1981 kuczera 1982 nash 1994 goodwin 2004 sholtes et al 2014 etc lognormal ln gamma g and log pearson type iii lp3 distributions were chosen for generation of daily discharge data details on the generation of data are provided in section s 1 in the supplementary material the expressions for probability density function pdf for ln g and lp3 distributions are provided in table s3 of the supplementary material preliminary assessment of the generated data revealed the necessity to exclude some rivers from the analysis to avoid unrealistic estimates of data characteristics such as coefficient of variation of sediment data cvs and kurtosis kd of log transformed discharge data sub scripts s and d stand for sediment and discharge respectively this was necessary to achieve the standard river conditions for the simulation experiment e g syvitski et al 2000 sholtes et al 2014 thresholds for the upper limit of cvs and kd were fixed as 10 and 6 respectively for the exclusion of rivers from the simulation experiment following some previous studies e g nash 1994 klonsky and vogel 2011 roy and sinha 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 we have adopted 28 9 and 9 rivers out of 55 u s rivers for ln g and lp3 distribution based simulation experiments subsequently the evaluation of the modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets was performed a flow diagram to summarize the methodological steps in the evaluation is provided in fig 1 4 1 performance assessment of the modified approach to te based qe the performance assessment of the modified approach to te based qe with respect to the conventional approaches i e ln g lp3 and kde based mfa is demonstrated in the following subsections 4 1 1 4 1 2 and 4 1 3 the subsections represent 3 different cases when the discharge data is generated using ln g and lp3 distributions 4 1 1 case 1 when discharge data follow the lognormal distribution for each of the 28 rivers pdfs for generated discharge data having sample sizes of 10 000 15 000 and 20 000 were determined using ln g lp3 distributions as well as non parametric kde based mfa for brevity fig 2 a shows the histogram of generated discharge data for the case of the sample size of 15000 along with fitted pdfs from ln g lp3 distributions and kde pertaining to river id 3 from nash 1994 the figure illustrates that the discharge data shows an adequate fit with ln distribution which is obvious as the data was generated by assuming ln distribution and kde except for g distribution the fitted density functions are compared with the histograms of generated discharge data by using error measures such as percent absolute relative bias ar bias and root mean square error rmse the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for all 28 rivers were found to be 11 07 29 27 10 57 and 136 51 329 10 129 36 for ln g kde based pdfs as the discharge data were log normally distributed i e γ s tends to zero lp3 distribution was approximated as ln distribution histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 27 rivers are provided in fig s1 of the supplementary material later te functions were constructed for each of the rivers based on conventional te based mfa approaches for brevity fig 3 a 3b and 3c present the pdfs and te functions for river id 3 considering ln g and kde based mfa respectively the figures illustrate that the g distribution based te function attains a maximum for higher discharges than the te function for other distributions ln and lp3 the difference in te function was due to the difference in pdfs for g and other distributions for the remaining 27 rivers pdfs and te functions are provided in fig s2 of supplementary material furthermore the jagged nature of the te function can be observed for the kde based approach although kde was able to fit discharge data adequately higher cvs results in the construction of the jagged te functions which is due to the sharp drops in the fitted pdfs subsequently estimates of qe were computed using analytical solutions for ln g and lp3 based mfa following goodwin 2004 in addition qe for kde based mfa was computed following klonsky and vogel 2011 estimates of qe obtained from ln g lp3 and kde based mfa are represented as q e ln q e g q e l p 3 and q e kde respectively and are tabulated in table s4 of the supplementary material in the case of the proposed approach pa initially the discharge data was transformed using box cox transformation for various values of the power function parameter λj following steps 1 to 3 of section 3 then an optimal power function parameter λopt for which the log likelihood function lj attains a maximum value was determined based on steps 4 to 6 of section 3 profiles of lj verses λj for all 28 rivers are shown in fig s3 of supplementary material it can be noted from the figures that the parameter λopt is close to zero as the data was generated assuming log transformation which is a special case of box cox transformation for λ 0 refer eq 5 λ opt 0 is also evident from table s4 in the supplementary material later the discharge data were transformed to a data vector p by parameter λopt following step 7 of section 3 the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for the fitted density functions in the case of pa were close to ln distribution i e 11 12 and 137 01 respectively which was used for data generation see fig 2a subsequently the te function was constructed based on the frequency distribution of q eq 9 and the power law relationship between q and s as given by eq 1 refer to steps 8 and 9 of section 3 it can also be noted that pdf and te for pa look similar to those obtained for the ln case see fig 3a and 3d for river id 3 similar findings were observed for the remaining 27 rivers from figs s2a and s2d of supplementary material finally the qe based on the proposed approach q e pa was determined using eq 11 described in step 10 of section 3 for each of the rivers estimates of q e pa are provided in table s4 in supplementary material corresponding to data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 performance of pa to mfa with respect to the conventional approaches i e ln g lp3 and kde based mfa was assessed based on performance measure percent absolute relative bias ar bias as given by eq 12 12 ar b i a s a q e assumed p d f q e a q e assumed p d f 100 where q e assumed p d f and q e a denote qe estimate obtained based on the analytical solutions pertaining to the assumed probability distribution function based mfa i e ln based mfa in this case and an approach a respectively ar bias a is the ar bias for a where a stands for ln or g or lp3 or kde or pa based mfa in this case table s4 of the supplementary material shows the ar bias in estimates for each of the approaches corresponding to various data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 the average ar bias g was found to be 169 38 186 04 and 175 55 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively higher ar bias g was due to an inadequate fit of pdf to the discharge data further it can be noted that the ar bias g tends to increase as the coefficient of variation of discharge cvd and cvs increase refer to table s4 in supplementary material higher values of cvd and cvs can affect the magnitude and frequency of sediment transport e g klonsky and vogel 2011 sholtes et al 2014 thus g based mfa yielded unreliable estimates of qe for lp3 based mfa the average ar bias lp3 in for 28 rivers was observed as 0 49 0 50 and 0 34 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20 000 respectively ar bias lp3 estimates are less as the skewness of log transformed data is close to 0 for which lp3 distribution can be assumed to be ln distribution in the case of kde based mfa the average ar bias kde in was found to be 4005 04 6239 17 and 6678 53 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively although kde was able to fit discharge data adequately higher cvd and cvs results in the construction of the jagged te function gaps in the constructed te functions due to sharp drops in the fitted pdf which leads to unrealistic estimates of qe for some of the rivers refer to table s4 in supplementary material for pa however the average ar bias pa in was found to be the least i e 0 48 0 50 and 0 34 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively this can be attributed to better fitting of normal distribution in transformed space and subsequent construction of te function without any limitation that is mentioned above in the case of conventional approaches in order to visualize the distribution of ar bias in for each of the approaches considering all 28 rivers corresponding to data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 box plots were prepared for ar bias in as illustrated in fig 4 a it can be observed from the figure that the spread of ar bias pa and ar bias lp3 is similar and less than 1 however the spread of ar bias g and ar bias kde is high there is a considerable variation in ar bias kde which denotes unreliable estimates of qe to summarize the pa has arguably yielded the most reliable estimates of qe as compared to the conventional approaches to mfa when the discharge data follow ln distribution 4 1 2 case 2 when discharge data follow gamma distribution for each of the 9 rivers pdfs for generated discharge data were fitted using ln g lp3 distributions and kde fig 2b illustrates the histograms along with fitted density functions it can be noted from the figure that the discharge data shows an adequate fit with g distribution which is obvious as the data was generated by assuming g distribution and kde except for ln distribution the lp3 distribution was unable to fit discharge data for all 9 rivers histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 8 rivers are provided in fig s4 of supplementary material fig 5 a 5b and 5c present the pdfs and te functions for river id 3 from nash 1994 considering ln distribution g distribution and kde the te function constructed based on ln distribution was found to be different than those constructed based on g distribution and kde the difference can be attributed to the difference in fitted pdfs figs 2b and 5a the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for all 9 rivers were found to be 5 31 0 40 0 54 and 70 29 12 74 9 61 for ln g kde based pdfs it can be seen from fig 5c that the te function constructed based on kde exhibits jagged nature for the remaining 8 rivers pdfs and te functions are provided in fig s5 of supplementary material subsequently estimates of qe were determined considering ln g lp3 and kde based mfa table s5 of the supplementary material provides estimates of qe further pa was considered to determine qe estimates for 9 rivers by following the procedure described in section 3 profiles of lj verses λj for all 9 rivers are shown in fig s6 of supplementary material it was observed that the parameter λopt was not close to zero fig 2b confirms a better fit of density function with the histogram of discharge data the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for the fitted density functions in the case of pa were close to g distribution i e 0 55 and 13 12 respectively it can also be noted that the fitted pdf for discharge data and subsequently constructed te function for pa and g based mfa look similar refer fig 5b and 5d for river id 3 similar findings were observed for the remaining 8 rivers from figs s5b and s5d in the supplementary material table s5 of the supplementary material shows the percent ar bias in qe obtained based on ln lp3 kde and pa based mfa with respect to the g based mfa for various data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 the average ar bias ln in was found to be 17 36 19 86 and 17 98 for data lengths of 10000 15 000 and 20000 respectively higher ar bias ln was obtained due to inadequate fit of pdf to the discharge data and it tends to increase as the kurtosis of discharge data increases for lp3 based mfa the average ar bias lp3 in for 9 rivers was observed as 348 39 410 05 and 189 94 pertaining to data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively ar bias lp3 estimates are high as lp3 distribution was unable to fit discharge data and they tend to increase as cvs and kd increase in the case of kde based mfa the average ar bias kde was found to be 12 64 20 25 and 10 19 for data lengths of 10000 15 000 and 20000 respectively it is interesting to observe that the average ar bias pa in for pa was found to be the least i e 3 61 3 89 and 3 68 for data lengths of 10000 15 000 and 20000 respectively low ar bias pa can be due to the better fit of the normal distribution to the discharge data in transformed space further fig 4b shows the box plots for percent ar bias it can be observed from the figure that the spread of ar bias ln and ar bias kde was nearly the same and less than 20 for all data lengths however the spread of ar bias lp3 was the highest and that of ar bias pa was the least to summarize pa was found to yield the least ar bias estimates in qe when the discharge data was assumed to follow the g distribution 4 1 3 case 3 when discharge data follows log pearson type iii distribution for each of the 9 rivers pdfs for discharge data were fitted using ln g lp3 distributions and kde fig 2c illustrates the histogram along with fitted density functions it can be noted from the figure that the discharge data shows an appropriate fit for ln lp3 and kde except for g distribution histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 8 rivers are provided in fig s7 of supplementary material the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for all 9 rivers were found to be 6 44 34 78 10 75 10 65 and 69 56 328 68 117 75 116 59 for ln g lp3 kde based pdfs fig 6 a 6b 6c and 6d show pdfs and te functions for river id 3 considering ln distribution g distribution lp3 distribution and kde the te function constructed based on g distribution was found to be different than those constructed based on others the difference can be attributed to the difference in fitted pdfs refer to figs 2c and 6b it can be seen from fig 6d that the te function constructed based on kde shows jagged behaviour the jagged behaviour was found for all the 9 rivers considered in this case for the remaining 8 rivers pdfs and te functions are provided in fig s8 of supplementary material subsequently estimates of qe were determined using ln g lp3 and kde based mfa refer to table s6 in supplementary material further pa was considered to determine qe estimates for all 9 rivers by following the procedure described in section 3 profiles of lj verses λj for all 9 rivers are shown in fig s9 of the supplementary material it was observed that the parameter λopt was not close to zero fig 2c shows a better fit of density function with the histogram of discharge data the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for the fitted density functions in the case of pa were close to lp3 distribution i e 10 84 and 117 04 respectively it can also be noted that the fitted pdf and constructed te function using pa and lp3 based mfa look similar fig 6c and 6e for river id 3 similar findings were observed for the remaining 8 rivers from figs s8c and s8e of supplementary material table s6 of the supplementary material shows the percent ar bias in qe for all 9 rivers obtained based on ln g kde and pa based mfa with respect to lp3 based mfa for various data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 the average ar bias ln in was found to be 9 40 9 39 and 9 77 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively it can be noted that ar bias ln tends to increase with the increase in γ s for g based mfa the average ar bias g was observed as 137 35 138 22 and 139 59 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively this is because the discharge data do not follow g distribution adequately and cvs of generated data is considerably high for all 9 rivers in the case of kde based mfa the average ar bias kde in was found to be very high i e 3208 70 3985 24 and 4277 63 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively due to a jagged te function due to high value of cvs in generated data however for the pa average ar bias pa in was found to be the least i e 2 12 2 21 and 2 16 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively due to better fit of the normal distribution to the discharge data in transformed space further fig 4c illustrates the box plots for percent ar bias it can be observed from the figure that the spread of ar bias pa is the lowest and ar bias kde is the highest to summarize pa was found to yield the least ar bias estimates when the discharge data was assumed to follow lp3 distribution 5 application of the proposed approach to south indian rivers in this section the application of the proposed approach pa to determine reliable estimates of effective discharge qe for 14 stream gauges in 4 major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery flowing through the indian peninsular region is demonstrated subsequently we studied the influence of the hysteresis effect due to the complex sediment transport dynamics on te based qe finally we explored the dependence between the estimates of qe on the hydrological and morphological characteristics of the south indian catchments 5 1 description of the study area and data used the locations of 14 stream gauges in 4 south indian rivers are shown in fig 7 the information about the rivers is presented in table s7 in the supplementary material in this paper the selection of the 14 stream gauges were based on the availability of continuous daily discharge and corresponding suspended sediment concentration data coarse medium and fine fractions for around or greater than 20 years similar criteria were considered by nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 and klonsky and vogel 2011 the catchment areas of the 14 gauges range from 3141 km2 to 67908 km2 the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data was downloaded from the water resources information system wris government of india https indiawris gov in wris the suspended sediment transport rate in tons per day was then computed from the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data the bed load which is a part of total sediment load i e suspended load plus bed load for the south indian rivers is insignificant e g vaithiyanathan et al 1988 ghose and swain 2011 the flow characteristics such as mean discharge coefficient of variation of discharge cvd coefficient of variation of sediment load cvs and mean α standard deviation β skewness γ s and kurtosis kd of log transformed discharge data for all the 14 stream gauges are presented in table 1 there are 4 climatological seasons in india designated by the india meteorological department imd namely winter january and february summer march april and may monsoon june july august and september and autumn october november and december attri and tyagi 2010 most of the catchments corresponding to 14 stream gauges receive rainfall during the southwest monsoon period i e monsoon season except for 5 catchments i e bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi musiri and savandapur these 5 catchments experience considerable rainfall during the northeast monsoon i e autumn season deshpande et al 2016 the sediment transport through the catchments is dependent on the distribution of rainfall during the seasons it can be seen from table 1 that a large percentage of sediment load transport in most of the catchments happen during the monsoon season except for the 5 catchments where considerable sediment load transport also occur during the autumn season additionally various catchment descriptors such as drainage area mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope in percentage rise which influence the surface run off and sediment yield are derived for all 14 catchments using arcgis framework by processing advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster digital elevation model dem data having 30 m resolution these descriptors for all 14 stram gauges are provided in table 2 5 2 estimation of te based qe for south indian catchments in this section estimates of qe were calculated considering the conventional approaches and the proposed approach pa for all the 14 stream gauges considering total discharge and sediment transport rate datasets firstly a 2 dimensional log log plot between discharge and sediment transport rate was constructed for each of the 14 gauges evidence of linear behaviour of the plots pertaining to 14 gauges confirms the validity existence of the power law relationship between the discharge and sediment transport rate refer to fig s10 in supplementary material information on the slope b intercept a and r2 value for the log log plots are provided in table 3 the exponent b ranges from 1 26 to 2 10 for all 14 gauges subsequently qe estimates were determined for all 14 gauges using the conventional and modified te based approaches see table 3 for brevity a histogram with the fitted density functions for gauge id 6 of south indian rivers is presented in fig 2d histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 13 stream gauges are provided in fig s11 of supplementary material fig s12 of the supplementary material illustrates the te functions for all 14 gauges based on various approaches figures depict the comparison of te functions based on conventional approaches ln g lp3 and kde based mfa and the proposed approach modified te based mfa the similarity in te functions results in close and similar estimates of qe based on different approaches further fig s13 of the supplementary material shows the profiles of lj versus λj for all 14 gauges which were utilized to determine λopt in the case of the proposed approach to facilitate the comparison between conventional te based mfa approaches with respect to the proposed approach ar bias in was used average ar bias ln and ar bias lp3 were 21 91 and 20 14 respectively while the average ar bias g was found to be 180 57 ar bias g tends to be higher than ar bias ln and ar bias lp3 due to the very high value of skewness greater than 3 5 and kurtosis greater than 19 of discharge data for all gauges for most of the gauges estimates of qe obtained using the ln lp3 based approach was found to be closer to those obtained using the proposed approach when the skewness of log transformed data was low high in the case of the kde based approach average ar bias kde was the highest i e 2465 67 in comparison to ln g and lp3 based mfa this is due to the jagged nature of the te function with the increase in the coefficient of variation of sediment load 5 3 investigation of hysteresis effect in south indian rivers in this section we investigated the presence of the hysteresis effect in sediment transport for all 14 catchments the hysteresis effect in the sediment rating curve is examined by considering i the total set of observations i e total dataset for discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate data and ii seasonal sets of observations i e seasonal datasets for discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate data in this study the presence of seasonal hysteresis is examined for monsoon season in the case of all 14 catchments and autumn season in the case of 5 catchments i e bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi musiri and savandapur that experience the northeast monsoon this is due to the reason that the majority of the sediment transport above 80 in south indian catchments is found to occur during monsoon and autumn seasons refer to table 1 firstly seasonal datasets containing the discharge and corresponding suspended sediment transport rate data from 2 seasons i e monsoon and autumn were prepared then the seasonal data sets were further subdivided according to the considerations of the rising and falling stages following walling 1977 and nash 1994 a rising stage is designated by a discharge recorded on a particular day when it exceeds the discharge recorded on the previous day at least by 0 5 m3 sec once all the discharges corresponding to the rising stage are identified the remaining discharges are designated as the discharges belonging to the falling stage subsequently sediment rating curves were constructed separately for rising and falling stages by considering total dataset and seasonal datasets i e monsoon and autumn season datasets if the rating curve for the rising stage is above below the rating curve for the falling stage then there exists a clockwise anticlockwise hysteresis it should be noted that the rising stage and falling stage based sediment rating curves were constructed for the total dataset and monsoon season dataset in the case of all 14 catchments refer to fig s14 in supplementary material additional rising stage and falling stage based sediment rating curves were constructed for 5 catchments i e bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi musiri and savandapur based on the autumn season dataset refer to fig s14 in supplementary material ten catchments i e ashti bamni basantpur bawapuram billigundulu huvinhedgi kodumudi pathagudem pauni and savandapur showed the presence of class v hysteresis figure eight i e anticlockwise loop clockwise loop in the relationship between discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate when the total dataset was considered refer to fig s14 in supplementary material for brevity fig 8 depicting the class v hysteresis for the catchment corresponding to the gauge id 6 i e billigundulu catchment is presented in the paper in the case of these 10 catchments anticlockwise hysteresis was observed at low discharges while clockwise hysteresis was noticed for high discharges when total datasets were analyzed low and high discharges were demarcated based on the intersection of the rating curves corresponding to the rising and falling stages this indicates that at high discharges the rate of increase in sediment load was greater than the rate of increase in discharge i e the sediment load peaked first while at low discharges the rate of increase in discharges was greater than the rate of increase in sediment load i e the discharge peaked first eight out of those 10 catchments showed the presence of class v hysteresis for monsoon season i e except basantpur and pauni catchments detailed discussion on the class of hysteresis and related explanations for all 14 catchments is provided in table s8 of the supplementary material the hysteresis effect can have an adverse impact on overall sediment transport in the catchments to investigate the influence of hysteresis effect on rating curve we considered 4 cases of fitting sediment rating curves for each catchment based on the use of i a single rating curve for the total dataset ii separate rating curves according to seasonal variation iii two rating curves defined according to stage tendency for the total dataset and iv four rating curves differentiated according to the seasonal variation and stage tendency walling 1977 the ar bias in estimates were determined for the 4 cases and are presented in table s9 of the supplementary material it can be observed that the average ar bias for case 1 a single rating curve for a total dataset was found to be the highest where a single rating curve was considered the average ar bias estimate was found to be the least in case 4 where rating curves were fitted according to seasonal variation and stage tendency followed by case 3 where two rating curves were defined according to stage tendency the rating curve for a catchment with gauge id 3 bamnidhi was found to exhibit a straight line which indicates class i means that there is no effect of hysteresis thus there is no improvement in the error when rating curves were constructed based on either seasonal variation or stage tendency or both in the case of the catchment with gauge id 9 konta an anticlockwise hysteresis in the lower range of discharges followed by a straight line for higher range discharges was observed due to the presence of a closed loop for lower discharge and the single straight line for higher discharges the error is less for all cases further clockwise hysteresis was observed at high discharges i e above some discharge threshold where a major improvement greater than 10 in the estimation of sediment load was obtained for case 4 i e ratings differentiated by season and stage for 6 catchments ashti bamni basantpur pathagudem pauni and savandapur while for remaining 6 catchments bawapuram billigundulu huvinhedgi kodumudi musiri nowrangpur minor improvements were observed for case 4 the minor improvement was due to the presence of the systematic divergence in sediment transport rates at high discharges which might be the influence of climatic and landscape controls on the sediment yields of the catchment walling 1977 nash 1994 nash 1994 also observed that most of the u s rivers were showing divergence in sediment transport rates at higher discharge rates rendering the ineffectiveness of the power function for extrapolation beyond some higher discharge threshold for gauge id 11 nowrangpur significant improvement was observed when the rating curves were constructed based on case 3 as compared to case 4 results indicated that the use of seasonally distinguished rating curves was unable to improve the load estimates for most of the catchments however the application of separate rating equations for rising and falling stages did result in significant improvement in the estimate thus it can be inferred from the analysis that the sediment rating curves based on either stage tendency case 3 or seasonal variation and stage tendency case 4 should be considered to minimize the influence of the hysteresis effect on sediment rating relations in magnitude frequency analysis nonetheless the great scattering of the collected suspended sediment data leads to a significant scatter in power law sediment discharge relation this might lead to uncertainty in the reliable estimation of effective discharge 5 4 estimation of te based qe by accounting for hysteresis effect in this section q e pa effective discharge based on the proposed approach was computed by considering the aforementioned 4 cases of fitting sediment rating curves for a catchment in this study q e pa were determined for all 9 subcases the subcases include total dataset based estimates i e t o t a l q e pa the total dataset with the stage rise and fall tendency based estimates i e r i s e q e pa and f a l l q e pa seasonal variation monsoon and autumn based estimates i e m o n q e pa and q e pa a u t and seasonal variation and stage tendency based estimates i e m o n r i s e q e pa m o n f a l l q e pa a u t r i s e q e pa and a u t f a l l q e pa the parameters i e coefficient a and exponent b of the power law relationship corresponding to 9 subcases are provided in table s10 of the supplementary material the estimates of q e pa for 9 subcases are presented in table 4 the estimates of q e pa were found to be sensitive to the value of b exponent of sediment power law relationship smaller variation in the value of b led to considerable change in the magnitude of q e pa for the catchments showing considerable hysteresis in sediment rating relationship the estimate of b was higher for rising stage based sediment rating curve than that for falling stage based rating curve thus the estimates of q e pa were higher for rising stage based datasets than those based on the falling stage the presence of clockwise hysteresis for the higher range of discharges indicates the transport of large amounts of sediments by the rising stage discharges as compared to falling stage discharges the selection of qe estimate for the 14 catchments given in table 4 could be made based on the case i e fitting sediment rating curves yielding the least ar bias error such estimates of effective discharges would be more reliable and representative of sediment transport dynamics within the catchments 5 5 variation of qe and its return period with the hydrological and morphological characteristics of south indian rivers variation of q e pa and its return period t pa with catchment descriptors such as drainage area mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope percentage rise was assessed for all 14 catchments scatter plots were prepared between catchment descriptors and 9 subcases of q e pa on a log scale and t pa plots of t o t a l q e pa and t o t a l t pa r i s e q e pa and r i s e t pa f a l l q e pa and f a l l t pa m o n q e pa and m o n t pa m o n r i s e q e pa and t pa m o n r i s e m o n f a l l q e pa and m o n f a l l t pa are provided for all 14 catchments while the plots of a u t q e pa and a u t t pa a u t r i s e q e pa and a u t r i s e t pa a u t f a l l q e pa and a u t f a l l t pa are presented for only 5 catchments where considerable sediment transport was observed during the autumn season fig s15 of the supplementary material shows the scatter plots between the drainage area and q e pa for all 9 subcases q e pa was found to have a considerable positive correlation r2 with drainage area for all the subcases in the case of the autumn season datasets a very high correlation was observed as these 5 catchments were located in the southernmost part of the study area which possesses similar hydrological governing northeast monsoon rainfall and morphological characteristics most of them belonging to the cauvery river basin as the drainage area of the catchments increases there is a decrease in the overall slope of the catchments e g walling 1983 ali and de boer 2007 this leads to the reduction in the effectiveness of discharges to carry suspended sediments along with them and thus the discharges are required to exceed a threshold i e critical stress value wolman and miller 1960 to transport suspended sediments in larger catchments hence the magnitude of the qe increases with an increase in the drainage area of catchments which is also evident from the scatter plots figs s16 s17 s18 and s19 of the supplementary material show the scatter plots between catchment descriptors such as mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope respectively with q e pa on a log scale for 9 subcases the q e pa was found to have an inverse relation with catchment descriptors such as mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope reduction in the magnitude of q e pa with these catchment descriptors indicates that discharges with lesser magnitudes are effective in carrying most of the suspended sediments over time the transfer of suspended sediments is generally facilitated by the steep slopes of headwater catchments i e upstream catchments e g syvitski et al 2000 ali and de boer 2007 steeper slopes enable low magnitude discharges to transport large quantities of suspended sediments lu and higgitt 1999 observed that the descriptors such as mean elevation elevation and average slope are positively correlated with each other they found that the average slope generally increases with elevation up to 2500 m similar observations were found in the case of south indian catchments in addition there is a strong influence of anthropogenic activities e g agriculture deforestation road construction within the catchments which has resulted in increased soil erosion especially in areas with a high elevation and steep slopes panda et al 2011 the value of the coefficient of determination r2 with the equation which provides the type of relationship and rate of change of qe with the catchment descriptor for the correlation is provided within the figures considering all the 14 catchments 5 catchments were considered for the autumn season in the case of the autumn season datasets no significant correlation was observed with maximum elevation and basin relief overall the highest correlation of q e pa for total datasets was found with mean elevation followed by maximum elevation then average slope and least with drainage area further the variation of recurrence interval return period t pa of q e pa for all the 14 catchments with respect to each of the catchment descriptors was also studied the estimates of t pa for all subcases were found to be less than a year for all 14 catchments vogel et al 2003 also found that the return period of qe is generally less than a year except for the catchments having values of b and cvd greater than 3 and 10 respectively which correspond to the rare magnitude of qe figs s20 s21 s22 s23 and s24 of the supplementary material illustrate the relationship between the t pa estimates of q e pa and each of the catchment descriptors i e drainage area mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope corresponding to all 9 subcases considered in this study most of the catchment descriptors were found to possess a similar relationship with the t pa estimates as that of q e pa it can be concluded that the effective discharge estimates and their return periods tend to get influenced by the catchment descriptors of various rivers the relationships between effective discharge and catchment descriptors obtained for gauged rivers with significant r2 might be useful to predict effective discharge estimates for ungauged rivers which are hydrologically similar to them 6 conclusions the present study proposed a modified approach which considers a one parameter box cox transformation to estimate the transport effectiveness based effective discharge for general discharge distribution datasets that alleviated the limitations of conventional approaches the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the robustness of the proposed approach over the conventional approaches was established through a monte carlo simulation study for 3 cases where discharge data was assumed to follow the lognormal gamma and log pearson type iii distributions absolute relative bias in the estimation of effective discharge based on the proposed approach was found to be very low in comparison to conventional approaches this indicates the validity of the proposed approach for the determination of reliable estimates of effective discharge for general discharge distribution datasets 2 a comparative analysis was performed between the conventional and proposed approaches for the estimation of effective discharge for 14 catchments in 4 major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery considerable differences were observed between the estimates of effective discharge determined based on proposed and conventional approaches 3 the investigation was carried out to determine the presence of the hysteresis effect in sediment rating curves of 14 south indian catchments class v hysteresis was present in the rating curves of the majority of the catchments whereas class i class ii and class iv hysteresis were also observed for few catchments the presence of hysteresis effect in sediment rating curves of indian catchments indicates the complexity in the sediment transport dynamics within the catchments this highlighted the need for considering the hysteresis effect while estimation of effective discharges for indian catchments 4 the influence of the hysteresis effect due to the complex sediment transport dynamics on the estimates of effective discharge was investigated for 14 catchments for this analysis 4 cases of fitting sediment rating curves were considered viz i a single rating curve for the total dataset ii separate rating curves according to seasonal variation iii two rating curves defined according to stage tendency for the total dataset and iv four rating curves differentiated according to the seasonal variation and stage tendency we have shown that the sediment rating curves based on either case 3 or case 4 should be considered to minimize the influence of the hysteresis effect on estimates of effective discharge however the great scattering of the collected suspended sediment data leads to a significant scatter in power law sediment discharge relation which might cause uncertainty in the estimation of effective discharge 5 the effective discharge based on the proposed approach was found to have a significant positive correlation with the drainage area and inverse relation with mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope most of the catchment descriptors were also found to possess a similar relationship with the return period of effective discharge these relationships between effective discharge and catchment descriptors obtained for gauged catchments might be useful to predict effective discharge estimates for ungauged catchments which are hydrologically similar to the gauged catchments however reliable prediction of effective discharge for ungauged catchments is subjected to the significant correlation between effective discharge and catchment descriptor further it is to be noted that the inferences from this study are limited to suspended sediment transport in the south indian rivers in summary the proposed approach alleviates a major limitation regarding the use of location specific probability distribution of discharge as in the case of conventional approaches from a practical view the proposed approach seems to be simple easy to use and has the potential of wide applicability as compared with the existing approaches thus the analysis performed in the present study can be easily extended to other river basins across the globe credit authorship contribution statement shobhit maheshwari conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft

3712,transport effectiveness te of a discharge is defined as the product of the frequency of discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate maximization of te function helps in finding the effective discharge qe which is responsible for the transfer of the majority of sediments over a prolonged period this approach to determine qe is famously known as magnitude frequency analysis mfa conventionally mfa involves the construction of the te function by assuming i a location specific probability density function pdf for discharge and ii power law relationship between discharge and sediment transport rate there have been attempts in the past to derive expressions for qe by assuming positively skewed pdfs for discharge the present study proposes a modified approach to estimate te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets which alleviates the limitation of assuming a location specific pdf the approach involves the transformation of discharge data through box cox transformation and subsequently performing mfa to determine qe an expression for the analytical solution of te based qe is derived for the proposed framework of mfa the robustness of the approach is established through a simulation study by generating discharge data using lognormal gamma and log pearson type iii distributions in this study the influence of the hysteresis effect was investigated for total as well as seasonal datasets according to the considerations of the rising and falling stages for 14 stream gauges in south indian rivers the analysis is performed by using the suspended sediment load and discharge data whereas the bedload has been excluded subsequently the estimates of qe based on the proposed approach q e pa were computed considering various sediment rating curves fitted for total seasonal stage and season stage based datasets finally the variation of q e pa with various catchment descriptors was examined keywords transport effectiveness effective discharge

flood events the flood event transferring most of the sediments was referred to as a dominant discharge wolman and miller 1960 benson and thomas 1966 later andrews 1980 was the first to describe this

in mfa the transport effectiveness te function of discharge i e flood is constructed by taking a product of its probability density function pdf and corresponding sediment transport rate finally the estimate of qe at a location can be determined by maximizing the te function with respect to discharge at that location it has been observed that the recurrence interval of qe tends to range from a few days to a couple of years e g wolman and miller 1960 benson and thomas 1966 andrews 1980 nash 1994 sichingabula 1999 emmett and wolman 2001 vogel et al 2003 introduced the concept of half load discharge which is the discharge responsible for the transfer of half of the long term sediment load doyle and shields 2008 developed an alternative discharge metric i e functional equivalent discharge qfed as a representative constant discharge that transports the same long term sediment load generated by the complete frequency distribution of discharge later basso et al 2015 studied the diversity of qfed with reference to the underlying heterogeneity of flow regimes by linking the functional equivalent ratio i e the ratio between qfed and mean discharge to the empirical exponent of sediment power law relationship and discharge variability resulting from climatic and landscape drivers from the indian context the literature review suggests that very few attempts were made to perform mfa for indian rivers roy and sinha 2014 carried out a study on the ganga river where they computed te based qe for suspended sediment transport at a monthly timescale zakwan et al 2018 also calculated the qe for suspended sediment transport at 15 stations on the ganga river using a mean and rating curve approach recently maheshwari and chavan 2019 demonstrated the utility of mfa to arrive at qe estimates based on daily and monthly discharge data at 30 gauges in four major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery basins flowing through the indian peninsular region the estimates of qe based on mfa can be sensitive to the location specific variability in the probability distribution of river discharge and the complexity in sediment transport dynamics due to the presence of the hysteresis effect further few past studies also examined the dependence between the estimates of qe on the hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers 1 1 influence

valid for most of the cases e g nash 1994 goodwin 2004 sholtes et al 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 researchers have found that other positively skewed continuous probability distributions might be useful for fitting daily discharge data in mfa e g nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 goodwin 2004 archfield et al 2007 quader et al 2008 segura and pitlick 2010 sholtes et al 2014 guo et al 2016 goodwin 2004 found that the qe estimate is sensitive to the frequency distribution of discharge data he considered various continuous frequency distributions such as normal n lognormal ln gamma g pearson type iii p3 and log pearson type iii lp3 to determine analytical solutions for te based qe for red river and russian river in the usa the study revealed that the discharge data predominantly follow either ln or g distribution quader et al 2008 found that for 25 small southern ontario streams drainage area ranging from 0 58 km2 to 1550 km2 a mixed exponential distribution model provides the most reliable estimates of qe when the exponent of sediment rating curve is less than 2 and for higher values of the exponent i e greater than 2 a g distribution based model was found to be the most suitable further klonsky and vogel 2011 used kernel density estimator kde for fitting discharge data recorded at 15 u s geological survey sampling locations to alleviate the dependence of mfa on the approximation of the probability distribution of discharge data however they found that the construction of te function from kde based pdf and sediment transport rate led to jagged te function whenever there is high variability in discharge cvd and sediment load cvs i e high values of coefficient of variation of discharge and sediment load jagged te function results in subjective and questionable estimates of qe the discussion above signifies the need to alleviate the limitation regarding the use of location specific probability distribution of discharge in conventional te based qe 1 2 influence of hysteresis effect due to the complex dynamics of sediment transport on te based qe the mechanism of sediment transport through natural rivers has been observed to get influenced by the unsteady discharges which are responsible for the cause of the hysteresis effect e g heidel 1956 arnborg et al 1967 axelsson 1967 walling 1974 kung and chiang 1977 wood 1977 brownlie 1981 vansickle and beschta 1983 shi et al 1985 hassan and church 2000 quader and guo 2009 gunsolus and binns 2017 juez et al 2018 plumb et al 2019 in the case of natural rivers the hysteretic behaviour observed during a hydrological event can be witnessed in the form of alterations in the sediment rating curve due to a lag in time between the peak discharge of a hydrograph and the peak rate of sediment transport of the corresponding sedimentograph williams 1989 classified the hysteresis effect based on sediment concentration c discharge q relationship as class i single valued line class ii clockwise loop class iii counterclockwise or anticlockwise loop class iv single valued line plus loop and class v figure eight a detailed discussion about the classification of the hysteresis effect is provided in table s1 of the supplementary material researchers have noted the fluctuations in the sediment rating curve i e c q relationship resulting from the hysteresis effect due to seasonal variation in the sediment carrying capacity of the discharge in the case of rivers fed by ice fields e g nordin 1985 hickin 1989 syvitski and alcott 1995 syvitski et al 2000 singh et al 2005 walling 1977 attempted to study the influence of the seasonal hysteresis determined based on rising and falling stages of discharges on the scatter of rating curve data for the creedy river in england it was observed that grouping the rating curve data according to seasonal variation and stage tendency resulted in reliable rating relations following walling 1977 nash 1994 examined the presence of seasonal hysteresis in sediment transport through 55 us rivers goswami 1985 found hysteresis in the relation between daily discharge and sediment concentration at pandu and ranaghat in the brahmaputra river he found that the repetitive pattern of the rise and fall of discharge and sediment load in the river is associated with the seasonal pattern of monsoonal precipitation and the freeze thaw cycle of himalayan snows sichingabula 1999 explored the effects of hysteresis on the estimation of qe due to the stage tendency alone however there is a dearth of attempts to study the effect of hysteresis on qe due to both seasonal variation and stage tendency in the sediment rating relationship 1 3 influence of hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers on te based qe the estimates of qe has been observed to get influenced by the hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers i e catchment descriptors as these characteristics tend to govern landscape evolution rates and patterns ecological processes water quality parameters and long term sediment loads e g sichingabula 1999 ali and de boer 2007 klonsky and vogel 2011 roy and sinha 2014 sichingabula 1999 related class based qe to the drainage area of the catchment with a very high coefficient of determination r2 0 99 further klonsky and vogel 2011 found a marginal correlation between qe and drainage area for 15 catchments in the united states us ali and de boer 2007 observed that the slope is inversely proportional to the magnitude of qe for the transport of sediments in natural catchments discharge magnitude i e the applied stress must exceed a threshold i e critical stress value wolman and miller 1960 thus higher discharge magnitudes are required to transport suspended sediments in larger catchments high slopes of headwater catchments i e upstream catchments facilitate the transfer of sediments which assist in carrying a considerable amount of sediments over time with a lesser magnitude of discharge e g syvitski et al 2000 ali and de boer 2007 the influence of hydrological and morphological characteristics of rivers on te based qe has not been explored for indian catchments 1 4 study goals in this paper we aim to propose a modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets which involves transforming the discharge data by using one parameter box cox transformation e g box and cox 1964 an analytical expression for te based qe under the framework of the proposed approach is derived in this paper the robustness of the approach is established through a simulation study by generating discharge data from various distributions considered in mfa furthermore the proposed approach is applied to estimate qe for 14 catchments in 4 major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery we also study the influence of the hysteresis effect due to seasonal variation and stage tendency in the sediment rating curve on qe finally we examine the dependence between qe and various catchment descriptors 2 background on approaches to te based qe magnitude frequency analysis mfa provides a mathematical framework to determine qe by maximizing te function te of a given discharge q is the product of the frequency of discharge f q and corresponding sediment transport rate s in general q is assumed to follow lognormal ln distribution whereas s corresponding to q exhibits a power law relationship with q q q represents the random variable for daily discharge and q denotes the values taken by q 1 s a q b where a and b are the parameters i e coefficient and exponent of the power law relationship nash 1994 assumed log normally distributed discharge data having a probability density function as 2 f ln q 1 β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 where ln q is the log transformed discharge α and β are the mean and standard deviation of the log transformed discharge respectively the expression eq 3 for the te function can be obtained by taking the product of eqs 1 and 2 3 te a q b β 2 π e ln q α 2 2 β 2 nash 1994 derived qe by maximizing the te function with respect to q q the equation for qe is shown in eq 4 4 q e exp b β 2 α later goodwin 2004 derived analytical solutions for te based qe by considering various continuous probability distributions e g normal lognormal gamma pearson and log pearson type iii distribution to fit the discharge data details about the expressions for probability density function pdf te function and qe can be found in goodwin 2004 later klonsky and vogel 2011 introduced a non parametric approach to determine te based qe based on a kernel density function they assumed the gaussian kernel with a fixed width smoothing parameter h i e bandwidth to describe the frequency distribution of discharge data at 15 us geological survey sites however they found that the presence of high values of the coefficient of variations of discharge data cvd and coefficient of variation of sediment loads cvs caused the jagged te function the jagged te function makes it difficult to determine a reliable estimate of qe further details can be found in klonsky and vogel 2011 3 modified approach to te based qe in this paper we aim to propose a modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets the approach utilizes one parameter box cox transformation e g box and cox 1964 to transform the observed discharge data in order to achieve discharge normalization and variance stabilization this kind of strategy has been found effective in many applications in the field of hydrology e g chander et al 1978 kuczera 1983 jain and singh 1986 bates and campbell 2001 thyer et al 2002 yang et al 2007 engeland et al 2010 wang et al 2012 in the present study the box cox transformation strategy is used to derive an analytical expression for te based qe the steps involved in the proposed approach pa to determine te based qe are as follows 1 define λmin and λmax respectively as the lower and the upper bound for a power function parameter λj for box cox transformation of raw discharge data where j 1 2 m in this study λmin and λmax were chosen as 1 and 1 respectively and the increment for the iteration was chosen to be 0 0001 here j ranges from 1 to m 20 000 2 initialize λj λmin and use it to transform the discharge data 3 the transformed data vector pj corresponding to λj can be obtained using eq 5 5 p j q i λ j 1 λ j i f λ j 0 ln q i i f λ j 0 f o r i 1 n where the subscript i denotes ith discharge data and n represents the total length of data 4 pj can be assumed to follow a normal n distribution construct a log likelihood function lj for each λj value based on eq 6 6 l j α p β p 2 λ j n 2 ln 2 π n 2 ln β p 2 1 2 i 1 n q λ j 1 λ j α p 2 β p 2 where αp and βp are the mean and standard deviation of pj the procedure to determine lj value corresponding to λj and parameters αp and βp is provided in appendix a 5 if j m then increment j j 1 and repeat steps 3 to 4 to obtain lj value if j m then proceed to step 6 6 construct the profile of lj with respect to λj determine optimal power function parameter λopt from all λj for which lj attains maximum value 7 transform raw discharge data to a data vector p by considering λopt as given by eq 7 7 p q i λ opt 1 λ opt i f λ opt 0 ln q i i f λ opt 0 f o r i 1 n 8 p can be assumed to have normal

p 2 2 1 λ opt 4 evaluation of the modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets prerequisite to the application of the modified approach to te based qe on the real world catchments its effectiveness was evaluated through a monte carlo simulation experiment for the simulation of daily discharge and corresponding suspended sediment transport rate the parameters were adopted from table s2 of the supplementary material given by nash 1994 which provides information on 55 u s rivers generation of daily discharge data was carried out by assuming that the discharges exhibit various probability distribution functions based on the recommendations from past research u s water resources council 1981 kuczera 1982 nash 1994 goodwin 2004 sholtes et al 2014 etc lognormal ln gamma g and log pearson type iii lp3 distributions were chosen for generation of daily discharge data details on the generation of data are provided in section s 1 in the supplementary material the expressions for probability density function pdf for ln g and lp3 distributions are provided in table s3 of the supplementary material preliminary assessment of the generated data revealed the necessity to exclude some rivers from the analysis to avoid unrealistic estimates of data characteristics such as coefficient of variation of sediment data cvs and kurtosis kd of log transformed discharge data sub scripts s and d stand for sediment and discharge respectively this was necessary to achieve the standard river conditions for the simulation experiment e g syvitski et al 2000 sholtes et al 2014 thresholds for the upper limit of cvs and kd were fixed as 10 and 6 respectively for the exclusion of rivers from the simulation experiment following some previous studies e g nash 1994 klonsky and vogel 2011 roy and sinha 2014 maheshwari and chavan 2019 we have adopted 28 9 and 9 rivers out of 55 u s rivers for ln g and lp3 distribution based simulation experiments subsequently the evaluation of the modified approach to te based qe for general discharge distribution datasets was performed a flow diagram to summarize the methodological steps in the evaluation is provided in fig 1 4 1 performance assessment of the modified approach to te based qe the performance assessment of the modified approach to te based qe with respect to the conventional approaches i e ln g lp3 and kde based mfa is demonstrated in the following subsections 4 1 1 4 1 2 and 4 1 3 the subsections represent 3 different cases when the discharge data is generated using ln g and lp3 distributions 4 1 1 case 1 when discharge data follow the lognormal distribution for each of the 28 rivers pdfs for generated discharge data having sample sizes of 10 000 15 000 and 20 000 were determined using ln g lp3 distributions as well as non parametric kde based mfa for brevity fig 2 a shows the histogram of generated discharge data for the case of the sample size of 15000 along with fitted pdfs from ln g lp3 distributions and kde pertaining to river id 3 from nash 1994 the figure illustrates that the discharge data shows an adequate fit with ln distribution which is obvious as the data was generated by assuming ln distribution and kde except for g distribution the fitted density functions are compared with the histograms of generated discharge data by using error measures such as percent absolute relative bias ar bias and root mean square error rmse the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for all 28 rivers were found to be 11 07 29 27 10 57 and 136 51 329 10 129 36 for ln g kde based pdfs as the discharge data were log normally distributed i e γ s tends to zero lp3 distribution was approximated as ln distribution histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 27 rivers are provided in fig s1 of the supplementary material later te functions were constructed for each of the rivers based on conventional te based mfa approaches for brevity fig 3 a 3b and 3c present the pdfs and te functions for river id 3 considering ln g and kde based mfa respectively the figures illustrate that the g distribution based te function attains a maximum for higher discharges than the te function for other distributions ln and lp3 the difference in te function was due to the difference in pdfs for g and other distributions for the remaining 27 rivers pdfs and te functions are provided in fig s2 of supplementary material furthermore the jagged nature of the te function can be observed for the kde based approach although kde was able to fit discharge data adequately higher cvs results in the construction of the jagged te functions which is due to the sharp drops in the fitted pdfs subsequently estimates of qe were computed using analytical solutions for ln g and lp3 based mfa following goodwin 2004 in addition qe for kde based mfa was computed following klonsky and vogel 2011 estimates of qe obtained from ln g lp3 and kde based mfa are represented as q e ln q e g q e l p 3 and q e kde respectively and are tabulated in table s4 of the supplementary material in the case of the proposed approach pa initially the discharge data was transformed using box cox transformation for various values of the power function parameter λj following steps 1 to 3 of section 3 then an optimal power function parameter λopt for which the log likelihood function lj attains a maximum value was determined based on steps 4 to 6 of section 3 profiles of lj verses λj for all 28 rivers are shown in fig s3 of supplementary material it can be noted from the figures that the parameter λopt is close to zero as the data was generated assuming log transformation which is a special case of box cox transformation for λ 0 refer eq 5 λ opt 0 is also evident from table s4 in the supplementary material later the discharge data were transformed to a data vector p by parameter λopt following step 7 of section 3 the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for the fitted density functions in the case of pa were close to ln distribution i e 11 12 and 137 01 respectively which was used for data generation see fig 2a subsequently the te function was constructed based on the frequency distribution of q eq 9 and the power law relationship between q and s as given by eq 1 refer to steps 8 and 9 of section 3 it can also be noted that pdf and te for pa look similar to those obtained for the ln case see fig 3a and 3d for river id 3 similar findings were observed for the remaining 27 rivers from figs s2a and s2d of supplementary material finally the qe based on the proposed approach q e pa was determined using eq 11 described in step 10 of section 3 for each of the rivers estimates of q e pa are provided in table s4 in supplementary material corresponding to data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 performance of pa to mfa with respect to the conventional approaches i e ln g lp3 and kde based mfa was assessed based on performance measure percent absolute relative bias ar bias as given by eq 12 12 ar b i a s a q e assumed p d f q e a q e assumed p d f 100 where q e assumed p d f and q e a denote qe estimate obtained based on the analytical solutions pertaining to the assumed probability distribution function based mfa i e ln based mfa in this case and an approach a respectively ar bias a is the ar bias for a where a stands for ln or g or lp3 or kde or pa based mfa in this case table s4 of the supplementary material shows the ar bias in estimates for each of the approaches corresponding to various data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 the average ar bias g was found to be 169 38 186 04 and 175 55 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively higher ar bias g was due to an inadequate fit of pdf to the discharge data further it can be noted that the ar bias g tends to increase as the coefficient of variation of discharge cvd and cvs increase refer to table s4 in supplementary material higher values of cvd and cvs can affect the magnitude and frequency of sediment transport e g klonsky and vogel 2011 sholtes et al 2014 thus g based mfa yielded unreliable estimates of qe for lp3 based mfa the average ar bias lp3 in for 28 rivers was observed as 0 49 0 50 and 0 34 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20 000 respectively ar bias lp3 estimates are less as the skewness of log transformed data is close to 0 for which lp3 distribution can be assumed to be ln distribution in the case of kde based mfa the average ar bias kde in was found to be 4005 04 6239 17 and 6678 53 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively although kde was able to fit discharge data adequately higher cvd and cvs results in the construction of the jagged te function gaps in the constructed te functions due to sharp drops in the fitted pdf which leads to unrealistic estimates of qe for some of the rivers refer to table s4 in supplementary material for pa however the average ar bias pa in was found to be the least i e 0 48 0 50 and 0 34 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively this can be attributed to better fitting of normal distribution in transformed space and subsequent construction of te function without any limitation that is mentioned above in the case of conventional approaches in order to visualize the distribution of ar bias in for each of the approaches considering all 28 rivers corresponding to data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 box plots were prepared for ar bias in as illustrated in fig 4 a it can be observed from the figure that the spread of ar bias pa and ar bias lp3 is similar and less than 1 however the spread of ar bias g and ar bias kde is high there is a considerable variation in ar bias kde which denotes unreliable estimates of qe to summarize the pa has arguably yielded the most reliable estimates of qe as compared to the conventional approaches to mfa when the discharge data follow ln distribution 4 1 2 case 2 when discharge data follow gamma distribution for each of the 9 rivers pdfs for generated discharge data were fitted using ln g lp3 distributions and kde fig 2b illustrates the histograms along with fitted density functions it can be noted from the figure that the discharge data shows an adequate fit with g distribution which is obvious as the data was generated by assuming g distribution and kde except for ln distribution the lp3 distribution was unable to fit discharge data for all 9 rivers histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 8 rivers are provided in fig s4 of supplementary material fig 5 a 5b and 5c present the pdfs and te functions for river id 3 from nash 1994 considering ln distribution g distribution and kde the te function constructed based on ln distribution was found to be different than those constructed based on g distribution and kde the difference can be attributed to the difference in fitted pdfs figs 2b and 5a the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for all 9 rivers were found to be 5 31 0 40 0 54 and 70 29 12 74 9 61 for ln g kde based pdfs it can be seen from fig 5c that the te function constructed based on kde exhibits jagged nature for the remaining 8 rivers pdfs and te functions are provided in fig s5 of supplementary material subsequently estimates of qe were determined considering ln g lp3 and kde based mfa table s5 of the supplementary material provides estimates of qe further pa was considered to determine qe estimates for 9 rivers by following the procedure described in section 3 profiles of lj verses λj for all 9 rivers are shown in fig s6 of supplementary material it was observed that the parameter λopt was not close to zero fig 2b confirms a better fit of density function with the histogram of discharge data the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for the fitted density functions in the case of pa were close to g distribution i e 0 55 and 13 12 respectively it can also be noted that the fitted pdf for discharge data and subsequently constructed te function for pa and g based mfa look similar refer fig 5b and 5d for river id 3 similar findings were observed for the remaining 8 rivers from figs s5b and s5d in the supplementary material table s5 of the supplementary material shows the percent ar bias in qe obtained based on ln lp3 kde and pa based mfa with respect to the g based mfa for various data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 the average ar bias ln in was found to be 17 36 19 86 and 17 98 for data lengths of 10000 15 000 and 20000 respectively higher ar bias ln was obtained due to inadequate fit of pdf to the discharge data and it tends to increase as the kurtosis of discharge data increases for lp3 based mfa the average ar bias lp3 in for 9 rivers was observed as 348 39 410 05 and 189 94 pertaining to data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively ar bias lp3 estimates are high as lp3 distribution was unable to fit discharge data and they tend to increase as cvs and kd increase in the case of kde based mfa the average ar bias kde was found to be 12 64 20 25 and 10 19 for data lengths of 10000 15 000 and 20000 respectively it is interesting to observe that the average ar bias pa in for pa was found to be the least i e 3 61 3 89 and 3 68 for data lengths of 10000 15 000 and 20000 respectively low ar bias pa can be due to the better fit of the normal distribution to the discharge data in transformed space further fig 4b shows the box plots for percent ar bias it can be observed from the figure that the spread of ar bias ln and ar bias kde was nearly the same and less than 20 for all data lengths however the spread of ar bias lp3 was the highest and that of ar bias pa was the least to summarize pa was found to yield the least ar bias estimates in qe when the discharge data was assumed to follow the g distribution 4 1 3 case 3 when discharge data follows log pearson type iii distribution for each of the 9 rivers pdfs for discharge data were fitted using ln g lp3 distributions and kde fig 2c illustrates the histogram along with fitted density functions it can be noted from the figure that the discharge data shows an appropriate fit for ln lp3 and kde except for g distribution histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 8 rivers are provided in fig s7 of supplementary material the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for all 9 rivers were found to be 6 44 34 78 10 75 10 65 and 69 56 328 68 117 75 116 59 for ln g lp3 kde based pdfs fig 6 a 6b 6c and 6d show pdfs and te functions for river id 3 considering ln distribution g distribution lp3 distribution and kde the te function constructed based on g distribution was found to be different than those constructed based on others the difference can be attributed to the difference in fitted pdfs refer to figs 2c and 6b it can be seen from fig 6d that the te function constructed based on kde shows jagged behaviour the jagged behaviour was found for all the 9 rivers considered in this case for the remaining 8 rivers pdfs and te functions are provided in fig s8 of supplementary material subsequently estimates of qe were determined using ln g lp3 and kde based mfa refer to table s6 in supplementary material further pa was considered to determine qe estimates for all 9 rivers by following the procedure described in section 3 profiles of lj verses λj for all 9 rivers are shown in fig s9 of the supplementary material it was observed that the parameter λopt was not close to zero fig 2c shows a better fit of density function with the histogram of discharge data the average estimates of ar bias in and rmse for the fitted density functions in the case of pa were close to lp3 distribution i e 10 84 and 117 04 respectively it can also be noted that the fitted pdf and constructed te function using pa and lp3 based mfa look similar fig 6c and 6e for river id 3 similar findings were observed for the remaining 8 rivers from figs s8c and s8e of supplementary material table s6 of the supplementary material shows the percent ar bias in qe for all 9 rivers obtained based on ln g kde and pa based mfa with respect to lp3 based mfa for various data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 the average ar bias ln in was found to be 9 40 9 39 and 9 77 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively it can be noted that ar bias ln tends to increase with the increase in γ s for g based mfa the average ar bias g was observed as 137 35 138 22 and 139 59 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively this is because the discharge data do not follow g distribution adequately and cvs of generated data is considerably high for all 9 rivers in the case of kde based mfa the average ar bias kde in was found to be very high i e 3208 70 3985 24 and 4277 63 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively due to a jagged te function due to high value of cvs in generated data however for the pa average ar bias pa in was found to be the least i e 2 12 2 21 and 2 16 for data lengths of 10000 15000 and 20000 respectively due to better fit of the normal distribution to the discharge data in transformed space further fig 4c illustrates the box plots for percent ar bias it can be observed from the figure that the spread of ar bias pa is the lowest and ar bias kde is the highest to summarize pa was found to yield the least ar bias estimates when the discharge data was assumed to follow lp3 distribution 5 application of the proposed approach to south indian rivers in this section the application of the proposed approach pa to determine reliable estimates of effective discharge qe for 14 stream gauges in 4 major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery flowing through the indian peninsular region is demonstrated subsequently we studied the influence of the hysteresis effect due to the complex sediment transport dynamics on te based qe finally we explored the dependence between the estimates of qe on the hydrological and morphological characteristics of the south indian catchments 5 1 description of the study area and data used the locations of 14 stream gauges in 4 south indian rivers are shown in fig 7 the information about the rivers is presented in table s7 in the supplementary material in this paper the selection of the 14 stream gauges were based on the availability of continuous daily discharge and corresponding suspended sediment concentration data coarse medium and fine fractions for around or greater than 20 years similar criteria were considered by nash 1994 vogel et al 2003 and klonsky and vogel 2011 the catchment areas of the 14 gauges range from 3141 km2 to 67908 km2 the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data was downloaded from the water resources information system wris government of india https indiawris gov in wris the suspended sediment transport rate in tons per day was then computed from the discharge and suspended sediment concentration data the bed load which is a part of total sediment load i e suspended load plus bed load for the south indian rivers is insignificant e g vaithiyanathan et al 1988 ghose and swain 2011 the flow characteristics such as mean discharge coefficient of variation of discharge cvd coefficient of variation of sediment load cvs and mean α standard deviation β skewness γ s and kurtosis kd of log transformed discharge data for all the 14 stream gauges are presented in table 1 there are 4 climatological seasons in india designated by the india meteorological department imd namely winter january and february summer march april and may monsoon june july august and september and autumn october november and december attri and tyagi 2010 most of the catchments corresponding to 14 stream gauges receive rainfall during the southwest monsoon period i e monsoon season except for 5 catchments i e bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi musiri and savandapur these 5 catchments experience considerable rainfall during the northeast monsoon i e autumn season deshpande et al 2016 the sediment transport through the catchments is dependent on the distribution of rainfall during the seasons it can be seen from table 1 that a large percentage of sediment load transport in most of the catchments happen during the monsoon season except for the 5 catchments where considerable sediment load transport also occur during the autumn season additionally various catchment descriptors such as drainage area mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope in percentage rise which influence the surface run off and sediment yield are derived for all 14 catchments using arcgis framework by processing advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster digital elevation model dem data having 30 m resolution these descriptors for all 14 stram gauges are provided in table 2 5 2 estimation of te based qe for south indian catchments in this section estimates of qe were calculated considering the conventional approaches and the proposed approach pa for all the 14 stream gauges considering total discharge and sediment transport rate datasets firstly a 2 dimensional log log plot between discharge and sediment transport rate was constructed for each of the 14 gauges evidence of linear behaviour of the plots pertaining to 14 gauges confirms the validity existence of the power law relationship between the discharge and sediment transport rate refer to fig s10 in supplementary material information on the slope b intercept a and r2 value for the log log plots are provided in table 3 the exponent b ranges from 1 26 to 2 10 for all 14 gauges subsequently qe estimates were determined for all 14 gauges using the conventional and modified te based approaches see table 3 for brevity a histogram with the fitted density functions for gauge id 6 of south indian rivers is presented in fig 2d histograms and fitted pdfs for the remaining 13 stream gauges are provided in fig s11 of supplementary material fig s12 of the supplementary material illustrates the te functions for all 14 gauges based on various approaches figures depict the comparison of te functions based on conventional approaches ln g lp3 and kde based mfa and the proposed approach modified te based mfa the similarity in te functions results in close and similar estimates of qe based on different approaches further fig s13 of the supplementary material shows the profiles of lj versus λj for all 14 gauges which were utilized to determine λopt in the case of the proposed approach to facilitate the comparison between conventional te based mfa approaches with respect to the proposed approach ar bias in was used average ar bias ln and ar bias lp3 were 21 91 and 20 14 respectively while the average ar bias g was found to be 180 57 ar bias g tends to be higher than ar bias ln and ar bias lp3 due to the very high value of skewness greater than 3 5 and kurtosis greater than 19 of discharge data for all gauges for most of the gauges estimates of qe obtained using the ln lp3 based approach was found to be closer to those obtained using the proposed approach when the skewness of log transformed data was low high in the case of the kde based approach average ar bias kde was the highest i e 2465 67 in comparison to ln g and lp3 based mfa this is due to the jagged nature of the te function with the increase in the coefficient of variation of sediment load 5 3 investigation of hysteresis effect in south indian rivers in this section we investigated the presence of the hysteresis effect in sediment transport for all 14 catchments the hysteresis effect in the sediment rating curve is examined by considering i the total set of observations i e total dataset for discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate data and ii seasonal sets of observations i e seasonal datasets for discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate data in this study the presence of seasonal hysteresis is examined for monsoon season in the case of all 14 catchments and autumn season in the case of 5 catchments i e bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi musiri and savandapur that experience the northeast monsoon this is due to the reason that the majority of the sediment transport above 80 in south indian catchments is found to occur during monsoon and autumn seasons refer to table 1 firstly seasonal datasets containing the discharge and corresponding suspended sediment transport rate data from 2 seasons i e monsoon and autumn were prepared then the seasonal data sets were further subdivided according to the considerations of the rising and falling stages following walling 1977 and nash 1994 a rising stage is designated by a discharge recorded on a particular day when it exceeds the discharge recorded on the previous day at least by 0 5 m3 sec once all the discharges corresponding to the rising stage are identified the remaining discharges are designated as the discharges belonging to the falling stage subsequently sediment rating curves were constructed separately for rising and falling stages by considering total dataset and seasonal datasets i e monsoon and autumn season datasets if the rating curve for the rising stage is above below the rating curve for the falling stage then there exists a clockwise anticlockwise hysteresis it should be noted that the rising stage and falling stage based sediment rating curves were constructed for the total dataset and monsoon season dataset in the case of all 14 catchments refer to fig s14 in supplementary material additional rising stage and falling stage based sediment rating curves were constructed for 5 catchments i e bawapuram billigundulu kodumudi musiri and savandapur based on the autumn season dataset refer to fig s14 in supplementary material ten catchments i e ashti bamni basantpur bawapuram billigundulu huvinhedgi kodumudi pathagudem pauni and savandapur showed the presence of class v hysteresis figure eight i e anticlockwise loop clockwise loop in the relationship between discharge and corresponding sediment transport rate when the total dataset was considered refer to fig s14 in supplementary material for brevity fig 8 depicting the class v hysteresis for the catchment corresponding to the gauge id 6 i e billigundulu catchment is presented in the paper in the case of these 10 catchments anticlockwise hysteresis was observed at low discharges while clockwise hysteresis was noticed for high discharges when total datasets were analyzed low and high discharges were demarcated based on the intersection of the rating curves corresponding to the rising and falling stages this indicates that at high discharges the rate of increase in sediment load was greater than the rate of increase in discharge i e the sediment load peaked first while at low discharges the rate of increase in discharges was greater than the rate of increase in sediment load i e the discharge peaked first eight out of those 10 catchments showed the presence of class v hysteresis for monsoon season i e except basantpur and pauni catchments detailed discussion on the class of hysteresis and related explanations for all 14 catchments is provided in table s8 of the supplementary material the hysteresis effect can have an adverse impact on overall sediment transport in the catchments to investigate the influence of hysteresis effect on rating curve we considered 4 cases of fitting sediment rating curves for each catchment based on the use of i a single rating curve for the total dataset ii separate rating curves according to seasonal variation iii two rating curves defined according to stage tendency for the total dataset and iv four rating curves differentiated according to the seasonal variation and stage tendency walling 1977 the ar bias in estimates were determined for the 4 cases and are presented in table s9 of the supplementary material it can be observed that the average ar bias for case 1 a single rating curve for a total dataset was found to be the highest where a single rating curve was considered the average ar bias estimate was found to be the least in case 4 where rating curves were fitted according to seasonal variation and stage tendency followed by case 3 where two rating curves were defined according to stage tendency the rating curve for a catchment with gauge id 3 bamnidhi was found to exhibit a straight line which indicates class i means that there is no effect of hysteresis thus there is no improvement in the error when rating curves were constructed based on either seasonal variation or stage tendency or both in the case of the catchment with gauge id 9 konta an anticlockwise hysteresis in the lower range of discharges followed by a straight line for higher range discharges was observed due to the presence of a closed loop for lower discharge and the single straight line for higher discharges the error is less for all cases further clockwise hysteresis was observed at high discharges i e above some discharge threshold where a major improvement greater than 10 in the estimation of sediment load was obtained for case 4 i e ratings differentiated by season and stage for 6 catchments ashti bamni basantpur pathagudem pauni and savandapur while for remaining 6 catchments bawapuram billigundulu huvinhedgi kodumudi musiri nowrangpur minor improvements were observed for case 4 the minor improvement was due to the presence of the systematic divergence in sediment transport rates at high discharges which might be the influence of climatic and landscape controls on the sediment yields of the catchment walling 1977 nash 1994 nash 1994 also observed that most of the u s rivers were showing divergence in sediment transport rates at higher discharge rates rendering the ineffectiveness of the power function for extrapolation beyond some higher discharge threshold for gauge id 11 nowrangpur significant improvement was observed when the rating curves were constructed based on case 3 as compared to case 4 results indicated that the use of seasonally distinguished rating curves was unable to improve the load estimates for most of the catchments however the application of separate rating equations for rising and falling stages did result in significant improvement in the estimate thus it can be inferred from the analysis that the sediment rating curves based on either stage tendency case 3 or seasonal variation and stage tendency case 4 should be considered to minimize the influence of the hysteresis effect on sediment rating relations in magnitude frequency analysis nonetheless the great scattering of the collected suspended sediment data leads to a significant scatter in power law sediment discharge relation this might lead to uncertainty in the reliable estimation of effective discharge 5 4 estimation of te based qe by accounting for hysteresis effect in this section q e pa effective discharge based on the proposed approach was computed by considering the aforementioned 4 cases of fitting sediment rating curves for a catchment in this study q e pa were determined for all 9 subcases the subcases include total dataset based estimates i e t o t a l q e pa the total dataset with the stage rise and fall tendency based estimates i e r i s e q e pa and f a l l q e pa seasonal variation monsoon and autumn based estimates i e m o n q e pa and q e pa a u t and seasonal variation and stage tendency based estimates i e m o n r i s e q e pa m o n f a l l q e pa a u t r i s e q e pa and a u t f a l l q e pa the parameters i e coefficient a and exponent b of the power law relationship corresponding to 9 subcases are provided in table s10 of the supplementary material the estimates of q e pa for 9 subcases are presented in table 4 the estimates of q e pa were found to be sensitive to the value of b exponent of sediment power law relationship smaller variation in the value of b led to considerable change in the magnitude of q e pa for the catchments showing considerable hysteresis in sediment rating relationship the estimate of b was higher for rising stage based sediment rating curve than that for falling stage based rating curve thus the estimates of q e pa were higher for rising stage based datasets than those based on the falling stage the presence of clockwise hysteresis for the higher range of discharges indicates the transport of large amounts of sediments by the rising stage discharges as compared to falling stage discharges the selection of qe estimate for the 14 catchments given in table 4 could be made based on the case i e fitting sediment rating curves yielding the least ar bias error such estimates of effective discharges would be more reliable and representative of sediment transport dynamics within the catchments 5 5 variation of qe and its return period with the hydrological and morphological characteristics of south indian rivers variation of q e pa and its return period t pa with catchment descriptors such as drainage area mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope percentage rise was assessed for all 14 catchments scatter plots were prepared between catchment descriptors and 9 subcases of q e pa on a log scale and t pa plots of t o t a l q e pa and t o t a l t pa r i s e q e pa and r i s e t pa f a l l q e pa and f a l l t pa m o n q e pa and m o n t pa m o n r i s e q e pa and t pa m o n r i s e m o n f a l l q e pa and m o n f a l l t pa are provided for all 14 catchments while the plots of a u t q e pa and a u t t pa a u t r i s e q e pa and a u t r i s e t pa a u t f a l l q e pa and a u t f a l l t pa are presented for only 5 catchments where considerable sediment transport was observed during the autumn season fig s15 of the supplementary material shows the scatter plots between the drainage area and q e pa for all 9 subcases q e pa was found to have a considerable positive correlation r2 with drainage area for all the subcases in the case of the autumn season datasets a very high correlation was observed as these 5 catchments were located in the southernmost part of the study area which possesses similar hydrological governing northeast monsoon rainfall and morphological characteristics most of them belonging to the cauvery river basin as the drainage area of the catchments increases there is a decrease in the overall slope of the catchments e g walling 1983 ali and de boer 2007 this leads to the reduction in the effectiveness of discharges to carry suspended sediments along with them and thus the discharges are required to exceed a threshold i e critical stress value wolman and miller 1960 to transport suspended sediments in larger catchments hence the magnitude of the qe increases with an increase in the drainage area of catchments which is also evident from the scatter plots figs s16 s17 s18 and s19 of the supplementary material show the scatter plots between catchment descriptors such as mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope respectively with q e pa on a log scale for 9 subcases the q e pa was found to have an inverse relation with catchment descriptors such as mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope reduction in the magnitude of q e pa with these catchment descriptors indicates that discharges with lesser magnitudes are effective in carrying most of the suspended sediments over time the transfer of suspended sediments is generally facilitated by the steep slopes of headwater catchments i e upstream catchments e g syvitski et al 2000 ali and de boer 2007 steeper slopes enable low magnitude discharges to transport large quantities of suspended sediments lu and higgitt 1999 observed that the descriptors such as mean elevation elevation and average slope are positively correlated with each other they found that the average slope generally increases with elevation up to 2500 m similar observations were found in the case of south indian catchments in addition there is a strong influence of anthropogenic activities e g agriculture deforestation road construction within the catchments which has resulted in increased soil erosion especially in areas with a high elevation and steep slopes panda et al 2011 the value of the coefficient of determination r2 with the equation which provides the type of relationship and rate of change of qe with the catchment descriptor for the correlation is provided within the figures considering all the 14 catchments 5 catchments were considered for the autumn season in the case of the autumn season datasets no significant correlation was observed with maximum elevation and basin relief overall the highest correlation of q e pa for total datasets was found with mean elevation followed by maximum elevation then average slope and least with drainage area further the variation of recurrence interval return period t pa of q e pa for all the 14 catchments with respect to each of the catchment descriptors was also studied the estimates of t pa for all subcases were found to be less than a year for all 14 catchments vogel et al 2003 also found that the return period of qe is generally less than a year except for the catchments having values of b and cvd greater than 3 and 10 respectively which correspond to the rare magnitude of qe figs s20 s21 s22 s23 and s24 of the supplementary material illustrate the relationship between the t pa estimates of q e pa and each of the catchment descriptors i e drainage area mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope corresponding to all 9 subcases considered in this study most of the catchment descriptors were found to possess a similar relationship with the t pa estimates as that of q e pa it can be concluded that the effective discharge estimates and their return periods tend to get influenced by the catchment descriptors of various rivers the relationships between effective discharge and catchment descriptors obtained for gauged rivers with significant r2 might be useful to predict effective discharge estimates for ungauged rivers which are hydrologically similar to them 6 conclusions the present study proposed a modified approach which considers a one parameter box cox transformation to estimate the transport effectiveness based effective discharge for general discharge distribution datasets that alleviated the limitations of conventional approaches the following conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the robustness of the proposed approach over the conventional approaches was established through a monte carlo simulation study for 3 cases where discharge data was assumed to follow the lognormal gamma and log pearson type iii distributions absolute relative bias in the estimation of effective discharge based on the proposed approach was found to be very low in comparison to conventional approaches this indicates the validity of the proposed approach for the determination of reliable estimates of effective discharge for general discharge distribution datasets 2 a comparative analysis was performed between the conventional and proposed approaches for the estimation of effective discharge for 14 catchments in 4 major south indian rivers mahanadi godavari krishna and cauvery considerable differences were observed between the estimates of effective discharge determined based on proposed and conventional approaches 3 the investigation was carried out to determine the presence of the hysteresis effect in sediment rating curves of 14 south indian catchments class v hysteresis was present in the rating curves of the majority of the catchments whereas class i class ii and class iv hysteresis were also observed for few catchments the presence of hysteresis effect in sediment rating curves of indian catchments indicates the complexity in the sediment transport dynamics within the catchments this highlighted the need for considering the hysteresis effect while estimation of effective discharges for indian catchments 4 the influence of the hysteresis effect due to the complex sediment transport dynamics on the estimates of effective discharge was investigated for 14 catchments for this analysis 4 cases of fitting sediment rating curves were considered viz i a single rating curve for the total dataset ii separate rating curves according to seasonal variation iii two rating curves defined according to stage tendency for the total dataset and iv four rating curves differentiated according to the seasonal variation and stage tendency we have shown that the sediment rating curves based on either case 3 or case 4 should be considered to minimize the influence of the hysteresis effect on estimates of effective discharge however the great scattering of the collected suspended sediment data leads to a significant scatter in power law sediment discharge relation which might cause uncertainty in the estimation of effective discharge 5 the effective discharge based on the proposed approach was found to have a significant positive correlation with the drainage area and inverse relation with mean elevation maximum elevation basin relief and average slope most of the catchment descriptors were also found to possess a similar relationship with the return period of effective discharge these relationships between effective discharge and catchment descriptors obtained for gauged catchments might be useful to predict effective discharge estimates for ungauged catchments which are hydrologically similar to the gauged catchments however reliable prediction of effective discharge for ungauged catchments is subjected to the significant correlation between effective discharge and catchment descriptor further it is to be noted that the inferences from this study are limited to suspended sediment transport in the south indian rivers in summary the proposed approach alleviates a major limitation regarding the use of location specific probability distribution of discharge as in the case of conventional approaches from a practical view the proposed approach seems to be simple easy to use and has the potential of wide applicability as compared with the existing approaches thus the analysis performed in the present study can be easily extended to other river basins across the globe credit authorship contribution statement shobhit maheshwari conceptualization methodology formal analysis data curation writing original draft

3713,researchers have attempted to use machine learning algorithms to replace physically based models for streamflow prediction although existing studies have contributed to improving machine learning methods they still have weaknesses such as large dataset requirements and overfitting therefore we propose an approach that combines the weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system wrf hydro and the long short term memory lstm network i e wrf hydro lstm to improve streamflow simulations in this approach lstm was employed to predict the residual errors of wrf hydro in contrast the conventional approach with lstm predicts streamflow directly here we performed numerical experiments to predict the inflow of soyangho lake in south korea using wrf hydro lstm wrf hydro only and lstm only wrf hydro lstm and lstm only showed better results nse 0 95 and r greater than 0 96 compared to wrf hydro only nse 0 72 and r 0 88 however in terms of the percent bias wrf hydro lstm had a better value 1 75 than lstm only 17 36 while the lstm only follows objective functions and not physical principles wrf hydro lstm simulates residual errors and efficiently decreases uncertainties that are inherent with conventional methods furthermore a sensitivity test on the training dataset indicated that the correlation coefficient and nse value were not overly sensitive but the pbias value differed substantially depending on the training set this study demonstrates that wrf hydro lstm is particularly useful for representing real world physical constraints and thus can potentially improve streamflow prediction compared to using either of the two approaches exclusively 1 introduction streamflow describes the volume of available freshwater and the flood discharge therefore accurate streamflow prediction is important for water resource management predicted basin scale streamflow can be used for effectively managing water resources by controlling the water storage of the reservoir which plays an important role in water power generation and flood alleviation as well as in irrigation schemes wedgbrow et al 2002 to achieve reliable predictions numerous hydrological models have been developed and utilized to simulate streamflow chiew et al 2003 asefa et al 2006 naabil et al 2017 which can be classified as empirical conceptual and physically based while lumped models including empirical and conceptual models use a limited number of parameters and basin average input data physically based distributed hydrological models are configured with various physically relevant and spatially distributed parameters to represent the spatial distribution of metrological environmental and physical characteristics as well as multiple principles of hydrological systems to represent simplified real world conditions schumann 1993 moradkhani sorooshian 2008 el hassan et al 2013 thus distributed models are expected to simulate a hydrological cycle that obeys the laws of nature better than the conceptual rainfall runoff models donnelly makowecki moore 1999 el hassan et al 2013 and have strengths for hydrological forecasting carpenter georgakakos 2006 furthermore the use of physically interpretable parameters in physically based distributed models enables us to understand various hydrological processes in relatively high temporal and spatial resolutions including not only streamflow processes but also evapotranspiration processes and soil moisture dynamics devia et al 2015 although considerable efforts have been made to improve the performance of hydrological models boyle et al 2000 chuck et al 2004 vrugt et al 2005 crochemore et al 2016 they are still limited by uncertainties in their datasets heterogeneity in their parameters and variables scale effects and nonlinearities in their process dynamics the structure of which is mostly based on unknown or complex boundary conditions and initial states liu gupta 2007 paniconi putti 2015 lane et al 2019 brigode et al 2013 has shown that the major source of uncertainty in hydrological modeling is the lack of model robustness which is the result of unsuitable model structures and inappropriate calibration procedures additionally the annual and interannual variability in streamflow and effects of climate change also increases these uncertainties which further complicates water resource management chiew et al 2003 the weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system wrf hydro couples a fully distributed land surface model with routing components which is used to simulate the streamflow of watersheds it includes multiple conceptual and physically based approaches high resolution terrestrial hydrological processes and energy fluxes accordingly the model has been used for water cycle analysis replication of observations and in forecast systems in numerous fields koren et al 1999 yucel et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 arnault et al 2016 givati et al 2016 xiang et al 2017 maidment 2017 kerandi et al 2018 similar to other physically based models the wrf hydro model requires parameter calibration for optimal performance earlier studies mainly applied manual calibration through trial and error methods for instance yucel et al 2015 simulated the streamflow for specific flood events in the western black sea region of turkey using a manual and stepwise calibration method by selecting six parameters affecting the shape of the hydrograph they calibrated the parameters and simulated a 10 d period of flood events their results showed considerable improvements in the fit of the hydrograph as demonstrated by a 22 2 reduction in the root mean squared error this substantiated the capability of the wrf hydro model to simulate major features of flood events with parameter calibration naabil et al 2017 also employed a manual calibration method using two variables the infiltration partition parameter and manning s roughness parameter to simulate the stream discharge of the tono basin in west africa for a year the calibrated model was able to capture the time of the maximum peak discharge in the simulated year however their results also indicated that a yearlong simulation requires additional improvements to capture other major flood event features such as the volume and peak flow rate recently enhanced calibration methods that utilize parameter estimation tool software senatore et al 2015 or implement additional channel infiltration function lahmers et al 2019 have also been employed to improve the performance of the wrf hydro model these parameter calibration methods however still have performance inadequacies in terms of input forcing datasets and residual error reduction which arise not only from parameter uncertainties but also from other uncertainties inherent in the model s structural limitations following recent developments in sophisticated machine learning techniques many studies in the field of hydrology have focused on adopting these techniques to interpolate meteorological data appelhans et al 2015 modeling groundwater xu et al 2014 xu valocchi 2015 sahoo et al 2017 and forecasting streamflow rasouli et al 2012 shortridge et al 2016 among many efforts long short term memory lstm which is a recurrent neural network rnn has been developed and widely used to better process long term sequential datasets hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 greff et al 2015 kratzert et al 2018 employed lstm networks to simulate runoff using catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample datasets of 241 catchments they compared this model to the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma of new england south atlantic gulf arkansas white red and pacific northwest regions of the united states the results revealed that the lstm model could predict runoff from climate observations with an accuracy comparable to that of the sac sma model however they also reported that lstm relied strongly on large datasets and as a data driven model it had no explicit representation of real world hydrological processes later to optimize the parameters the lstm with the ant lion optimizer alo model lstm alo was employed by yuan et al 2018 to predict monthly runoff in the astor river basin in pakistan the study demonstrated that the lstm alo model improved the model performance by demonstrating the sensitivity of lstm to datasets and parameter values likewise multiple studies have applied and improved machine learning algorithms to replace physically based models showing that the lstm model exhibits a comparable or better performance in simulating runoff yuan et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 recent studies have shown the potential of machine learning techniques in overcoming the limitations or errors in hydrologic models xu et al 2014 konapala et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to improve the prediction of physically based regional groundwater flow models in the republican river basin of the united states xu et al 2014 introduced a combination of two machine learning methods instance based weighting and support vector regression the results showed that the data driven models based on machine learning algorithms could predict errors in outputs from the groundwater models thus correcting the simulated outputs by removing the errors konapala et al 2020 demonstrated the potential of a hybrid model to simulate streamflow using the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac and lstm to build two different hybrid models they compared different combinations of the sac and lstm models in 531 catchments across the conterminous united states they showed considerable improvements in the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value with the hybrid models furthermore yang et al 2020 employed anns coupled with a categorization approach ca to simulate streamflow in data limited areas to generate training data they used a geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm and computer vision to extract spatial features to use as inputs the prediction results of their combined model showed improved nse and percent bias pbias values when compared to the gbhm standalone simulation this study also shows the potential of various applications including machine learning techniques for overcoming the limitations in previous hydrological models this study proposes a hybrid model combining a machine learning algorithm lstm and the wrf hydro model hereafter referred to as wrf hydro lstm to improve streamflow prediction and demonstrates improved prediction skills with the suggested approach and the model sensitivity of different datasets and hyperparameters over soyangho lake south korea in this study lstm was used to predict the residual errors between observations and wrf hydro simulations it is distinguished from existing studies of correcting biases of streamflow prediction using statistical approaches e g hashino et al 2007 farmer et al 2018 which are limited in simulating unprecedented or extreme streamflow because the models consider those conditions to be outliers in particular we present how the model s performance can vary with different datasets and hyperparameters which have not been addressed in previous related studies e g konapala et al 2020 the simulations using wrf hydro and lstm individually hereafter referred to as wrf hydro only and lstm only respectively were also compared with the simulations of the proposed model wrf hydro lstm 2 methods 2 1 wrf hydro model the wrf hydro model was first introduced by the national center for atmospheric research ncar under the research applications laboratory as a hydrological extension package that could be coupled with the wrf model gochis chen 2003 it was designed to improve simulations representing terrestrial hydrological processes in the wrf model currently the wrf hydro model itself has the capabilities of a distributed and physically based hydrological modeling system it not only couples regional atmospheric models i e the wrf model but also acts as an uncoupled stand alone land surface hydrological model the uncoupled mode which is the model configuration used in this study utilizes one way process using a meteorological forcing dataset while the coupled mode has a two way interaction process between the climate model and the components of the wrf hydro model there are two options for the land surface model in the wrf hydro model noah and noah multiparameterization noah mp land surface models the wrf hydro model can simulate the three dimensional distribution of discharge including under the land surface whereas previous models had only been able to simulate one dimensional discharges gochis et al 2018 because the wrf hydro model uses noah land surface models and can simulate three dimensional distribution it is also called the noah distribution or ncar distributed hydrological modeling system gochis chen 2003 the available physics options include land surface parameterization surface overland flow saturated subsurface flow conceptual or empirical base flow channel routing and reservoir routing gochis et al 2018 using these options the wrf hydro model can simulate terrestrial hydrological processes and energy fluxes with multi spatiotemporal resolution in this study we activated surface overland saturated subsurface and channel routing for the routing module the steepest descent for the surface overland flow routing diffusive wave for the channel routing and exponential bucket for the base flow model were used 2 2 lstm networks the rnn model is widely used to manipulate sequential data in machine learning lipton 2015 however rnn has limitations in terms of learning long term dependencies due to gradient vanishing during multiple backpropagation processes the lstm network has been devised to mitigate the weaknesses of rnn models for long term sequential datasets hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 greff et al 2015 lstm is a memory strengthened version of rnn that can process long term sequential data with a low level of gradient vanishing compared to other algorithms with long term memory the lstm algorithm can predict multivariate time series data with high accuracy hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 the lstm block structure can model time series prediction including long term dependencies as such this study employed lstm networks which have an outstanding ability to process time series data fang et al 2017 kratzert et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 in the wrf hydro lstm approach lstm provides residual error prediction which is difficult to predict because it is a consequence of multiple processes the lstm network has a modified rnn structure that has an additional cell state structure in the hidden layer which is known as the lstm block to enable the learning of long term time dependencies the main principle of lstm can be explained using memory cells and nonlinear gates which maintain its state and regulate the flow of information in the cell state structure greff et al 2015 with a constant error carousel cec c an input gate i an output gate o and a forget gate f fig 1 the cec is a neuron that keeps the error constant and prevents gradient vanishing due to backpropagation the input gate and output gate serve as signal filters for distinguishing the time dependent and time independent signals to prevent input and output weight conflicts by installing the input gate in front of the cec and the output gate at the back past information can be used selectively when required by the signal to control the value of the cec the forget gate receives an error from the cec and causes the cec to forget the error when it is considered unnecessary for demonstrating effective and reasonable modeling performance in the lstm model we need to fine tune the hyperparameters and select proper optimizers loss functions and activation functions the hyperparameters are parameter sets that are used to control the quality of learning which depend on the structure of the machine learning algorithm as the machine learning process in the lstm model is mostly based on stochastic gradient descent optimization the principal parameters for efficient and accurate learning performance are considered as the number of hidden layers number of epochs and nodes neurons in the hidden layer learning rate and batch size kratzert et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 an epoch indicates a complete training process using the entire training dataset batch size is the total amount of training data allotted in a single batch learning rate is the step size in the training process and a node is a computational unit that organizes a network in a hidden layer for these variables there is not an exact reference number or calculation method therefore their values should be set by user preference depending on the type of dataset or via a trial and error method 2 3 wrf hydro lstm approach we developed the wrf hydro lstm approach fig 2 to improve streamflow prediction using the traditional wrf hydro model while preserving the physical constraints in the model therefore to minimize the impact on physical constraints and maximize the strength of the lstm we used the lstm for predicting the difference between the observed and wrf hydro simulated inflows residual errors from the meteorological inputs as previously noted residual errors are consequences of multiple sources and are difficult to quantify which makes it difficult to predict and remove them however this approach was developed based on the assumption that the residual errors in the model result would have a pattern in our approach lstm modeling succeeds the wrf hydro simulation step and processes inputs independently as shown in fig 2 as presented in fig 2 we initially generated the streamflow simulation data using the wrf hydro model i e wrf hydro only approach followed by the calculation of residual errors between the simulated and observed data for the lstm model input with residual errors and the meteorological forcing dataset we optimized the hyperparameters and trained the lstm model finally we predicted the residual errors of the future time step using a trained lstm model and applied the predicted values to the wrf hydro simulation for the future time step thus the wrf hydro lstm approach improved the conventional wrf hydro model simulation by applying predictive but difficult to quantify errors from multiple uncertainties 2 4 case study from the soyangho lake basin 2 4 1 study area we applied the wrf hydro lstm approach for the soyangho lake basin located in the northeastern region of south korea which extends over the province of gangwon do fig 3 a the soyangho lake basin is the main source of water and hydroelectricity in the seoul metropolitan region which is the most densely populated region in south korea the total area of the basin is 2703 k m 2 with a mean annual precipitation of 1154 mm 1981 2010 national water resources management information system 2003 soyangho lake was created by the soyang dam which has a storage capacity of 2900 million tons of water it is the largest rockfill dam in asia and serves multiple purposes including hydroelectricity generation water supply and flood control the mean annual inflow of soyangho lake was 2 148 10 9 m 3 and its streamflow was the target of the simulations performed in this study the korea water resources corporation routinely measures streamflow using gauges and provides inflow and outflow data for the dam owing to the absence of any other hydraulic structure in the upstream area of soyangho lake we used the hourly inflow rate for the calibration and evaluation to exclude anthropogenic impacts such as outflow control in the upstream region 2 4 2 meteorological forcings and terrain datasets in this study the noah mp model within the wrf hydro model was configured with a grid size of 1500 m including the entire watershed area of soyangho lake for the routing module nested routing grid cells within the land surface model with a grid size of 100 m were used and the number of grid cells was 660 660 for meteorological data 2013 2018 we used the local data assimilation and prediction system ldaps datasets which was the product of a numerical weather prediction model that employed a three dimensional data assimilation technique with a 1 5 km horizontal spatial resolution and 70 vertical layers ldaps provided the 3 h data of precipitation temperature surface pressure u and v components of wind specific humidity and longwave and shortwave radiations which are the meteorological forcings required to drive the wrf hydro model among these variables precipitation is the most important variable for streamflow simulation the data assimilation product ldaps data for precipitation was replaced with observational data gridded using the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism method daly et al 2007 daly et al 2008 kim et al 2013 prism considers distance elevation cluster vertical layer topographic facet coastal proximity topographic position and effective terrain of the station by weights the data consistency among the meteorological variables might be compromised to some extent but it is necessary to improve the precipitation data because it is critical for accurately predicting streamflow the observed gauge based precipitation data from the automated synoptic observing system asos stations in the upstream area injae sokcho daegwallyeong and gangneung 1 2 fig 3b were used because these stations directly affected the streamflow of the basin and were interpolated in the grid data at a 1 5 km resolution terrain datasets were required for the wrf hydro model each grid of the domain for the land surface model contained static terrestrial data such as those for land use soil type topographic height and vegetation fraction gridded data was interpolated horizontally using the wrf preprocessing system wps geographical static dataset with a 30 resolution which consisted of the united states geological survey datasets and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis for the land use data we used 20 modis categories a reconnaissance soil map provided by the rural development administration of korea was used to classify the soil types and their characteristics fig 3c soil types were classified and their material properties were updated accordingly reconnaissance soil maps with scales of 1 50 000 contain soil characteristic data for soil type slope soil fraction drainage effective soil depth and land use type these maps were used to extract two dimensional soil texture type information and aggregated for a resolution of 1 5 km furthermore we used spatial topographic data and lake polygons from shuttle elevation derivatives hydrosheds at multiple scales for the routing module in this study hydrologically conditioned elevation con data from hydrosheds with a resolution of 3 were used for the terrain elevation data con data is a result of dem postprocesses such as the deepening of open water surfaces weeding of the coastal zone stream burning filtering molding of valley courses sink filling and carving through barriers lehner et al 2008 using these terrain datasets we generated flow directions watersheds stream and reservoir networks one dimensional parameter files for lake and stream networks nest grid cells for routing and the lake s geographical information moreover hydrolakes data which represent a global digital map of lakes larger than 10 ha were employed to improve the ability of the model to reflect the role of the lake messager et al 2016 2 4 3 experimental designs we performed three different types of model simulations wrf hydro only wrf hydro lstm and lstm only for the soyangho lake basin initially we performed a wrf hydro only simulation from meteorological data from 2013 to 2018 using eight meteorological forcing data variables table 1 based on the calculated residual errors of the wrf hydro only model with respect to the observations and meteorological variables the lstm model was trained with data from 2013 to 2016 and validated for 2017 table 1 notably the average of the spatially variant meteorological datasets was used for training the lstm model the trained lstm model with optimized hyperparameters predicted the residual errors and then applied them to the wrf hydro only streamflow prediction for 2018 please refer to section 2 4 4 for details on the optimized hyperparameters of the lstms finally we performed an lstm only simulation to predict streamflow similar to the wrf hydro lstm approach the lstm model was trained but this was undertaken with the ldaps meteorological dataset and observed streamflow in the wrf hydro lstm model table 1 in addition the hyperparameter values were optimized for the lstm only case therefore all the settings were the same as in the wrf hydro lstm approach except for the target dataset and values for the hyperparameters we then predicted the streamflow for 2018 using the trained lstm model the streamflow prediction of the wrf hydro lstm approach was evaluate compared to that of wrf hydro only and lstm only we conducted a comparative analysis using three commonly used metrics for hydrological model evaluation pbias nse and the correlation coefficient r the metrics are computed as follows 1 pbias t 1 n q sim t q obs t t 1 n q obs t 100 2 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t t 1 n q sim t q obs 3 r t 1 n q obs t q obs q sim t q sim t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 t 1 n q sim t q sim 2 where q sim is the mean of the simulated streamflow q obs is the mean of the observed streamflow q sim t is the simulated streamflow at time t and q obs t is the observed streamflow at time t pbias is widely used to evaluate hydrological models by indicating the magnitude of over or under estimations compared to the observations the nse and r values were used to evaluate the predictive power of the model and the linear correlation between the observations and predictions respectively for the wrf hydro lstm and lstm only models we used the 50th percentile result while repeating the same experiment 30 times a sensitivity test was conducted to examine the impact of the training dataset duration and determine the years for which the data needed to be used to evaluate model performance consequently we used four years of training data 2013 2016 which was the longest sequential period possible with available data and we labeled it according to the starting and ending training periods tp1316 the test sets were configured with a total of 10 cases with different training periods tp13 14 15 16 1314 1415 1516 1315 1416 and 1316 for the validation we utilized data from 2017 because it is the last year before the prediction year 2018 it is impossible to have information about the prediction period i e whether it will be a wet dry or normal year beforehand thus we sought to improve the performance using the closest year s data which is expected to have a climate trend similar to that of the prediction period under climate change trenberth 2011 furthermore the validation year 2017 and the prediction year 2018 were wet years we then performed an additional validation year for a case with a dry year 2014 we examined how the characteristics of the validation year influence the model performance with the cases using 2013 2015 2016 and 2017 for training and 2014 for validation tp13 1517 2 4 4 hyperparameter tuning for the lstm model the number of nodes per hidden layer batch size learning rate and number of epochs must be determined as introduced in section 2 2 in this study the random search method bergstra bengio 2012 was used to identify a set of optimal values for hyperparameters because they are nonlinearly correlated and have no fixed range we generated 200 random hyperparameter values for the candidate set within a certain range table 2 and evaluated the values for both the wrf hydro lstm and lstm only methods the range was configured based on experience and results from previous studies stathakis 2009 masters luschi 2018 as the lstm model shuffles the split data for each epoch the starting point for training changes and the training results may vary within a certain range therefore we permitted 10 iterations to evaluate each candidate set and selected the optimal set which had the lowest mean squared error in the validation process in this study two lstm hidden layers and an adaptive moment estimation optimizer adam kingma ba 2014 were used for stable and efficient model optimization adam the latest version of the optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent can rapidly and accurately search for optimal machine learning values we set the adam parameters in the keras api using default values 0 001 for the learning rate 0 9 for the momentum decay rate and 0 999 for the adaptive term decay rate to train the model with updated weights we employed the mean squared error for the loss function and mean absolute error to optimize the objective function 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the wrf hydro model we first evaluated the performance of the wrf hydro model for peak flow in 2018 fig 4 the hydrograph indicates that the simulated values at the peak point were slightly lower and decreased more slowly than the observed values moreover in comparison with the observations the nse of the wrf hydro model was 0 93 r was 0 96 and pbias was 6 12 suggesting that the model captured a total volume of inflow that is quite close to the observations albeit with a slight overestimation these results show that the wrf hydro model is capable of simulating streamflow with effective predictive skills for a specific short period of a few weeks we then evaluated the performance of a one year streamflow simulation using the same model fig 5 the evaluation results for a year pbias 11 78 nse 0 72 and r 0 88 indicated a slight decrease in performance compared to the short term case fig 5a the results were still acceptable in hydrological modeling according to moriasi et al 2007 because the nse was higher than 0 5 pbias was less than 25 r and nse decreased slightly and the pbias increased from 6 12 to 11 78 suggesting considerable underestimation of streamflow for an extended period we identified multiple peaks indicating a large difference between the observations and model simulation results e g between may and june as well as at the beginning of july and the sum of the differences overestimated and underestimated values contributed to the relatively large pbias 3 2 evaluation of streamflow prediction skills we evaluated the performance of wrf hydro lstm in comparison to wrf hydro only and lstm only for simulating the 2018 streamflow in the soyangho lake basin fig 5 the streamflow simulated with wrf hydro lstm and lstm only had a hydrograph shape markedly similar to that of the observations unlike the streamflow simulated with wrf hydro only although some of the peak flows were still captured with limitations in both wrf hydro lstm and lstm only the metrics also indicated the superiority of both wrf hydro lstm and lstm only over wrf hydro only with an nse of 0 95 and r above 0 97 this result was predicted as the loss function for optimization in the lstm model and directly associated with the nse and r which was set with the mean squared error wrf hydro lstm showed a decrease in pbias whereas lstm only showed an increase in pbias in comparison to wrf hydro only the pbias values indicate that the underestimation bias of wrf hydro only was improved in wrf hydro lstm otherwise lstm only was considerably more biased toward underestimation than wrf hydro only consequently the volume of streamflow accumulated for 2018 fig 6 which is closely related to pbias showed that out of the three models only wrf hydro lstm captured the observed trends reasonably similarly we noted that the performance of lstm only is poor in low flows thus exerting a relatively smaller effect on the loss function than high flows because lstm uses a loss function for regression in the training process without any physical constraints such as conservation principles it can violate the laws of physics while minimizing losses this could further worsen the results in this study we found that these characteristics of lstm evaluated by the range of values and standard deviation sd could limit the results owing to the variability of datasets while lstm only with a wide range of fluctuations in values and high variability between dry and wet seasons directly predicted the streamflow range 0 2325 sd 174 8 2018 the lstm model in the wrf hydro lstm approach could only predict residual error whose values fluctuate less seasonally range 713 1067 sd 109 8 in 2018 among the different roles of lstm the wrf hydro lstm approach simulated the streamflow in a manner markedly closer to the observations while systematically limiting the impacts of possible errors from the lstm model and conserving physical constraints as opposed to lstm only 3 3 training data sensitivity of wrf hydro lstm and lstm only we also examined how the duration and timing of the training data influenced prediction skills fig 7 demonstrates that climate conditions such as precipitation show strong interannual variability and hence the training data from different years i e dry or wet years could influence the streamflow prediction skills of lstm models notably in this study the lstm models i e wrf hydro lstm and lstm only were trained with data from the years 2013 to 2016 and validated with data from 2017 and the trained models were then evaluated for the year 2018 in the default case tp1316 we conducted sensitivity tests with various training datasets utilizing 30 iterations per dataset over numerous time periods 1 2 3 and 4 years between 2013 and 2016 the nse and r values in all cases of wrf hydro lstm and lstm only were found to be close to 1 for all evaluations with the three metrics nse r and pbias fig 8 without considerable differences between the cases such model performance was foreseeable because we used the mean squared error for the loss function to train the lstm models furthermore the ranges of nse and r values in the 30 iterations of lstm only were much wider than those in the wrf hydro lstm model indicating that wrf hydro lstm provides a more stable prediction than lstm only these aspects can be explained by the difference in target value and the influence of the lstm model prediction between wrf hydro lstm and lstm only the wrf hydro lstm model uses residual errors as target values for simulation and predicts streamflow as the sum of the two components in contrast lstm only uses streamflow data as the target value and predicts the streamflow directly this may lead to more systematic errors owing to the wide range of fluctuations in the streamflow values the pbias values in fig 8 vary markedly according to the training dataset used for the lstm models in particular the prediction results based on pbias were substantially influenced by the configuration of the training dataset the best configuration of the training dataset can be represented by the consistency and similarity of the training dataset with the target dataset in wrf hydro lstm the cases ending in 2015 showed wide variation and large absolute pbias the cases using the years 2013 or 2016 as the training data performed relatively better than the cases ending in 2015 table 3 shows the smallest absolute pbias in cases using 2016 as the training set tp16 tp1516 and tp1416 this was followed by tp13 and tp1314 which included 2013 in the training set these findings can be attributed to the fact that the prediction year i e 2018 with a relatively large residual error between the observation inflow and wrf hydro simulated inflow is analogous to the patterns in the years 2013 and 2016 fig 7 in the case of lstm only the cases with training datasets that either begin or end in 2015 dry year showed unstable pbias and the smallest absolute pbias in cases mainly included the year 2013 wet year in the training set i e tp13 and tp1315 followed by tp1415 tp15 and tp1314 fig 8 and table 3 this tendency was similar but less prominent when compared to the wrf hydro lstm model these findings suggest that the training data should have a pattern similar to that of the target data for the best performance of lstm the year 2018 wet year furthermore we identified the importance of data consistency from the results of tp1415 and tp1314 according to the similarity between the target year 2018 wet year and 2013 wet year tp1314 should have produced a better result than tp1415 however it showed an even higher value for the pbias table 3 this result can be explained by the consistency of data responsible for stabilizing the lstm training process as clearly shown in the results of tp1415 and tp1315 two consecutive dry years i e the years 2014 and 2015 yielded a better result whereas the cases with nonconsecutive composition produced a higher value of pbias even though they included the year 2013 i e tp1316 and tp1314 we also found that the number of years included in the training dataset that had a similar pattern to the target year was more important than the length of the training period for example tp1316 default case in the wrf hydro lstm model had the longest training period and showed the best performance among all the cases tp16 and tp1516 yielded equivalent results although they used a shorter period table 3 finally we employed another case using 2014 dry year for validation and 2013 2015 2016 and 2017 for the training period tp13 1517 table 3 regardless of the characteristics of the validation year two distinct cases the wet year 2017 and the dry year 2014 showed similarly successful performance with their pbias nse and r values tp1316 vs tp13 1517 in table 3 this result shows that our lstm approaches had stable performance regardless of the characteristics i e wet or dry of the validation year 3 4 hyperparameter tuning for wrf hydro lstm and lstm only hyperparameter tuning for each model is required to utilize the lstm for the lstm only and wrf hydro lstm models we tuned hyperparameters separately for all different cases with lstm only and wrf hydro lstm and all cases showed different optimal values for each hyperparameter table 4 focusing on the default case tp1316 evaluated in section 3 2 in table 4 revealed that the wrf hydro lstm model used more nodes for the first hidden layer and smaller values for the batch size and learning rate than lstm only a large number of nodes in the hidden layer indicate that the data requires a greater capacity for wide training networks the smaller batch size and learning rate indicate that the training data are difficult to generalize thus requiring smaller gradient steps for updating the weights goodfellow et al 2016 this result suggests that the prediction of residual error wrf hydro lstm requires a more substantial workload than that of streamflow lstm only moreover table 4 also shows that the optimal values for each case varied regardless of the duration and specific year used for the training the details of data sensitivity test in section 3 3 and thus there is no noticeable tendency among the cases because all cases showed different combinations of numbers without clear characteristics we found that employing the random search method was efficient and appropriate for finding optimal values nevertheless the results indicate that the case with data restricted to training the lstm model for optimized prediction skill leads to a large number of nodes small batch sizes and low learning rates the wrf hydro lstm cases tended to have smaller batch sizes compared to the lstm only cases implying that the residual errors require much more iterations for training the lstm model than for streamflow while streamflow has many variable values limiting the performance of lstm it has factors that can be generalized such as streamflow seasonality and the correlation between precipitation data r 0 8841 in 2018 the generalized pattern in the training dataset makes training the lstm model easier in contrast residual errors have an ambiguous correlation with other forcing variables including precipitation r 0 48 in 2018 therefore training with residual errors requires more effort than training with streamflow 4 conclusions this study aims to improve the streamflow prediction of the wrf hydro model using a machine learning algorithm i e lstm particularly for improving long term streamflow predictions our analysis in soyangho lake south korea demonstrates that the strength of machine learning to be used in improving physically based model which is not addressed much before the proposed wrf hydro lstm predicts differences between wrf hydro predictions and observations through embedded lstm model and considerably improve wrf hydro predictions wrf hydro lstm and lstm only show improved results in terms of the nse and correlation coefficient compared to wrf hydro only however in terms of the pbias wrf hydro lstm had a better value than lstm only these dissimilarities in pbias values were mainly attributable to the several limitations of lstm which tends to generate more systematic errors with highly variable datasets and optimizes the weights based on the given loss function without any physical constraints although lstm makes nonlinear modeling easier and allows a relatively short computational time lstm only is limited in extreme event predictions and thus wrf hydro lstm is considered the most suitable for streamflow prediction furthermore we performed a sensitivity test on the training dataset in terms of its length and elements 1 2 3 or 4 years of data with different component years the results indicated that the correlation coefficient and nse value were not overly sensitive to different training sets because we used the mean squared error for the loss function but the pbias value differed substantially depending on the training set both wrf hydro lstm and lstm only displayed improved performance when the training set contained specific years i e the years 2013 and 2015 for lstm only and 2016 for wrf hydro lstm that had input characteristics i e precipitation streamflow and residual errors similar to those of the target year more years similar to the target year in trend and composition in the training dataset was also crucial for the prediction result in addition a test case with different validation years 2014 supported that the model performance may vary with different validation and target years quantitatively not qualitatively as such it is usually impossible to recognize the trend of the target data for prediction thus we recommend that using large data would be advantageous for the ideal performance of the lstm model our approach has several limitations that need to be improved for clarity and performance we evaluated the model performance through the representative basin soyangho lake south korea with accumulated observational data 2013 2018 notwithstanding the limited period of data and number of basins used we argue that the evaluation results demonstrate the strength of the combined structure of the wrf hydro lstm and the potential of lstm application although there was a short period for training and calibration meteorological conditions such as precipitation in south korea show significant yearly seasonal variations and most years have dry periods in winter and spring with heavy rain periods in summer the data period may limit the performance to some extent but the 6 year data is acceptable given the data availability from the kldaps dataset however the lstm model as a data driven model has high data dependency which requires an accurate and sufficient training dataset limited available historical meteorological data for training the model should be complemented by techniques such as cross validation and an increased number of training iterations in recent years hydrologists have attempted to apply machine learning algorithms in lieu of physically based models because of their efficiency and favorable performance given this trend we showed that machine learning algorithms can be used to improve streamflow prediction through physically based modeling although the machine learning approach has limitations it has more potential in this method than when used directly to make streamflow predictions although the approach continues to be developed with new types of algorithms such as physics guided neural networks pgnn they still include a limited number of options read et al 2019 attempted to develop a pgnn to improve the prediction of lake water temperatures but they also had to simplify the physics of the system owing to this limitation therefore our proposed approach improves machine learning limitations and utilizes its strengths for improvement during application furthermore because our approach requires only residual errors and meteorological forcing data to drive the physically based model it can be applied to other models and easily used to efficiently improve simulations of any basin we also note that wrf hydro facilitates applying the trained lstm to the upstream and downstream streamflow i e to the stream without a gauge with transfer learning for deep learning neural networks weiss et al 2016 a pretrained model for one domain with a set of hyperparameters can be fine tuned on any relevant domain or problem although in this study we focused on understanding model sensitivity by training the model separately for all different cases a well developed wrf hydro lstm model for one basin can be applied to different locations in the same or another basin using a transfer learning technique the applicability of the trained wrf hydro lstm should be further investigated in a future study data availability the datasets for this study are accessible online the hydrosheds conditioned dem and lake polygons are available at http www

3713,researchers have attempted to use machine learning algorithms to replace physically based models for streamflow prediction although existing studies have contributed to improving machine learning methods they still have weaknesses such as large dataset requirements and overfitting therefore we propose an approach that combines the weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system wrf hydro and the long short term memory lstm network i e wrf hydro lstm to improve streamflow simulations in this approach lstm was employed to predict the residual errors of wrf hydro in contrast the conventional approach with lstm predicts streamflow directly here we performed numerical experiments to predict the inflow of soyangho lake in south korea using wrf hydro lstm wrf hydro only and lstm only wrf hydro lstm and lstm only showed better results nse 0 95 and r greater than 0 96 compared to wrf hydro only nse 0 72 and r 0 88 however in terms of the percent bias wrf hydro lstm had a better value 1 75 than lstm only 17 36 while the lstm only follows objective functions and not physical principles wrf hydro lstm simulates residual errors and efficiently decreases uncertainties that are inherent with conventional methods furthermore a sensitivity test on the training dataset indicated that the correlation coefficient and nse value were not overly sensitive but the pbias value differed substantially depending on the training set this study demonstrates that wrf hydro lstm is particularly useful for representing real world physical constraints and thus can potentially improve streamflow prediction compared to using either of the two approaches exclusively 1 introduction streamflow describes the volume of available freshwater and the flood discharge therefore accurate streamflow prediction is important for water resource management predicted basin scale streamflow can be used for effectively managing water resources by controlling the water storage of the reservoir which plays an important role in water power generation and flood alleviation as well as in irrigation schemes wedgbrow et al 2002 to achieve reliable predictions numerous hydrological models have been developed and utilized to simulate streamflow chiew et al 2003 asefa et al 2006 naabil et al 2017 which can be classified as empirical conceptual and physically based while lumped models including empirical and conceptual models use a limited number of parameters and basin average input data physically based distributed hydrological models are configured with various physically relevant and spatially distributed parameters to represent the spatial distribution of metrological environmental and physical characteristics as well as multiple principles of hydrological systems to represent simplified real world conditions schumann 1993 moradkhani sorooshian 2008 el hassan et al 2013 thus distributed models are expected to simulate a hydrological cycle that obeys the laws of nature better than the conceptual rainfall runoff models donnelly makowecki moore 1999 el hassan et al 2013 and have strengths for hydrological forecasting carpenter georgakakos 2006 furthermore the use of physically interpretable parameters in physically based distributed models enables us to understand various hydrological processes in relatively high temporal and spatial resolutions including not only streamflow processes but also evapotranspiration processes and soil moisture dynamics devia et al 2015 although considerable efforts have been made to improve the performance of hydrological models boyle et al 2000 chuck et al 2004 vrugt et al 2005 crochemore et al 2016 they are still limited by uncertainties in their datasets heterogeneity in their parameters and variables scale effects and nonlinearities in their process dynamics the structure of which is mostly based on unknown or complex boundary conditions and initial states liu gupta 2007 paniconi putti 2015 lane et al 2019 brigode et al 2013 has shown that the major source of uncertainty in hydrological modeling is the lack of model robustness which is the result of unsuitable model structures and inappropriate calibration procedures additionally the annual and interannual variability in streamflow and effects of climate change also increases these uncertainties which further complicates water resource management chiew et al 2003 the weather research and forecasting hydrological modeling system wrf hydro couples a fully distributed land surface model with routing components which is used to simulate the streamflow of watersheds it includes multiple conceptual and physically based approaches high resolution terrestrial hydrological processes and energy fluxes accordingly the model has been used for water cycle analysis replication of observations and in forecast systems in numerous fields koren et al 1999 yucel et al 2015 senatore et al 2015 arnault et al 2016 givati et al 2016 xiang et al 2017 maidment 2017 kerandi et al 2018 similar to other physically based models the wrf hydro model requires parameter calibration for optimal performance earlier studies mainly applied manual calibration through trial and error methods for instance yucel et al 2015 simulated the streamflow for specific flood events in the western black sea region of turkey using a manual and stepwise calibration method by selecting six parameters affecting the shape of the hydrograph they calibrated the parameters and simulated a 10 d period of flood events their results showed considerable improvements in the fit of the hydrograph as demonstrated by a 22 2 reduction in the root mean squared error this substantiated the capability of the wrf hydro model to simulate major features of flood events with parameter calibration naabil et al 2017 also employed a manual calibration method using two variables the infiltration partition parameter and manning s roughness parameter to simulate the stream discharge of the tono basin in west africa for a year the calibrated model was able to capture the time of the maximum peak discharge in the simulated year however their results also indicated that a yearlong simulation requires additional improvements to capture other major flood event features such as the volume and peak flow rate recently enhanced calibration methods that utilize parameter estimation tool software senatore et al 2015 or implement additional channel infiltration function lahmers et al 2019 have also been employed to improve the performance of the wrf hydro model these parameter calibration methods however still have performance inadequacies in terms of input forcing datasets and residual error reduction which arise not only from parameter uncertainties but also from other uncertainties inherent in the model s structural limitations following recent developments in sophisticated machine learning techniques many studies in the field of hydrology have focused on adopting these techniques to interpolate meteorological data appelhans et al 2015 modeling groundwater xu et al 2014 xu valocchi 2015 sahoo et al 2017 and forecasting streamflow rasouli et al 2012 shortridge et al 2016 among many efforts long short term memory lstm which is a recurrent neural network rnn has been developed and widely used to better process long term sequential datasets hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 greff et al 2015 kratzert et al 2018 employed lstm networks to simulate runoff using catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample datasets of 241 catchments they compared this model to the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma of new england south atlantic gulf arkansas white red and pacific northwest regions of the united states the results revealed that the lstm model could predict runoff from climate observations with an accuracy comparable to that of the sac sma model however they also reported that lstm relied strongly on large datasets and as a data driven model it had no explicit representation of real world hydrological processes later to optimize the parameters the lstm with the ant lion optimizer alo model lstm alo was employed by yuan et al 2018 to predict monthly runoff in the astor river basin in pakistan the study demonstrated that the lstm alo model improved the model performance by demonstrating the sensitivity of lstm to datasets and parameter values likewise multiple studies have applied and improved machine learning algorithms to replace physically based models showing that the lstm model exhibits a comparable or better performance in simulating runoff yuan et al 2018 kratzert et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 recent studies have shown the potential of machine learning techniques in overcoming the limitations or errors in hydrologic models xu et al 2014 konapala et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to improve the prediction of physically based regional groundwater flow models in the republican river basin of the united states xu et al 2014 introduced a combination of two machine learning methods instance based weighting and support vector regression the results showed that the data driven models based on machine learning algorithms could predict errors in outputs from the groundwater models thus correcting the simulated outputs by removing the errors konapala et al 2020 demonstrated the potential of a hybrid model to simulate streamflow using the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac and lstm to build two different hybrid models they compared different combinations of the sac and lstm models in 531 catchments across the conterminous united states they showed considerable improvements in the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value with the hybrid models furthermore yang et al 2020 employed anns coupled with a categorization approach ca to simulate streamflow in data limited areas to generate training data they used a geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm and computer vision to extract spatial features to use as inputs the prediction results of their combined model showed improved nse and percent bias pbias values when compared to the gbhm standalone simulation this study also shows the potential of various applications including machine learning techniques for overcoming the limitations in previous hydrological models this study proposes a hybrid model combining a machine learning algorithm lstm and the wrf hydro model hereafter referred to as wrf hydro lstm to improve streamflow prediction and demonstrates improved prediction skills with the suggested approach and the model sensitivity of different datasets and hyperparameters over soyangho lake south korea in this study lstm was used to predict the residual errors between observations and wrf hydro simulations it is distinguished from existing studies of correcting biases of streamflow prediction using statistical approaches e g hashino et al 2007 farmer et al 2018 which are limited in simulating unprecedented or extreme streamflow because the models consider those conditions to be outliers in particular we present how the model s performance can vary with different datasets and hyperparameters which have not been addressed in previous related studies e g konapala et al 2020 the simulations using wrf hydro and lstm individually hereafter referred to as wrf hydro only and lstm only respectively were also compared with the simulations of the proposed model wrf hydro lstm 2 methods 2 1 wrf hydro model the wrf hydro model was first introduced by the national center for atmospheric research ncar under the research applications laboratory as a hydrological extension package that could be coupled with the wrf model gochis chen 2003 it was designed to improve simulations representing terrestrial hydrological processes in the wrf model currently the wrf hydro model itself has the capabilities of a distributed and physically based hydrological modeling system it not only couples regional atmospheric models i e the wrf model but also acts as an uncoupled stand alone land surface hydrological model the uncoupled mode which is the model configuration used in this study utilizes one way process using a meteorological forcing dataset while the coupled mode has a two way interaction process between the climate model and the components of the wrf hydro model there are two options for the land surface model in the wrf hydro model noah and noah multiparameterization noah mp land surface models the wrf hydro model can simulate the three dimensional distribution of discharge including under the land surface whereas previous models had only been able to simulate one dimensional discharges gochis et al 2018 because the wrf hydro model uses noah land surface models and can simulate three dimensional distribution it is also called the noah distribution or ncar distributed hydrological modeling system gochis chen 2003 the available physics options include land surface parameterization surface overland flow saturated subsurface flow conceptual or empirical base flow channel routing and reservoir routing gochis et al 2018 using these options the wrf hydro model can simulate terrestrial hydrological processes and energy fluxes with multi spatiotemporal resolution in this study we activated surface overland saturated subsurface and channel routing for the routing module the steepest descent for the surface overland flow routing diffusive wave for the channel routing and exponential bucket for the base flow model were used 2 2 lstm networks the rnn model is widely used to manipulate sequential data in machine learning lipton 2015 however rnn has limitations in terms of learning long term dependencies due to gradient vanishing during multiple backpropagation processes the lstm network has been devised to mitigate the weaknesses of rnn models for long term sequential datasets hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 greff et al 2015 lstm is a memory strengthened version of rnn that can process long term sequential data with a low level of gradient vanishing compared to other algorithms with long term memory the lstm algorithm can predict multivariate time series data with high accuracy hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 the lstm block structure can model time series prediction including long term dependencies as such this study employed lstm networks which have an outstanding ability to process time series data fang et al 2017 kratzert et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 in the wrf hydro lstm approach lstm provides residual error prediction which is difficult to predict because it is a consequence of multiple processes the lstm network has a modified rnn structure that has an additional cell state structure in the hidden layer which is known as the lstm block to enable the learning of long term time dependencies the main principle of lstm can be explained using memory cells and nonlinear gates which maintain its state and regulate the flow of information in the cell state structure greff et al 2015 with a constant error carousel cec c an input gate i an output gate o and a forget gate f fig 1 the cec is a neuron that keeps the error constant and prevents gradient vanishing due to backpropagation the input gate and output gate serve as signal filters for distinguishing the time dependent and time independent signals to prevent input and output weight conflicts by installing the input gate in front of the cec and the output gate at the back past information can be used selectively when required by the signal to control the value of the cec the forget gate receives an error from the cec and causes the cec to forget the error when it is considered unnecessary for demonstrating effective and reasonable modeling performance in the lstm model we need to fine tune the hyperparameters and select proper optimizers loss functions and activation functions the hyperparameters are parameter sets that are used to control the quality of learning which depend on the structure of the machine learning algorithm as the machine learning process in the lstm model is mostly based on stochastic gradient descent optimization the principal parameters for efficient and accurate learning performance are considered as the number of hidden layers number of epochs and nodes neurons in the hidden layer learning rate and batch size kratzert et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 an epoch indicates a complete training process using the entire training dataset batch size is the total amount of training data allotted in a single batch learning rate is the step size in the training process and a node is a computational unit that organizes a network in a hidden layer for these variables there is not an exact reference number or calculation method therefore their values should be set by user preference depending on the type of dataset or via a trial and error method 2 3 wrf hydro lstm approach we developed the wrf hydro lstm approach fig 2 to improve streamflow prediction using the traditional wrf hydro model while preserving the physical constraints in the model therefore to minimize the impact on physical constraints and maximize the strength of the lstm we used the lstm for predicting the difference between the observed and wrf hydro simulated inflows residual errors from the meteorological inputs as previously noted residual errors are consequences of multiple sources and are difficult to quantify which makes it difficult to predict and remove them however this approach was developed based on the assumption that the residual errors in the model result would have a pattern in our approach lstm modeling succeeds the wrf hydro simulation step and processes inputs independently as shown in fig 2 as presented in fig 2 we initially generated the streamflow simulation data using the wrf hydro model i e wrf hydro only approach followed by the calculation of residual errors between the simulated and observed data for the lstm model input with residual errors and the meteorological forcing dataset we optimized the hyperparameters and trained the lstm model finally we predicted the residual errors of the future time step using a trained lstm model and applied the predicted values to the wrf hydro simulation for the future time step thus the wrf hydro lstm approach improved the conventional wrf hydro model simulation by applying predictive but difficult to quantify errors from multiple uncertainties 2 4 case study from the soyangho lake basin 2 4 1 study area we applied the wrf hydro lstm approach for the soyangho lake basin located in the northeastern region of south korea which extends over the province of gangwon do fig 3 a the soyangho lake basin is the main source of water and hydroelectricity in the seoul metropolitan region which is the most densely populated region in south korea the total area of the basin is 2703 k m 2 with a mean annual precipitation of 1154 mm 1981 2010 national water resources management information system 2003 soyangho lake was created by the soyang dam which has a storage capacity of 2900 million tons of water it is the largest rockfill dam in asia and serves multiple purposes including hydroelectricity generation water supply and flood control the mean annual inflow of soyangho lake was 2 148 10 9 m 3 and its streamflow was the target of the simulations performed in this study the korea water resources corporation routinely measures streamflow using gauges and provides inflow and outflow data for the dam owing to the absence of any other hydraulic structure in the upstream area of soyangho lake we used the hourly inflow rate for the calibration and evaluation to exclude anthropogenic impacts such as outflow control in the upstream region 2 4 2 meteorological forcings and terrain datasets in this study the noah mp model within the wrf hydro model was configured with a grid size of 1500 m including the entire watershed area of soyangho lake for the routing module nested routing grid cells within the land surface model with a grid size of 100 m were used and the number of grid cells was 660 660 for meteorological data 2013 2018 we used the local data assimilation and prediction system ldaps datasets which was the product of a numerical weather prediction model that employed a three dimensional data assimilation technique with a 1 5 km horizontal spatial resolution and 70 vertical layers ldaps provided the 3 h data of precipitation temperature surface pressure u and v components of wind specific humidity and longwave and shortwave radiations which are the meteorological forcings required to drive the wrf hydro model among these variables precipitation is the most important variable for streamflow simulation the data assimilation product ldaps data for precipitation was replaced with observational data gridded using the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism method daly et al 2007 daly et al 2008 kim et al 2013 prism considers distance elevation cluster vertical layer topographic facet coastal proximity topographic position and effective terrain of the station by weights the data consistency among the meteorological variables might be compromised to some extent but it is necessary to improve the precipitation data because it is critical for accurately predicting streamflow the observed gauge based precipitation data from the automated synoptic observing system asos stations in the upstream area injae sokcho daegwallyeong and gangneung 1 2 fig 3b were used because these stations directly affected the streamflow of the basin and were interpolated in the grid data at a 1 5 km resolution terrain datasets were required for the wrf hydro model each grid of the domain for the land surface model contained static terrestrial data such as those for land use soil type topographic height and vegetation fraction gridded data was interpolated horizontally using the wrf preprocessing system wps geographical static dataset with a 30 resolution which consisted of the united states geological survey datasets and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis for the land use data we used 20 modis categories a reconnaissance soil map provided by the rural development administration of korea was used to classify the soil types and their characteristics fig 3c soil types were classified and their material properties were updated accordingly reconnaissance soil maps with scales of 1 50 000 contain soil characteristic data for soil type slope soil fraction drainage effective soil depth and land use type these maps were used to extract two dimensional soil texture type information and aggregated for a resolution of 1 5 km furthermore we used spatial topographic data and lake polygons from shuttle elevation derivatives hydrosheds at multiple scales for the routing module in this study hydrologically conditioned elevation con data from hydrosheds with a resolution of 3 were used for the terrain elevation data con data is a result of dem postprocesses such as the deepening of open water surfaces weeding of the coastal zone stream burning filtering molding of valley courses sink filling and carving through barriers lehner et al 2008 using these terrain datasets we generated flow directions watersheds stream and reservoir networks one dimensional parameter files for lake and stream networks nest grid cells for routing and the lake s geographical information moreover hydrolakes data which represent a global digital map of lakes larger than 10 ha were employed to improve the ability of the model to reflect the role of the lake messager et al 2016 2 4 3 experimental designs we performed three different types of model simulations wrf hydro only wrf hydro lstm and lstm only for the soyangho lake basin initially we performed a wrf hydro only simulation from meteorological data from 2013 to 2018 using eight meteorological forcing data variables table 1 based on the calculated residual errors of the wrf hydro only model with respect to the observations and meteorological variables the lstm model was trained with data from 2013 to 2016 and validated for 2017 table 1 notably the average of the spatially variant meteorological datasets was used for training the lstm model the trained lstm model with optimized hyperparameters predicted the residual errors and then applied them to the wrf hydro only streamflow prediction for 2018 please refer to section 2 4 4 for details on the optimized hyperparameters of the lstms finally we performed an lstm only simulation to predict streamflow similar to the wrf hydro lstm approach the lstm model was trained but this was undertaken with the ldaps meteorological dataset and observed streamflow in the wrf hydro lstm model table 1 in addition the hyperparameter values were optimized for the lstm only case therefore all the settings were the same as in the wrf hydro lstm approach except for the target dataset and values for the hyperparameters we then predicted the streamflow for 2018 using the trained lstm model the streamflow prediction of the wrf hydro lstm approach was evaluate compared to that of wrf hydro only and lstm only we conducted a comparative analysis using three commonly used metrics for hydrological model evaluation pbias nse and the correlation coefficient r the metrics are computed as follows 1 pbias t 1 n q sim t q obs t t 1 n q obs t 100 2 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t t 1 n q sim t q obs 3 r t 1 n q obs t q obs q sim t q sim t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 t 1 n q sim t q sim 2 where q sim is the mean of the simulated streamflow q obs is the mean of the observed streamflow q sim t is the simulated streamflow at time t and q obs t is the observed streamflow at time t pbias is widely used to evaluate hydrological models by indicating the magnitude of over or under estimations compared to the observations the nse and r values were used to evaluate the predictive power of the model and the linear correlation between the observations and predictions respectively for the wrf hydro lstm and lstm only models we used the 50th percentile result while repeating the same experiment 30 times a sensitivity test was conducted to examine the impact of the training dataset duration and determine the years for which the data needed to be used to evaluate model performance consequently we used four years of training data 2013 2016 which was the longest sequential period possible with available data and we labeled it according to the starting and ending training periods tp1316 the test sets were configured with a total of 10 cases with different training periods tp13 14 15 16 1314 1415 1516 1315 1416 and 1316 for the validation we utilized data from 2017 because it is the last year before the prediction year 2018 it is impossible to have information about the prediction period i e whether it will be a wet dry or normal year beforehand thus we sought to improve the performance using the closest year s data which is expected to have a climate trend similar to that of the prediction period under climate change trenberth 2011 furthermore the validation year 2017 and the prediction year 2018 were wet years we then performed an additional validation year for a case with a dry year 2014 we examined how the characteristics of the validation year influence the model performance with the cases using 2013 2015 2016 and 2017 for training and 2014 for validation tp13 1517 2 4 4 hyperparameter tuning for the lstm model the number of nodes per hidden layer batch size learning rate and number of epochs must be determined as introduced in section 2 2 in this study the random search method bergstra bengio 2012 was used to identify a set of optimal values for hyperparameters because they are nonlinearly correlated and have no fixed range we generated 200 random hyperparameter values for the candidate set within a certain range table 2 and evaluated the values for both the wrf hydro lstm and lstm only methods the range was configured based on experience and results from previous studies stathakis 2009 masters luschi 2018 as the lstm model shuffles the split data for each epoch the starting point for training changes and the training results may vary within a certain range therefore we permitted 10 iterations to evaluate each candidate set and selected the optimal set which had the lowest mean squared error in the validation process in this study two lstm hidden layers and an adaptive moment estimation optimizer adam kingma ba 2014 were used for stable and efficient model optimization adam the latest version of the optimization algorithm for stochastic gradient descent can rapidly and accurately search for optimal machine learning values we set the adam parameters in the keras api using default values 0 001 for the learning rate 0 9 for the momentum decay rate and 0 999 for the adaptive term decay rate to train the model with updated weights we employed the mean squared error for the loss function and mean absolute error to optimize the objective function 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the wrf hydro model we first evaluated the performance of the wrf hydro model for peak flow in 2018 fig 4 the hydrograph indicates that the simulated values at the peak point were slightly lower and decreased more slowly than the observed values moreover in comparison with the observations the nse of the wrf hydro model was 0 93 r was 0 96 and pbias was 6 12 suggesting that the model captured a total volume of inflow that is quite close to the observations albeit with a slight overestimation these results show that the wrf hydro model is capable of simulating streamflow with effective predictive skills for a specific short period of a few weeks we then evaluated the performance of a one year streamflow simulation using the same model fig 5 the evaluation results for a year pbias 11 78 nse 0 72 and r 0 88 indicated a slight decrease in performance compared to the short term case fig 5a the results were still acceptable in hydrological modeling according to moriasi et al 2007 because the nse was higher than 0 5 pbias was less than 25 r and nse decreased slightly and the pbias increased from 6 12 to 11 78 suggesting considerable underestimation of streamflow for an extended period we identified multiple peaks indicating a large difference between the observations and model simulation results e g between may and june as well as at the beginning of july and the sum of the differences overestimated and underestimated values contributed to the relatively large pbias 3 2 evaluation of streamflow prediction skills we evaluated the performance of wrf hydro lstm in comparison to wrf hydro only and lstm only for simulating the 2018 streamflow in the soyangho lake basin fig 5 the streamflow simulated with wrf hydro lstm and lstm only had a hydrograph shape markedly similar to that of the observations unlike the streamflow simulated with wrf hydro only although some of the peak flows were still captured with limitations in both wrf hydro lstm and lstm only the metrics also indicated the superiority of both wrf hydro lstm and lstm only over wrf hydro only with an nse of 0 95 and r above 0 97 this result was predicted as the loss function for optimization in the lstm model and directly associated with the nse and r which was set with the mean squared error wrf hydro lstm showed a decrease in pbias whereas lstm only showed an increase in pbias in comparison to wrf hydro only the pbias values indicate that the underestimation bias of wrf hydro only was improved in wrf hydro lstm otherwise lstm only was considerably more biased toward underestimation than wrf hydro only consequently the volume of streamflow accumulated for 2018 fig 6 which is closely related to pbias showed that out of the three models only wrf hydro lstm captured the observed trends reasonably similarly we noted that the performance of lstm only is poor in low flows thus exerting a relatively smaller effect on the loss function than high flows because lstm uses a loss function for regression in the training process without any physical constraints such as conservation principles it can violate the laws of physics while minimizing losses this could further worsen the results in this study we found that these characteristics of lstm evaluated by the range of values and standard deviation sd could limit the results owing to the variability of datasets while lstm only with a wide range of fluctuations in values and high variability between dry and wet seasons directly predicted the streamflow range 0 2325 sd 174 8 2018 the lstm model in the wrf hydro lstm approach could only predict residual error whose values fluctuate less seasonally range 713 1067 sd 109 8 in 2018 among the different roles of lstm the wrf hydro lstm approach simulated the streamflow in a manner markedly closer to the observations while systematically limiting the impacts of possible errors from the lstm model and conserving physical constraints as opposed to lstm only 3 3 training data sensitivity of wrf hydro lstm and lstm only we also examined how the duration and timing of the training data influenced prediction skills fig 7 demonstrates that climate conditions such as precipitation show strong interannual variability and hence the training data from different years i e dry or wet years could influence the streamflow prediction skills of lstm models notably in this study the lstm models i e wrf hydro lstm and lstm only were trained with data from the years 2013 to 2016 and validated with data from 2017 and the trained models were then evaluated for the year 2018 in the default case tp1316 we conducted sensitivity tests with various training datasets utilizing 30 iterations per dataset over numerous time periods 1 2 3 and 4 years between 2013 and 2016 the nse and r values in all cases of wrf hydro lstm and lstm only were found to be close to 1 for all evaluations with the three metrics nse r and pbias fig 8 without considerable differences between the cases such model performance was foreseeable because we used the mean squared error for the loss function to train the lstm models furthermore the ranges of nse and r values in the 30 iterations of lstm only were much wider than those in the wrf hydro lstm model indicating that wrf hydro lstm provides a more stable prediction than lstm only these aspects can be explained by the difference in target value and the influence of the lstm model prediction between wrf hydro lstm and lstm only the wrf hydro lstm model uses residual errors as target values for simulation and predicts streamflow as the sum of the two components in contrast lstm only uses streamflow data as the target value and predicts the streamflow directly this may lead to more systematic errors owing to the wide range of fluctuations in the streamflow values the pbias values in fig 8 vary markedly according to the training dataset used for the lstm models in particular the prediction results based on pbias were substantially influenced by the configuration of the training dataset the best configuration of the training dataset can be represented by the consistency and similarity of the training dataset with the target dataset in wrf hydro lstm the cases ending in 2015 showed wide variation and large absolute pbias the cases using the years 2013 or 2016 as the training data performed relatively better than the cases ending in 2015 table 3 shows the smallest absolute pbias in cases using 2016 as the training set tp16 tp1516 and tp1416 this was followed by tp13 and tp1314 which included 2013 in the training set these findings can be attributed to the fact that the prediction year i e 2018 with a relatively large residual error between the observation inflow and wrf hydro simulated inflow is analogous to the patterns in the years 2013 and 2016 fig 7 in the case of lstm only the cases with training datasets that either begin or end in 2015 dry year showed unstable pbias and the smallest absolute pbias in cases mainly included the year 2013 wet year in the training set i e tp13 and tp1315 followed by tp1415 tp15 and tp1314 fig 8 and table 3 this tendency was similar but less prominent when compared to the wrf hydro lstm model these findings suggest that the training data should have a pattern similar to that of the target data for the best performance of lstm the year 2018 wet year furthermore we identified the importance of data consistency from the results of tp1415 and tp1314 according to the similarity between the target year 2018 wet year and 2013 wet year tp1314 should have produced a better result than tp1415 however it showed an even higher value for the pbias table 3 this result can be explained by the consistency of data responsible for stabilizing the lstm training process as clearly shown in the results of tp1415 and tp1315 two consecutive dry years i e the years 2014 and 2015 yielded a better result whereas the cases with nonconsecutive composition produced a higher value of pbias even though they included the year 2013 i e tp1316 and tp1314 we also found that the number of years included in the training dataset that had a similar pattern to the target year was more important than the length of the training period for example tp1316 default case in the wrf hydro lstm model had the longest training period and showed the best performance among all the cases tp16 and tp1516 yielded equivalent results although they used a shorter period table 3 finally we employed another case using 2014 dry year for validation and 2013 2015 2016 and 2017 for the training period tp13 1517 table 3 regardless of the characteristics of the validation year two distinct cases the wet year 2017 and the dry year 2014 showed similarly successful performance with their pbias nse and r values tp1316 vs tp13 1517 in table 3 this result shows that our lstm approaches had stable performance regardless of the characteristics i e wet or dry of the validation year 3 4 hyperparameter tuning for wrf hydro lstm and lstm only hyperparameter tuning for each model is required to utilize the lstm for the lstm only and wrf hydro lstm models we tuned hyperparameters separately for all different cases with lstm only and wrf hydro lstm and all cases showed different optimal values for each hyperparameter table 4 focusing on the default case tp1316 evaluated in section 3 2 in table 4 revealed that the wrf hydro lstm model used more nodes for the first hidden layer and smaller values for the batch size and learning rate than lstm only a large number of nodes in the hidden layer indicate that the data requires a greater capacity for wide training networks the smaller batch size and learning rate indicate that the training data are difficult to generalize thus requiring smaller gradient steps for updating the weights goodfellow et al 2016 this result suggests that the prediction of residual error wrf hydro lstm requires a more substantial workload than that of streamflow lstm only moreover table 4 also shows that the optimal values for each case varied regardless of the duration and specific year used for the training the details of data sensitivity test in section 3 3 and thus there is no noticeable tendency among the cases because all cases showed different combinations of numbers without clear characteristics we found that employing the random search method was efficient and appropriate for finding optimal values nevertheless the results indicate that the case with data restricted to training the lstm model for optimized prediction skill leads to a large number of nodes small batch sizes and low learning rates the wrf hydro lstm cases tended to have smaller batch sizes compared to the lstm only cases implying that the residual errors require much more iterations for training the lstm model than for streamflow while streamflow has many variable values limiting the performance of lstm it has factors that can be generalized such as streamflow seasonality and the correlation between precipitation data r 0 8841 in 2018 the generalized pattern in the training dataset makes training the lstm model easier in contrast residual errors have an ambiguous correlation with other forcing variables including precipitation r 0 48 in 2018 therefore training with residual errors requires more effort than training with streamflow 4 conclusions this study aims to improve the streamflow prediction of the wrf hydro model using a machine learning algorithm i e lstm particularly for improving long term streamflow predictions our analysis in soyangho lake south korea demonstrates that the strength of machine learning to be used in improving physically based model which is not addressed much before the proposed wrf hydro lstm predicts differences between wrf hydro predictions and observations through embedded lstm model and considerably improve wrf hydro predictions wrf hydro lstm and lstm only show improved results in terms of the nse and correlation coefficient compared to wrf hydro only however in terms of the pbias wrf hydro lstm had a better value than lstm only these dissimilarities in pbias values were mainly attributable to the several limitations of lstm which tends to generate more systematic errors with highly variable datasets and optimizes the weights based on the given loss function without any physical constraints although lstm makes nonlinear modeling easier and allows a relatively short computational time lstm only is limited in extreme event predictions and thus wrf hydro lstm is considered the most suitable for streamflow prediction furthermore we performed a sensitivity test on the training dataset in terms of its length and elements 1 2 3 or 4 years of data with different component years the results indicated that the correlation coefficient and nse value were not overly sensitive to different training sets because we used the mean squared error for the loss function but the pbias value differed substantially depending on the training set both wrf hydro lstm and lstm only displayed improved performance when the training set contained specific years i e the years 2013 and 2015 for lstm only and 2016 for wrf hydro lstm that had input characteristics i e precipitation streamflow and residual errors similar to those of the target year more years similar to the target year in trend and composition in the training dataset was also crucial for the prediction result in addition a test case with different validation years 2014 supported that the model performance may vary with different validation and target years quantitatively not qualitatively as such it is usually impossible to recognize the trend of the target data for prediction thus we recommend that using large data would be advantageous for the ideal performance of the lstm model our approach has several limitations that need to be improved for clarity and performance we evaluated the model performance through the representative basin soyangho lake south korea with accumulated observational data 2013 2018 notwithstanding the limited period of data and number of basins used we argue that the evaluation results demonstrate the strength of the combined structure of the wrf hydro lstm and the potential of lstm application although there was a short period for training and calibration meteorological conditions such as precipitation in south korea show significant yearly seasonal variations and most years have dry periods in winter and spring with heavy rain periods in summer the data period may limit the performance to some extent but the 6 year data is acceptable given the data availability from the kldaps dataset however the lstm model as a data driven model has high data dependency which requires an accurate and sufficient training dataset limited available historical meteorological data for training the model should be complemented by techniques such as cross validation and an increased number of training iterations in recent years hydrologists have attempted to apply machine learning algorithms in lieu of physically based models because of their efficiency and favorable performance given this trend we showed that machine learning algorithms can be used to improve streamflow prediction through physically based modeling although the machine learning approach has limitations it has more potential in this method than when used directly to make streamflow predictions although the approach continues to be developed with new types of algorithms such as physics guided neural networks pgnn they still include a limited number of options read et al 2019 attempted to develop a pgnn to improve the prediction of lake water temperatures but they also had to simplify the physics of the system owing to this limitation therefore our proposed approach improves machine learning limitations and utilizes its strengths for improvement during application furthermore because our approach requires only residual errors and meteorological forcing data to drive the physically based model it can be applied to other models and easily used to efficiently improve simulations of any basin we also note that wrf hydro facilitates applying the trained lstm to the upstream and downstream streamflow i e to the stream without a gauge with transfer learning for deep learning neural networks weiss et al 2016 a pretrained model for one domain with a set of hyperparameters can be fine tuned on any relevant domain or problem although in this study we focused on understanding model sensitivity by training the model separately for all different cases a well developed wrf hydro lstm model for one basin can be applied to different locations in the same or another basin using a transfer learning technique the applicability of the trained wrf hydro lstm should be further investigated in a future study data availability the datasets for this study are accessible online the hydrosheds conditioned dem and lake polygons are available at http www

3714,in mountainous areas with inadequate precipitation anthropogenic vegetation restoration would increase evapotranspiration water consumption and decrease regional water yield affecting downstream water use assessing vegetation restoration related water consumption and future vegetation restoration potential is important for vegetation management in mountainous areas however it is still difficult to evaluate the impact of vegetation restoration on evapotranspiration water consumption and determine the appropriate restoration level this study focused on the haihe river basin as a typical afforestation area in china with growing competition for water use between the upstream afforested vegetation and the downstream urban development this study adopted the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration model with a de trending data series method to analyze actual evapotranspiration and vegetation restoration potential the results show that 1 the average precipitation in the mountainous areas of the haihe river basin and the actual evapotranspiration aet between 2000 and 2019 were 508 and 317 mm respectively while the precipitation leaf area index lai and actual evapotranspiration all showed an increasing trend in the past two decades with growth rates of 3 8 mm yr 0 0015 cm3 cm3 yr and 1 37 mm yr respectively 2 in the past 20 years vegetation restoration has cumulatively led to an actual evapotranspiration increase by 314 269 175 429 277 and 187 mm in the luan he mountainous basin lhmb yong ding he mountainous basin ydhmb da qing he mountainous basin dqhmb bei san he mountainous basin bshmb zi ya he mountainous basin zyhmb and zhang wei he mountainous basin zwhmb respectively 3 the lai maximum recovery level in the six sub basins was deduced by using the linear fitting formula when considering the replacement water of over drafting groundwater in the downstream plain the lhmb ydhmb zyhmb zwhmb still have the potential for vegetation restoration and the maximum lai could be restored to 1 83 1 30 1 09 and 1 6 cm3 cm3 respectively in summary large scale anthropogenic afforestation should consider the decrease in regional water yield to avoid the imbalance of ecological and human water use this research method can be extended to other areas of water scarcity and provide a reference for mountain vegetation restoration to set a

could be observed between ecological and human water requirements and human water use is usually prioritized over ecological needs leading to ecological degradation montanari et al 2013 nevertheless recently large scale anthropogenic revegetation is becoming more important in china strongly influencing evapotranspiration and surface water balance farley et al 2005 murray et al 2012 zheng et al 2018 improved vegetation cover plays a prominent role in soil and water conservation and ecological environmental improvements gao et al 2018 anderson et al 2007 however it also causes increased water consumption by evapotranspiration and reduced regional water yield exacerbating the imbalance of water supply and demand in water scarce areas wang et al 2011 descheemaeker et al 2006 vegetation restoration in watersheds directly influences evapotranspiration in two ways first the vegetation canopy gets thicker and canopy interception increases eventually resulting in evaporation mo et al 2004 nega et al 2019 second it leads to vegetation growth and increased water consumption eventually leading to a loss in transpiration jin et al 2017 the influence of vegetation change on actual evapotranspiration is currently a popular research area and several methods have been used to evaluate the effects of afforestation on actual evapotranspiration generally there are three methods to study the relationship between vegetation and actual evapotranspiration 1 small watershed comparative test method this approach compares the different runoffs in two adjacent watersheds of which one underwent vegetation restoration and the other did not huang et al 2003 the authors assumed that all the variables were the same between the two watersheds except for the vegetation with considerable uncertainty therefore the conclusions had limited applicability to large basins zhang et al 2017 2 budyko s hydroclimatic coupling framework method budyko curves as a first order estimate of the annual evaporation in terms of annual and potential evaporation mianabadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the analysis formula of the budyko curve reflected the relationship of hydrology and climate by modifying land surface parameters but referring to all environmental factors climate topography soil etc not just vegetation characteristics zhang et al 2018a 3 evapotranspiration simulating method an evapotranspiration model that considers vegetation characteristics is a more advantageous approach the effect of vegetation change on evaporation can be simulated by varying the vegetation conditions while holding other factors constant zhang et al 2018b multiple study approaches exist to investigate actual regional evapotranspiration including the penman equation the water balance method eddy covariance method bowen ratio energy balance method energy balance method based on remote sensing etc zhang et al 2010 czikowsky et al 2009 gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 sumner and jacobs 2005 cleugh et al 2007 proposing a method of surface conductance gs calculation using remote sensing of the lai leaf area index combined with the penman monteith equation to calculate the evaporation of the region leuning et al 2008 replaced both the earlier empirical models for gs with a biophysical two parameter model for surface conductance the penman monteith leuning model pml model has achieved good results in different climate and vegetation types of 15 basins and explains the penman monteith equation as a biophysical framework for estimating daily evapotranspiration at regional to global scales zhang et al 2008 the pml model can be combined with remote sensing data which offers great advantages in evaluating large scale spatial and temporal continuous evapotranspiration fluxes zhang et al 2008 bhattarai et al 2012 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 the method is highly suitable for the mountainous area of the haihe river basin mhrb lacking adequate monitoring stations while remote sensing data has the advantage of allowing a wide monitoring range and strong data continuity for large scale studies the haihe river basin in china is one of the most densely populated regions with the most severe water shortages in the world chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the region has limited water resources with per capita water resources estimated as 292 m3 yr which is 3 5 of the global mean below the internationally recognized extreme water shortage threshold 500 m3 xia et al 2012 runoff from mountain regions is one of the most important water sources for cities in plain regions the runoff characteristics are closely related to mountain vegetation zhang et al 2016 li et al 2016 after 2000 with the economic development of china and the subsequent focus on the ecological environment policies prohibiting the felling of trees in mountainous areas and implementing afforestation programs resulted in rapid vegetation restoration in the mhrb bao et al 2012 lei et al 2014 in the loess plateau another large scale afforestation area in china multiple studies showed that vegetation restoration reduced runoff feng et al 2016 cao et al 2009 shao et al 2019 however water scarcity is more serious in the haihe river basin and the area has not received sufficient attention anthropogenic afforestation in the mhrb is still ongoing the water shortage downstream would thus likely become more severe therefore sustainably restoring the vegetative conditions proves particularly challenging yang et al 2016b this study had two objectives 1 to quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation restoration on water consumption by evapotranspiration using the penman monteith luening model 2 to analyze the vegetation restoration potential combined with water resources supply in the basin the main purpose of this study is to guide the reasonable restoration of mountain vegetation and ensure the balance of ecological and social water use in the upper and lower reaches of the basin 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the haihe river basin is one of seven major river basins in china it is located between 113 39 117 34 e 38 10 40 102 n and has a total area of 318 200 km2 the taihang and yan mountain regions could be found west and north of the basin accounting for 60 of the whole basin area the haihe river basin is located in the north temperate monsoon type zone with precipitation mainly concentrated in june to september the mountainous area of the haihe river basin mhrb fig 1 has an annual mean precipitation of 535 mm an annual mean minimum and maximum temperature of 7 4 26 8 and 43 3 c respectively the mhrb is divided into six sub basins from north to south as follows the lhmb the ydhmb the dqhmb the bshmb the zyhmb and the zwhmb the plain is located downstream of the mountains one of the most densely populated areas in china including china s capital beijing the plain area of haihe river basin is very short of water and the main sources of water are local precipitation water transfer snwdp the south north water diversion project however those water supplies do not meet the city s requirements in the past the supply has been sustained by over drafting groundwater feng et al 2013 given that the inflow from mountain areas can partially replace the overdrawn groundwater in the plain area highlighting why water yield from the mountainous region is important to ensure an adequate water supply to the plain areas recently large scale vegetation restoration measures have been implemented in mountainous areas bao et al 2012 the previously exposed mountain is now covered by vegetation coinciding with a significant decrease in the water yield of the mountains 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 data sources data used to calculate potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration such as temperature humidity radiation wind speed and other meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological station fig 1 precipitation data was obtained from the monthly trmm 3b43 data published by nasa https gpm nasa gov category mission affiliation trmm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 approximately 27 5 km and a time series from january 2000 to 2019 the trmm precipitation data were calibrated by surface meteorological station while the two sets of data fitted a relationship curve s t a t i o n d a t a 0 85 t r m m d a t a 21 36 r 2 0 79 and the trmm precipitation data were corrected by the fitting curve the lai data were obtained from the mod15a2 chinese monthly synthesis product http www gscloud cn sources index pid 1 rootid 1 in which the spatial resolution was 500 m the time sequence was from 2000 to 2019 missing data from january to march 2000 were replaced by data from january to march 2001 due to vegetation growth mainly occurring from may to october winter basin evapotranspiration was small from january to march so interpolation data had little influence on the overall results all data were converted into grid data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 due to a lack of actual evapotranspiration verification instruments such as flux towers in the basin the water balance in the basin was used to verify results reliability the soil layer of the mhrb was very thin with little space for groundwater storage in the mountain region which would hardly affect the annual runoff he and wang 2001 therefore on the annual scale the precipitation minus the actual evapotranspiration in the mountain area was assumed to be approximately equal to the runoff at the basin outlet runoff data of six sub basins from 2000 to 2019 were obtained from haihe river basin water resources bulletin http www hwcc gov cn wwgj xxgb szygb runoff data from 2000 to 2014 were used to calibrate the pml actual evapotranspiration model and data from 2015 to 2019 were used to verify the model accuracy 2 2 2 study method 1 potential evapotranspiration pet potential evapotranspiration

test the mann kendall mk test has been widely used to identify the significance of hydrological and climate trends ding et al 2019 han et al 2018 gui et al 2021 in this study the mk trend test was used to identify the significant of lai precipitation and pet and there are many literatures about mk test but the relevant formula is not listed in this study 4 quantitative estimation of the vegetation restoration influence on actual evapotranspiration the change of lai caused by vegetation restoration and climate change such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes led to the change of actual evapotranspiration therefore it is necessary to distinguish the contribution of vegetation restoration and climate change in lai change a time series de trended method huo et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 was used to separate the contribution of vegetation restoration on lai change lai change in time sequence could be regarded as the superposition of trend change and fluctuation change as the annual vegetation restoration task and investment are relatively fixed it was assumed that the trend change was affected by vegetation restoration and the fluctuation change was mainly influenced by climate change the de trend analysis method decomposes lai time series into linear increasing and fluctuation trends as shown in eq 6 6 q det r e n d i q actual i α i i pivot

annual trend of the sequence and α can be solved by a linear regression equation combined with the pml method the effects of vegetation restoration factors on water consumption in the watershed were quantitatively evaluated the following steps were performed 1 removing the changing trend in vegetation lai to convert as stationary time series 2 recalculating the actual evapotranspiration using the detrended lai data series 3 comparing the recalculated actual evapotranspiration with the original value and the difference was the influence of vegetation restoration on actual evapotranspiration as the groundwater overdraft in the plain area the plain needs more water from the mountain to replace the groundwater overdraft two scenarios were designed in this study in which groundwater overdraft in the plain area did high availability scenarios and did not need to be replaced low availability scenarios implying that the available water of vegetation is deducted from the calculation results of the former scenario results regarding available water in the plain for both scenarios are presented in section 3 4 3 results 3 1 precipitation potential evapotranspiration and lai the mean precipitation in the mhrb between 2000 and 2019 was 508 mm with a slightly increasing trend of 3 8 mm yr as is shown in fig 2 a while the bshmb and ydhmb exhibited the largest and the smallest amount of precipitation of 527 and 417 mm respectively the increasing trend of the bshmb was 5 88 mm yr corresponding to a region with a rapid increase in precipitation while the zwhmb was the only region where precipitation decreased with a mean trend of 1 67 mm yr the maximum mean and the minimum precipitations in the basin were 823 and only 312 mm observed in the zwhmb in 2003 and ydhmb in 2001 respectively due to the extremely high precipitation that occurred in 2003 the precipitation in the zwhmb showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2019 while in the years of extreme precipitation was removed and the precipitation would show an increasing trend therefore for the mhrb precipitation had been mainly increasing for the past 20 years according to budyko s theory the potential evapotranspiration pet reflected the amount of available evaporation energy in the basin fig 2b shows that the mean annual potential evapotranspiration in the mhrb was 985 mm while the highest mean annual potential evapotranspiration was 1033 m observed in the zyhmb and the lhmb displayed the lowest annual potential evapotranspiration of 913 mm the maximum increase rate of potential evapotranspiration was 2 03 mm yr which happened in the bshmb and the minimum increase rate was 0 77 mm yr recorded in the dqhmb the potential regional evapotranspiration is larger than the precipitation indicating that water is the main limiting factor of the actual evapotranspiration in the mountainous areas of the haihe river basin the remote data from modis showed that the mean annual lai of the mhrb was 0 73 cm3 cm3 with an annual increasing rate of 0 015 among which the best and the worst vegetation lai were 0 871 and 0 506 cm3 cm3 observed in the bshmb and the ydhmb respectively fig 2c the lai of all sub basins showed an increasing trend among which the annual growth rate of the zwhmb and the dqhmb was the fastest and the slowest increasing by 0 018 and 0 0129 cm3 cm3 yr respectively lai of each month of the year was given in fig 2d lai showed a single peak curve distribution in the year and the maximum lai was 2 4 cm3 cm3 in july which occurred in the lhmb while the minimum lai was 1 3 cm3 cm3 in july in the ydhmb precipitation potential evapotranspiration and lai all were increased in the mhrb and the three factors led to the increase of actual evapotranspiration however the mean annual precipitation increased by 2 1 in the mhrb the mean annual pet increased by 1 and the mean annual lai increased by 23 compared the two periods from 2000 to 2009 and 2010 to 2019 the trend tests of lai precipitation and pet were shown in table 1 lai in the six sub basins all showed an extremely significant increasing trend p 0 01 but precipitation and pet did not pass the test of significant change trend p 0 05 the range of climate change is much smaller that lai change therefore we assume that the linear growth trend of lai is dominated by vegetation restoration the following sections will discuss how to dissect lai s contribution among other factors in terms of aet change 3 2 changes in actual evapotranspiration consumption of vegetation the pml method was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of the basin and the results are presented in fig 3 the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the mhrb was 317 mm accounting for 35 of the potential evapotranspiration the water balance results of the six sub basins are shown in fig 3a while the maximum and minimum root mean square error rmse were 1 03 and 0 02 in the bshmb and zwhmb respectively the actual evapotranspiration calculation results were in line with the actual situation of the basin and the key parameters of calibration in the model are shown in table 2 fig 3b shows the changing pattern of the actual evapotranspiration in each sub basin it was found that actual evapotranspiration in each sub basin had an increasing trend in the past 20 years the actual annual evapotranspiration of the mhrb in 317 mm among which that in the zwhmb was the largest with a value of 334 mm and the ydhmb was the smallest with a value of 283 mm the actual evapotranspiration change rate of the mhrb was 1 37 mm yr the actual evapotranspiration increase rate of the bshmb basin was the largest and the actual evapotranspiration growth rate of the zyhmb basin was the smallest in general the changing trend of actual evapotranspiration in each sub basin was consistent with the increasing trend of lai still the increasing trend of actual evapotranspiration was not as evident as that of lai which may be due to the influence of changes in water conditions fig 4 a showed the actual evapotranspiration distribution in the mhrb it could be observed that the actual evapotranspiration in the low altitude mountain area was higher than that in the high altitude mountain area mainly because the air temperature in the high altitude was lower which and less conducive to vegetation growth the change rate of actual evapotranspiration did not show a special pattern and it was distributed evenly throughout the basin illustrated in fig 4b the slope of actual evapotranspiration change in the bshmb was slightly larger but there was no noticeable change in other sub basins fig 4c showed the lai distribution in the mhrb the distribution of actual evapotranspiration was almost the same indicating a strong correlation between vegetation growth and actual evapotranspiration in the basin the slope of lai is shown in fig 4d of note lai showed an increasing trend in all the six sub basins where lai increasing rate was high the actual evapotranspiration growth rate was also high such as in the lhmb and the bshmb however where the lai growth rate is low actual evapotranspiration might show a decreasing trend such as the upper reaches of the ydhmb which is mainly caused by the decrease of precipitation 3 3 effects of vegetation restoration on actual evapotranspiration to analyze the impact of vegetation restoration on actual evapotranspiration this study assumed that lai changes from 2000 to 2019 could be decomposed into linear trend change and random fluctuation change eq 6 was used for de trend calculation of lai namely lai changes in fig 2c were decomposed into fluctuation change fig 5 a and linear trend change fig 5b after removing the trend it was shown in fig 5a there is no obvious growth trend in the series only fluctuation changes the actual evapotranspiration is recalculated according to the de trend lai series as shown in fig 5c under the assumption that there was no trend change in vegetation the average annual evapotranspiration of the six sub basins was 299 mm the lhmb 270 mm the ydhmb 311 mm the dqhmb 312 mm the bshmb 309 mm the zyhmb and 320 mm the zwhmb during 2000 2019 respectively compared with the actual evapotranspiration of the basin as was shown in fig 5d evapotranspiration respectively increased by 314 mm the lhmb 269 mm the yhmb 175 mm the dqhmb 429 mm the bshmb 277 mm the zyhmb 187 mm the zwhmb and 212 mm the mhrb due to vegetation restoration in the past 20 years 3 4 the amount of water available for vegetation growth the mean annual water supply and use data in the plain from 2015 to 2019 the last 5 years were used for the water balance analysis which could be seen in fig 6 a and the value above 0 on the vertical axis was the inflow of water in the sub basin and below that was the outflow of water in the sub basin water transfer of the snwdp was 2 93 billion m3 every year which was far less than the water withdrawn 20 4 billion m3 in the plain areas even with the precipitations on the plains water supply precipitation water transfer cannot exceed the amount of water withdrawn every year nevertheless in some dry years over extraction of groundwater is needed to avoid continuous groundwater over exploitation in plain areas mountainous areas must supply more water however this also implies competition with vegetation water in mountainous areas fig 6b showed the current actual evapotranspiration consumption of vegetation in mountainous areas and the available water of vegetation in two scenarios as seen in the figures the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the lhmb was 329 mm in high and low availability scenarios the water available for vegetation growth was 481 and 471 mm respectively the plain area of the yongding river basin was relatively small there was no groundwater over extraction and inflow from the snwdp therefore the amount of water available for vegetation growth under high and low scenarios was the same which was 396 mm the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the bshmb was 353 mm which had exceeded the available water in high availability scenarios 328 mm and low availability scenarios 293 mm the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the dqhmb was 326 mm which had exceeded the available water in low availability scenarios 271 mm but not exceeded low availability scenarios 334 mm the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the zyhmb was 328 mm the amount of water available for vegetation growth under high and low scenarios was 395 and 373 mm respectively the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the zwhmb was 350 mm the amount of water under two scenarios was 475 and 459 mm so the lhmb had the largest water amount space for vegetation restoration the proportion of actual vegetation evapotranspiration to available water resources is showed in table 3 it is easy to calculate vegetation evapotranspiration by lai through the model but it is very difficult to inverse calculate corresponding lai from available vegetation evapotranspiration because the model is highly nonlinear in order to facilitate the analysis of the relationship between lai and vegetation evapotranspiration annual mean lai and vegetation evapotranspiration were used as horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively for approximate linear fitting this phenomenon was illustrated in fig 7 the red line in the large frame was the actual vegetation evapotranspiration corresponding to the mean lai of the past five years while the blue line and the green line in the small frame represented the possible lai corresponding to the high available scenarios and high available scenarios respectively typically the horizontal and vertical coordinates in the small frame were larger than those in the large frame except that in the bshmb as the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the bshmb had exceeded the available water in two scenarios taking the lhmb as an example the mean actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the past five years was 328 mm the corresponding mean lai of the basin was 0 98 cm3 cm3 the water resource for vegetation evapotranspiration in the low available scenarios was 472 mm the corresponding mean lai of the basin is 1 83 cm3 cm3 while the water supply of vegetation evapotranspiration in the high available scenarios was 481 mm the corresponding mean lai was 1 88 cm3 cm3 the result indicated that vegetation lai in the lhmb could be restored from 0 98 cm3 cm3 to 1 88 cm3 cm3 at most while if the replacement of groundwater overdraft in the plain area was considered the maximum recovery lai could be 1 83 cm3 cm3 and those could be regarded as the recovery limit of vegetation in the lhmb this was no groundwater over drafting problem in the plain of the yongding river basin so only one scenario of available water supply was set and the lai could be increased from 0 62 cm3 cm3 to 1 30 cm3 cm3 the current annual average lai of the dqhmb is 0 78 cm3 cm3 while under the condition of high water availability lai could increase to 0 81 cm3 cm3 however under low water availability conditions lai should decrease to 0 4 cm3 cm3 vegetation in the bshmb has been over restored and according to the water resource support capacity lai should be reduced to 0 83 cm3 cm3 and 0 66 cm3 cm3 respectively under high and low water availability scenarios there was potentially available water in both the zyhmb and the zwhmb and lai could increase to 1 22 cm3 cm3 and 1 71 cm3 cm3 in high water availability scenarios lai could rise to 1 09 cm3 cm3 and 1 6 cm3 cm3 in low water availability scenarios according to the assessment of the available water supply the lhmb had the largest space for vegetation restoration followed by the zwhmb nevertheless there are differences between lai and aet relationships among different sub basins mainly influenced by climatic factors and vegetation types for example the lhmb is in the northernmost part of the mhrb and its annual average temperature and radiation are lower than those in the zwhmb in the southernmost region this leads to less aet in the lhmb than in the zwhmb under similar lai conditions which means more water available for vegetation growth in the lhmb on the other hand different vegetation types lead to varying proportions of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration in total evapotranspiration for instance the ydhmb and the dqhmb are basically at the same latitude nonetheless the ydhmb has a higher elevation the vegetation is sparser and the ratio of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is larger than that in the dqhmb which also means that under the same aet conditions the vegetation transpiration and lai of the ydhmb are smaller 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of soil water parameters a key parameter of the pml method used in this study is f representing the influence of soil moisture on evapotranspiration at present no reliable method is available to calculate f which is usually obtained by parameter calibration in this study sensitivity analysis was carried out on parameter f and the changes in the vegetation evapotranspiration were calculated when f changed by 5 and 10 when lai is between 0 6 and 1 the relationship between parameter f and evapotranspiration changes under climatic conditions in the mhrb fig 8 the higher the lai the higher the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to the soil water content swc when lai is 0 6 f and aet change between 10 10 and 8 1 10 7 respectively when lai becomes 1 0 f and aet change between 10 10 and 21 4 23 7 respectively the swc increase exhibits a slightly more significant effect on evapotranspiration than the swc decrease for example the swc increased by 5 and aet by 15 2 and the swc decreased by 5 and aet by 12 similar to what was observed in other regions which could mean that the swc increase exhibits a more significant effect on vegetation improvement in water deficient areas nevertheless the complex relationship between swc and aet still needs to be further studied and the next level of experimental observation analysis would be a better approach the interaction between swc and aet was determined by the soil water supply atmospheric evaporative demand and the physiological properties of vegetation huang et al 2017 vegetation root water uptake and soil evaporation are the main pathways of forest water transport and vegetation responses vary among plant functional types and depend on the seasonal and soil depth swc dynamics jian et al 2015 wang et al 2018 vegetation restoration can increase soil water conservation capacity while vegetation water absorption can also lead to soil drying certain studies have found that better vegetation significantly increases the swc in a wet and forest covered region where the increasing aet could be attributed to increased precipitation while several researchers also reported that soils become extremely dry in both deep and shallow layers when the vegetation restoration strategy is applied yaseef et al 2010 wang et al 2010 cao et al 2011 however swc is the main vegetation growth limiting condition in arid and semi arid areas in the process of vegetation restoration on the loess plateau in china several old man trees could be observed that are very short in length due to insufficient soil moisture support also indicating that excessive afforestation is not appropriate wang et al 2011 rodríguez caballero et al 2012 4 2 changes in the proportion of evapotranspiration to precipitation the proportion of evapotranspiration to precipitation aet p in different precipitation intervals was also compared it can be seen from fig 9 that the less the annual precipitation the greater aet p value within the range of 400 mm the median value of aet p was 0 65 within the range of 400 500 mm the median value was 0 62 within the range of 500 600 mm the median value was 0 603 when the annual precipitation exceeded 600 mm the median values were 0 58 in years with less precipitation actual evapotranspiration accounts for a larger percentage of precipitation which means that water yield in mountain areas may reduce even more vegetation restoration might play an important role in the process for example increased leaf area implies greater canopy interception however the contribution of canopy interception is eventually lost in the form of evaporation aston 1979 gerrits et al 2009 moreover vegetation restoration leads to increased water uptake by roots even in a dry environment the vegetation root can absorb more water by increasing its root length which leads to soil drying yang et al 2016 hui et al 2018 and more rainfall stored in the soil and less runoff generated this indicates that excessive vegetation restoration will aggravate the water shortage crisis in dry years therefore the water demand of the watershed should be fully considered in the design of vegetation restoration scale in dry years 4 3 potential of vegetation restoration in mountainous areas of haihe river basin our results confirm that large scale vegetation restoration will increase the evapotranspiration water consumption of vegetation in mountainous areas and reduce the water yield which also has a similar conclusion in the loess plateau three north region of china and other vegetation restoration regions ning et al 2020 deng et al 2019 shao et al 2019 climate and vegetation changes influence the water cycle with complex interactions and a single factor cannot explain the full variation of the cycle colucci and guglielmin 2015 liu et al 2006 kim and wang 2012 although vegetation restoration practices have substantially improved regional ecosystems a common result is that large scale revegetation exceeds the carrying capacity for vegetation of the local abiotic environment causing over consumption of resources especially water liu et al 2018 feng et al 2017 it has been reported that large scale tree planting in arid areas of northwest china has led to the depletion of surface water resources zastrow 2019 vegetation afforestation will increase water consumption by 559 2354 m3 ha annually compared with natural vegetation cao et al 2009 even so vegetation restoration did not cause regional water imbalance due to enhanced precipitation and water use efficiency deng et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 proposed that large scale afforestation significantly increases permanent surface water while decreases seasonal surface water in china s vegetation restoration regions in the haihe river basin if the water demand of rivers and lakes in the lower plain is not considered the water consumption of vegetation in the upper mountain area has not reached the limit of the water supply in the basin in the lhmb and the zwhmb there is still great potential while the bshmb and the dqhmb have reached the limit of vegetation restoration so it is not suitable for further vegetation restoration the reason why the ecological water demand of rivers and lakes are not considered is that the groundwater table has dropped dramatically and the leakage of rivers and lakes is huge which cannot make up for the huge gap in the short term no matter whether the vegetation is restored in the upstream mountainous area eventually water conservation in urban society is still necessary and it will be a continuous and slow process to restore the vegetation and river ecology 5 conclusions in the context of water shortage strong competition for water consumption exists between vegetation restoration in the mountainous areas and the social and economic sectors accurate calculation of water consumption for vegetation restoration and analysis of the maximum available amount of vegetation restoration is of particular significance to water resource management in river basins in this study the pml model was used to calculate the variation of water consumption during vegetation restoration in the mountainous areas of the haihe river basin between 2000 and 2019 we could observe that evapotranspiration water consumption in the mountainous areas increased by 212 mm due to vegetation restoration in the past two decades moreover we also described that the lai and evapotranspiration could be fitted by a linear relationship based on the above analysis we assessed the potential of vegetation restoration in different river basins considering water over extraction as a replacement plan the lhmb has the largest available water potential for vegetation restoration and the bshmb had exceeded the available water this study provides a simple method to evaluate whether vegetation restoration is reasonable which could also be a reference for other watershed studies credit authorship contribution statement wang qingming methodology conceptualization writing original draft jiang

3714,in mountainous areas with inadequate precipitation anthropogenic vegetation restoration would increase evapotranspiration water consumption and decrease regional water yield affecting downstream water use assessing vegetation restoration related water consumption and future vegetation restoration potential is important for vegetation management in mountainous areas however it is still difficult to evaluate the impact of vegetation restoration on evapotranspiration water consumption and determine the appropriate restoration level this study focused on the haihe river basin as a typical afforestation area in china with growing competition for water use between the upstream afforested vegetation and the downstream urban development this study adopted the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration model with a de trending data series method to analyze actual evapotranspiration and vegetation restoration potential the results show that 1 the average precipitation in the mountainous areas of the haihe river basin and the actual evapotranspiration aet between 2000 and 2019 were 508 and 317 mm respectively while the precipitation leaf area index lai and actual evapotranspiration all showed an increasing trend in the past two decades with growth rates of 3 8 mm yr 0 0015 cm3 cm3 yr and 1 37 mm yr respectively 2 in the past 20 years vegetation restoration has cumulatively led to an actual evapotranspiration increase by 314 269 175 429 277 and 187 mm in the luan he mountainous basin lhmb yong ding he mountainous basin ydhmb da qing he mountainous basin dqhmb bei san he mountainous basin bshmb zi ya he mountainous basin zyhmb and zhang wei he mountainous basin zwhmb respectively 3 the lai maximum recovery level in the six sub basins was deduced by using the linear fitting formula when considering the replacement water of over drafting groundwater in the downstream plain the lhmb ydhmb zyhmb zwhmb still have the potential for vegetation restoration and the maximum lai could be restored to 1 83 1 30 1 09 and 1 6 cm3 cm3 respectively in summary large scale anthropogenic afforestation should consider the decrease in regional water yield to avoid the imbalance of ecological and human water use this research method can be extended to other areas of water scarcity and provide a reference for mountain vegetation restoration to set a

could be observed between ecological and human water requirements and human water use is usually prioritized over ecological needs leading to ecological degradation montanari et al 2013 nevertheless recently large scale anthropogenic revegetation is becoming more important in china strongly influencing evapotranspiration and surface water balance farley et al 2005 murray et al 2012 zheng et al 2018 improved vegetation cover plays a prominent role in soil and water conservation and ecological environmental improvements gao et al 2018 anderson et al 2007 however it also causes increased water consumption by evapotranspiration and reduced regional water yield exacerbating the imbalance of water supply and demand in water scarce areas wang et al 2011 descheemaeker et al 2006 vegetation restoration in watersheds directly influences evapotranspiration in two ways first the vegetation canopy gets thicker and canopy interception increases eventually resulting in evaporation mo et al 2004 nega et al 2019 second it leads to vegetation growth and increased water consumption eventually leading to a loss in transpiration jin et al 2017 the influence of vegetation change on actual evapotranspiration is currently a popular research area and several methods have been used to evaluate the effects of afforestation on actual evapotranspiration generally there are three methods to study the relationship between vegetation and actual evapotranspiration 1 small watershed comparative test method this approach compares the different runoffs in two adjacent watersheds of which one underwent vegetation restoration and the other did not huang et al 2003 the authors assumed that all the variables were the same between the two watersheds except for the vegetation with considerable uncertainty therefore the conclusions had limited applicability to large basins zhang et al 2017 2 budyko s hydroclimatic coupling framework method budyko curves as a first order estimate of the annual evaporation in terms of annual and potential evaporation mianabadi et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 the analysis formula of the budyko curve reflected the relationship of hydrology and climate by modifying land surface parameters but referring to all environmental factors climate topography soil etc not just vegetation characteristics zhang et al 2018a 3 evapotranspiration simulating method an evapotranspiration model that considers vegetation characteristics is a more advantageous approach the effect of vegetation change on evaporation can be simulated by varying the vegetation conditions while holding other factors constant zhang et al 2018b multiple study approaches exist to investigate actual regional evapotranspiration including the penman equation the water balance method eddy covariance method bowen ratio energy balance method energy balance method based on remote sensing etc zhang et al 2010 czikowsky et al 2009 gianniou and antonopoulos 2007 sumner and jacobs 2005 cleugh et al 2007 proposing a method of surface conductance gs calculation using remote sensing of the lai leaf area index combined with the penman monteith equation to calculate the evaporation of the region leuning et al 2008 replaced both the earlier empirical models for gs with a biophysical two parameter model for surface conductance the penman monteith leuning model pml model has achieved good results in different climate and vegetation types of 15 basins and explains the penman monteith equation as a biophysical framework for estimating daily evapotranspiration at regional to global scales zhang et al 2008 the pml model can be combined with remote sensing data which offers great advantages in evaluating large scale spatial and temporal continuous evapotranspiration fluxes zhang et al 2008 bhattarai et al 2012 losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 the method is highly suitable for the mountainous area of the haihe river basin mhrb lacking adequate monitoring stations while remote sensing data has the advantage of allowing a wide monitoring range and strong data continuity for large scale studies the haihe river basin in china is one of the most densely populated regions with the most severe water shortages in the world chen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 the region has limited water resources with per capita water resources estimated as 292 m3 yr which is 3 5 of the global mean below the internationally recognized extreme water shortage threshold 500 m3 xia et al 2012 runoff from mountain regions is one of the most important water sources for cities in plain regions the runoff characteristics are closely related to mountain vegetation zhang et al 2016 li et al 2016 after 2000 with the economic development of china and the subsequent focus on the ecological environment policies prohibiting the felling of trees in mountainous areas and implementing afforestation programs resulted in rapid vegetation restoration in the mhrb bao et al 2012 lei et al 2014 in the loess plateau another large scale afforestation area in china multiple studies showed that vegetation restoration reduced runoff feng et al 2016 cao et al 2009 shao et al 2019 however water scarcity is more serious in the haihe river basin and the area has not received sufficient attention anthropogenic afforestation in the mhrb is still ongoing the water shortage downstream would thus likely become more severe therefore sustainably restoring the vegetative conditions proves particularly challenging yang et al 2016b this study had two objectives 1 to quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation restoration on water consumption by evapotranspiration using the penman monteith luening model 2 to analyze the vegetation restoration potential combined with water resources supply in the basin the main purpose of this study is to guide the reasonable restoration of mountain vegetation and ensure the balance of ecological and social water use in the upper and lower reaches of the basin 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the haihe river basin is one of seven major river basins in china it is located between 113 39 117 34 e 38 10 40 102 n and has a total area of 318 200 km2 the taihang and yan mountain regions could be found west and north of the basin accounting for 60 of the whole basin area the haihe river basin is located in the north temperate monsoon type zone with precipitation mainly concentrated in june to september the mountainous area of the haihe river basin mhrb fig 1 has an annual mean precipitation of 535 mm an annual mean minimum and maximum temperature of 7 4 26 8 and 43 3 c respectively the mhrb is divided into six sub basins from north to south as follows the lhmb the ydhmb the dqhmb the bshmb the zyhmb and the zwhmb the plain is located downstream of the mountains one of the most densely populated areas in china including china s capital beijing the plain area of haihe river basin is very short of water and the main sources of water are local precipitation water transfer snwdp the south north water diversion project however those water supplies do not meet the city s requirements in the past the supply has been sustained by over drafting groundwater feng et al 2013 given that the inflow from mountain areas can partially replace the overdrawn groundwater in the plain area highlighting why water yield from the mountainous region is important to ensure an adequate water supply to the plain areas recently large scale vegetation restoration measures have been implemented in mountainous areas bao et al 2012 the previously exposed mountain is now covered by vegetation coinciding with a significant decrease in the water yield of the mountains 2 2 data sources and methods 2 2 1 data sources data used to calculate potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration such as temperature humidity radiation wind speed and other meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological station fig 1 precipitation data was obtained from the monthly trmm 3b43 data published by nasa https gpm nasa gov category mission affiliation trmm with a spatial resolution of 0 25 approximately 27 5 km and a time series from january 2000 to 2019 the trmm precipitation data were calibrated by surface meteorological station while the two sets of data fitted a relationship curve s t a t i o n d a t a 0 85 t r m m d a t a 21 36 r 2 0 79 and the trmm precipitation data were corrected by the fitting curve the lai data were obtained from the mod15a2 chinese monthly synthesis product http www gscloud cn sources index pid 1 rootid 1 in which the spatial resolution was 500 m the time sequence was from 2000 to 2019 missing data from january to march 2000 were replaced by data from january to march 2001 due to vegetation growth mainly occurring from may to october winter basin evapotranspiration was small from january to march so interpolation data had little influence on the overall results all data were converted into grid data with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 due to a lack of actual evapotranspiration verification instruments such as flux towers in the basin the water balance in the basin was used to verify results reliability the soil layer of the mhrb was very thin with little space for groundwater storage in the mountain region which would hardly affect the annual runoff he and wang 2001 therefore on the annual scale the precipitation minus the actual evapotranspiration in the mountain area was assumed to be approximately equal to the runoff at the basin outlet runoff data of six sub basins from 2000 to 2019 were obtained from haihe river basin water resources bulletin http www hwcc gov cn wwgj xxgb szygb runoff data from 2000 to 2014 were used to calibrate the pml actual evapotranspiration model and data from 2015 to 2019 were used to verify the model accuracy 2 2 2 study method 1 potential evapotranspiration pet potential evapotranspiration

on the maximum stomatal conductance g sx of leaves above the canopy and the lai the modified penman monteith model is usually called the pml evapotranspiration model the calculation formulas are as

test the mann kendall mk test has been widely used to identify the significance of hydrological and climate trends ding et al 2019 han et al 2018 gui et al 2021 in this study the mk trend test was used to identify the significant of lai precipitation and pet and there are many literatures about mk test but the relevant formula is not listed in this study 4 quantitative estimation of the vegetation restoration influence on actual evapotranspiration the change of lai caused by vegetation restoration and climate change such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration changes led to the change of actual evapotranspiration therefore it is necessary to distinguish the contribution of vegetation restoration and climate change in lai change a time series de trended method huo et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 was used to separate the contribution of vegetation restoration on lai change lai change in time sequence could be regarded as the superposition of trend change and fluctuation change as the annual vegetation restoration task and investment are relatively fixed it was assumed that the trend change was affected by vegetation restoration and the fluctuation change was mainly influenced by climate change the de trend analysis method decomposes lai time series into linear increasing and fluctuation trends as shown in eq 6 6 q det r e n d i q actual i α i i pivot

annual trend of the sequence and α can be solved by a linear regression equation combined with the pml method the effects of vegetation restoration factors on water consumption in the watershed were quantitatively evaluated the following steps were performed 1 removing the changing trend in vegetation lai to convert as stationary time series 2 recalculating the actual evapotranspiration using the detrended lai data series 3 comparing the recalculated actual evapotranspiration with the original value and the difference was the influence of vegetation restoration on actual evapotranspiration as the groundwater overdraft in the plain area the plain needs more water from the mountain to replace the groundwater overdraft two scenarios were designed in this study in which groundwater overdraft in the plain area did high availability scenarios and did not need to be replaced low availability scenarios implying that the available water of vegetation is deducted from the calculation results of the former scenario results regarding available water in the plain for both scenarios are presented in section 3 4 3 results 3 1 precipitation potential evapotranspiration and lai the mean precipitation in the mhrb between 2000 and 2019 was 508 mm with a slightly increasing trend of 3 8 mm yr as is shown in fig 2 a while the bshmb and ydhmb exhibited the largest and the smallest amount of precipitation of 527 and 417 mm respectively the increasing trend of the bshmb was 5 88 mm yr corresponding to a region with a rapid increase in precipitation while the zwhmb was the only region where precipitation decreased with a mean trend of 1 67 mm yr the maximum mean and the minimum precipitations in the basin were 823 and only 312 mm observed in the zwhmb in 2003 and ydhmb in 2001 respectively due to the extremely high precipitation that occurred in 2003 the precipitation in the zwhmb showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2019 while in the years of extreme precipitation was removed and the precipitation would show an increasing trend therefore for the mhrb precipitation had been mainly increasing for the past 20 years according to budyko s theory the potential evapotranspiration pet reflected the amount of available evaporation energy in the basin fig 2b shows that the mean annual potential evapotranspiration in the mhrb was 985 mm while the highest mean annual potential evapotranspiration was 1033 m observed in the zyhmb and the lhmb displayed the lowest annual potential evapotranspiration of 913 mm the maximum increase rate of potential evapotranspiration was 2 03 mm yr which happened in the bshmb and the minimum increase rate was 0 77 mm yr recorded in the dqhmb the potential regional evapotranspiration is larger than the precipitation indicating that water is the main limiting factor of the actual evapotranspiration in the mountainous areas of the haihe river basin the remote data from modis showed that the mean annual lai of the mhrb was 0 73 cm3 cm3 with an annual increasing rate of 0 015 among which the best and the worst vegetation lai were 0 871 and 0 506 cm3 cm3 observed in the bshmb and the ydhmb respectively fig 2c the lai of all sub basins showed an increasing trend among which the annual growth rate of the zwhmb and the dqhmb was the fastest and the slowest increasing by 0 018 and 0 0129 cm3 cm3 yr respectively lai of each month of the year was given in fig 2d lai showed a single peak curve distribution in the year and the maximum lai was 2 4 cm3 cm3 in july which occurred in the lhmb while the minimum lai was 1 3 cm3 cm3 in july in the ydhmb precipitation potential evapotranspiration and lai all were increased in the mhrb and the three factors led to the increase of actual evapotranspiration however the mean annual precipitation increased by 2 1 in the mhrb the mean annual pet increased by 1 and the mean annual lai increased by 23 compared the two periods from 2000 to 2009 and 2010 to 2019 the trend tests of lai precipitation and pet were shown in table 1 lai in the six sub basins all showed an extremely significant increasing trend p 0 01 but precipitation and pet did not pass the test of significant change trend p 0 05 the range of climate change is much smaller that lai change therefore we assume that the linear growth trend of lai is dominated by vegetation restoration the following sections will discuss how to dissect lai s contribution among other factors in terms of aet change 3 2 changes in actual evapotranspiration consumption of vegetation the pml method was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of the basin and the results are presented in fig 3 the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the mhrb was 317 mm accounting for 35 of the potential evapotranspiration the water balance results of the six sub basins are shown in fig 3a while the maximum and minimum root mean square error rmse were 1 03 and 0 02 in the bshmb and zwhmb respectively the actual evapotranspiration calculation results were in line with the actual situation of the basin and the key parameters of calibration in the model are shown in table 2 fig 3b shows the changing pattern of the actual evapotranspiration in each sub basin it was found that actual evapotranspiration in each sub basin had an increasing trend in the past 20 years the actual annual evapotranspiration of the mhrb in 317 mm among which that in the zwhmb was the largest with a value of 334 mm and the ydhmb was the smallest with a value of 283 mm the actual evapotranspiration change rate of the mhrb was 1 37 mm yr the actual evapotranspiration increase rate of the bshmb basin was the largest and the actual evapotranspiration growth rate of the zyhmb basin was the smallest in general the changing trend of actual evapotranspiration in each sub basin was consistent with the increasing trend of lai still the increasing trend of actual evapotranspiration was not as evident as that of lai which may be due to the influence of changes in water conditions fig 4 a showed the actual evapotranspiration distribution in the mhrb it could be observed that the actual evapotranspiration in the low altitude mountain area was higher than that in the high altitude mountain area mainly because the air temperature in the high altitude was lower which and less conducive to vegetation growth the change rate of actual evapotranspiration did not show a special pattern and it was distributed evenly throughout the basin illustrated in fig 4b the slope of actual evapotranspiration change in the bshmb was slightly larger but there was no noticeable change in other sub basins fig 4c showed the lai distribution in the mhrb the distribution of actual evapotranspiration was almost the same indicating a strong correlation between vegetation growth and actual evapotranspiration in the basin the slope of lai is shown in fig 4d of note lai showed an increasing trend in all the six sub basins where lai increasing rate was high the actual evapotranspiration growth rate was also high such as in the lhmb and the bshmb however where the lai growth rate is low actual evapotranspiration might show a decreasing trend such as the upper reaches of the ydhmb which is mainly caused by the decrease of precipitation 3 3 effects of vegetation restoration on actual evapotranspiration to analyze the impact of vegetation restoration on actual evapotranspiration this study assumed that lai changes from 2000 to 2019 could be decomposed into linear trend change and random fluctuation change eq 6 was used for de trend calculation of lai namely lai changes in fig 2c were decomposed into fluctuation change fig 5 a and linear trend change fig 5b after removing the trend it was shown in fig 5a there is no obvious growth trend in the series only fluctuation changes the actual evapotranspiration is recalculated according to the de trend lai series as shown in fig 5c under the assumption that there was no trend change in vegetation the average annual evapotranspiration of the six sub basins was 299 mm the lhmb 270 mm the ydhmb 311 mm the dqhmb 312 mm the bshmb 309 mm the zyhmb and 320 mm the zwhmb during 2000 2019 respectively compared with the actual evapotranspiration of the basin as was shown in fig 5d evapotranspiration respectively increased by 314 mm the lhmb 269 mm the yhmb 175 mm the dqhmb 429 mm the bshmb 277 mm the zyhmb 187 mm the zwhmb and 212 mm the mhrb due to vegetation restoration in the past 20 years 3 4 the amount of water available for vegetation growth the mean annual water supply and use data in the plain from 2015 to 2019 the last 5 years were used for the water balance analysis which could be seen in fig 6 a and the value above 0 on the vertical axis was the inflow of water in the sub basin and below that was the outflow of water in the sub basin water transfer of the snwdp was 2 93 billion m3 every year which was far less than the water withdrawn 20 4 billion m3 in the plain areas even with the precipitations on the plains water supply precipitation water transfer cannot exceed the amount of water withdrawn every year nevertheless in some dry years over extraction of groundwater is needed to avoid continuous groundwater over exploitation in plain areas mountainous areas must supply more water however this also implies competition with vegetation water in mountainous areas fig 6b showed the current actual evapotranspiration consumption of vegetation in mountainous areas and the available water of vegetation in two scenarios as seen in the figures the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the lhmb was 329 mm in high and low availability scenarios the water available for vegetation growth was 481 and 471 mm respectively the plain area of the yongding river basin was relatively small there was no groundwater over extraction and inflow from the snwdp therefore the amount of water available for vegetation growth under high and low scenarios was the same which was 396 mm the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the bshmb was 353 mm which had exceeded the available water in high availability scenarios 328 mm and low availability scenarios 293 mm the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the dqhmb was 326 mm which had exceeded the available water in low availability scenarios 271 mm but not exceeded low availability scenarios 334 mm the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the zyhmb was 328 mm the amount of water available for vegetation growth under high and low scenarios was 395 and 373 mm respectively the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the zwhmb was 350 mm the amount of water under two scenarios was 475 and 459 mm so the lhmb had the largest water amount space for vegetation restoration the proportion of actual vegetation evapotranspiration to available water resources is showed in table 3 it is easy to calculate vegetation evapotranspiration by lai through the model but it is very difficult to inverse calculate corresponding lai from available vegetation evapotranspiration because the model is highly nonlinear in order to facilitate the analysis of the relationship between lai and vegetation evapotranspiration annual mean lai and vegetation evapotranspiration were used as horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively for approximate linear fitting this phenomenon was illustrated in fig 7 the red line in the large frame was the actual vegetation evapotranspiration corresponding to the mean lai of the past five years while the blue line and the green line in the small frame represented the possible lai corresponding to the high available scenarios and high available scenarios respectively typically the horizontal and vertical coordinates in the small frame were larger than those in the large frame except that in the bshmb as the actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the bshmb had exceeded the available water in two scenarios taking the lhmb as an example the mean actual vegetation evapotranspiration in the past five years was 328 mm the corresponding mean lai of the basin was 0 98 cm3 cm3 the water resource for vegetation evapotranspiration in the low available scenarios was 472 mm the corresponding mean lai of the basin is 1 83 cm3 cm3 while the water supply of vegetation evapotranspiration in the high available scenarios was 481 mm the corresponding mean lai was 1 88 cm3 cm3 the result indicated that vegetation lai in the lhmb could be restored from 0 98 cm3 cm3 to 1 88 cm3 cm3 at most while if the replacement of groundwater overdraft in the plain area was considered the maximum recovery lai could be 1 83 cm3 cm3 and those could be regarded as the recovery limit of vegetation in the lhmb this was no groundwater over drafting problem in the plain of the yongding river basin so only one scenario of available water supply was set and the lai could be increased from 0 62 cm3 cm3 to 1 30 cm3 cm3 the current annual average lai of the dqhmb is 0 78 cm3 cm3 while under the condition of high water availability lai could increase to 0 81 cm3 cm3 however under low water availability conditions lai should decrease to 0 4 cm3 cm3 vegetation in the bshmb has been over restored and according to the water resource support capacity lai should be reduced to 0 83 cm3 cm3 and 0 66 cm3 cm3 respectively under high and low water availability scenarios there was potentially available water in both the zyhmb and the zwhmb and lai could increase to 1 22 cm3 cm3 and 1 71 cm3 cm3 in high water availability scenarios lai could rise to 1 09 cm3 cm3 and 1 6 cm3 cm3 in low water availability scenarios according to the assessment of the available water supply the lhmb had the largest space for vegetation restoration followed by the zwhmb nevertheless there are differences between lai and aet relationships among different sub basins mainly influenced by climatic factors and vegetation types for example the lhmb is in the northernmost part of the mhrb and its annual average temperature and radiation are lower than those in the zwhmb in the southernmost region this leads to less aet in the lhmb than in the zwhmb under similar lai conditions which means more water available for vegetation growth in the lhmb on the other hand different vegetation types lead to varying proportions of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration in total evapotranspiration for instance the ydhmb and the dqhmb are basically at the same latitude nonetheless the ydhmb has a higher elevation the vegetation is sparser and the ratio of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is larger than that in the dqhmb which also means that under the same aet conditions the vegetation transpiration and lai of the ydhmb are smaller 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis of soil water parameters a key parameter of the pml method used in this study is f representing the influence of soil moisture on evapotranspiration at present no reliable method is available to calculate f which is usually obtained by parameter calibration in this study sensitivity analysis was carried out on parameter f and the changes in the vegetation evapotranspiration were calculated when f changed by 5 and 10 when lai is between 0 6 and 1 the relationship between parameter f and evapotranspiration changes under climatic conditions in the mhrb fig 8 the higher the lai the higher the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to the soil water content swc when lai is 0 6 f and aet change between 10 10 and 8 1 10 7 respectively when lai becomes 1 0 f and aet change between 10 10 and 21 4 23 7 respectively the swc increase exhibits a slightly more significant effect on evapotranspiration than the swc decrease for example the swc increased by 5 and aet by 15 2 and the swc decreased by 5 and aet by 12 similar to what was observed in other regions which could mean that the swc increase exhibits a more significant effect on vegetation improvement in water deficient areas nevertheless the complex relationship between swc and aet still needs to be further studied and the next level of experimental observation analysis would be a better approach the interaction between swc and aet was determined by the soil water supply atmospheric evaporative demand and the physiological properties of vegetation huang et al 2017 vegetation root water uptake and soil evaporation are the main pathways of forest water transport and vegetation responses vary among plant functional types and depend on the seasonal and soil depth swc dynamics jian et al 2015 wang et al 2018 vegetation restoration can increase soil water conservation capacity while vegetation water absorption can also lead to soil drying certain studies have found that better vegetation significantly increases the swc in a wet and forest covered region where the increasing aet could be attributed to increased precipitation while several researchers also reported that soils become extremely dry in both deep and shallow layers when the vegetation restoration strategy is applied yaseef et al 2010 wang et al 2010 cao et al 2011 however swc is the main vegetation growth limiting condition in arid and semi arid areas in the process of vegetation restoration on the loess plateau in china several old man trees could be observed that are very short in length due to insufficient soil moisture support also indicating that excessive afforestation is not appropriate wang et al 2011 rodríguez caballero et al 2012 4 2 changes in the proportion of evapotranspiration to precipitation the proportion of evapotranspiration to precipitation aet p in different precipitation intervals was also compared it can be seen from fig 9 that the less the annual precipitation the greater aet p value within the range of 400 mm the median value of aet p was 0 65 within the range of 400 500 mm the median value was 0 62 within the range of 500 600 mm the median value was 0 603 when the annual precipitation exceeded 600 mm the median values were 0 58 in years with less precipitation actual evapotranspiration accounts for a larger percentage of precipitation which means that water yield in mountain areas may reduce even more vegetation restoration might play an important role in the process for example increased leaf area implies greater canopy interception however the contribution of canopy interception is eventually lost in the form of evaporation aston 1979 gerrits et al 2009 moreover vegetation restoration leads to increased water uptake by roots even in a dry environment the vegetation root can absorb more water by increasing its root length which leads to soil drying yang et al 2016 hui et al 2018 and more rainfall stored in the soil and less runoff generated this indicates that excessive vegetation restoration will aggravate the water shortage crisis in dry years therefore the water demand of the watershed should be fully considered in the design of vegetation restoration scale in dry years 4 3 potential of vegetation restoration in mountainous areas of haihe river basin our results confirm that large scale vegetation restoration will increase the evapotranspiration water consumption of vegetation in mountainous areas and reduce the water yield which also has a similar conclusion in the loess plateau three north region of china and other vegetation restoration regions ning et al 2020 deng et al 2019 shao et al 2019 climate and vegetation changes influence the water cycle with complex interactions and a single factor cannot explain the full variation of the cycle colucci and guglielmin 2015 liu et al 2006 kim and wang 2012 although vegetation restoration practices have substantially improved regional ecosystems a common result is that large scale revegetation exceeds the carrying capacity for vegetation of the local abiotic environment causing over consumption of resources especially water liu et al 2018 feng et al 2017 it has been reported that large scale tree planting in arid areas of northwest china has led to the depletion of surface water resources zastrow 2019 vegetation afforestation will increase water consumption by 559 2354 m3 ha annually compared with natural vegetation cao et al 2009 even so vegetation restoration did not cause regional water imbalance due to enhanced precipitation and water use efficiency deng et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 proposed that large scale afforestation significantly increases permanent surface water while decreases seasonal surface water in china s vegetation restoration regions in the haihe river basin if the water demand of rivers and lakes in the lower plain is not considered the water consumption of vegetation in the upper mountain area has not reached the limit of the water supply in the basin in the lhmb and the zwhmb there is still great potential while the bshmb and the dqhmb have reached the limit of vegetation restoration so it is not suitable for further vegetation restoration the reason why the ecological water demand of rivers and lakes are not considered is that the groundwater table has dropped dramatically and the leakage of rivers and lakes is huge which cannot make up for the huge gap in the short term no matter whether the vegetation is restored in the upstream mountainous area eventually water conservation in urban society is still necessary and it will be a continuous and slow process to restore the vegetation and river ecology 5 conclusions in the context of water shortage strong competition for water consumption exists between vegetation restoration in the mountainous areas and the social and economic sectors accurate calculation of water consumption for vegetation restoration and analysis of the maximum available amount of vegetation restoration is of particular significance to water resource management in river basins in this study the pml model was used to calculate the variation of water consumption during vegetation restoration in the mountainous areas of the haihe river basin between 2000 and 2019 we could observe that evapotranspiration water consumption in the mountainous areas increased by 212 mm due to vegetation restoration in the past two decades moreover we also described that the lai and evapotranspiration could be fitted by a linear relationship based on the above analysis we assessed the potential of vegetation restoration in different river basins considering water over extraction as a replacement plan the lhmb has the largest available water potential for vegetation restoration and the bshmb had exceeded the available water this study provides a simple method to evaluate whether vegetation restoration is reasonable which could also be a reference for other watershed studies credit authorship contribution statement wang qingming methodology conceptualization writing original draft jiang
