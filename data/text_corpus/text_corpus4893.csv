24465,understanding and modelling plant interactions is an important field in quantitative forest ecology many spatially explicit techniques have been devised for shedding light into these processes one of these methods includes the application of kernel functions which describe the decay with increasing distance of interaction effects of each plant of a given community on others in forest inventory a method referred to as relascope sampling is often applied to collect information on the state and change of tree resources somewhat unexpectedly the mathematical principles of this technique have been turned into measures of competition for use in ecological modelling in this study we combined methods from quantitative ecology and sampling theory by defining a parameter parsimonious relascope kernel function thus generalising the concept of individual tree basal area factors by using both relative and absolute growth rates as response variables in the regression we compared the performance of the relascope kernel with an alternative the exponential kernel function our results indicated that the relascope kernel can indeed be applied to both types of growth rates in individual based models using individual tree basal area factors it is even possible to anticipate the performance of the relascope kernel in most cases the estimation efficiency was greater when absolute growth rate was the response variable the exponential kernel was more efficient than the relascope kernel but at the expense of parameter parsimony and estimation robustness our study has shown that simple parsimonious models inspired by another field of natural sciences such as the relascope kernel can effectively encapsulate the interaction dynamics of forest ecosystems keywords agent individual based model spatial tree interactions neighbourhood forest inventory shot noise model ecological field theory 1 introduction traditionally the fields of forest inventory and forest ecology traditionally had little common ground except for the occasional cooperation for work on estimators of ecologically important summary characteristics motz et al 2010 newton 2007 krebs 1999 forest inventory has always been more dedicated to estimating the current state of forest resources and associated changes however forest ecology like many other scientific disciplines largely developed its own sampling theory and procedures to study the dynamics of individuals and populations green 1992 although there were exceptions see gregoire et al 1995 gregoire and schabenberger 1999 this was due to the vast diversity and heterogeneity of forest ecology where sampling and experimental design often but not always overlap gregoire 1998 newton 2007 montgomery 2013 one intriguing overlap between forest inventory and forest ecology is an offshoot of relascope sampling also referred to commonly as angle count or horizontal point sampling the method was originally invented in 1948 by walter bitterlich an austrian forest scientist to accelerate and improve the estimation of stand basal area and timber volume in forest stands and was later extended by others bitterlich 1984 grosenbaugh 1952 gregoire and valentine 2008 the method is applied also in resource monitoring as part of several national forest inventories tomppo et al 2010 the concept is based on angular measurements made using a small hand held device referred to as the relascope the method is used in many parts of the world e g west 2015 section 8 4 2 it has particular advantage where topography is highly variable since the original relascope device has an automated slope correction ability to avoid bias due to varying slopes interestingly the relascope idea has been taken up by quantitative forest ecology particularly in ecological modelling a common problem in forest modelling is to quantify tree interactions these interactions are often termed competition although competition is only a small part of the total interaction between trees traditionally the quantification of competitive effects has been subdivided as 1 the identification of competitors of a given subject tree and 2 the quantification of the competition load using information of both the competitors and the subject tree gadow and hui 1999 burkhart and tomé 2012 weiskittel et al 2011 two forms of competitive processes have been identified in forests symmetric and asymmetric e g binkley 2004 rasmussen and weiner 2017 ouyang et al 2019 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 section 2 1 1 in the former trees have competitive effects directly proportional to their sizes in asymmetric competition trees have disproportionately large competitive effects with respect to their sizes for much of the life of a forest above ground asymmetric competition for light tends to predominate as taller trees shade smaller but the reverse cannot occur interestingly researchers in ecology found that aspects of relascope sampling can be used effectively in the identification of competitor trees due to its design the method includes trees in the sample with a probability directly proportional to their sizes or formally to their stem cross sectional areas at breast height which generally correlates well with overall tree size thus it tends to prioritise the inclusion of larger trees that are likely to be the asymmetric competitors of other trees daniels 1976 lorimer 1983 tomé and burkhart 1989 the choice of the angle used to select trees in a relascope sample influences which trees are included the larger the angle the fewer and the larger are the trees that tend to be selected in practice these angles are defined through what is known as the basal area factor of the sampling device being used west 2015 section 8 4 2 this is described fully in section 2 of this article based on the relascope idea stöhr 1959 and spurr 1962 defined an angle summation method that can be used particularly to quantify the competition load suffered by individual trees it depends on the spatial distribution and relative sizes of neighbouring trees this approach is headed more in the direction of the second part of studying competitive effects that is the actual quantification of competition load key to doing this is the derivation of an individual tree basal area factor a similar method was used by rouvinen and kuuluvainen 1997 mctague 2010 and mctague and weiskittel 2016 suggested an individual tree basal area factor that employs elements of both the original bitterlich relascope sample and the spurr method whilst serving as an estimator of basal area and timber volume at the same time similar concepts were also suggested by stage and ledermann 2008 in recent years kernel functions have been increasingly favoured as modern successors to the traditional concept of competition indices that have been used in the past to quantify competition load kernel functions are important elements of individual based models and typically applied for modelling plant interaction and birth processes adler 1996 schneider et al 2006 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 like basal area factors they also depend on the size of trees and their distance to other trees or to a sample point apart from a solid mathematical foundation and great flexibility kernel functions offer the benefit of merging the two separate steps involved in the calculation of competitive effects pommerening and maleki 2014 therefore the kernel function concept has the potential to generalise individual tree basal area factors consequently in this paper we have proposed analysed and tested a new way of modelling tree interaction by combining the relascope with the kernel function concept the objective of this study was firstly to model and analyse a new kernel function which is based on the relascope concept secondly we aimed to analyse and discussed the merits of the new relascope kernel and compared its efficacy when used in modelling both absolute and relative growth rates of individual tree stem diameter and basal area with that of a reference function the more sophisticated exponential kernel function pommerening et al 2011 pommerening and maleki 2014 in the analysis we used eight different spatially explicit data sets representing rather different forest types from different parts of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 the concept of the relascope kernel consider fig 1 where tree j with stem diameter d j measured at 1 3 m above ground level is located at distance r j from a point i that point is the centre of a circle of which the circumference passes through the centre of the stem of tree j consider lines from the point that are tangential to the circumference of the tree stem with an angle between those lines of θ a tree is included in a point sample if for a chosen angle θ it is at or closer to the point than the distance r j it then simply follows that 1 r j d j 2 sin θ 2 angle θ depends on a basal area factor β defined in eq 2 usually in forest practice the same factor is employed for all trees in a forest stand that stand basal area factor is then used to estimate stand basal area from a count of the number of trees included in a sample west 2015 section 8 4 2 2 β π d j 2 4 π r 2 d j 2 r 2 si n 2 θ 2 this stand basal area factor β may be turned into an individual tree basal area factor β i where r j is the distance between tree j and another tree i as 3 β i d j 2 r j 2 suppose that a tree with index i is referred to hereafter as the subject tree the smaller tree j and the further it is from this subject tree i the smaller is the corresponding value of β i the properties and dependencies of β i are reminiscent of interaction kernels adler 1996 schneider et al 2006 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 suggesting that eq 3 might form the basis of a new kernel function using the kernel notation of pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 2 2 the individual tree basal area factor in eq 3 was modified to yield a kernel function eq 4 as 4 g j d j ξ d j 1 2 d i s t j ξ α where gj dj ξ is the relascope kernel function at an arbitrary location ξ in the forest related to tree j which has a diameter d j and is located at distance d i s t j ξ from ξ from a theoretical point of view eq 4 constitutes a hyperbolic or fractional interaction kernel adler 1996 schneider et al 2006 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 similar to the definition of other hyperbolic or fractional kernels the addition of 1 in the denominator ensures that eq 4 is defined for d i s t j ξ 0 that is at the location of tree j the power 2 in eq 3 has been replaced by a general model parameter α this parameter is interpretable and controls both the strength and range of the kernel function as illustrated in fig 2 a a similar but more sophisticated kernel function is the exponential kernel 5 g j d j ξ d j α e δ d i s t j ξ d j β that has been used successfully in previous studies pommerening et al 2011 pommerening and maleki 2014 in eq 5 parameter α controls the strength of the interaction signal expressed by the kernel function whilst β and δ define its range fig 2a the general shape of both kernel functions described in eqs 4 and 5 is very similar but the exponential kernel has three times the number of parameters of the relascope kernel following the terminology of pommerening and grabarnik 2019 eqs 4 and 5 are not strictly speaking kernel functions which have a maximum value of one but instead are local effects based on kernel functions for simplicity we retain the term kernel function here 2 2 estimating growth rates based on kernel functions one of the main benefits of the use of kernel functions in modelling is that their values for all the trees of a population can be aggregated multiplicatively or additively at any point ξ in the forest stand this ultimately results in an interaction field fig 2b that changes with time as trees grow produce offspring and die and covers the whole horizontal extent of the forest stand pommerening et al 2011 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 the ultimate goal of producing an interaction field is also the reason why eqs 4 and 5 include information only of those trees j that emit interaction signals and not of those that are on the receiving end that is the subject trees i this interaction field can now be employed in a second step to extract the amount of interaction each tree i faces at its own location of course this modelling focus uses only a small discretised fraction of the information that the interaction field offers the whole field provides much more information and can for example be used also to estimate the probability of occurrence of processes such as tree mortality or tree regeneration in those cases it seems reasonable to assume that trees are more likely to die and less likely to regenerate where the intensity of the interaction field is high pommerening et al 2021 as such the interaction field can also be interpreted as a kind of resource map describing for example light water or nutrient availability when using the relascope kernel the resulting interaction field is also an approximate estimator of tree basal area at any point in the forest tree growth depends mainly on the size of each tree but also on its interaction with other trees which influence the availability of resources such as light water and nutrients burkhart and tomé 2012 weiskittel et al 2011 the interaction load to which each subject tree i is exposed at its location ξ i can be calculated as the additive aggregation of the interaction effects imposed emitted by all other trees j i trees that are large and close to subject tree i naturally make a larger contribution to this interaction load than trees that are smaller and or further way the contribution of trees j that are very far from a subject tree is zero or near zero therefore no explicit selection of competitors is required the sum of interaction kernel values at ξ i at any time t forms the interaction function h i t which is an expression of the interaction load tree i is facing at that time to allow for asymmetric interaction it is advisable to divide the sum of interaction kernel values by the maximum kernel value at the location of tree i which for both kernel types is d i α since d i s t i ξ i 0 adding t as the temporal index to the terms of g j d j ξ of eqs 4 and 5 yielded 6 h i t j i g j t ξ i d i t α to ensure that the values of the interaction function lie between 0 and 1 a further transformation was carried out häbel et al 2019 to give h i t in place of h i t as 7 h i t 1 e ν h i t which introduces another model parameter ν in this study we had data available from tree plots that differed both in the number of times each was measured and the interval between measurements accordingly we calculated the growth rate of an individual tree as the difference between its sizes at two measurements divided by the length of the time period between them growth rates were considered in stem diameter d and basal area g π d 2 2 and both of these in terms of their absolute and relative growth rates agr and rgr respectively in the following equations we refer to a general growth variable y which can be either d or g in tree modelling basal area growth rates are often preferred to stem diameter growth rates as response or dependent variables although evidence for the superiority of one of these growth rates is not substantial west 1980 the absolute growth rate δ y i t can be estimated as 8 δ y i t δ y i t pot h i t where δ y i t pot is the stem diameter or basal area growth potential that a tree would have if competitive effects from other trees were absent eq 8 is based on the hypothesis that the interaction load exerted on a tree by other trees in the stand reduces its growth rate from what it might potentially be when basal area was used for y stem diameter agr was derived from basal area agr through 9 δ d i t 2 δ g i t π in the rgr case a few transformation steps eqs 10 12 need to be taken when basal area is used for y related to basal area at the beginning of the annual growth period the upper bound of relative growth rate of basal area p i t g can be calculated as 10 p i t g δ g i t g i t 1 and logarithmic rgr p i t g as commonly used in plant science pommerening and grabarnik 2019 p 264 can be obtained from p i t g through 11 p i t g log 1 p i t g finally stem diameter rgr is calculated from basal area rgr using eq 12 sumida et al 1997 12 p i t d p i t g 2 potential growth as applied in eq 8 was determined from all the data we had available for each of the eight tree species sites we considered and was modelled using the hugershoff function hugershoff 1936 zeide 1993 eq 7 13 δ y i t pot k y i t p e q y i t the parameters of the hugershoff function were estimated as an upper quantile of absolute stem diameter or basal area growth see section 2 3 and as a function of y k p and q are the model parameters häbel et al 2019 fig 3 2 3 estimation and validation characteristics for parameter estimation of the various functions being considered here we largely followed the methods described by häbel et al 2019 firstly we estimated the parameters k p and q of the potential stem diameter or basal area growth model eq 13 for each data set this was done applying quantile regression koenker and park 1994 cade and noon 2003 west 2021 with the quantile set to τ 0 975 as shown for examples in fig 3 secondly the kernel parameters α relascope kernel eq 4 α β δ exponential kernel eq 5 and growth parameter ν eq 7 were estimated simultaneously through regression using stem diameter basal area potential and tree interaction as independent predictor variables mean annual stem diameter basal area rgr and agr served as dependent response variable as in häbel et al 2019 we applied both weighted nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood approach for estimating kernel and growth parameters we checked various goodness of fit characteristics including the distribution of h i t the residuals and the shape of the interaction kernels to select the best estimation for each data set in the regression we applied periodic boundary conditions pommerening and grabarnik 2019 p 177 for spatial edge correction for evaluating the regression results we quantified common characteristics such as bias and rmse root mean square error these characteristics always related to stem diameter in addition and for better comparison between data sets we calculated relative bias and efficiency relative bias b is defined as 14 b i 1 n y i y i n y where y i is the ith prediction modelled stem diameter agr or rgr y i is the ith observation observed stem diameter agr or rgr n is the number of observations and y is the mean observation efficiency e is defined as 15 e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 efficiency values approach 1 with improving model performance a value of zero indicates that the model explains no more variation than the mean value of the observations alone and negative values highlight biased estimates for this analysis we used our own r r development core team 2020 and c code 2 4 study data spatially explicit time series data from three plots of three eucalypt species were included in

al 2019 for this study the data from the two plots were pooled for convenience we have used the prevailing species name when referring to each data set hereafter 3 results 3 1 growth potentials an important outcome of this work is the finding that the growth potential had considerable influence on the estimation of the parameters of the kernel function for estimating relative growth rates it was in terms of the performance criteria described in section 2 3 usually found best to define the growth potentials based on basal area agr for estimating absolute growth rates it was generally only possible to define growth potential in terms of stem diameter agr since the regressions involving the kernel functions when based on potential basal area agr would in that case not yield realistic model parameters in terms of the performance criteria described in section 2 3 with both modelling alternatives the independent variable of the growth potential estimation was stem diameter fig 3 it has also proved advantageous and made the model more versatile to always model agr growth potentials rather than rgr potentials irrespective of whether agr or rgr was the final dependent variable in the regression rgr dbh point clouds often differed substantially in shape from the data set of one species to that of another whilst agr dbh point clouds as in fig 3 largely shared the same shape and their quantile data were amendable to being described by the same general model eq 13 3 2 correlations between growth rates and individual tree basal area factors individual basal area factors eq 3 formed the starting point of our modelling work consequently as a preparation for modelling we studied the relationship between individual basal area factors and relative and absolute growth rates more specifically as an expression of competition load and in analogy to eq 6 we calculated the sum of individual basal area factors over all trees other than subject tree i finally we divided this sum by the square of stem diameter of tree i to obtain a measure of asymmetric competition i e 16 h i t β β i d i 2 h i t β and both rgr agr were negatively correlated i e small growth rates occurred more where values of h i t β were large fig 4 both the rgr and agr point clouds greatly varied from study site to study site for small trees rgr is usually largest the e regnans data fig 4ca showed the largest and f sylvatica fig 4cb the smallest relative growth rates some rgr point clouds had a larger vertical and horizontal spread than others the point clouds related to the p abies plots fig 4ac for example had a comparatively large horizontal spread and the point cloud of e regnans fig 4ca showed a large vertical spread noteworthy is the almost uniform distribution of rgr in the natural p menziesii forest fig 4cc the agr point cloud patterns were in fact not too dissimilar from the rgr patterns also here the general pattern was that of a negative exponential distribution when comparing agr and rgr the tendency to this distribution was for some data stronger for agr than for rgr for some data e g p abies plots fig 4bc 4ac f sylvatica fig 4db 4cb and p menziesii forest fig 4dc 4cc yet for other data there was hardly any difference in the point cloud shapes between agr and rgr e g e regnans fig 4da 4ca p pinaster fig 4bd and fig 4ad and p sylvestris fig 4dd fig 4cd based on these initial results involving h i t β we hypothesised that the relascope kernel function performed best with those data where the rgr or agr point clouds most closely exhibited an exponential pattern 3 3 regression results regressions for both the relascope and the exponential kernels with regard to rgr as the dependent variable were determined satisfactorily for all eight data sets table 1 as expected usually the use of exponential kernels with three model parameters instead of one led to greater efficiencies than the application of relascope kernels however the differences were often moderately large e g in the case of e obliqua 20 5 gain f sylvatica 29 8 gain p abies 4 0 gain and p sylvestris 20 1 gain the largest gain achieved by applying the exponential kernel instead of the relascope kernel was 47 2 for e regnans these gains came at the expense of two more model parameters and greater estimation difficulties in the majority of cases acceptable regression results were more straightforward to obtain for the relascope kernel i e the regression was more robust estimation difficulties were often indicated by very large and very small model parameters α β δ ν with the relascope kernel this was the case for p menziesii and parameter ν with the exponential kernel this situation occurred for δ with e obliqua e regnans and p pinaster with the exponential kernel there was also a very small value for β with e delegatensis in four out of eight cases the absolute relative bias b eq 14 was smaller when the relascope kernel was applied rather than the exponential kernel using stem diameter agr potentials the same regressions were also possible for agr as the dependent variable table 2 the efficiency values were generally considerably higher in table 2 than in table 1 this result was consistent with our earlier observations made concerning fig 4 i e our hypothesis stating that the performance of the relascope kernel can be anticipated from the point clouds in fig 4 is true the agr point cloud often followed the shape of an exponential distribution more than the rgr point cloud and with agr there was usually less of a concentration of points near the origin of the system of coordinates in table 2 we also noted the same efficiency trend as for rgr in table 1 i e the efficiencies were usually markedly higher for the exponential kernel for e obliqua e delegatensis and p abies the gain of using an exponential kernel instead of a relascope kernel was 14 9 6 3 and 7 2 respectively these percentages are generally lower than the minimum percentages calculated from table 1 for p pinaster and p sylvestris this gain exceeded 100 these large differences were attributed to the fact that the efficiencies for the two pine data sets were negative for the relascope kernel the gains achieved by the exponential kernel were again contrasted by the much larger number of parameters in the exponential kernel and the associated estimation difficulties with the relascope kernel suspiciously large ν values occurred only for p menziesii and p sylvestris by contrast with the exponential kernel a suspicious β value was obtained for e delegatensis in addition large δ and or ν values were estimated for e obliqua e regnans p pinaster and p sylvestris only the absolute relative bias b associated with the relascope kernel and p menziesii was smaller than that achieved with the exponential kernel 4 discussion and conclusions neighbourhood interactions are an important process in plant population dynamics and the quantification of such processes is therefore a core interest of quantitative forest ecology schneider et al 2006 berger and hildenbrandt 2000 häbel et al 2019 individual tree basal area factors and relascope kernel functions are comparatively simple quantities that can play important roles both in forest ecology and resource management rouvinen and kuuluvainen 1997 mctague 2010 mctague and weiskittel 2016 stage and ledermann 2008 resource managers forest practitioners and forest scientists are very familiar with the relascope concept which eases the understanding and application of these techniques in individual based modelling by using measures forest practitioners and resource managers are familiar with trust in new models and the applications can be inspired after analysing data from eight very different forest ecosystems located in different parts of the world our work demonstrated that the relascope kernel function can indeed be applied in individual based models like any other kernel function and thus achieve a generalisation of individual tree basal area factors relascope kernels can be even used for estimating two different growth rates relative and absolute growth rates as dependent or response variables such a comparison of performance with different growth rates as response variables does not appear to have been done previously by plotting these growth rates over the values of the interaction function constructed from individual tree basal area factors eq 16 fig 4 it is even possible to anticipate the performance and suitability of the relascope kernel for a given data set this should save the analyst from spending time and effort on modelling what would eventually yield poor results as expected growth rates and the interaction function h i t β were negatively correlated i e large values of h i t β typically lead to a reduction of growth rates when comparing the relascope kernel with the exponential kernel as a reference it turned out that the behaviour of the relascope kernel was usually more robust in regressions judging by the efficiency results the exponential kernel however was more exact in modelling the interaction field although earlier research has shown that the difference in attenuation with distance as a result of using different kernel functions plays a rather minor role schneider et al 2006 both performance aspects are related to the difference in the number of model parameters considering the very different data sets involving eight tree species greater efficiencies eq 15 could in most cases be achieved when agr was used as dependent variable in that case the efficiency differences were also smaller between relascope and exponential kernel function than in a situation where rgr was the dependent variable however there were also situations where the rgr model outperformed the agr model such as in the case of the e regnans p pinaster and p sylvestris data table 1 and 2 and again scatter plots such as those in fig 4 can aid the decision process therefore the final choice of rgr versus agr as dependent variable in the regression always depends on the actual data at hand and on the objectives of modelling an interesting and helpful result of our study was the discovery of a clear and strong influence of the potential growth model on the parameters of the kernel function in the case of stem diameter agr reliable parameters of the two kernel functions could only be estimated when the growth potential eq 13 was based on stem diameter agr as well by contrast when stem diameter rgr was the dependant variable the regressions led in most cases to more reliable parameters of the two kernel functions if the growth potential was based on basal area agr in the same way the finding that the modelling process is more straightforward when potential growth is generally based on agr even if rgr is the dependent variable of the regression may prove helpful in future modelling work this influence of the growth potential needs to be considered in future modelling efforts kernel functions play a crucial role in individual based modelling where they are used to model interaction birth and sometimes even death processes our study has shown that simple parsimonious functions such as the relascope kernel can be quite effective and an important starting point for quantifying the interaction dynamics in forest

parsimonious relascope kernel function thus generalising the concept of individual tree basal area factors by using both relative and absolute growth rates as response variables in the regression we compared the performance of the relascope kernel with an alternative the exponential kernel function our results indicated that the relascope kernel can indeed be applied to both types of growth rates in individual based models using individual tree basal area factors it is even possible to anticipate the performance of the relascope kernel in most cases the estimation efficiency was greater when absolute growth rate was the response variable the exponential kernel was more efficient than the relascope kernel but at the expense of parameter parsimony and estimation robustness our study has shown that simple parsimonious models inspired by another field of natural sciences such as the relascope kernel can effectively encapsulate the interaction dynamics of forest ecosystems keywords agent individual based model spatial tree interactions neighbourhood forest inventory shot noise model ecological field theory 1 introduction traditionally the fields of forest inventory and forest ecology traditionally had little common ground except for the occasional cooperation for work on estimators of ecologically important summary characteristics motz et al 2010 newton 2007 krebs 1999 forest inventory has always been more dedicated to estimating the current state of forest resources and associated changes however forest ecology like many other scientific disciplines largely developed its own sampling theory and procedures to study the dynamics of individuals and populations green 1992 although there were exceptions see gregoire et al 1995 gregoire and schabenberger 1999 this was due to the vast diversity and heterogeneity of forest ecology where sampling and experimental design often but not always overlap gregoire 1998 newton 2007 montgomery 2013 one intriguing overlap between forest inventory and forest ecology is an offshoot of relascope sampling also referred to commonly as angle count or horizontal point sampling the method was originally invented in 1948 by walter bitterlich an austrian forest scientist to accelerate and improve the estimation of stand basal area and timber volume in forest stands and was later extended by others bitterlich 1984 grosenbaugh 1952 gregoire and valentine 2008 the method is applied also in resource monitoring as part of several national forest inventories tomppo et al 2010 the concept is based on angular measurements made using a small hand held device referred to as the relascope the method is used in many parts of the world e g west 2015 section 8 4 2 it has particular advantage where topography is highly variable since the original relascope device has an automated slope correction ability to avoid bias due to varying slopes interestingly the relascope idea has been taken up by quantitative forest ecology particularly in ecological modelling a common problem in forest modelling is to quantify tree interactions these interactions are often termed competition although competition is only a small part of the total interaction between trees traditionally the quantification of competitive effects has been subdivided as 1 the identification of competitors of a given subject tree and 2 the quantification of the competition load using information of both the competitors and the subject tree gadow and hui 1999 burkhart and tomé 2012 weiskittel et al 2011 two forms of competitive processes have been identified in forests symmetric and asymmetric e g binkley 2004 rasmussen and weiner 2017 ouyang et al 2019 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 section 2 1 1 in the former trees have competitive effects directly proportional to their sizes in asymmetric competition trees have disproportionately large competitive effects with respect to their sizes for much of the life of a forest above ground asymmetric competition for light tends to predominate as taller trees shade smaller but the reverse cannot occur interestingly researchers in ecology found that aspects of relascope sampling can be used effectively in the identification of competitor trees due to its design the method includes trees in the sample with a probability directly proportional to their sizes or formally to their stem cross sectional areas at breast height which generally correlates well with overall tree size thus it tends to prioritise the inclusion of larger trees that are likely to be the asymmetric competitors of other trees daniels 1976 lorimer 1983 tomé and burkhart 1989 the choice of the angle used to select trees in a relascope sample influences which trees are included the larger the angle the fewer and the larger are the trees that tend to be selected in practice these angles are defined through what is known as the basal area factor of the sampling device being used west 2015 section 8 4 2 this is described fully in section 2 of this article based on the relascope idea stöhr 1959 and spurr 1962 defined an angle summation method that can be used particularly to quantify the competition load suffered by individual trees it depends on the spatial distribution and relative sizes of neighbouring trees this approach is headed more in the direction of the second part of studying competitive effects that is the actual quantification of competition load key to doing this is the derivation of an individual tree basal area factor a similar method was used by rouvinen and kuuluvainen 1997 mctague 2010 and mctague and weiskittel 2016 suggested an individual tree basal area factor that employs elements of both the original bitterlich relascope sample and the spurr method whilst serving as an estimator of basal area and timber volume at the same time similar concepts were also suggested by stage and ledermann 2008 in recent years kernel functions have been increasingly favoured as modern successors to the traditional concept of competition indices that have been used in the past to quantify competition load kernel functions are important elements of individual based models and typically applied for modelling plant interaction and birth processes adler 1996 schneider et al 2006 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 like basal area factors they also depend on the size of trees and their distance to other trees or to a sample point apart from a solid mathematical foundation and great flexibility kernel functions offer the benefit of merging the two separate steps involved in the calculation of competitive effects pommerening and maleki 2014 therefore the kernel function concept has the potential to generalise individual tree basal area factors consequently in this paper we have proposed analysed and tested a new way of modelling tree interaction by combining the relascope with the kernel function concept the objective of this study was firstly to model and analyse a new kernel function which is based on the relascope concept secondly we aimed to analyse and discussed the merits of the new relascope kernel and compared its efficacy when used in modelling both absolute and relative growth rates of individual tree stem diameter and basal area with that of a reference function the more sophisticated exponential kernel function pommerening et al 2011 pommerening and maleki 2014 in the analysis we used eight different spatially explicit data sets representing rather different forest types from different parts of the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 the concept of the relascope kernel consider fig 1 where tree j with stem diameter d j measured at 1 3 m above ground level is located at distance r j from a point i that point is the centre of a circle of which the circumference passes through the centre of the stem of tree j consider lines from the point that are tangential to the circumference of the tree stem with an angle between those lines of θ a tree is included in a point sample if for a chosen angle θ it is at or closer to the point than the distance r j it then simply follows that 1 r j d j 2 sin θ 2 angle θ depends on a basal area factor β defined in eq 2 usually in forest practice the same factor is employed for all trees in a forest stand that stand basal area factor is then used to estimate stand basal area from a count of the number of trees included in a sample west 2015 section 8 4 2 2 β π d j 2 4 π r 2 d j 2 r 2 si n 2 θ 2 this stand basal area factor β may be turned into an individual tree basal area factor β i where r j is the distance between tree j and another tree i as 3 β i d j 2 r j 2 suppose that a tree with index i is referred to hereafter as the subject tree the smaller tree j and the further it is from this subject tree i the smaller is the corresponding value of β i the properties and dependencies of β i are reminiscent of interaction kernels adler 1996 schneider et al 2006 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 suggesting that eq 3 might form the basis of a new kernel function using the kernel notation of pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 2 2 the individual tree basal area factor in eq 3 was modified to yield a kernel function eq 4 as 4 g j d j ξ d j 1 2 d i s t j ξ α where gj dj ξ is the relascope kernel function at an arbitrary location ξ in the forest related to tree j which has a diameter d j and is located at distance d i s t j ξ from ξ from a theoretical point of view eq 4 constitutes a hyperbolic or fractional interaction kernel adler 1996 schneider et al 2006 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 chapter 5 similar to the definition of other hyperbolic or fractional kernels the addition of 1 in the denominator ensures that eq 4 is defined for d i s t j ξ 0 that is at the location of tree j the power 2 in eq 3 has been replaced by a general model parameter α this parameter is interpretable and controls both the strength and range of the kernel function as illustrated in fig 2 a a similar but more sophisticated kernel function is the exponential kernel 5 g j d j ξ d j α e δ d i s t j ξ d j β that has been used successfully in previous studies pommerening et al 2011 pommerening and maleki 2014 in eq 5 parameter α controls the strength of the interaction signal expressed by the kernel function whilst β and δ define its range fig 2a the general shape of both kernel functions described in eqs 4 and 5 is very similar but the exponential kernel has three times the number of parameters of the relascope kernel following the terminology of pommerening and grabarnik 2019 eqs 4 and 5 are not strictly speaking kernel functions which have a maximum value of one but instead are local effects based on kernel functions for simplicity we retain the term kernel function here 2 2 estimating growth rates based on kernel functions one of the main benefits of the use of kernel functions in modelling is that their values for all the trees of a population can be aggregated multiplicatively or additively at any point ξ in the forest stand this ultimately results in an interaction field fig 2b that changes with time as trees grow produce offspring and die and covers the whole horizontal extent of the forest stand pommerening et al 2011 pommerening and grabarnik 2019 the ultimate goal of producing an interaction field is also the reason why eqs 4 and 5 include information only of those trees j that emit interaction signals and not of those that are on the receiving end that is the subject trees i this interaction field can now be employed in a second step to extract the amount of interaction each tree i faces at its own location of course this modelling focus uses only a small discretised fraction of the information that the interaction field offers the whole field provides much more information and can for example be used also to estimate the probability of occurrence of processes such as tree mortality or tree regeneration in those cases it seems reasonable to assume that trees are more likely to die and less likely to regenerate where the intensity of the interaction field is high pommerening et al 2021 as such the interaction field can also be interpreted as a kind of resource map describing for example light water or nutrient availability when using the relascope kernel the resulting interaction field is also an approximate estimator of tree basal area at any point in the forest tree growth depends mainly on the size of each tree but also on its interaction with other trees which influence the availability of resources such as light water and nutrients burkhart and tomé 2012 weiskittel et al 2011 the interaction load to which each subject tree i is exposed at its location ξ i can be calculated as the additive aggregation of the interaction effects imposed emitted by all other trees j i trees that are large and close to subject tree i naturally make a larger contribution to this interaction load than trees that are smaller and or further way the contribution of trees j that are very far from a subject tree is zero or near zero therefore no explicit selection of competitors is required the sum of interaction kernel values at ξ i at any time t forms the interaction function h i t which is an expression of the interaction load tree i is facing at that time to allow for asymmetric interaction it is advisable to divide the sum of interaction kernel values by the maximum kernel value at the location of tree i which for both kernel types is d i α since d i s t i ξ i 0 adding t as the temporal index to the terms of g j d j ξ of eqs 4 and 5 yielded 6 h i t j i g j t ξ i d i t α to ensure that the values of the interaction function lie between 0 and 1 a further transformation was carried out häbel et al 2019 to give h i t in place of h i t as 7 h i t 1 e ν h i t which introduces another model parameter ν in this study we had data available from tree plots that differed both in the number of times each was measured and the interval between measurements accordingly we calculated the growth rate of an individual tree as the difference between its sizes at two measurements divided by the length of the time period between them growth rates were considered in stem diameter d and basal area g π d 2 2 and both of these in terms of their absolute and relative growth rates agr and rgr respectively in the following equations we refer to a general growth variable y which can be either d or g in tree modelling basal area growth rates are often preferred to stem diameter growth rates as response or dependent variables although evidence for the superiority of one of these growth rates is not substantial west 1980 the absolute growth rate δ y i t can be estimated as 8 δ y i t δ y i t pot h i t where δ y i t pot is the stem diameter or basal area growth potential that a tree would have if competitive effects from other trees were absent eq 8 is based on the hypothesis that the interaction load exerted on a tree by other trees in the stand reduces its growth rate from what it might potentially be when basal area was used for y stem diameter agr was derived from basal area agr through 9 δ d i t 2 δ g i t π in the rgr case a few transformation steps eqs 10 12 need to be taken when basal area is used for y related to basal area at the beginning of the annual growth period the upper bound of relative growth rate of basal area p i t g can be calculated as 10 p i t g δ g i t g i t 1 and logarithmic rgr p i t g as commonly used in plant science pommerening and grabarnik 2019 p 264 can be obtained from p i t g through 11 p i t g log 1 p i t g finally stem diameter rgr is calculated from basal area rgr using eq 12 sumida et al 1997 12 p i t d p i t g 2 potential growth as applied in eq 8 was determined from all the data we had available for each of the eight tree species sites we considered and was modelled using the hugershoff function hugershoff 1936 zeide 1993 eq 7 13 δ y i t pot k y i t p e q y i t the parameters of the hugershoff function were estimated as an upper quantile of absolute stem diameter or basal area growth see section 2 3 and as a function of y k p and q are the model parameters häbel et al 2019 fig 3 2 3 estimation and validation characteristics for parameter estimation of the various functions being considered here we largely followed the methods described by häbel et al 2019 firstly we estimated the parameters k p and q of the potential stem diameter or basal area growth model eq 13 for each data set this was done applying quantile regression koenker and park 1994 cade and noon 2003 west 2021 with the quantile set to τ 0 975 as shown for examples in fig 3 secondly the kernel parameters α relascope kernel eq 4 α β δ exponential kernel eq 5 and growth parameter ν eq 7 were estimated simultaneously through regression using stem diameter basal area potential and tree interaction as independent predictor variables mean annual stem diameter basal area rgr and agr served as dependent response variable as in häbel et al 2019 we applied both weighted nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood approach for estimating kernel and growth parameters we checked various goodness of fit characteristics including the distribution of h i t the residuals and the shape of the interaction kernels to select the best estimation for each data set in the regression we applied periodic boundary conditions pommerening and grabarnik 2019 p 177 for spatial edge correction for evaluating the regression results we quantified common characteristics such as bias and rmse root mean square error these characteristics always related to stem diameter in addition and for better comparison between data sets we calculated relative bias and efficiency relative bias b is defined as 14 b i 1 n y i y i n y where y i is the ith prediction modelled stem diameter agr or rgr y i is the ith observation observed stem diameter agr or rgr n is the number of observations and y is the mean observation efficiency e is defined as 15 e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 efficiency values approach 1 with improving model performance a value of zero indicates that the model explains no more variation than the mean value of the observations alone and negative values highlight biased estimates for this analysis we used our own r r development core team 2020 and c code 2 4 study data spatially explicit time series data from three plots of three eucalypt species were included in

al 2019 for this study the data from the two plots were pooled for convenience we have used the prevailing species name when referring to each data set hereafter 3 results 3 1 growth potentials an important outcome of this work is the finding that the growth potential had considerable influence on the estimation of the parameters of the kernel function for estimating relative growth rates it was in terms of the performance criteria described in section 2 3 usually found best to define the growth potentials based on basal area agr for estimating absolute growth rates it was generally only possible to define growth potential in terms of stem diameter agr since the regressions involving the kernel functions when based on potential basal area agr would in that case not yield realistic model parameters in terms of the performance criteria described in section 2 3 with both modelling alternatives the independent variable of the growth potential estimation was stem diameter fig 3 it has also proved advantageous and made the model more versatile to always model agr growth potentials rather than rgr potentials irrespective of whether agr or rgr was the final dependent variable in the regression rgr dbh point clouds often differed substantially in shape from the data set of one species to that of another whilst agr dbh point clouds as in fig 3 largely shared the same shape and their quantile data were amendable to being described by the same general model eq 13 3 2 correlations between growth rates and individual tree basal area factors individual basal area factors eq 3 formed the starting point of our modelling work consequently as a preparation for modelling we studied the relationship between individual basal area factors and relative and absolute growth rates more specifically as an expression of competition load and in analogy to eq 6 we calculated the sum of individual basal area factors over all trees other than subject tree i finally we divided this sum by the square of stem diameter of tree i to obtain a measure of asymmetric competition i e 16 h i t β β i d i 2 h i t β and both rgr agr were negatively correlated i e small growth rates occurred more where values of h i t β were large fig 4 both the rgr and agr point clouds greatly varied from study site to study site for small trees rgr is usually largest the e regnans data fig 4ca showed the largest and f sylvatica fig 4cb the smallest relative growth rates some rgr point clouds had a larger vertical and horizontal spread than others the point clouds related to the p abies plots fig 4ac for example had a comparatively large horizontal spread and the point cloud of e regnans fig 4ca showed a large vertical spread noteworthy is the almost uniform distribution of rgr in the natural p menziesii forest fig 4cc the agr point cloud patterns were in fact not too dissimilar from the rgr patterns also here the general pattern was that of a negative exponential distribution when comparing agr and rgr the tendency to this distribution was for some data stronger for agr than for rgr for some data e g p abies plots fig 4bc 4ac f sylvatica fig 4db 4cb and p menziesii forest fig 4dc 4cc yet for other data there was hardly any difference in the point cloud shapes between agr and rgr e g e regnans fig 4da 4ca p pinaster fig 4bd and fig 4ad and p sylvestris fig 4dd fig 4cd based on these initial results involving h i t β we hypothesised that the relascope kernel function performed best with those data where the rgr or agr point clouds most closely exhibited an exponential pattern 3 3 regression results regressions for both the relascope and the exponential kernels with regard to rgr as the dependent variable were determined satisfactorily for all eight data sets table 1 as expected usually the use of exponential kernels with three model parameters instead of one led to greater efficiencies than the application of relascope kernels however the differences were often moderately large e g in the case of e obliqua 20 5 gain f sylvatica 29 8 gain p abies 4 0 gain and p sylvestris 20 1 gain the largest gain achieved by applying the exponential kernel instead of the relascope kernel was 47 2 for e regnans these gains came at the expense of two more model parameters and greater estimation difficulties in the majority of cases acceptable regression results were more straightforward to obtain for the relascope kernel i e the regression was more robust estimation difficulties were often indicated by very large and very small model parameters α β δ ν with the relascope kernel this was the case for p menziesii and parameter ν with the exponential kernel this situation occurred for δ with e obliqua e regnans and p pinaster with the exponential kernel there was also a very small value for β with e delegatensis in four out of eight cases the absolute relative bias b eq 14 was smaller when the relascope kernel was applied rather than the exponential kernel using stem diameter agr potentials the same regressions were also possible for agr as the dependent variable table 2 the efficiency values were generally considerably higher in table 2 than in table 1 this result was consistent with our earlier observations made concerning fig 4 i e our hypothesis stating that the performance of the relascope kernel can be anticipated from the point clouds in fig 4 is true the agr point cloud often followed the shape of an exponential distribution more than the rgr point cloud and with agr there was usually less of a concentration of points near the origin of the system of coordinates in table 2 we also noted the same efficiency trend as for rgr in table 1 i e the efficiencies were usually markedly higher for the exponential kernel for e obliqua e delegatensis and p abies the gain of using an exponential kernel instead of a relascope kernel was 14 9 6 3 and 7 2 respectively these percentages are generally lower than the minimum percentages calculated from table 1 for p pinaster and p sylvestris this gain exceeded 100 these large differences were attributed to the fact that the efficiencies for the two pine data sets were negative for the relascope kernel the gains achieved by the exponential kernel were again contrasted by the much larger number of parameters in the exponential kernel and the associated estimation difficulties with the relascope kernel suspiciously large ν values occurred only for p menziesii and p sylvestris by contrast with the exponential kernel a suspicious β value was obtained for e delegatensis in addition large δ and or ν values were estimated for e obliqua e regnans p pinaster and p sylvestris only the absolute relative bias b associated with the relascope kernel and p menziesii was smaller than that achieved with the exponential kernel 4 discussion and conclusions neighbourhood interactions are an important process in plant population dynamics and the quantification of such processes is therefore a core interest of quantitative forest ecology schneider et al 2006 berger and hildenbrandt 2000 häbel et al 2019 individual tree basal area factors and relascope kernel functions are comparatively simple quantities that can play important roles both in forest ecology and resource management rouvinen and kuuluvainen 1997 mctague 2010 mctague and weiskittel 2016 stage and ledermann 2008 resource managers forest practitioners and forest scientists are very familiar with the relascope concept which eases the understanding and application of these techniques in individual based modelling by using measures forest practitioners and resource managers are familiar with trust in new models and the applications can be inspired after analysing data from eight very different forest ecosystems located in different parts of the world our work demonstrated that the relascope kernel function can indeed be applied in individual based models like any other kernel function and thus achieve a generalisation of individual tree basal area factors relascope kernels can be even used for estimating two different growth rates relative and absolute growth rates as dependent or response variables such a comparison of performance with different growth rates as response variables does not appear to have been done previously by plotting these growth rates over the values of the interaction function constructed from individual tree basal area factors eq 16 fig 4 it is even possible to anticipate the performance and suitability of the relascope kernel for a given data set this should save the analyst from spending time and effort on modelling what would eventually yield poor results as expected growth rates and the interaction function h i t β were negatively correlated i e large values of h i t β typically lead to a reduction of growth rates when comparing the relascope kernel with the exponential kernel as a reference it turned out that the behaviour of the relascope kernel was usually more robust in regressions judging by the efficiency results the exponential kernel however was more exact in modelling the interaction field although earlier research has shown that the difference in attenuation with distance as a result of using different kernel functions plays a rather minor role schneider et al 2006 both performance aspects are related to the difference in the number of model parameters considering the very different data sets involving eight tree species greater efficiencies eq 15 could in most cases be achieved when agr was used as dependent variable in that case the efficiency differences were also smaller between relascope and exponential kernel function than in a situation where rgr was the dependent variable however there were also situations where the rgr model outperformed the agr model such as in the case of the e regnans p pinaster and p sylvestris data table 1 and 2 and again scatter plots such as those in fig 4 can aid the decision process therefore the final choice of rgr versus agr as dependent variable in the regression always depends on the actual data at hand and on the objectives of modelling an interesting and helpful result of our study was the discovery of a clear and strong influence of the potential growth model on the parameters of the kernel function in the case of stem diameter agr reliable parameters of the two kernel functions could only be estimated when the growth potential eq 13 was based on stem diameter agr as well by contrast when stem diameter rgr was the dependant variable the regressions led in most cases to more reliable parameters of the two kernel functions if the growth potential was based on basal area agr in the same way the finding that the modelling process is more straightforward when potential growth is generally based on agr even if rgr is the dependent variable of the regression may prove helpful in future modelling work this influence of the growth potential needs to be considered in future modelling efforts kernel functions play a crucial role in individual based modelling where they are used to model interaction birth and sometimes even death processes our study has shown that simple parsimonious functions such as the relascope kernel can be quite effective and an important starting point for quantifying the interaction dynamics in forest

24466,correcting for sampling biases and the misleading results they generate is an important but sometimes overlooked aspect of ecological research removal sampling a common method used across survey protocols to estimate abundance usually assumes constant capture probability across all individuals in a population however differences in body size which are widespread in fish assemblages are likely to violate this assumption to correct for potential biases in removal sampling we used hierarchical bayesian models that estimate capture probability as a function of body size and common covariates associated with electrofishing of fish in streams using a fish out data set n 78 from alberta canada that includes true abundances we demonstrate that capture probability increased with body size and the model accurately estimated abundance for the majority of the reaches 83 furthermore model performance improved when site width and conductivity and their interactions with body size were included as covariates in a stream fish dataset from ontario n 56 the inclusion of site covariates in the model indicates that these size based effects on capture probability can be dependent on the environment the consequence of ignoring size dependent catch probability is to underestimate biomass when the actual biomass is low and to overestimate biomass when it is high this removal model allows us to estimate capture probability for multiple pass samples and consequently improves our ability to obtain more reliable abundance estimates this modeling framework is presented using electrofishing yet it is flexible enough to be used with a variety of other sampling techniques keywords abundance capture probability populations removal sampling size bias streams introduction sampling bias is a common issue when collecting and analyzing ecological data as many uncontrollable confounding factors can affect the effectiveness of study design stuber et al 2013 the problem for ecologists and resource managers is that these biases can misrepresent relationships within populations and communities may lead to misinterpretations of results and hypotheses and ultimately impact scientific or management decisions all empirical studies and their associated sampling techniques have potential biases with unintended consequences prior et al 2001 and many of these biases may not be completely avoidable šimundić 2013 as such it is important to identify and address these biases where possible to improve the quality of field data and subsequent ecological analyses removal sampling a commonly used method in ecology is subject to potential sampling biases while many applications of this method have focused on freshwater systems e g jones and stockwell 1995 sutton and jones 2020 it has been used in many different contexts to estimate the density of populations such as ringed seals phoca hispida using seal holes hammill and smith 1990 adult ground beetles with pitfall traps clark et al 1995 northern bobwhites colinus virginianus with roadside point counts murray et al 2011 and salamanders in a streamside community petranka and murray 2001 the removal method involves removing individuals from a closed population across successive samplings passes so that the rate of depletion of catches among passes allows for the inference of the initial population density and the capture probability to be free of bias this method requires that three main assumptions are valid 1 the population is closed with no immigration emigration or mortality in the sampling site 2 there is equal effort among successive sampling events and 3 capture probability is constant across individuals and passes e g carle and strub 1978 which is the focus of our study the first two assumptions can be accounted for mainly through the design of robust field protocols that involve isolating sites and standardizing effort respectively however the third assumption is more difficult to account for in a field setting if capture probability is inherently variable among the target organisms due to some behavioral or life history trait e g body size anderson 1995 under this scenario the field data will likely require analytical corrections following the survey here we demonstrate a possible correction using a removal protocol for an electrofishing survey of fish assemblages in streams fish populations including all different species in the assemblage in streams and rivers 10 m width provide a model system for the removal method using electrofishing as these populations can be easily closed using block nets and effort standardized by ensuring the same magnitude of electrical current is used over the same time period and the same stream area across passes however these systems likely violate the third assumption as capture probability has been shown to be positively correlated with body size korman et al 2009 millar et al 2016 while many different studies note potential biases associated with body size in electrofishing samples e g borgstrom and skaala 1993 anderson 1995 dauwalter and fisher 2007 few have attempted to address this issue korman et al 2009 hense et al 2010 millar et al 2016 among other factors the efficiency and probability of capturing fish using an electrofishing unit is dependent on the ability of the sampler and the electrofishing unit to immobilize the fish and then the ability to see and net the immobilized fish understanding how an electrofishing unit immobilizes fish is essential to understanding a source of size related bias and allow for its correction previous studies have investigated the electrofishing unit settings required to immobilize fish with an electrical field and have concluded that lower power and voltage gradients are needed to immobilize larger fish relative to smaller ones dolan and miranda 2003 habera et al 2010 for example under a common power setting the capture efficiency of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss in south appalachian streams over 100 mm in length was 0 88 but only 0 65 for trout under 100 mm habera et al 2010 this presents a challenge when sampling a fish population because only one power setting is typically used yet it needs to be high enough that it immobilizes smaller fish while low enough that there is minimal physical harm to larger fish dolan and miranda 2004 henry et al 2004 striking this balance will typically allow smaller fish to be less sensitive to the electrical field and as such capture probability will increase with body size within the field collection there is also the potential for a sampler bias when sampling fish populations when sampling an individual collecting fish may focus inadvertently on catching the larger fish as these individuals are more visible within the water column hedger et al 2013 the focus on larger fish may result in some smaller individuals not being caught in earlier passes while the immobilization aspect may be unique to electrofishing it is important to understand that biases can arise from the sampling equipment used in other sampling contexts and that sampling crews can unknowingly be a source for sampling bias the presence of a size bias in electrofishing sampling can have considerable consequences on the subsequent use of the data the size bias may result in unreliable estimates of abundance and biomass from any given sample if the size distribution of the target population differs from the one used to estimate capture probability this is likely to be the case given that size distributions of stream fish can vary with local conditions and temporal fluctuations benejam et al 2016 ilha et al 2018 mcgarvey and kirk 2018 sutton and jones 2020 in addition without correcting for differences in capture probability estimates of size distributions and summary statistics such as mean length and or mass may not be representative of the true population this is an issue particularly when a small fraction of the population is captured which is common in single pass samples as shown in this study multipass removal samples often capture the majority of the population meaning that these summary measures will be more representative of the true population a size correction can be applied to improve the interpretation of data like that from single pass samples that would be otherwise unreliable in this study we use a bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that can account for potential biases in removal samplings and improve our ability to estimate fish density and abundance of body size critical to estimate overall biomass while past studies have used a bayesian approach to address biases in removal samples mäntyniemi et al 2005 ruiz and laplanche 2010 none have validated the model using true population estimates or incorporated key site covariates that can explain additional capture probability variability we use stream fish communities as a model system to demonstrate our approach in correcting for a size bias in capture probability we validate that the removal method can be used to accurately estimate abundance and demonstrate that capture probability is size dependent using a fish salvage data set from the tar river alberta that includes true abundances we then used a multi pass data set from ontario to investigate whether site covariates can improve model performance using cross validation more specifically we expected that 1 capture probability is positively related to body size and 2 site width and conductivity have opposing effects on capture probability we considered site width and conductivity as predictors as they have been shown to affect capture probability the first negatively and the second positively hense et al 2010 millar et al 2016 pottier et al 2020 we also tested for potential interactions between these site covariates and body size and compared how abundance estimates differ between the bayesian hierarchical model and a commonly used removal model carle and strub 1978 methods data the data from the tar river alberta 57 356262 n 111 752231 w were collected in 2007 as part of a fish salvage project the goal of this collection project was to remove all fish within the watercourse for relocation prior to a major development the river was partitioned into reaches isolated from each other using fyke nets and sampled using a multi pass backpack electrofishing approach the sampling reaches ranged from 170 m to 600 m in length and were relatively consistent in width with a mean width of 8 04 m sampling reaches were isolated from one another through the use of fyke nets to increase capture efficiency each reach was sampled until a specified depletion criterion was met with a minimum effort of three passes sampling of a reach was considered complete when 1 the combined total catch for all sport fish species in the first three passes was less than or equal to 10 individuals 2 less than 10 suckers catostomidae were caught per pass on two consecutive passes 3 when an 80 reduction in catch on the final pass relative to the catch from the first or second pass when the first two criteria do not apply and 4 if arctic grayling thymallus arcticus were encountered sampling was completed when one or zero arctic grayling individuals were captured in the final pass only reaches with total catches more than 10 fish n 78 were included in the final data set for analysis the average number of passes across reaches was 3 30 and 24 3 of the reaches had more than three sampling passes in reaches with more than three passes n 19 90 of the total catch on average was captured in the first three passes indicating that three pass catches are representative of the entire catch this data set was included as the total catch from all passes provides a close estimate of the true abundance allowing us to validate our model reliably the second set of data was obtained from three pass backpack electrofishing samples from 56 stream reaches in southern ontario canada 2016 2018 fig 1 the collection of the field data followed the multiple pass electrofishing procedures outlined by the standardized ontario stream assessment protocol stanfield 2017 in general the sampling effort across the dataset followed the optimal electrofishing effort intensity guideline of 5 s m2 stanfield et al 2013 and generally remained constant across passes however the sampling effort in 2016 surveys decreased during subsequent passes as mean effort for the passes was 8 36 pass 1 7 41 pass 2 and 7 16 s m2 pass 3 although these small differences may slightly affect capture probability estimation we assume they are negligible for the purpose of this paper whose focus is on variability among individual fish each site included fish catch data from three consecutive passes on a closed population each study site was isolated from the remainder of the stream by the use of block nets so that fish were unable to enter leave the study site site width m and water conductivity µs cm were measured at each site sampling passes were conducted from the downstream block net upwards until the upstream block net was reached fish caught in each pass were measured mm and weighed g and then released downstream of the sampling site to ensure that they were not included in any other subsequent catches individual fish measurements were used to partition fish into size classes which were based on fish length and the size classes were represented by their respective log2 scale midpoints 4 6 5 and 8 log2 mm for the tar river dataset and 5 6 5 and 8 log2 mm for the ontario dataset different combinations of the number of size classes and size class widths were considered however the results were comparable across these variations figure s1 and the main conclusions regarding the effect of body size and covariates were unaffected we present the models using three size classes to ensure that each size class had sufficient sample sizes to estimate capture probability and abundance a logarithmic scale was used to partition fish into size classes as the electric power required to immobilize a fish generally follows a power function of size dolan and miranda 2003 the geometric mean mass grams for each size class was used to estimate biomass per class while capture probability may vary across fish species fish were not partitioned into species to ensure sufficient sample size for analysis model to estimate abundance and capture probability we used a bayesian hierarchical framework rather than a maximum likelihood method that has been the basis for some of the more commonly used models carle and strub 1978 the main advantage of this bayesian approach is its flexibility in specifying relationships between variables which include observed variables such as the number of fish caught unobserved latent variables such as abundance and capture probability at each site and size class and model parameters defining their distributions the hierarchical structure allows the estimation of latent variables for all size classes and sites together so the data from one group can help inform the estimation for others rivot et al 2008 ruiz and laplanche 2010 this is particularly useful for data poor or unusual situations such as in samples with greater consecutive catches in later passes for which having independent parameter estimation using traditional methods would be unfeasible or unreliable the model is based on catch data of consecutive passes from a closed assemblage fig 2 the catch c i j k of size class i at site j from electrofishing pass k is dependent on the abundance just prior the pass n i j k and the probability of capture q i j which is assumed to be constant between passes this assumption is made to simplify the model and ensure that the model is not overparameterized the fish catch in the first pass can be thus assumed to follow a binomial distribution as there are n i j 1 number of independent trials with two possible outcomes caught or not caught 1 c i j 1 b i n o m i a l n i j 1 q i j catches in subsequent passes are based on the initial abundance and the number of individuals removed in the previous passes after every pass the number of individuals removed from the assemblage is subtracted from the initial abundance to obtain the abundance for the subsequent pass i e n i j 2 n i j 1 c i j 1 n i j 3 n i j 2 c i j 2 the initial abundance n i j 1 was assumed to follow a log normal distribution n i j 1 n μ n σ n rounded to the nearest integer where μ n and σ n represent respectively the mean abundance and the degree of variation between size classes and sites assumed to be independent abundance can then be used to estimate biomass in the size class and site using the geometric mean mass w b i j 1 n i j 1 w i j the key aspect of this model is that capture probability q for each site size class combination is a logistic function of body size represented by the midpoint of the size class l i along with other potential site covariates that can influence q the complete model is 2 l o g i t q i j β 0 δ j β s i z e l i v 1 v x v j β v β v v l i where β 0 is the fixed intercept δ j represents the random site effect β s i z e is the coefficient for body size effects β v is the coefficient for the main effect of covariate x v β v v is the coefficient for the interaction between size and covariate x v and v is the total number of covariates the random site effect is incorporated as an intercept term and is assumed to follow a normal distribution δ n 0 σ q where σ q represents the degree of among site variability in capture probability for our data analysis we used two covariates i site width and ii conductivity these two variables are expected to have more direct effects due to their influence on sampling effectiveness e g ability to perceive and reach immobilized fish and electrofishing power we evaluated their correlation r2 0 014 to ensure there was no problem with collinearity in the model we used uninformative priors for the hyperparameters the normal distributions were re parameterized using a precision parameter τ 1 σ 2 the priors for β parameters and μ n were uninformative normal distributions with mean zero and low precision τ 10 4 the prior distribution for τ n was uniform within broad intervals but confined within realistic limits 0 0 1 the prior distribution for τ q precision of random site effect on q was a uniform distribution within realistic limits 0 5 the posterior distributions for the model parameters were obtained using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler three sampling chains were run with each having a length of 500 000 values a thinning rate of 20 to reduce sample autocorrelation and a burn in of 50 000 values to reduce the chance that the initial conditions influenced the posterior distributions the convergence of the sampling chains was assessed using the gelman rubin statistic brooks and gelman 1998 and visually using trace plots the mcmc sampler was implemented through r r core team 2018 and jags using the package rjags plummer 2019 and r2jags su and yajima 2015 model analysis models were fit to each dataset separately as the purpose for data analysis i e goals of the model development differed between the two datasets the tar river dataset was used to test for the presence of a size bias in capture probability whereas the ontario dataset was used to develop a predictive model for capture probability for the tar river data set population size was estimated using data from the first three passes as the majority of sites only have three passes of data and most multipass datasets only include three passes body size and the random site effect were included as predictors for capture probability to determine whether capture probability was size dependent we evaluated the certainty of the predictor effects on capture probability using the 95 credible intervals we compared this model to a model that only included the random site effect intercept only model using root mean square error rmse values to evaluate whether the inclusion of the size predictor improved model using linear regression we examined the relationship between model abundance estimates calculated using the first three passes and total catch across all passes a close indicator of actual abundance at both site class and site levels we also considered whether the observed total catch was included in the 95 credible interval of the model estimate to evaluate model performance biomass estimates were also compared the three pass southern ontario data set was used to develop a predictive model and investigate whether site covariates can significantly improve capture probability and abundance estimates to identify the best predictive model and variation among data subsets we used 10 fold cross validation to quantify model predictive performance the rmse values were calculated from the difference between observed pass catches from the test data randomly selected 10 of sites and predicted pass catches from the training data 90 remaining sites and summed across all passes the procedure was repeated for each fold and the mean value was used to compare the models to one another for the full model we included all predictors size site width and conductivity along with all possible two way interactions with body size interactions that did not include size were not considered as the focus of this study is the size bias correction in removal models the other candidate models were reduced models that included different combinations of the predictor variables as well as interactions between size and the covariates we also considered a model that only includes the random site effect to determine specifically whether the size parameter improves the model fit we compared model performance for estimating abundance between our bayesian hierarchical removal model and a maximum likelihood approach carle and strub 1978 using major axis regression major axis regression was used to compare the two modeling approaches as there is no clear dependent variable and it considers variability in both variables biomass estimates were also compared between the two removal models a strong correlation between the two abundance estimates was expected as both models used the same catch data nevertheless we expected the comparison to provide insight into how accounting for a size bias in capture probability influence abundance estimates additionally we compared the abundance and biomass estimates between the best fitted and the intercept only bayesian hierarchical model using major axis regression to provide insight into how incorporating length into the capture probability function improves model estimates with the ontario dataset the applicability of the bayesian hierarchical model to single pass data was evaluated using simulated single pass data based on the bayesian estimates from the ontario dataset the simulated dataset consisted of first pass catch values generated by the best model selected from the cross validation from the simulated catches we calculated abundance using capture probabilities estimated from 1 our bayesian hierarchical model bhm and 2 carle and strub 1993 model csm to determine whether our model provides less biased abundance estimates in the context of single pass data relative to alternative approaches for the bayesian model capture probabilities were based on the mean estimated size dependent function for the carle strub method the capture probability was the mean estimate across all sites the predicted first pass abundance estimates from the two approaches were then compared to the abundances estimated from the bayesian hierarchical model fitted to the full three pass data and used here as surrogates for true abundances results tar river dataset the mean total catch for the tar river sites was 44 with a range of 10 to 255 site level abundance estimates from the bayesian hierarchical removal model had a range of 10 1 to 262 6 with a mean value of 33 1 mean site biomass was 1630 2 g with a range of 181 7 g to 11 523 7 g size was an important predictor of capture probability with a mean coefficient value β s i z e of 0 0044 and a 95 credible interval of 0 0033 0 0055 capture probability increased with size across all reaches fig 3 the size based model had an rmse value of 5 61 whereas the intercept only model had a higher value of 6 14 indicating the size based model outperformed the intercept only model these results demonstrate that our model can correct for a size bias in capture probability and improve abundance estimates total catch and model abundance estimates were significantly correlated at both the size class and site level for the tar river dataset as r2 ranged from 0 79 to 0 98 fig 4 all slope coefficients did not significantly differ from 1 and only the intercept for size class 6 5 was significantly different from the expected value of 0 t 2 368 p 0 020 these relationships indicate that our model accurately estimates abundance at the site level and for two of the three size classes at the site level 83 3 of the abundance 95 credible intervals included total catch whereas those of the size class site combinations included 71 7 of the total catches of the 13 sites that did not include the total catch in the 95 credible interval the lower limit of the credible interval was greater than the total catch in all but one of the sites 92 3 ontario dataset for the ontario dataset the mean total catch at the site level was 245 2 with a range of 27 to 794 site level abundance estimates had a mean value of 295 5 and ranged between 89 2 and 1414 7 while mean site biomass was 1500 0 g range 450 9 5667 3 g for the site covariates for the ontario sites site width ranged between 1 85 m and 9 3 m while conductivity had a range of 23µs cm to 2093µs cm the model with the best fit for these stream fish assemblages based on the cross validation rmse values was the full model with all two way interactions table 1 the full model had an rmse value 26 90 whereas the intercept only model had an rmse value of 28 56 the total catch rmse values were greater than 28 for all of the other model variations indicating poorer predictive performance the inclusion of both site covariates improved the predictive performance of the model while their effects on capture probability were size dependent in all of the models the 95 credible interval for size did not overlap 0 indicating that there is a high certainty that the size parameter affects capture probability given the ontario multi pass dataset there is a 95 probability that the size and the size site width interaction terms were non zero in the best fit model table 2 fig 5 despite the 95 credible intervals for site width conductivity and size conductivity interaction overlapping with 0 these variables still improved the model fit to the pass catch data in general body size was positively related with capture probability however differences in capture probability among size classes tended to be greater at narrower streams and smaller or even nonexistent on wider streams fig 5 conversely site width had the strongest and negative association with capture probability for larger fish whereas for smaller fish capture probability was relatively constant across site width values fig 5 across all of the validation folds of data the observed and predicted catches of the test data were strongly correlated to one another figure s2 this trend was evident for all three different size classes considered and supported by the rmse values the two smaller size classes had similar rmse values whereas the larger size class 8 log2 length midpoint had a smaller rmse value which can likely be attributed to the smaller sample and abundance sizes for this size class in general the prediction error tended to decrease with pass for all of the three size classes for the training data set the 95 credible interval coverage for the predicted catch was 75 0 for the first pass figure s3 73 2 for the second pass figure s4 and 98 2 for the third pass figure s5 although the difference between the observed and predicted catches tended to increase with catch size there was no systematic deviation from the 1 1 that would otherwise indicate a lack of fit or violation of assumptions there was a strong significant correlation between the abundance estimates from the bayesian hierarchical model bhm size corrected and from the more traditional removal model csm size uncorrected r2 1 figure s6a for the ontario dataset the csm typically estimated lower abundance when compared to that of the bhm although strongly correlated to one another r2 0 98 figure s6b there was a notable difference between the biomass estimates from the two models the slope and intercept were significantly different from 1 to 0 respectively meaning that the csm estimated smaller biomass of assemblages than bhm at lower biomass levels and estimated higher biomass for sites with more biomass relative to the bhm estimates a notable advantage of the bhm over the csm is that the bhm estimates realistic credible intervals as the total catch should represent the lower possible abundance the lower credible interval for the bhm was greater than all total catches whereas the lower confidence limit for the csm was less than the total catch for 33 9 of the sites when comparing the size corrected and intercept only bhm abundance and biomass estimates were strongly correlated to one another r2 0 99 for abundance and r2 0 98 for biomass figure s6 major axis regression indicated that when size is not included in the model then the abundance will be slightly underestimated and biomass will be considerably overestimated particularly for sites with higher biomass levels for the simulated single pass data the bhm provided more unbiased estimates of abundance relative to the csm fig 6 both approaches provided strongly correlated estimates to the true abundance bhm r2 0 927 csm r2 0 916 and neither deviated significantly from it the csm underestimated abundance by 10 on average whereas the bhm differed in average by a smaller amount 0 4 the simulation indicates that the size dependent capture probability function from the bayesian hierarchical model can provide an unbiased estimate of abundance when only single pass data are available the alternative csm approach is suitable for multi pass data however it can lead to biased abundance estimates if applied to single pass data discussion by correcting for potential sampling biases removal sampling can provide a reliable means of accurately estimating abundance and biomass of target species and ecological communities in many different ecological problems in this study we provide a bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that can overcome a bias due to size dependent probability of capture that is associated with electrofishing sampling we demonstrate the utility of this framework using stream fish assemblages as a study system we show that body size is a key determinant of capture probability in two independent stream fish data sets and that other site specific covariates such as stream width can also be important factors in predicting capture probability and consequently estimating abundance furthermore it is also important to consider potential interactions between size and site covariates as these size based effects on capture probability can be dependent on the environment by using a fish salvage data set we validated the removal method and concluded that our model provides accurate abundance estimates relative to the true abundance abundance and biomass estimates from our model and a more common linear regression based removal model carle and strub 1978 were strongly correlated although the carle strub model can have a tendency to overestimate biomass when biomass is high previous studies jones and stockwell 1995 hense et al 2010 millar et al 2016 have attempted to address size bias by focusing on age or life stage classes such as juveniles versus adults and not body size explicitly regardless size class partitioning can alleviate a bias as the capture probability among individuals would generally be close to constant within each size class using more than two size classes allows us to characterize the size parameter of the capture probability functions as a more continuous function however there is a trade off between the number of size classes and the sample size within each size class when using this framework because minimum sample sizes are required to accurately observe depletion trends across passes capture probability is undoubtedly influenced by environmental and biotic factors other than body size e g hense et al 2010 peterson et al 2004 and therefore it is important to develop simple models that include additional covariates in a manner that keeps the model generally applicable in a wide variety of systems and situations while species specific factors such as behavior and physiology can influence capture probability millar et al 2016 we focused on how environmental factors influence capture probability site covariates such as water velocity price and peterson 2010 channel cross sectional area price and peterson 2010 wood density peterson et al 2004 and site width hedger et al 2013 can influence capture probability although these data are not always available or have insufficient sample size to robustly evaluate their effects millar et al 2016 we identified site width a measure of sampling area as a key component of the model as it has been shown to be important in previous studies e g hense et al 2010 pottier et al 2020 and is generally available in stream survey protocols while the main effect of site width was uncertain and included zero as a plausible possibility the interaction term of size site width indicated with high certainty that capture probability decreases with increasing site width at least for the larger size classes considered as larger fish are more mobile relative to smaller fish radinger and wolter 2014 they can effectively use the additional space in larger streams to successfully evade capture from the sampling crew which may partially compensate for their higher sensitivity to the electric field and lower their capture efficiency to a level similar to that of smaller fish increased sampling effort may not mitigate this decrease in capture probability because electrofishing units have a maximum immobilization range schwartz and herricks 2004 and fish can still avoid the electrical field within the sampling area as a result sampling crews should then employ multiple electrofishing units in larger streams to ensure that larger fish cannot evade capture as the maximum immobilization range spans across the stream width an alternative option to mitigating this decrease in capture probability via increased sampling area is to use other means for estimating abundance and biomass such as mark recapture methods especially when dealing with larger populations rosenberger and dunham 2005 while the size dependent effect of site width on capture probability was clear conductivity only had a small and very uncertain effect on capture probability even though it was selected as a covariate in the best model this result supports the findings of some studies that capture probability increases with conductivity bayley and austen 2002 schoenebeck et al 2015 although other studies observed no effect hense et al 2010 pottier et al 2020 these different conclusions about the effect of conductivity on capture probability could likely be attributed to the fact that the settings of an electrofishing unit can be adjusted based on the site conditions alternatively the range and variation of conductivity may differ across studies which could also lead to these contrasting conclusions our approach to modeling provides insight into how size and the site covariates influence capture probability however it may not be the most appropriate for direct null hypothesis testing of predictor effects which may require more controlled experimental conditions although applied to stream fishes as an example our modeling framework can be used for various removal sampling methods applied in an ecological context as it provides researchers with an effective means of estimating abundance especially when dealing with smaller assemblages the model framework can be applied to investigate how particular characteristics such as body size influence the capture probability of individuals rather than partitioning individuals based on size individuals could be partitioned based on a different characteristic attribute e g species to ensure that the assumption of equal capture probability across individuals within a group is not violated the ecological context will determine which site covariates should be considered as they may influence the capture probability for instance site width may be relevant to stream sampling although it could still be useful when sampling transects for other taxa or other relative measures of sampling area can be incorporated into the framework in wadeable streams a site covariate such as water velocity may influence capture probability price and peterson 2010 whereas water depth is an important consideration when boat electrofishing bayley and austen 2002 when using removal methods to assess bird density with roadside point counts distance from the observer is an important site covariate that can influence the detection probability similar to capture probability of an individual murray et al 2011 these differences between sampling techniques highlight the need to understand the study system and identify potential sources of sampling biases this modeling framework can be applied to different sampling methods as well as investigate and correct for biases associated with different sampling equipment rather than assuming constant capture probability across all individuals the hierarchical size class approach used in this model allows capture probability to vary across subsets of the total assemblage the size dependence of capture probability has also been an issue when using mark recapture methods to assess populations in a variety of ecological contexts borgstrom and skaala 1993 anderson 1995 alternatively a sampling bias is dependent on the equipment used to sample meaning that the size bias associated with backpack electrofishing may differ from that of other sampling equipment e g seining for instance there was a negative relationship between capture probability and body size observed when using bottom trawl sampling to assess black crappie pomoxis nigromaculatus in florida usa binion et al 2009 there has been a considerable amount of research that has focused on the size selectivity of gill netting as the efficiency of capture is strongly dependent on the size of the net mesh and the fish size doll et al 2014 shoup and ryswyk 2016 pitfall trapping used in arthropod surveys is also subject to a size bias in which capture probability increases with body size hancock and legg 2012 these biases associated with size highlight the need to correct for potential sampling biases in any ecological data set the model fitted to the ontario data can be used to estimate capture probability and abundance estimates for multi pass samples but it can also be applied to single pass samples as well a key advantage of this form of model is that it directly estimates capture probability from size class and site covariates meaning that one can use the parameterized capture probability function to estimate the abundance for the single pass samples the quality of multi pass samples is greater than that of single pass samples as more reliable estimates are obtained with multiple sampling passes jones and stockwell 1995 millar et al 2016 consequently multi pass sampling is preferred from a reliability standpoint although field crews may elect to conduct single pass sampling in order to increase the number of independent observations locations collected and the spatial coverage of the data hedger et al 2013 hanks et al 2018 single pass sampling is a common technique when only presence absence data are required or when considering other characteristics of communities such as species richness diversity reid et al 2008 peoples and frimpong 2011 rather than completely disregarding abundance data from single pass sampling as being poor and unreliable information we can use this model to obtain relative abundance estimates by correcting single pass catches with the capture probability function while this approach can provide relative abundance estimates obtaining absolute estimates remains a challenge as other differences between the sampling methodologies can influence capture probability for example single pass methods often do not involve block nets while they are commonplace in multi pass methods these applications highlight the flexibility of the bayesian hierarchical model that can improve the quality of data analysis and interpretation for other key questions in ecology our size based removal model has many advantages over earlier removal models commonly used in the field of ecology the hierarchical structure allows the model to simultaneously estimate abundance at the size class and site level while incorporating information from other sites to improving estimates for any given site rivot et al 2008 this structure improves our ability to estimate abundance for data limited sites to overcome common removal sampling issues such as poor depletion e g larger consecutive catches or the absence of individuals in sampling passes another advantage of the bayesian removal model is that it estimates realistic abundance credible intervals as the lower limit will be the total catch whereas the confidence intervals of the maximum likelihood model is typically lower than the actual catch body size can be incorporated into the capture probability function as a continuous variable rather than categorical providing a function to estimate capture probability for size classes that differ from the ones we used in this study site covariates and their potential interactions with size can be used in the model to improve capture probability estimates which became clear through the model selection process

24466,correcting for sampling biases and the misleading results they generate is an important but sometimes overlooked aspect of ecological research removal sampling a common method used across survey protocols to estimate abundance usually assumes constant capture probability across all individuals in a population however differences in body size which are widespread in fish assemblages are likely to violate this assumption to correct for potential biases in removal sampling we used hierarchical bayesian models that estimate capture probability as a function of body size and common covariates associated with electrofishing of fish in streams using a fish out data set n 78 from alberta canada that includes true abundances we demonstrate that capture probability increased with body size and the model accurately estimated abundance for the majority of the reaches 83 furthermore model performance improved when site width and conductivity and their interactions with body size were included as covariates in a stream fish dataset from ontario n 56 the inclusion of site covariates in the model indicates that these size based effects on capture probability can be dependent on the environment the consequence of ignoring size dependent catch probability is to underestimate biomass when the actual biomass is low and to overestimate biomass when it is high this removal model allows us to estimate capture probability for multiple pass samples and consequently improves our ability to obtain more reliable abundance estimates this modeling framework is presented using electrofishing yet it is flexible enough to be used with a variety of other sampling techniques keywords abundance capture probability populations removal sampling size bias streams introduction sampling bias is a common issue when collecting and analyzing ecological data as many uncontrollable confounding factors can affect the effectiveness of study design stuber et al 2013 the problem for ecologists and resource managers is that these biases can misrepresent relationships within populations and communities may lead to misinterpretations of results and hypotheses and ultimately impact scientific or management decisions all empirical studies and their associated sampling techniques have potential biases with unintended consequences prior et al 2001 and many of these biases may not be completely avoidable šimundić 2013 as such it is important to identify and address these biases where possible to improve the quality of field data and subsequent ecological analyses removal sampling a commonly used method in ecology is subject to potential sampling biases while many applications of this method have focused on freshwater systems e g jones and stockwell 1995 sutton and jones 2020 it has been used in many different contexts to estimate the density of populations such as ringed seals phoca hispida using seal holes hammill and smith 1990 adult ground beetles with pitfall traps clark et al 1995 northern bobwhites colinus virginianus with roadside point counts murray et al 2011 and salamanders in a streamside community petranka and murray 2001 the removal method involves removing individuals from a closed population across successive samplings passes so that the rate of depletion of catches among passes allows for the inference of the initial population density and the capture probability to be free of bias this method requires that three main assumptions are valid 1 the population is closed with no immigration emigration or mortality in the sampling site 2 there is equal effort among successive sampling events and 3 capture probability is constant across individuals and passes e g carle and strub 1978 which is the focus of our study the first two assumptions can be accounted for mainly through the design of robust field protocols that involve isolating sites and standardizing effort respectively however the third assumption is more difficult to account for in a field setting if capture probability is inherently variable among the target organisms due to some behavioral or life history trait e g body size anderson 1995 under this scenario the field data will likely require analytical corrections following the survey here we demonstrate a possible correction using a removal protocol for an electrofishing survey of fish assemblages in streams fish populations including all different species in the assemblage in streams and rivers 10 m width provide a model system for the removal method using electrofishing as these populations can be easily closed using block nets and effort standardized by ensuring the same magnitude of electrical current is used over the same time period and the same stream area across passes however these systems likely violate the third assumption as capture probability has been shown to be positively correlated with body size korman et al 2009 millar et al 2016 while many different studies note potential biases associated with body size in electrofishing samples e g borgstrom and skaala 1993 anderson 1995 dauwalter and fisher 2007 few have attempted to address this issue korman et al 2009 hense et al 2010 millar et al 2016 among other factors the efficiency and probability of capturing fish using an electrofishing unit is dependent on the ability of the sampler and the electrofishing unit to immobilize the fish and then the ability to see and net the immobilized fish understanding how an electrofishing unit immobilizes fish is essential to understanding a source of size related bias and allow for its correction previous studies have investigated the electrofishing unit settings required to immobilize fish with an electrical field and have concluded that lower power and voltage gradients are needed to immobilize larger fish relative to smaller ones dolan and miranda 2003 habera et al 2010 for example under a common power setting the capture efficiency of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss in south appalachian streams over 100 mm in length was 0 88 but only 0 65 for trout under 100 mm habera et al 2010 this presents a challenge when sampling a fish population because only one power setting is typically used yet it needs to be high enough that it immobilizes smaller fish while low enough that there is minimal physical harm to larger fish dolan and miranda 2004 henry et al 2004 striking this balance will typically allow smaller fish to be less sensitive to the electrical field and as such capture probability will increase with body size within the field collection there is also the potential for a sampler bias when sampling fish populations when sampling an individual collecting fish may focus inadvertently on catching the larger fish as these individuals are more visible within the water column hedger et al 2013 the focus on larger fish may result in some smaller individuals not being caught in earlier passes while the immobilization aspect may be unique to electrofishing it is important to understand that biases can arise from the sampling equipment used in other sampling contexts and that sampling crews can unknowingly be a source for sampling bias the presence of a size bias in electrofishing sampling can have considerable consequences on the subsequent use of the data the size bias may result in unreliable estimates of abundance and biomass from any given sample if the size distribution of the target population differs from the one used to estimate capture probability this is likely to be the case given that size distributions of stream fish can vary with local conditions and temporal fluctuations benejam et al 2016 ilha et al 2018 mcgarvey and kirk 2018 sutton and jones 2020 in addition without correcting for differences in capture probability estimates of size distributions and summary statistics such as mean length and or mass may not be representative of the true population this is an issue particularly when a small fraction of the population is captured which is common in single pass samples as shown in this study multipass removal samples often capture the majority of the population meaning that these summary measures will be more representative of the true population a size correction can be applied to improve the interpretation of data like that from single pass samples that would be otherwise unreliable in this study we use a bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that can account for potential biases in removal samplings and improve our ability to estimate fish density and abundance of body size critical to estimate overall biomass while past studies have used a bayesian approach to address biases in removal samples mäntyniemi et al 2005 ruiz and laplanche 2010 none have validated the model using true population estimates or incorporated key site covariates that can explain additional capture probability variability we use stream fish communities as a model system to demonstrate our approach in correcting for a size bias in capture probability we validate that the removal method can be used to accurately estimate abundance and demonstrate that capture probability is size dependent using a fish salvage data set from the tar river alberta that includes true abundances we then used a multi pass data set from ontario to investigate whether site covariates can improve model performance using cross validation more specifically we expected that 1 capture probability is positively related to body size and 2 site width and conductivity have opposing effects on capture probability we considered site width and conductivity as predictors as they have been shown to affect capture probability the first negatively and the second positively hense et al 2010 millar et al 2016 pottier et al 2020 we also tested for potential interactions between these site covariates and body size and compared how abundance estimates differ between the bayesian hierarchical model and a commonly used removal model carle and strub 1978 methods data the data from the tar river alberta 57 356262 n 111 752231 w were collected in 2007 as part of a fish salvage project the goal of this collection project was to remove all fish within the watercourse for relocation prior to a major development the river was partitioned into reaches isolated from each other using fyke nets and sampled using a multi pass backpack electrofishing approach the sampling reaches ranged from 170 m to 600 m in length and were relatively consistent in width with a mean width of 8 04 m sampling reaches were isolated from one another through the use of fyke nets to increase capture efficiency each reach was sampled until a specified depletion criterion was met with a minimum effort of three passes sampling of a reach was considered complete when 1 the combined total catch for all sport fish species in the first three passes was less than or equal to 10 individuals 2 less than 10 suckers catostomidae were caught per pass on two consecutive passes 3 when an 80 reduction in catch on the final pass relative to the catch from the first or second pass when the first two criteria do not apply and 4 if arctic grayling thymallus arcticus were encountered sampling was completed when one or zero arctic grayling individuals were captured in the final pass only reaches with total catches more than 10 fish n 78 were included in the final data set for analysis the average number of passes across reaches was 3 30 and 24 3 of the reaches had more than three sampling passes in reaches with more than three passes n 19 90 of the total catch on average was captured in the first three passes indicating that three pass catches are representative of the entire catch this data set was included as the total catch from all passes provides a close estimate of the true abundance allowing us to validate our model reliably the second set of data was obtained from three pass backpack electrofishing samples from 56 stream reaches in southern ontario canada 2016 2018 fig 1 the collection of the field data followed the multiple pass electrofishing procedures outlined by the standardized ontario stream assessment protocol stanfield 2017 in general the sampling effort across the dataset followed the optimal electrofishing effort intensity guideline of 5 s m2 stanfield et al 2013 and generally remained constant across passes however the sampling effort in 2016 surveys decreased during subsequent passes as mean effort for the passes was 8 36 pass 1 7 41 pass 2 and 7 16 s m2 pass 3 although these small differences may slightly affect capture probability estimation we assume they are negligible for the purpose of this paper whose focus is on variability among individual fish each site included fish catch data from three consecutive passes on a closed population each study site was isolated from the remainder of the stream by the use of block nets so that fish were unable to enter leave the study site site width m and water conductivity µs cm were measured at each site sampling passes were conducted from the downstream block net upwards until the upstream block net was reached fish caught in each pass were measured mm and weighed g and then released downstream of the sampling site to ensure that they were not included in any other subsequent catches individual fish measurements were used to partition fish into size classes which were based on fish length and the size classes were represented by their respective log2 scale midpoints 4 6 5 and 8 log2 mm for the tar river dataset and 5 6 5 and 8 log2 mm for the ontario dataset different combinations of the number of size classes and size class widths were considered however the results were comparable across these variations figure s1 and the main conclusions regarding the effect of body size and covariates were unaffected we present the models using three size classes to ensure that each size class had sufficient sample sizes to estimate capture probability and abundance a logarithmic scale was used to partition fish into size classes as the electric power required to immobilize a fish generally follows a power function of size dolan and miranda 2003 the geometric mean mass grams for each size class was used to estimate biomass per class while capture probability may vary across fish species fish were not partitioned into species to ensure sufficient sample size for analysis model to estimate abundance and capture probability we used a bayesian hierarchical framework rather than a maximum likelihood method that has been the basis for some of the more commonly used models carle and strub 1978 the main advantage of this bayesian approach is its flexibility in specifying relationships between variables which include observed variables such as the number of fish caught unobserved latent variables such as abundance and capture probability at each site and size class and model parameters defining their distributions the hierarchical structure allows the estimation of latent variables for all size classes and sites together so the data from one group can help inform the estimation for others rivot et al 2008 ruiz and laplanche 2010 this is particularly useful for data poor or unusual situations such as in samples with greater consecutive catches in later passes for which having independent parameter estimation using traditional methods would be unfeasible or unreliable the model is based on catch data of consecutive passes from a closed assemblage fig 2 the catch c i j k of size class i at site j from electrofishing pass k is dependent on the abundance just prior the pass n i j k and the probability of capture q i j which is assumed to be constant between passes this assumption is made to simplify the model and ensure that the model is not overparameterized the fish catch in the first pass can be thus assumed to follow a binomial distribution as there are n i j 1 number of independent trials with two possible outcomes caught or not caught 1 c i j 1 b i n o m i a l n i j 1 q i j catches in subsequent passes are based on the initial abundance and the number of individuals removed in the previous passes after every pass the number of individuals removed from the assemblage is subtracted from the initial abundance to obtain the abundance for the subsequent pass i e n i j 2 n i j 1 c i j 1 n i j 3 n i j 2 c i j 2 the initial abundance n i j 1 was assumed to follow a log normal distribution n i j 1 n μ n σ n rounded to the nearest integer where μ n and σ n represent respectively the mean abundance and the degree of variation between size classes and sites assumed to be independent abundance can then be used to estimate biomass in the size class and site using the geometric mean mass w b i j 1 n i j 1 w i j the key aspect of this model is that capture probability q for each site size class combination is a logistic function of body size represented by the midpoint of the size class l i along with other potential site covariates that can influence q the complete model is 2 l o g i t q i j β 0 δ j β s i z e l i v 1 v x v j β v β v v l i where β 0 is the fixed intercept δ j represents the random site effect β s i z e is the coefficient for body size effects β v is the coefficient for the main effect of covariate x v β v v is the coefficient for the interaction between size and covariate x v and v is the total number of covariates the random site effect is incorporated as an intercept term and is assumed to follow a normal distribution δ n 0 σ q where σ q represents the degree of among site variability in capture probability for our data analysis we used two covariates i site width and ii conductivity these two variables are expected to have more direct effects due to their influence on sampling effectiveness e g ability to perceive and reach immobilized fish and electrofishing power we evaluated their correlation r2 0 014 to ensure there was no problem with collinearity in the model we used uninformative priors for the hyperparameters the normal distributions were re parameterized using a precision parameter τ 1 σ 2 the priors for β parameters and μ n were uninformative normal distributions with mean zero and low precision τ 10 4 the prior distribution for τ n was uniform within broad intervals but confined within realistic limits 0 0 1 the prior distribution for τ q precision of random site effect on q was a uniform distribution within realistic limits 0 5 the posterior distributions for the model parameters were obtained using a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler three sampling chains were run with each having a length of 500 000 values a thinning rate of 20 to reduce sample autocorrelation and a burn in of 50 000 values to reduce the chance that the initial conditions influenced the posterior distributions the convergence of the sampling chains was assessed using the gelman rubin statistic brooks and gelman 1998 and visually using trace plots the mcmc sampler was implemented through r r core team 2018 and jags using the package rjags plummer 2019 and r2jags su and yajima 2015 model analysis models were fit to each dataset separately as the purpose for data analysis i e goals of the model development differed between the two datasets the tar river dataset was used to test for the presence of a size bias in capture probability whereas the ontario dataset was used to develop a predictive model for capture probability for the tar river data set population size was estimated using data from the first three passes as the majority of sites only have three passes of data and most multipass datasets only include three passes body size and the random site effect were included as predictors for capture probability to determine whether capture probability was size dependent we evaluated the certainty of the predictor effects on capture probability using the 95 credible intervals we compared this model to a model that only included the random site effect intercept only model using root mean square error rmse values to evaluate whether the inclusion of the size predictor improved model using linear regression we examined the relationship between model abundance estimates calculated using the first three passes and total catch across all passes a close indicator of actual abundance at both site class and site levels we also considered whether the observed total catch was included in the 95 credible interval of the model estimate to evaluate model performance biomass estimates were also compared the three pass southern ontario data set was used to develop a predictive model and investigate whether site covariates can significantly improve capture probability and abundance estimates to identify the best predictive model and variation among data subsets we used 10 fold cross validation to quantify model predictive performance the rmse values were calculated from the difference between observed pass catches from the test data randomly selected 10 of sites and predicted pass catches from the training data 90 remaining sites and summed across all passes the procedure was repeated for each fold and the mean value was used to compare the models to one another for the full model we included all predictors size site width and conductivity along with all possible two way interactions with body size interactions that did not include size were not considered as the focus of this study is the size bias correction in removal models the other candidate models were reduced models that included different combinations of the predictor variables as well as interactions between size and the covariates we also considered a model that only includes the random site effect to determine specifically whether the size parameter improves the model fit we compared model performance for estimating abundance between our bayesian hierarchical removal model and a maximum likelihood approach carle and strub 1978 using major axis regression major axis regression was used to compare the two modeling approaches as there is no clear dependent variable and it considers variability in both variables biomass estimates were also compared between the two removal models a strong correlation between the two abundance estimates was expected as both models used the same catch data nevertheless we expected the comparison to provide insight into how accounting for a size bias in capture probability influence abundance estimates additionally we compared the abundance and biomass estimates between the best fitted and the intercept only bayesian hierarchical model using major axis regression to provide insight into how incorporating length into the capture probability function improves model estimates with the ontario dataset the applicability of the bayesian hierarchical model to single pass data was evaluated using simulated single pass data based on the bayesian estimates from the ontario dataset the simulated dataset consisted of first pass catch values generated by the best model selected from the cross validation from the simulated catches we calculated abundance using capture probabilities estimated from 1 our bayesian hierarchical model bhm and 2 carle and strub 1993 model csm to determine whether our model provides less biased abundance estimates in the context of single pass data relative to alternative approaches for the bayesian model capture probabilities were based on the mean estimated size dependent function for the carle strub method the capture probability was the mean estimate across all sites the predicted first pass abundance estimates from the two approaches were then compared to the abundances estimated from the bayesian hierarchical model fitted to the full three pass data and used here as surrogates for true abundances results tar river dataset the mean total catch for the tar river sites was 44 with a range of 10 to 255 site level abundance estimates from the bayesian hierarchical removal model had a range of 10 1 to 262 6 with a mean value of 33 1 mean site biomass was 1630 2 g with a range of 181 7 g to 11 523 7 g size was an important predictor of capture probability with a mean coefficient value β s i z e of 0 0044 and a 95 credible interval of 0 0033 0 0055 capture probability increased with size across all reaches fig 3 the size based model had an rmse value of 5 61 whereas the intercept only model had a higher value of 6 14 indicating the size based model outperformed the intercept only model these results demonstrate that our model can correct for a size bias in capture probability and improve abundance estimates total catch and model abundance estimates were significantly correlated at both the size class and site level for the tar river dataset as r2 ranged from 0 79 to 0 98 fig 4 all slope coefficients did not significantly differ from 1 and only the intercept for size class 6 5 was significantly different from the expected value of 0 t 2 368 p 0 020 these relationships indicate that our model accurately estimates abundance at the site level and for two of the three size classes at the site level 83 3 of the abundance 95 credible intervals included total catch whereas those of the size class site combinations included 71 7 of the total catches of the 13 sites that did not include the total catch in the 95 credible interval the lower limit of the credible interval was greater than the total catch in all but one of the sites 92 3 ontario dataset for the ontario dataset the mean total catch at the site level was 245 2 with a range of 27 to 794 site level abundance estimates had a mean value of 295 5 and ranged between 89 2 and 1414 7 while mean site biomass was 1500 0 g range 450 9 5667 3 g for the site covariates for the ontario sites site width ranged between 1 85 m and 9 3 m while conductivity had a range of 23µs cm to 2093µs cm the model with the best fit for these stream fish assemblages based on the cross validation rmse values was the full model with all two way interactions table 1 the full model had an rmse value 26 90 whereas the intercept only model had an rmse value of 28 56 the total catch rmse values were greater than 28 for all of the other model variations indicating poorer predictive performance the inclusion of both site covariates improved the predictive performance of the model while their effects on capture probability were size dependent in all of the models the 95 credible interval for size did not overlap 0 indicating that there is a high certainty that the size parameter affects capture probability given the ontario multi pass dataset there is a 95 probability that the size and the size site width interaction terms were non zero in the best fit model table 2 fig 5 despite the 95 credible intervals for site width conductivity and size conductivity interaction overlapping with 0 these variables still improved the model fit to the pass catch data in general body size was positively related with capture probability however differences in capture probability among size classes tended to be greater at narrower streams and smaller or even nonexistent on wider streams fig 5 conversely site width had the strongest and negative association with capture probability for larger fish whereas for smaller fish capture probability was relatively constant across site width values fig 5 across all of the validation folds of data the observed and predicted catches of the test data were strongly correlated to one another figure s2 this trend was evident for all three different size classes considered and supported by the rmse values the two smaller size classes had similar rmse values whereas the larger size class 8 log2 length midpoint had a smaller rmse value which can likely be attributed to the smaller sample and abundance sizes for this size class in general the prediction error tended to decrease with pass for all of the three size classes for the training data set the 95 credible interval coverage for the predicted catch was 75 0 for the first pass figure s3 73 2 for the second pass figure s4 and 98 2 for the third pass figure s5 although the difference between the observed and predicted catches tended to increase with catch size there was no systematic deviation from the 1 1 that would otherwise indicate a lack of fit or violation of assumptions there was a strong significant correlation between the abundance estimates from the bayesian hierarchical model bhm size corrected and from the more traditional removal model csm size uncorrected r2 1 figure s6a for the ontario dataset the csm typically estimated lower abundance when compared to that of the bhm although strongly correlated to one another r2 0 98 figure s6b there was a notable difference between the biomass estimates from the two models the slope and intercept were significantly different from 1 to 0 respectively meaning that the csm estimated smaller biomass of assemblages than bhm at lower biomass levels and estimated higher biomass for sites with more biomass relative to the bhm estimates a notable advantage of the bhm over the csm is that the bhm estimates realistic credible intervals as the total catch should represent the lower possible abundance the lower credible interval for the bhm was greater than all total catches whereas the lower confidence limit for the csm was less than the total catch for 33 9 of the sites when comparing the size corrected and intercept only bhm abundance and biomass estimates were strongly correlated to one another r2 0 99 for abundance and r2 0 98 for biomass figure s6 major axis regression indicated that when size is not included in the model then the abundance will be slightly underestimated and biomass will be considerably overestimated particularly for sites with higher biomass levels for the simulated single pass data the bhm provided more unbiased estimates of abundance relative to the csm fig 6 both approaches provided strongly correlated estimates to the true abundance bhm r2 0 927 csm r2 0 916 and neither deviated significantly from it the csm underestimated abundance by 10 on average whereas the bhm differed in average by a smaller amount 0 4 the simulation indicates that the size dependent capture probability function from the bayesian hierarchical model can provide an unbiased estimate of abundance when only single pass data are available the alternative csm approach is suitable for multi pass data however it can lead to biased abundance estimates if applied to single pass data discussion by correcting for potential sampling biases removal sampling can provide a reliable means of accurately estimating abundance and biomass of target species and ecological communities in many different ecological problems in this study we provide a bayesian hierarchical modeling framework that can overcome a bias due to size dependent probability of capture that is associated with electrofishing sampling we demonstrate the utility of this framework using stream fish assemblages as a study system we show that body size is a key determinant of capture probability in two independent stream fish data sets and that other site specific covariates such as stream width can also be important factors in predicting capture probability and consequently estimating abundance furthermore it is also important to consider potential interactions between size and site covariates as these size based effects on capture probability can be dependent on the environment by using a fish salvage data set we validated the removal method and concluded that our model provides accurate abundance estimates relative to the true abundance abundance and biomass estimates from our model and a more common linear regression based removal model carle and strub 1978 were strongly correlated although the carle strub model can have a tendency to overestimate biomass when biomass is high previous studies jones and stockwell 1995 hense et al 2010 millar et al 2016 have attempted to address size bias by focusing on age or life stage classes such as juveniles versus adults and not body size explicitly regardless size class partitioning can alleviate a bias as the capture probability among individuals would generally be close to constant within each size class using more than two size classes allows us to characterize the size parameter of the capture probability functions as a more continuous function however there is a trade off between the number of size classes and the sample size within each size class when using this framework because minimum sample sizes are required to accurately observe depletion trends across passes capture probability is undoubtedly influenced by environmental and biotic factors other than body size e g hense et al 2010 peterson et al 2004 and therefore it is important to develop simple models that include additional covariates in a manner that keeps the model generally applicable in a wide variety of systems and situations while species specific factors such as behavior and physiology can influence capture probability millar et al 2016 we focused on how environmental factors influence capture probability site covariates such as water velocity price and peterson 2010 channel cross sectional area price and peterson 2010 wood density peterson et al 2004 and site width hedger et al 2013 can influence capture probability although these data are not always available or have insufficient sample size to robustly evaluate their effects millar et al 2016 we identified site width a measure of sampling area as a key component of the model as it has been shown to be important in previous studies e g hense et al 2010 pottier et al 2020 and is generally available in stream survey protocols while the main effect of site width was uncertain and included zero as a plausible possibility the interaction term of size site width indicated with high certainty that capture probability decreases with increasing site width at least for the larger size classes considered as larger fish are more mobile relative to smaller fish radinger and wolter 2014 they can effectively use the additional space in larger streams to successfully evade capture from the sampling crew which may partially compensate for their higher sensitivity to the electric field and lower their capture efficiency to a level similar to that of smaller fish increased sampling effort may not mitigate this decrease in capture probability because electrofishing units have a maximum immobilization range schwartz and herricks 2004 and fish can still avoid the electrical field within the sampling area as a result sampling crews should then employ multiple electrofishing units in larger streams to ensure that larger fish cannot evade capture as the maximum immobilization range spans across the stream width an alternative option to mitigating this decrease in capture probability via increased sampling area is to use other means for estimating abundance and biomass such as mark recapture methods especially when dealing with larger populations rosenberger and dunham 2005 while the size dependent effect of site width on capture probability was clear conductivity only had a small and very uncertain effect on capture probability even though it was selected as a covariate in the best model this result supports the findings of some studies that capture probability increases with conductivity bayley and austen 2002 schoenebeck et al 2015 although other studies observed no effect hense et al 2010 pottier et al 2020 these different conclusions about the effect of conductivity on capture probability could likely be attributed to the fact that the settings of an electrofishing unit can be adjusted based on the site conditions alternatively the range and variation of conductivity may differ across studies which could also lead to these contrasting conclusions our approach to modeling provides insight into how size and the site covariates influence capture probability however it may not be the most appropriate for direct null hypothesis testing of predictor effects which may require more controlled experimental conditions although applied to stream fishes as an example our modeling framework can be used for various removal sampling methods applied in an ecological context as it provides researchers with an effective means of estimating abundance especially when dealing with smaller assemblages the model framework can be applied to investigate how particular characteristics such as body size influence the capture probability of individuals rather than partitioning individuals based on size individuals could be partitioned based on a different characteristic attribute e g species to ensure that the assumption of equal capture probability across individuals within a group is not violated the ecological context will determine which site covariates should be considered as they may influence the capture probability for instance site width may be relevant to stream sampling although it could still be useful when sampling transects for other taxa or other relative measures of sampling area can be incorporated into the framework in wadeable streams a site covariate such as water velocity may influence capture probability price and peterson 2010 whereas water depth is an important consideration when boat electrofishing bayley and austen 2002 when using removal methods to assess bird density with roadside point counts distance from the observer is an important site covariate that can influence the detection probability similar to capture probability of an individual murray et al 2011 these differences between sampling techniques highlight the need to understand the study system and identify potential sources of sampling biases this modeling framework can be applied to different sampling methods as well as investigate and correct for biases associated with different sampling equipment rather than assuming constant capture probability across all individuals the hierarchical size class approach used in this model allows capture probability to vary across subsets of the total assemblage the size dependence of capture probability has also been an issue when using mark recapture methods to assess populations in a variety of ecological contexts borgstrom and skaala 1993 anderson 1995 alternatively a sampling bias is dependent on the equipment used to sample meaning that the size bias associated with backpack electrofishing may differ from that of other sampling equipment e g seining for instance there was a negative relationship between capture probability and body size observed when using bottom trawl sampling to assess black crappie pomoxis nigromaculatus in florida usa binion et al 2009 there has been a considerable amount of research that has focused on the size selectivity of gill netting as the efficiency of capture is strongly dependent on the size of the net mesh and the fish size doll et al 2014 shoup and ryswyk 2016 pitfall trapping used in arthropod surveys is also subject to a size bias in which capture probability increases with body size hancock and legg 2012 these biases associated with size highlight the need to correct for potential sampling biases in any ecological data set the model fitted to the ontario data can be used to estimate capture probability and abundance estimates for multi pass samples but it can also be applied to single pass samples as well a key advantage of this form of model is that it directly estimates capture probability from size class and site covariates meaning that one can use the parameterized capture probability function to estimate the abundance for the single pass samples the quality of multi pass samples is greater than that of single pass samples as more reliable estimates are obtained with multiple sampling passes jones and stockwell 1995 millar et al 2016 consequently multi pass sampling is preferred from a reliability standpoint although field crews may elect to conduct single pass sampling in order to increase the number of independent observations locations collected and the spatial coverage of the data hedger et al 2013 hanks et al 2018 single pass sampling is a common technique when only presence absence data are required or when considering other characteristics of communities such as species richness diversity reid et al 2008 peoples and frimpong 2011 rather than completely disregarding abundance data from single pass sampling as being poor and unreliable information we can use this model to obtain relative abundance estimates by correcting single pass catches with the capture probability function while this approach can provide relative abundance estimates obtaining absolute estimates remains a challenge as other differences between the sampling methodologies can influence capture probability for example single pass methods often do not involve block nets while they are commonplace in multi pass methods these applications highlight the flexibility of the bayesian hierarchical model that can improve the quality of data analysis and interpretation for other key questions in ecology our size based removal model has many advantages over earlier removal models commonly used in the field of ecology the hierarchical structure allows the model to simultaneously estimate abundance at the size class and site level while incorporating information from other sites to improving estimates for any given site rivot et al 2008 this structure improves our ability to estimate abundance for data limited sites to overcome common removal sampling issues such as poor depletion e g larger consecutive catches or the absence of individuals in sampling passes another advantage of the bayesian removal model is that it estimates realistic abundance credible intervals as the lower limit will be the total catch whereas the confidence intervals of the maximum likelihood model is typically lower than the actual catch body size can be incorporated into the capture probability function as a continuous variable rather than categorical providing a function to estimate capture probability for size classes that differ from the ones we used in this study site covariates and their potential interactions with size can be used in the model to improve capture probability estimates which became clear through the model selection process used in this paper addressing biases in sampling methods is an important area of study in ecology as it provides reliable estimates fundamental to answering many questions in ecology furthermore the framework used in this study can be used to correct for other sampling biases associated with removal sampling in different ecological contexts authors contributions all authors conceived the idea i r

24467,root turnover rates define how frequently plants replace their root systems and input organic matter into soil turnover rates are often computed using measurements of total living and dead standing root biomass r by assuming gross and net production are equivalent during the growing season this assumption may be inappropriate in grasslands where root lifespans are relatively short and decomposition substantially offsets growth the objective of this study was to quantify turnover rates from measurements of r over time assuming growth and decomposition happen simultaneously and that net r changes δ r δ t decrease linearly as the size of r increases first order kinetics these hypotheses were interpreted with the growth maintenance respiration paradigm gmrp based on whether daily growth is constant gp or reduced by the costs of tissue maintenance mp the two parameters of the linear gmrp models were inferred using bayesian methods from 111 growing season records of r versus δ r δ t from 15 grasslands two level hierarchical inferences were setup for the 14 grasslands that had multiple records assuming parameters from each grassland originated from the same population for the grassland with one record a single level inference was conducted a total of 89 records at least one per grassland substantially supported the gmrp models median predicted turnover rates based on production decomposition for the gp and mp models were 1 8 1 1 and 1 4 1 2 per growing season respectively these estimates were 3 to 7 times faster than those from traditional algorithms that neglect decomposition suggesting organic matter inputs from roots may be larger than expected in some grasslands especially where growth occurs almost year round keywords soil organic matter root decomposition carbon cycle ecosystem process bayesian inference parameter scaling 1 introduction the interplay between root growth and decomposition collectively referred to as root cycling is a key mechanism that regulates fluxes of mass and energy through the soil plant atmosphere continuum plants translocate carbon from the atmosphere to produce root systems that globally have the capacity to uptake about 40 of terrestrial precipitation and return it to the atmosphere via transpiration clothier and green 1997 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in turn the accumulation of organic matter from root decomposition fuels soil carbon and nutrient cycling cotrufo et al 2013 kuzyakov and domanski 2000 as well as alters soil structural and hydraulic properties angers and caron 1998 jastrow et al 1998 all of which have important implications for sustaining ecosystem productivity hobbie 2015 hupet et al 2004 understanding the impact of root cycling on these and other ecosystem processes bardgett et al 2014 faucon et al 2017 requires knowledge about the frequency at which plants replace their root biomass otherwise known as the rate of root turnover mccormack et al 2015 reliable global estimations of root turnover are necessary for reconciling uncertainty about the carbon cycle and quantifying potential sequestration of carbon in soil minasny et al 2017 rasse et al 2005 approximately 3 2 million km2 nearly one quarter of earth s land surface excluding antarctica is permanently occupied by meadows or pastures broadly referred to as grasslands fao 2021 root systems in grasslands represent nearly 15 of the global biomass of roots jackson et al 1997 contain nearly as much carbon as 2 5 of the atmospheric pool jackson et al 1997 lal 2008 and contribute about 33 to annual litter production freschet et al 2013 additionally roots in grasslands are characterized by relatively fast turnover rates and lifespans as short as a few days gill et al 2002 johnson et al 2001 reid et al 2015 stevens et al 2002 stewart and frank 2008 despite evidence to the contrary many root turnover rate estimates for grasslands are derived from algorithms that neglect the influence of decomposition during the growing season gill and jackson 2000 scurlock et al 2002 iversen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 resolving this contradiction is likely to improve the representation of root cycling processes within ecological mccormack et al 2015 biogeochemical ostle et al 2009 hydrological schymanski et al 2008 sivandran and bras 2013 pedological finke and hutson 2008 and climatological dickinson et al 1998 models another source of uncertainty in root databases is the lack of conformity to a standard definition and methodology for quantifying root turnover rates smithwick et al 2014 when root lifespans are directly observed turnover rates are computed by inverting the average lifespan otherwise turnover rates are approximated as the ratio of annual production or dieback godbold et al 2003 relative to the mean aerts et al 1992 or maximum biomass dahlman and kucera 1965 most studies derive root turnover rates from discrete sampling experiments in which roots in the uppermost soil layers are intermittently sampled throughout the growing season usually without distinguishing between the living and dead fractions scurlock et al 2002 with this type of time series data annual production is computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum biomass mmd or as the sum of all positive growth increments spi sims and singh 1978 since both algorithms ignore sampling intervals when biomass decreases both are prone to underestimating gross production when decomposition is substantial brunner et al 2012 hendricks et al 2006 nadelhoffer and raich 1992 or overestimating it when productivity is conflated by high spatial variability sala et al 1988 singh et al 1984 alternative computational approaches have been developed to address underestimation issues with the mmd and spi algorithms brunner et al 2012 mäkelä and vanninen 2000 santantonio and grace 1987 but such approaches cannot be used to re analyze historical datasets that seldom contain independent information about root necromass dynamics thus a model of root cycling processes that can derive information from the temporal dynamics of the total living and dead standing root biomass is needed for resolving global uncertainty about root turnover rates in grasslands the growth maintenance respiration paradigm gmrp is a conceptual modeling framework employed by plant physiologists to describe how energy is partitioned between plant metabolic processes amthor 2000 generally the gmrp describes the asymptotic growth behavior of plants by assuming that losses in biomass attributed to maintenance respiration and decomposition are proportional to plant size thornley and cannell 2000 while this framework was originally theorized for modeling biomass dynamics of whole plants mccree 1970 thornley 1970 it is also relevant for understanding the activity of specific plant organs including roots sun et al 2020 the objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the gmrp for constraining estimations of root turnover rates from standing root biomass observations a historical database of 111 growing season records each having at least four observations from 15 grassland locations scurlock et al 2002 milchunas 2014 was used to evaluate the hypothesis of an inverse linear relationship between the size of the standing root biomass and its temporal fluctuation this hypothesis was interpreted through the lens of the gmrp based on whether plants prioritize resources for growth or maintenance processes the two parameters of the linear gmrp models were fit to each record using a bayesian method that treats parameter sets representing the same grassland as members of a common population defined by site characteristics this method of hierarchical inference was intended to reduce parameter sensitivity to outlier and high variance measurements borsuk et al 2001 gelman 2006 turnover rates predicted with the gmrp models were compared to traditional estimates from the mmd and spi algorithms predicted relationships with climate soil and plant information were also explored 2 methods 2 1 model development the gmrp represents root biomass dynamics as the balance between biomass gains and losses via respiration and decomposition if the flux of photosynthate γ g m 2 d 1 allocated to the root system r g m 2 is prioritized for growth then the energy requirement for maintenance respiration τ m g g 1 m 2 d 1 pirt 1965 is acquired by consuming pre existing substrate stored in r mccree 1970 fig 1 a 1 d r d t y t γ t τ m t r τ d t r alternatively if γ is prioritized for maintenance then only the residual is available for growth thornley 1970 fig 1b 2 d r d t y t γ t τ m t r τ d t r in both models the efficiency of converting γ into r is determined by the growth yield y g g 1 while the daily proportion of r that decomposes is controlled by τ d g g 1 m 2 d 1 in this study the growth gp eq 1 fig 1a and maintenance mp eq 2 fig 1b priority models were simplified to describe average temporal dynamics exhibited by r over a growing season this means eco physiological factors influencing model parameters on shorter timescales were not considered furthermore equations 1 and 2 were linearized by adopting the assumptions that y is 0 75 poorter villar 1997 and τ m 1 2 τ d thornley cannell 2000 wang et al 2005 this allows expression of both models as linear ordinary differential equations with two unknown parameters γ and τ the implications of these assumptions are discussed in section 4 3 3 d r d t 0 75 γ 3 τ r 4 d r d t 0 75 γ τ r 2 τ r the slope in the gp model is 3 τ and in the mp it is y τ 2 τ this means the value of τ in the mp model must be greater than it is in the gp since these models are linear and are therefore equivalent the intercept of this relationship when r 0 represents the maximum growth rate y γ g m 2 d 1 and when d r d t 0 it equals the standing root biomass at steady state r 5 r 0 25 γ τ 6 r 3 γ 11 τ if r equals

calculated based on the prioritization of γ 8 p g 0 75 γ l 9 p g 0 75 γ τ r l subsequently turnover rates are approximated either in relation to d t o d l 1 10 t o d d r 2 τ l or to p g t o p l 1 11 t

root biomass measured with the sequential coring method lukac 2012 milchunas 2009 were acquired from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive centre scurlock et al 2002 and the environmental data initiative program milchunas 2014 here a record n is defined as measurements of r from at least four sampling dates taken over a minimum span of three months during the growing season sample sizes smaller than this were deemed inadequate for drawing inferences about r dynamics averages were calculated if multiple observations of r were taken per sampling date in total n 111 measurement records representing 15 grassland locations were used in this study table 1 fig 2 within each record net changes in root biomass δ r δ t g m 2 d 1 were calculated between all unique combinations of sampling dates 13 δ r δ t r i j r i t i j t i where r i is the current sampling date and r i j is some sampling date after r i this means that x sampling dates in a record will result in x 2 x 2 possible observations of δ r δ t biomass changes over the winter were not considered when measurements were taken over consecutive growing seasons mean annual rainfall map and air temperature mat were computed from daily meteorological observations recorded at weather stations contributing to the global historical climatology network menne et al 2012 that were within a 200 km radius around the location of each grassland table 1 the average length of the growing period l d was acquired from the output of the global agro ecological zones model mapped at 1 km resolution fischer et al 2002 parameter inference the gmrp model parameters γ and τ were estimated from paired observations of δ r δ t and r i eq 13 parameter sets for records n from the same grassland were specified to arise from a common population distribution this assumes records from the same grassland are independent samples drawn from the same population regardless of years treatments and or site replicates unknown parameters at the sample and population levels were inferred simultaneously in a two level hierarchical framework bayes theorem was applied to estimate the conditional posterior distributions of the sample level parameters γ n and τ n and their governing parameters at the population level known as hyperparameters in bayesian terminology gelman hill 2006 this approach can shrink uncertainty and prevent overfitting at the sample level through the exchange of information between the sample and population levels i e partial pooling effect borsuk et al 2001 gelman 2006 bayesian methods treat unknown model parameters as probabilistic random variables whose distribution can be inferred by updating prior knowledge about those parameters gained through new observations this approach requires assigning an initial prior probability distribution to each unknown parameter including their errors model fits to the n records were evaluated with a gaussian likelihood function and the unknown model error ϵ n was assigned a weakly informative inverse gamma prior distribution with shape and rate parameters set to 0 01 lemoine 2019 sample level parameters γ n and τ n were assigned positive truncated normal prior distributions for the same grassland sets of γ n and τ n were assigned common population hypermeans and hypervariances hypermeans μ γ and μ τ were assigned uniform prior distributions bounded between γ values from 1 to 100 g m 2 d 1 and τ values from 1e 4 to 0 1 d 1 hypervariances σ γ 2 and σ τ 2 were assigned inverse gamma prior distributions setup the same as ϵ n for each location except calabozo where n 1 n sets of sample level parameters γ n τ n ϵ n plus the four population level hyperparameters μ γ μ τ σ γ 2 σ τ 2 were inferred simultaneously for calabozo a single level inference was conducted in which γ and τ were assigned uniform prior distributions the same as μ γ and μ τ optimal posterior distributions of the parameters subjected to inference along with their corresponding predictions of r p n p g d t o p and t o d were approximated using gibbs sampling and markov chain monte carlo mcmc techniques as implemented in the r software package rjags plummer 2019 four mcmc chains were each programmed to run for a burn in period of 250 000 generations until the ratio of between and within chain variance was less than 1

summarized in tables s1 and s2 results for the best fitting mle parameter sets are in tables s3 and s4 the estimated daily flux of photosynthate allocated to roots γ and the predicted steady state root biomass r are equivalent in the gp and mp models estimates of γ ranged from 1 6 g m 2 d 1 charleville jornada up to 65 g m 2 d 1 shortandy with an average of ln γ 2 5 0 89 g m 2 d 1 while those for r ranged between 106 charleville and 3894 g m 2 shortandy with an average of ln r 6 7 0 76 g m 2 d 1 estimates of the biomass loss coefficient τ slightly differed for the gp mp models and ranged from 1 5e 3 1 6e 3 d 1 central plains konza to 8 8e 3 9 2e 3 d 1 dickinson with an average of ln τ 5 6 5 5 0 36 d 1 in total 89 out of 111 sequential coring records supported the gmrp hypothesis that r i and δ r δ t are inversely related over the null hypothesis that r i has no effect on δ r δ t table s1 and s2 specifically there were 11 36 and 42 records that substantially 0 5 log 10 b f 1 strongly 1 log 10 b f 2 and decisively log 10 b f 2 supported the gmrp respectively in contrast eight records two out of four records from konza and six out of 30 records from tumugi supported the null over the gmrp log 10 b f 0 one of these records from konza had negative r2 and log 10 b f values because measurements of δ r δ t increased with r i the remaining 14 records anecdotally favored the gmrp 0 log 10 b f 0 5 pearson correlations ρ showed some evidence that gmrp support was stronger as the slope term τ ρ 0 11 and the turnover rate with respect to decomposition ρ 0 24 increased fig 4 however such evidence was inconsistent suggesting that the statistical significance of the gmrp hypothesis was not dependent on the magnitude of τ the inverse relation between the root standing biomass r i and its dynamics δ r δ t is depicted in fig 5 a using the 22 yr dataset from the central plains table 1 fig 2 across all datasets the gmrp explained on average 45 of the variability in the

and extreme observations than parameter sets representing the means of the posterior distributions fig 5b and c this shrinkage in parameter uncertainty was due to the partial pooling effect which attracted the posterior mean values of γ and τ towards the center of their grassland specific hyperdistributions table s5 pearson correlation between δ r δ t and δ t were typically near zero ρ 0 03 0 16 confirming that fluctuations in biomass were not systematically biased by the time elapsed between sampling dates the gp and mp predictions of net production p n are equivalent because both models start from the same initial condition r m i n at t 0 and asymptotically develop to the same final biomass r m i n p n fig 6 overall predictions of p n 158 220 g m 2 l 1 ranged from 74 9 central plains to 1226 hays g m 2 l 1 and were negative for six records three each from central plains and tumugi when r was inferred to be less than r m i n because r decreased over the growing season the model reasonably simulates r development when there is a pronounced asymptotic growth trend fig 6 this result is encouraging considering the model was not optimized to observations of r over time but to the inverse linear relationship between r i and δ r δ t depicted in figure 5a non steady state predictions of gross production p g by the gp model were systematically greater than those of the mp by 1 33 0 05 which is close to the ratio at steady state y γ l y γ τ r 11 8 eq 5 and 6 when r r y 0 75 and τ τ m 1 2 τ d predictions of gross decomposition d are not equal between gp and mp models eq 7 fig 1 because the gp mp ratio for τ is fixed y τ 2 τ 3 τ 2 75 3 estimates of p g ln p g 7 0 0 9 g m 2 l 1 ranged from around 60 charleville to over 6000 lamto g m 2 l 1 while those for d ln d 6 7 0 9 g m 2 l 1 were typically smaller but spanned a similar range of magnitude from 30 charleville up to 4500 lamto g m 2 l 1 the gp mp ratios for the root turnover rates defined relative to production top and decomposition tod reflected those for p g and d because r was equivalent in both models estimates of top were typically greater than tod by 1 7 0 30 for the gp model and by 1 2 0 28 for the mp model fig 7 at steady state these ratios simplify to y γ l 2 τ r l 3 2 eq 5 and 7 and y γ τ r l 2 τ r l 1 1 eq 6 and 7 respectively this means when net production is zero the two turnover definitions are equivalent in the mp model but not in the gp interestingly for the mp model top is less than tod when p n is negative but this cannot happen in the gp model if the growth rate is fixed comparisons to traditional methods posterior estimates of p n from the gmrp were closer to the maximum minimum difference estimates of production p m m d eq 12 whereas those for p g were closer to the sum of positive increments estimates p s p i eq 13 fig 8 table s6 excluding the six records where the gmrp predicted negative p n the median ratio one standard deviation for p n p m m d was 0 46 0 18 fig 8a and for p n p s p i it was 0 35 0 17 fig 8b median ratios of p g p m m d for the gp were 6 6 6 6 and for the mp they were 4 9 4 8 fig 8c the p g p s p i ratios for the gp and mp were 5 0 5 2 and 3 7 3 8 fig 8d respectively turnover rate estimates from the gmrp were also greater than those computed from p s p i and p m m d the median ratio of t o p t o m m d for the gp model was 6 5 7 0 and for the mp it was 4 9 5 1 for t o p t o s p i these ratios were 4 8 5 6 and 3 6 4 0 respectively even t o d which was usually less than t o p was typically at least three times greater than t o s p i and t o m m d note if t o s p i and t o m m d were defined relative to the maximum biomass r m a x instead of the average biomass r a v g these differences would be exacerbated because r was only 3 2 11 greater than r a v g but it was 15 18 less than r m a x scaling relationships predictions with the gmrp are a function of the length of the growing season fig 9 a which depends on the seasonal availability of energy and water as such turnover rates increased by about 1 6 for every 10 c in mean annual temperature fig 9b and by about 0 5 for every 500 mm increase in mean annual precipitation fig 9c additionally turnover rates were on average twice as fast in locations dominated by c4 versus c3 grasses fig 9d and in locations with coarse versus fine soil texture fig 9e turnover rates were also twice as fast when root biomass was sampled within the top 25 cm of soil compared to deeper sampling fig 9f this suggests that shallow sampling could overestimate turnover rates however the pearson correlation between sampling depth and the average standing biomass ρ 0 01 did not substantiate this instead 30 out of the 47 records with a maximum sampling depth below 25 cm were from the cold steppes at tumugi where root cycling was relatively slower than most other locations pearson correlations for the gmrp parameters γ τ with mean annual temperature ρ 0 30 0 06 precipitation ρ 0 21 0 19 and growing season length ρ 0 17 0 11 were inconsequential instead there was strong positive correlation ρ 0 88 between fitted γ values and measured r a v g values fig 10 a this correlation implies that grasses allocate similar amounts of growth resources to their root systems relative to how much root biomass they have the zero intercept slope of this empirical relationship γ r a v g 1 7e 2 5e 4 d 1 was used to scale γ γ by taking r a v g as a proxy for the predicted value of r ρ between r a v g and r is 0 97 scaled estimates of τ τ for the gp 4 2e 3 d 1 and mp 4 5e 3 d 1 models could then be determined through the steady state relations in eq 5 and 6 predictions with the scaled parameter sets table s7 were closer to the original predictions when r a v g was less than 1500 g m 2 fig 10a overall the scaled predictions of p g p g were closer to the mp fig 10b whereas those for d d fig 10c and t o d t o d fig 10d were closer to the gp discussion support for the gmrp was substantial in over three quarters of the grassland data records re analyzed in this study while this result does not verify the accuracy of the gmrp predictions it provides empirical support for the gmrp hypothesis that net changes in biomass δ r δ t decrease as standing root biomass r increases because losses attributed to respiration and decomposition are proportional to r fig 5a this is logical because the reverse relationship would imply root biomass grows indefinitely rather than to some mature amount of biomass fig 6 hunt 2003 according to singh et al 1984 measurements of net production δ r δ t may be biased by the time that elapses between sampling dates δ t particularly if the spatial variability of r is considerably larger than its temporal variability that is δ r δ t should be systematically greater when δ t is short and vice versa results in this study did not support such a relationship which is another optimistic sign for the validity of the gmrp median predictions with the gmrp method for the subset of grasslands in this study suggest grasses replace their entire root biomass between one to two times per growing season while this estimate is faster than the global average for grasslands gill jackson 2000 wang et al 2019 it is in agreement with turnover rates reported in the literature aerts et al 1992 gill et al 2002 picard 1979 stevens et al 2002 stewart frank 2008 for example the root biomass in a temperate pasture in new zealand was replaced on average three times per year and reached a frequency of eight times per year during the peak of the growing season reid et al 2015 results can also be validated by checking the ranges of the fitted parameters against values reported in the literature the inter quartile range of log

ranges would be closer if γ were defined with respect to a more juvenile standing root biomass as it normally is comparisons to traditional methods most estimates of root production and turnover are derived from the maximum minimum difference mmd eq 10 and sum of positive increments spi eq 11 algorithms majdi et al 2005 milchunas 2009 singh et al 1984 both algorithms neglect sampling intervals where root biomass decreases and ignore the influence of decomposition during the growing season when decomposition was accounted for with the gmrp predictions of gross production and turnover rates were typically three to seven times greater than those computed with the mmd and spi algorithms fig 7c and d the direction and magnitude of this bias is consistent with what others have documented for these algorithms in various ecosystems for example hendricks et al 2006 found the mmd and spi yielded gross production estimations that were five times smaller than minirhizotron estimates brunner et al 2012 found the mmd consistently underpredicted turnover rates by about half compared to estimates from a decision matrix algorithm and chen et al 2015 reported the mmd and spi applied on sequential coring data gave production estimates that were about 75 smaller than ingrowth coring on the other hand yuan chen s 2012 meta analysis provided evidence that indirect estimates of production from compartmental flow models similar to the gmrp tend to be 1 3 to 3 3 times larger than production estimates directly measured with ingrowth coring and minirhizotron methods similarly milchunas 2009 asserts predictions from compartmental flow models should be regarded as high end estimates of belowground productivity whereas predictions from the mmd and spi algorithms should not be trusted at all there are several other drawbacks with the mmd and spi algorithms that the gmrp approach can overcome for example if turnover is expressed in relation to the maximum biomass then root turnover rates cannot exceed one with the mmd and rarely ever do they exceed one with the spi unless large fluctuations in biomass occur another drawback is that the mmd and spi cannot predict negative net production for instance if samples are collected towards the end or after the growing season joslin wolfe 1998 or during a period of drought green et al 2005 in contrast it is possible to predict negative net production with the gmrp as was the case during the 1982 growing season in three different field sites at tumugi each dominated by a different short grass species perhaps this was because the 1982 growing season was part of a severe drought period in inner mongolia lei et al 2020 however for years with more extreme drought conditions net production was estimated as positive with the data records in this study likewise net production at central plains was negative for three consecutive growing seasons 2003 2005 at the end of a drought period but was average during one of the worst drought years 2002 ever for this region rondeau et al 2013 these results support evidence that grasses in semi arid climates are adapted to periodic drought but prolonged drought conditions over consecutive growing seasons might have more adverse impacts evans et al 2011 excluding data records with negative predictions net production according to the gmrp was usually two to three times smaller than mmd or spi based estimates fig 8 this is because the gmrp cannot predict net production values exceeding the difference between the initial biomass and the steady state biomass which was usually just slightly larger than the average biomass root turnover rates for the datasets used in this study were previously expressed in terms of production rather than decomposition because the latter process is neglected in the mmd and spi algorithms so long as net production is positive turnover rates defined in terms of production are typically faster than those defined in terms of decomposition godbold et al 2003 which was also the case in this study fig 7 differences between these two definitions are subtle the inverse of the turnover rate defined with respect to production can be interpreted as the average time it takes to replace the standing biomass whereas the inverse of the definition with respect to decomposition is a closer approximation of the average root lifespan measured by minirhizotron and carbon isotope techniques gill et al 2002 since the gmrp can be used to interchangeably calculate turnover rates with respect to either production or decomposition it has potential for homogenizing methodological differences in root databases thus facilitating global meta analyses scaling relationships the empirical relationships between climate and the gmrp predictions shown in fig 9 are corroborated globally gill jackson 2000 wang et al 2019 and locally kitajima et al 2010 and are suggestive of how root dynamics might respond to future shifts in climate norby jackson 2000 information on soil texture and structure may also provide a meaningful way to predict root turnover rates especially as the resolution and complexity of digitally mapped soil information becomes more accessible hartemink et al 2010 in this study there was some evidence that grasses growing in coarse sandy soils had faster turnover rates than those growing in fine clayey soils even though fine textured soils have higher plant available water storage saxton rawls 2006 they also have higher penetration resistance that inhibits root growth bengough et al 2011 and slows root turnover times wang et al 2019 photosynthetic mechanism also seemed relevant for predicting root cycling as the turnover rates of c4 grasses were double those of c3 grasses this could be due to the organic compounds in the roots of c4 plants being more labile than those of c3 plants wynn bird 2007 which in conjunction with the high productivity of c4 plants can accelerate decomposition zatta et al 2014 without distinguishing between living and dead roots this would likely lead to faster turnover rate measurements picard 1979 results from charleville support this notion as the predicted turnover rates were about four times greater at a site dominated by a non native c4 grass cenchrus ciliaris compared to a site with a native c3 species thyridolepis mitchelliana these climate plant and soil relationships should be taken with caution because multiple collinearities exist between them that may be exacerbated by the small sample size of grasslands in this study possibly a better way to extrapolate the results in this study is through the concept that plants of the same functional type have similar growth rates relative to their size hunt 2003 hunt cornelissen 1997 this theory of relative growth can be leveraged to parameterize the gmrp models from their steady state relations eq 5 and 6 using information about the average standing root biomass which demands less time and resources to measure than root biomass dynamics moreover it is possible to estimate root biomass from aboveground biomass by assuming a value for the root shoot ratio of grasses which is typically around 4 6 qi et al 2019 this type of approach would enable quantifying root cycling at the global scale by exploiting the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing information about aboveground biomass xiao et al 2019 gmrp limitations several assumptions are adopted in this study to simplify the gmrp section 2 1 first the daily amount of energy allocated to roots was constant which is reasonable for plants that have maximized canopy light interception mccree 1983 van iersel 2003 but otherwise this quantity depends on photosynthetic and eco physiological restrictions that vary in space and time larcher 2003 second the 2 1 ratio of root decompostion relative to maintenance respiration was deemed reasonable in other modeling studies thornley cannell 2000 but it may not be constant and is likely closer to 1 1 in cooler climates sun et al 2020 wang et al 2005 it was also implicitly assumed that the ratio of maintenance to growth respiration at steady state for the gp model is 1 1 whereas for the mp model it is 3 2 verifying these ratios is difficult because maintenance and growth respiration byproducts are biochemically indistinct amthor 2000 in any case neither of these ratios is unreasonable compared to what sun et al 2020 estimated for a deciduous 15 11 and evergreen 23 11 forest in japan or what szaniawski 1983 measured under laboratory conditions for helianthus annus as soil temperature was increased from 10 c 4 6 to 30 c 6 4 in this study the parameters controlling root cycling processes were held stationary for the purpose of describing average standing root biomass dynamics mäkelä vanninen 2000 however this is a simplification of the phenological mccormack guo 2014 radville et al 2016 ontogenic gedroc et al 1996 winzeler et al 1976 and environmental factors particularly soil temperature nutrient status and moisture availability mccormack guo 2014 that influence root cycling accounting for such variables could improve simulations of how root biomass fluctuates seasonally and inter annually fig 6 and what influence this might have on ecosystem functioning in response to shifts in climate norby jackson 2000 mccormack dickie et al 2015 current models that simulate root autotrophic respiration often separate root metabolic processes into growth and maintenance components agren et al 1991 but it is unclear which of these processes is actually prioritized by plants for example roots of sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua trees mostly used new photosynthates for growth lynch et al 2013 whereas several types of crop plants have been observed to suspend root growth once their supply of photosynthates is reduced crapo ketellapper 1981 from the standpoint of conserving energy the mp strategy would be advantageous bardgett et al 2014 but in terms of maximizing the acquisition of soil resources a fixed growth rate with the gp strategy would presumably be better until the respiration byproducts of specific root processes can be measured in isolation baggs 2006 it will remain difficult to select a gmrp model for simulating the mass and energy balance of plants the version of the gmrp used in this study treats all roots as if their lifecycles were the same rather than considering plant root systems as different pools of fast and slow cycling biomass however sun et al 2016 estimated 62 87 of the root biomass for perennial herbaceous species growing in a cold temperate forest in china was ephemeral lifespan 2 years and the remaining structural portion of this biomass e g rhizome and root collar persisted across multiple growing seasons in this study gmrp predictions likely represent the fast cycling portion of the root biomass because they are derived from measurements that reflect short term biomass changes this highlights one of the reasons why turnover rates from the gmrp method could be larger than methods that directly measure root lifespans yuan chen 2012 conclusions biogeochemical models that simulate vegetation carbon and nutrient cycles are sensitive to prescribed rates of root turnover this study has demonstrated the value in using the gmrp modeling framework to quantify root turnover rates from observations of standing root biomass our results suggest roots in grasslands could account for more than half of all annual litter inputs using the gmrp to constrain root turnover rates is most appropriate in ecosystems that experience long growing seasons and where decomposition considerably offsets gross production further refinement of the gmrp model should consider factors that influence root cycling such as soil water availability fertility and temperature also distinguishing the fractions of fast and slow cycling biomass might improve model predictions but predictions would be difficult to validate because such data are rare using allometric relationships to estimate belowground biomass from aboveground biomass measured with remote sensing has the potential to extend the gmrp predictions to unmeasured sites this would also facilitate coupling this model with other terrestrial process

24467,root turnover rates define how frequently plants replace their root systems and input organic matter into soil turnover rates are often computed using measurements of total living and dead standing root biomass r by assuming gross and net production are equivalent during the growing season this assumption may be inappropriate in grasslands where root lifespans are relatively short and decomposition substantially offsets growth the objective of this study was to quantify turnover rates from measurements of r over time assuming growth and decomposition happen simultaneously and that net r changes δ r δ t decrease linearly as the size of r increases first order kinetics these hypotheses were interpreted with the growth maintenance respiration paradigm gmrp based on whether daily growth is constant gp or reduced by the costs of tissue maintenance mp the two parameters of the linear gmrp models were inferred using bayesian methods from 111 growing season records of r versus δ r δ t from 15 grasslands two level hierarchical inferences were setup for the 14 grasslands that had multiple records assuming parameters from each grassland originated from the same population for the grassland with one record a single level inference was conducted a total of 89 records at least one per grassland substantially supported the gmrp models median predicted turnover rates based on production decomposition for the gp and mp models were 1 8 1 1 and 1 4 1 2 per growing season respectively these estimates were 3 to 7 times faster than those from traditional algorithms that neglect decomposition suggesting organic matter inputs from roots may be larger than expected in some grasslands especially where growth occurs almost year round keywords soil organic matter root decomposition carbon cycle ecosystem process bayesian inference parameter scaling 1 introduction the interplay between root growth and decomposition collectively referred to as root cycling is a key mechanism that regulates fluxes of mass and energy through the soil plant atmosphere continuum plants translocate carbon from the atmosphere to produce root systems that globally have the capacity to uptake about 40 of terrestrial precipitation and return it to the atmosphere via transpiration clothier and green 1997 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in turn the accumulation of organic matter from root decomposition fuels soil carbon and nutrient cycling cotrufo et al 2013 kuzyakov and domanski 2000 as well as alters soil structural and hydraulic properties angers and caron 1998 jastrow et al 1998 all of which have important implications for sustaining ecosystem productivity hobbie 2015 hupet et al 2004 understanding the impact of root cycling on these and other ecosystem processes bardgett et al 2014 faucon et al 2017 requires knowledge about the frequency at which plants replace their root biomass otherwise known as the rate of root turnover mccormack et al 2015 reliable global estimations of root turnover are necessary for reconciling uncertainty about the carbon cycle and quantifying potential sequestration of carbon in soil minasny et al 2017 rasse et al 2005 approximately 3 2 million km2 nearly one quarter of earth s land surface excluding antarctica is permanently occupied by meadows or pastures broadly referred to as grasslands fao 2021 root systems in grasslands represent nearly 15 of the global biomass of roots jackson et al 1997 contain nearly as much carbon as 2 5 of the atmospheric pool jackson et al 1997 lal 2008 and contribute about 33 to annual litter production freschet et al 2013 additionally roots in grasslands are characterized by relatively fast turnover rates and lifespans as short as a few days gill et al 2002 johnson et al 2001 reid et al 2015 stevens et al 2002 stewart and frank 2008 despite evidence to the contrary many root turnover rate estimates for grasslands are derived from algorithms that neglect the influence of decomposition during the growing season gill and jackson 2000 scurlock et al 2002 iversen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 resolving this contradiction is likely to improve the representation of root cycling processes within ecological mccormack et al 2015 biogeochemical ostle et al 2009 hydrological schymanski et al 2008 sivandran and bras 2013 pedological finke and hutson 2008 and climatological dickinson et al 1998 models another source of uncertainty in root databases is the lack of conformity to a standard definition and methodology for quantifying root turnover rates smithwick et al 2014 when root lifespans are directly observed turnover rates are computed by inverting the average lifespan otherwise turnover rates are approximated as the ratio of annual production or dieback godbold et al 2003 relative to the mean aerts et al 1992 or maximum biomass dahlman and kucera 1965 most studies derive root turnover rates from discrete sampling experiments in which roots in the uppermost soil layers are intermittently sampled throughout the growing season usually without distinguishing between the living and dead fractions scurlock et al 2002 with this type of time series data annual production is computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum biomass mmd or as the sum of all positive growth increments spi sims and singh 1978 since both algorithms ignore sampling intervals when biomass decreases both are prone to underestimating gross production when decomposition is substantial brunner et al 2012 hendricks et al 2006 nadelhoffer and raich 1992 or overestimating it when productivity is conflated by high spatial variability sala et al 1988 singh et al 1984 alternative computational approaches have been developed to address underestimation issues with the mmd and spi algorithms brunner et al 2012 mäkelä and vanninen 2000 santantonio and grace 1987 but such approaches cannot be used to re analyze historical datasets that seldom contain independent information about root necromass dynamics thus a model of root cycling processes that can derive information from the temporal dynamics of the total living and dead standing root biomass is needed for resolving global uncertainty about root turnover rates in grasslands the growth maintenance respiration paradigm gmrp is a conceptual modeling framework employed by plant physiologists to describe how energy is partitioned between plant metabolic processes amthor 2000 generally the gmrp describes the asymptotic growth behavior of plants by assuming that losses in biomass attributed to maintenance respiration and decomposition are proportional to plant size thornley and cannell 2000 while this framework was originally theorized for modeling biomass dynamics of whole plants mccree 1970 thornley 1970 it is also relevant for understanding the activity of specific plant organs including roots sun et al 2020 the objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of the gmrp for constraining estimations of root turnover rates from standing root biomass observations a historical database of 111 growing season records each having at least four observations from 15 grassland locations scurlock et al 2002 milchunas 2014 was used to evaluate the hypothesis of an inverse linear relationship between the size of the standing root biomass and its temporal fluctuation this hypothesis was interpreted through the lens of the gmrp based on whether plants prioritize resources for growth or maintenance processes the two parameters of the linear gmrp models were fit to each record using a bayesian method that treats parameter sets representing the same grassland as members of a common population defined by site characteristics this method of hierarchical inference was intended to reduce parameter sensitivity to outlier and high variance measurements borsuk et al 2001 gelman 2006 turnover rates predicted with the gmrp models were compared to traditional estimates from the mmd and spi algorithms predicted relationships with climate soil and plant information were also explored 2 methods 2 1 model development the gmrp represents root biomass dynamics as the balance between biomass gains and losses via respiration and decomposition if the flux of photosynthate γ g m 2 d 1 allocated to the root system r g m 2 is prioritized for growth then the energy requirement for maintenance respiration τ m g g 1 m 2 d 1 pirt 1965 is acquired by consuming pre existing substrate stored in r mccree 1970 fig 1 a 1 d r d t y t γ t τ m t r τ d t r alternatively if γ is prioritized for maintenance then only the residual is available for growth thornley 1970 fig 1b 2 d r d t y t γ t τ m t r τ d t r in both models the efficiency of converting γ into r is determined by the growth yield y g g 1 while the daily proportion of r that decomposes is controlled by τ d g g 1 m 2 d 1 in this study the growth gp eq 1 fig 1a and maintenance mp eq 2 fig 1b priority models were simplified to describe average temporal dynamics exhibited by r over a growing season this means eco physiological factors influencing model parameters on shorter timescales were not considered furthermore equations 1 and 2 were linearized by adopting the assumptions that y is 0 75 poorter villar 1997 and τ m 1 2 τ d thornley cannell 2000 wang et al 2005 this allows expression of both models as linear ordinary differential equations with two unknown parameters γ and τ the implications of these assumptions are discussed in section 4 3 3 d r d t 0 75 γ 3 τ r 4 d r d t 0 75 γ τ r 2 τ r the slope in the gp model is 3 τ and in the mp it is y τ 2 τ this means the value of τ in the mp model must be greater than it is in the gp since these models are linear and are therefore equivalent the

environmental data initiative program milchunas 2014 here a record n is defined as measurements of r from at least four sampling dates taken over a minimum span of three months during the growing

specified to arise from a common population distribution this assumes records from the same grassland are independent samples drawn from the same population regardless of years treatments and or site replicates unknown parameters at the sample and population levels were inferred simultaneously in a two level hierarchical framework bayes theorem was applied to estimate the conditional posterior

shrink uncertainty and prevent overfitting at the sample level through the exchange of information between the sample and population levels i e partial pooling effect borsuk et al 2001 gelman 2006 bayesian methods treat unknown model parameters as probabilistic random variables whose distribution can be inferred by updating prior knowledge about those parameters gained through new observations

r i vs δ r δ t relationship r 2 0 45 0 18 ϵ 2 3 2 3 g m 2 d 1 the mle sets slightly improved the goodness of fit r m l e 2 0 51 0 18 ϵ m l e 2 0 2 1 g m 2 d 1 but were twice as sensitive to data noise and extreme observations than parameter sets representing the means of the posterior distributions fig 5b and c this shrinkage in parameter uncertainty was due to the partial pooling effect which attracted the posterior mean values of γ and τ towards the center of their grassland specific hyperdistributions table s5 pearson correlation between δ r δ t and δ t were typically near zero ρ 0 03 0 16 confirming that fluctuations in biomass were not systematically biased by the time elapsed between sampling dates the gp and mp predictions of net production p n are equivalent because both models start from the same initial condition r m i n at t 0 and asymptotically develop to the same final biomass r m i n p n fig 6 overall predictions of p n 158 220 g m 2 l 1 ranged from 74 9 central plains to 1226 hays g m 2 l 1 and were negative for six records three each from central plains and tumugi when r was inferred to be less than r m i n because r decreased over the growing season the model reasonably simulates r development when there is a pronounced asymptotic growth trend fig 6 this result is encouraging considering the model was not optimized to observations of r over time but to the inverse linear relationship between r i and δ r δ t depicted in figure 5a non steady state predictions of gross production p g by the gp model were systematically greater than those of the mp by 1 33 0 05 which is close to the ratio at steady state y γ l y γ τ r 11 8 eq 5 and 6 when r r y 0 75 and τ τ m 1 2 τ d predictions of gross decomposition d are not equal between gp and mp models eq 7 fig 1 because the gp mp ratio for τ is fixed y τ 2 τ 3 τ 2 75 3 estimates of p g ln p g 7 0 0 9 g m 2 l 1 ranged from around 60 charleville to over 6000 lamto g m 2 l 1 while those for d ln d 6 7 0 9 g m 2 l 1 were typically smaller but spanned a similar range of magnitude from 30 charleville up to 4500 lamto g m 2 l 1 the gp mp ratios for the root turnover rates defined relative to production top and decomposition tod reflected those for p g and d because r was equivalent in both models estimates of top were typically greater than tod by 1 7 0 30 for the gp model and by 1 2 0 28 for the mp model fig 7 at steady state these ratios simplify to y γ l 2 τ r l 3 2 eq 5 and 7 and y γ τ r l 2 τ r l 1 1 eq 6 and 7 respectively this means when net production is zero the two turnover definitions are equivalent in the mp model but not in the gp interestingly for the mp model top is less than tod when p n is negative but this cannot happen in the gp model if the growth rate is fixed comparisons to traditional methods posterior estimates of p n from the gmrp were closer to the maximum minimum difference estimates of production p m m d eq 12 whereas those for p g were closer to the sum of positive increments estimates p s p i eq 13 fig 8 table s6 excluding the six records where the gmrp predicted negative p n the median ratio one standard deviation for p n p m m d was 0 46 0 18 fig 8a and for p n p s p i it was 0 35 0 17 fig 8b median ratios of p g p m m d for the gp were 6 6 6 6 and for the mp they were 4 9 4 8 fig 8c the p g p s p i ratios for the gp and mp were 5 0 5 2 and 3 7 3 8 fig 8d respectively turnover rate estimates from the gmrp were also greater than those computed from p s p i and p m m d the median ratio of t o p t o m m d for the gp model was 6 5 7 0 and for the mp it was 4 9 5 1 for t o p t o s p i these ratios were 4 8 5 6 and 3 6 4 0 respectively even t o d which was usually less than t o p was typically at least three times greater than t o s p i and t o m m d note if t o s p i and t o m m d were defined relative to the maximum biomass r m a x instead of the average biomass r a v g these differences would be exacerbated because r was only 3 2 11 greater than r a v g but it was 15 18 less than r m a x scaling relationships predictions with the gmrp are a function of the length of the growing season fig 9 a which depends on the seasonal availability of energy and water as such turnover rates increased by about 1 6 for every 10 c in mean annual temperature fig 9b and by about 0 5 for every 500 mm increase in mean annual precipitation fig 9c additionally turnover rates were on average twice as fast in locations dominated by c4 versus c3 grasses fig 9d and in locations with coarse versus fine soil texture fig 9e turnover rates were also twice as fast when root biomass was sampled within the top 25 cm of soil compared to deeper sampling fig 9f this suggests that shallow sampling could overestimate turnover rates however the pearson correlation between sampling depth and the average standing biomass ρ 0 01 did not substantiate this instead 30 out of the 47 records with a maximum sampling depth below 25 cm were from the cold steppes at tumugi where root cycling was relatively slower than most other locations pearson correlations for the gmrp parameters γ τ with mean annual temperature ρ 0 30 0 06 precipitation ρ 0 21 0 19 and growing season length ρ 0 17 0 11 were inconsequential instead there was strong positive correlation ρ 0 88 between fitted γ values and measured r a v g values fig 10 a this correlation implies that grasses allocate similar amounts of growth resources to their root systems relative to how much root biomass they have the zero intercept slope of this empirical relationship γ r a v g 1 7e 2 5e 4 d 1 was used to scale γ γ by taking r a v g as a proxy for the predicted value of r ρ between r a v g and r is 0 97 scaled estimates of τ τ for the gp 4 2e 3 d 1 and mp 4 5e 3 d 1 models could then be determined through the steady state relations in eq 5 and 6 predictions with the scaled parameter sets table s7 were closer to the original predictions when r a v g was less than 1500 g m 2 fig 10a overall the scaled predictions of p g p g were closer to the mp fig 10b whereas those for d d fig 10c and t o d t o d fig 10d were closer to the gp discussion support for the gmrp was substantial in over three quarters of the grassland data records re analyzed in this study while this result does not verify the accuracy of the gmrp predictions it provides empirical support for the gmrp hypothesis that net changes in biomass δ r δ t decrease as standing root biomass r increases because losses attributed to respiration and decomposition are proportional to r fig 5a this is logical because the reverse relationship would imply root biomass grows indefinitely rather than to some mature amount of biomass fig 6 hunt 2003 according to singh et al 1984 measurements of net production δ r δ t may be biased by the time that elapses between sampling dates δ t particularly if the spatial variability of r is considerably larger than its temporal variability that is δ r δ t should be systematically greater when δ t is short and vice versa results in this study did not support such a relationship which is another optimistic sign for the validity of the gmrp median predictions with the gmrp method for the subset of grasslands in this study suggest grasses replace their entire root biomass between one to two times per growing season while this estimate is faster than the global average for grasslands gill jackson 2000 wang et al 2019 it is in agreement with turnover rates reported in the literature aerts et al 1992 gill et al 2002 picard 1979 stevens et al 2002 stewart frank 2008 for example the root biomass in a temperate pasture in new zealand was replaced on average three times per year and reached a frequency of eight times per year during the peak of the growing season reid et al 2015 results can also be validated by checking the ranges of the fitted parameters against values reported in the literature the inter quartile range of log transformed root decomposition rates in this study ln τ d 0 8 1 3 yr 1 was slightly above the global average 0 75 0 04 yr 1 for fine roots 2 mm in diameter zhang wang 2015 using the ratio of the daily amount of energy allocated to roots divided by the steady state standing biomass as a proxy for the maximum relative growth rate γ r 12 21 mg g 1 d 1 m 2 gave values smaller than those measured for grasses native to the usa great plains 60 150 mg g 1 d 1 plant 1 levang brilz biondini 2003 and c3 species native to western europe 100 335 mg g 1 d 1 plant 1 poorter remkes 1990 presumably these ranges would be closer if γ were defined with respect to a more juvenile standing root biomass as it normally is comparisons to traditional methods most estimates of root production and turnover are derived from the maximum minimum difference mmd eq 10 and sum of positive increments spi eq 11 algorithms majdi et al 2005 milchunas 2009 singh et al 1984 both algorithms neglect sampling intervals where root biomass decreases and ignore the influence of decomposition during the growing season when decomposition was accounted for with the gmrp predictions of gross production and turnover rates were typically three to seven times greater than those computed with the mmd and spi algorithms fig 7c and d the direction and magnitude of this bias is consistent with what others have documented for these algorithms in various ecosystems for example hendricks et al 2006 found the mmd and spi yielded gross production estimations that were five times smaller than minirhizotron estimates brunner et al 2012 found the mmd consistently underpredicted turnover rates by about half compared to estimates from a decision matrix algorithm and chen et al 2015 reported the mmd and spi applied on sequential coring data gave production estimates that were about 75 smaller than ingrowth coring on the other hand yuan chen s 2012 meta analysis provided evidence that indirect estimates of production from compartmental flow models similar to the gmrp tend to be 1 3 to 3 3 times larger than production estimates directly measured with ingrowth coring and minirhizotron methods similarly milchunas 2009 asserts predictions from compartmental flow models should be regarded as high end estimates of belowground productivity whereas predictions from the mmd and spi algorithms should not be trusted at all there are several other drawbacks with the mmd and spi algorithms that the gmrp approach can overcome for example if turnover is expressed in relation to the maximum biomass then root turnover rates cannot exceed one with the mmd and rarely ever do they exceed one with the spi unless large fluctuations in biomass occur another drawback is that the mmd and spi cannot predict negative net production for instance if samples are collected towards the end or after the growing season joslin wolfe 1998 or during a period of drought green et al 2005 in contrast it is possible to predict negative net production with the gmrp as was the case during the 1982 growing season in three different field sites at tumugi each dominated by a different short grass species perhaps this was because the 1982 growing season was part of a severe drought period in inner mongolia lei et al 2020 however for years with more extreme drought conditions net production was estimated as positive with the data records in this study likewise net production at central plains was negative for three consecutive growing seasons 2003 2005 at the end of a drought period but was average during one of the worst drought years 2002 ever for this region rondeau et al 2013 these results support evidence that grasses in semi arid climates are adapted to periodic drought but prolonged drought conditions over consecutive growing seasons might have more adverse impacts evans et al 2011 excluding data records with negative predictions net production according to the gmrp was usually two to three times smaller than mmd or spi based estimates fig 8 this is because the gmrp cannot predict net production values exceeding the difference between the initial biomass and the steady state biomass which was usually just slightly larger than the average biomass root turnover rates for the datasets used in this study were previously expressed in terms of production rather than decomposition because the latter process is neglected in the mmd and spi algorithms so long as net production is positive turnover rates defined in terms of production are typically faster than those defined in terms of decomposition godbold et al 2003 which was also the case in this study fig 7 differences between these two definitions are subtle the inverse of the turnover rate defined with respect to production can be interpreted as the average time it takes to replace the standing biomass whereas the inverse of the definition with respect to decomposition is a closer approximation of the average root lifespan measured by minirhizotron and carbon isotope techniques gill et al 2002 since the gmrp can be used to interchangeably calculate turnover rates with respect to either production or decomposition it has potential for homogenizing methodological differences in root databases thus facilitating global meta analyses scaling relationships the empirical relationships between climate and the gmrp predictions shown in fig 9 are corroborated globally gill jackson 2000 wang et al 2019 and locally kitajima et al 2010 and are suggestive of how root dynamics might respond to future shifts in climate norby jackson 2000 information on soil texture and structure may also provide a meaningful way to predict root turnover rates especially as the resolution and complexity of digitally mapped soil information becomes more accessible hartemink et al 2010 in this study there was some evidence that grasses growing in coarse sandy soils had faster turnover rates than those growing in fine clayey soils even though fine textured soils have higher plant available water storage saxton rawls 2006 they also have higher penetration resistance that inhibits root growth bengough et al 2011 and slows root turnover times wang et al 2019 photosynthetic mechanism also seemed relevant for predicting root cycling as the turnover rates of c4 grasses were double those of c3 grasses this could be due to the organic compounds in the roots of c4 plants being more labile than those of c3 plants wynn bird 2007 which in conjunction with the high productivity of c4 plants can accelerate decomposition zatta et al 2014 without distinguishing between living and dead roots this would likely lead to faster turnover rate measurements picard 1979 results from charleville support this notion as the predicted turnover rates were about four times greater at a site dominated by a non native c4 grass cenchrus ciliaris compared to a site with a native c3 species thyridolepis mitchelliana these climate plant and soil relationships should be taken with caution because multiple collinearities exist between them that may be exacerbated by the small sample size of grasslands in this study possibly a better way to extrapolate the results in this study is through the concept that plants of the same functional type have similar growth rates relative to their size hunt 2003 hunt cornelissen 1997 this theory of relative growth can be leveraged to parameterize the gmrp models from their steady state relations eq 5 and 6 using information about the average standing root biomass which demands less time and resources to measure than root biomass dynamics moreover it is possible to estimate root biomass from aboveground biomass by assuming a value for the root shoot ratio of grasses which is typically around 4 6 qi et al 2019 this type of approach would enable quantifying root cycling at the global scale by exploiting the increasing availability of high resolution remote sensing information about aboveground biomass xiao et al 2019 gmrp limitations several assumptions are adopted in this study to simplify the gmrp section 2 1 first the daily amount of energy allocated to roots was constant which is reasonable for plants that have maximized canopy light interception mccree 1983 van iersel 2003 but otherwise this quantity depends on photosynthetic and eco physiological restrictions that vary in space and time larcher 2003 second the 2 1 ratio of root decompostion relative to maintenance respiration was deemed reasonable in other modeling studies thornley cannell 2000 but it may not be constant and is likely closer to 1 1 in cooler climates sun et al 2020 wang et al 2005 it was also implicitly assumed that the ratio of maintenance to growth respiration at steady state for the gp model is 1 1 whereas for the mp model it is 3 2 verifying these ratios is difficult because maintenance and growth respiration byproducts are biochemically indistinct amthor 2000 in any case neither of these ratios is unreasonable compared to what sun et al 2020 estimated for a deciduous 15 11 and evergreen 23 11 forest in japan or what szaniawski 1983 measured under laboratory conditions for helianthus annus as soil temperature was increased from 10 c 4 6 to 30 c 6 4 in this study the parameters controlling root cycling processes were held stationary for the purpose of describing average standing root biomass dynamics mäkelä vanninen 2000 however this is a simplification of the phenological mccormack guo 2014 radville et al 2016 ontogenic gedroc et al 1996 winzeler et al 1976 and environmental factors particularly soil temperature nutrient status and moisture availability mccormack guo 2014 that influence root cycling accounting for such variables could improve simulations of how root biomass fluctuates seasonally and inter annually fig 6 and what influence this might have on ecosystem functioning in response to shifts in climate norby jackson 2000 mccormack dickie et al 2015 current models that simulate root autotrophic respiration often separate root metabolic processes into growth and maintenance components agren et al 1991 but it is unclear which of these processes is actually prioritized by plants for example roots of sweetgum liquidambar styraciflua trees mostly used new photosynthates for growth lynch et al 2013 whereas several types of crop plants have been observed to suspend root growth once their supply of photosynthates is reduced crapo ketellapper 1981 from the standpoint of conserving energy the mp strategy would be advantageous bardgett et al 2014 but in terms of maximizing the acquisition of soil resources a fixed growth rate with the gp strategy would presumably be better until the respiration byproducts of specific root processes can be measured in isolation baggs 2006 it will remain difficult to select a gmrp model for simulating the mass and energy balance of plants the version of the gmrp used in this study treats all roots as if their lifecycles were the same rather than considering plant root systems as different pools of fast and slow cycling biomass however sun et al 2016 estimated 62 87 of the root biomass for perennial herbaceous species growing in a cold temperate forest in china was ephemeral lifespan 2 years and the remaining structural portion of this biomass e g rhizome and root collar persisted across multiple growing seasons in this study gmrp predictions likely represent the fast cycling portion of the root biomass because they are derived from measurements that reflect short term biomass changes this highlights one of the reasons why turnover rates from the gmrp method could be larger than methods that directly measure root lifespans yuan chen 2012 conclusions biogeochemical models that simulate vegetation carbon and nutrient cycles are sensitive to prescribed rates of root turnover this study has demonstrated the value in using the gmrp modeling framework to quantify root turnover rates from observations of standing root biomass our results suggest roots in grasslands could account for more than half of all annual litter inputs using the gmrp to constrain root turnover rates is most appropriate in ecosystems that experience long growing seasons and where decomposition considerably offsets gross production further refinement of the gmrp model should consider factors that influence root cycling such as soil water availability fertility and temperature also distinguishing the fractions of fast and slow cycling biomass might improve model predictions but predictions would be difficult to validate because such data are rare using allometric relationships to estimate belowground biomass from aboveground biomass measured with remote sensing has the potential to extend the gmrp predictions to unmeasured sites this would also facilitate coupling this model with other terrestrial process

24468,the singok weir an instream structure in the han river estuary constructed in the 1980s for multiple purposes has interfered with natural river flow removal of this structure has been considered to restore water quality including reducing algal blooms spatiotemporal changes in water quality hydrodynamics hydrology and algal growth resulting from the removal of the singok weir were analyzed using 3 d hydrodynamic water quality and sediment transport modules in the environmental fluid dynamics code model for a five year period 2013 2017 with field data weir removal decreased water depth and thus water volume by 10 which increased average nutrient concentrations given fixed pollutant inputs with the weir removal average cyanobacteria decreased in the upper region during summer but increased in the lower region however differences in cyanobacteria biomass were less than 1 0 mg chl a m3 except during 2015 the driest summer where peak cyanobacteria increased by 20 11 8 mg m3 factors limiting summer algal growth tended to increase modestly during normal flow 3 1 which suggests the weir removal can potentially enhance algal growth the role of hydrology stood out as the major factor determining algal growth with greater relative importance than nutrients light and temperature simulations showed minimum discharge of 150 m3 s from the paldang dam was required to avoid excessive cyanobacteria growth downstream hydraulic residence time during summer determined the growth potential of algae low discharge provided sufficient residence time for algae to proliferate and

algal toxins in rivers specifically regulated rivers are understudied relative to factors that promote habs in lakes estuaries and coastal regions hydraulic structures such as dams and weirs are known to adversely affect aquatic ecosystems due to the interference of water movement and disruption of river continuity bednarek et al 2001 the structures reduce horizontal flow velocity and make vertical movement dominant which favors particulate materials settling to the sediments construction of hydraulic structures generally reduces flow rates and increases both residence time and water volume seo et al 2012 reported that increased residence time by hydraulic structures may promote algal blooms even in river reaches with moderate nutrients feld et al 2011 suggested the removal of hydraulic structures can in time result in biological restoration though there may be a temporary negative impact from the disturbance in contrast cisowska and hutchins 2016 estimated that a weir in their study modestly reduced the annual fraction of nitrate load being retained behind the structure but was uncertain how the river would respond to increased nitrogen following weir removal cha et al 2017

metropolitan area where 4 of the nation s largest wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharge effluent in 1988 an in stream structure the singok weir was constructed which blocked tidal seawater at the mouth of the river to reduce bridge scouring and provide an agricultural water supply consequently habs have continually occurred and become severe especially in 2015 many research shows that the construction of hydro structures deteriorates water quality and removal of the weir in the han river has been considered an option to alleviate nuisance habs and restore the ecosystem kim et al 2021 reported that the removal of weirs in a regulated river can reduce habs upstream due to increased flow velocity but may deteriorate water quality and promote habs further downstream the han river estuary has extremely complicated flow dynamics and water quality kinetics due to a mixture of incoming flows which includes discharge from paldang dam in the headwater effluents from wwtps inflows from urban and nonurban tributaries and appreciable tidal effects kim et al 2017 the complexity of this system makes it difficult to analyze the effects of weir removal based on insights from previous studies the aim of this study was to quantify the effects of hydraulic changes resulting from the removal of the hydraulic structure the singok weir on water quality and habs occurrences in the han

quantitative basis for comprehensive interpretation of complex water quality interactions and thus to develop management alternatives thomann and mueller 1987 chapra 1997 ambrose et al 2009 however in order to reflect and analyze various external and internal interactions it is important to ensure that the model adequately reflects these conditions first the physical transport of the hydraulic structure should be calculated with consideration of a tidal effect second the interaction between water quality variables and algae should be quantitatively linked third sediment transport should be considered to reflect key riverine processes these characteristics are particularly relevant in downstream regions and estuaries the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model hamrick 1992 is used to simulate physical chemical and microbiological changes in aquatic systems such as rivers lakes estuaries and coastal areas park et al 2005 li et al 2011 wu and xu 2011 tang et al 2016 kim et al

friedrichs lewy condition courant et al 1967 and the cfl number was estimated at 1 0 the average size of the horizontal grid was 130 m x 270 m wetting and drying conditions were also considered s fig 4 daily flow data from fourteen tributaries as well as the headwater from paldang dam five wastewater treatment plants and twelve water intake systems were used as flow boundary conditions open boundary conditions were established to reflect the tidal movement along the west coast to address water level fluctuations of around 3 m hourly data were applied s fig 5 water quality data from the tributaries were available from irregular intervals ranging between 1 5 times a month all data were linearly interpolated to make daily data for boundary conditions values and applied in the efdc model based on the cell count data measured by seoul city supplemental table 1 hereafter s table 1 algae were divided into cyanobacteria diatoms and green algae the time series of the water quality and salinity for the estuary boundary condition were considered using data from q14 including tss values used in the sediment transport model salinity values were not available for the study area and were derived from water temperature and conductivity fofonoff and millard 1983 in the sediment transport model data were subdivided into cohesive and non cohesive sediment categories according to zhang et al 2011 and the settling velocity of cohesive sediment was estimated using data from kim et al 2015 all the necessary field data for simulation was obtained from the korean governmental database management systems the water information system water neir go kr was used for water quality data and the water resources management information system wamis go kr was used for flow rates and water level data data on weather and wind conditions were obtained from the korea meteorological administration data kma go kr 2 3 calibration and scenario development calibrations of the hydrodynamics and water quality model were performed using data from 2013 to 2017 s fig 6 and s table 2 water level calibration was based on data from six water level monitoring stations wl1 wl6 for calibration of water temperature and water quality data from fourteen water quality monitoring stations q1 q14 were used water quality variables were toc tn tp chl a dissolved oxygen do ammonia nitrogen nh3 nitrate nitrogen no3 dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip or total phosphate and total suspended solids tss accuracies of calibration results were calculated using root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ia willmott 1981 s table 2 rmse is the size of a typical error ia is the ratio between the mean square error and potential error willmott 1984 and can be used as a

previous research results bowie et al 1985 cole and wells 2006 shin et al 2008 and adjusted further to improve calibration accuracy s table 3 the calibration of this study was based on previous efdc applications for the same study site by kim et al 2017 this analysis used improved grid resolution and field data over a longer period with consideration of sediment transport total chlorophyll a is the summation of all simulated algal groups and this was used for chl a calibration because the data are available in the national database system in korea www nier go kr changes in the hydraulic dynamics water quality and hab occurrences in the lower part of the han river due to the singok weir were evaluated with the model the scenario with indicates when the singok weir exists which is the same as the current conditions the scenario without predicts conditions if the singok weir was removed 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of annual water quality changes due to weir removal to analyze the effect of the weir removal the analysis was focused on the 30 km reach between jamsil weir and singok weir hereafter weir though model simulation was performed for the entire 71 km river reach also the study reach was subdivided into three regions for detailed analysis the upper region q7 middle region q10 and lower region q12 located 24 km 12 km and 2 km upstream from weir respectively s fig 4 volume weighted averages were used from 20 cells around each station to strengthen the representation of the area to avoid a possible bias of a value from a particular cell for the weighted averaged values simulated values for the without scenario were compared with the with scenario at the upper middle and lower regions respectively weir removal would reduce water levels by approximately 14 which may reduce water volume given that the river cross section is trapezoidal table 1 weir removal will restore the influence of tidal flow upstream the extent of tidal influence can be assessed by periodic water level fluctuations after removal of the weir water level fluctuation became greater up to the upper region q7 due to the increased tidal effect s fig 7 annual average water quality concentrations in the study area would largely be controlled by dilution from the mixture of headwater tributary flows wwtp discharges and tidal flow along with kinetic transformations as water levels declined due to the weir removal concentrations of water quality constituents increased with reduced water volume and unchanged waste loading introduced to the river tn and tp increased 1 5 and 2 11 respectively nh3 no3 or din dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dip also increased up to 5 2 and 37 respectively fig 2 and s table 4 increasing rates of tss were much greater at q12 lower 126 214 compared to at q7 upper 107 132 due to increased sediment resuspension and transport by tidal action following the weir removal van rijn 1993 temperature decreased modestly 0 01 0 06 c or 0 1 1 1 in the upper region and increased in the middle and lower region 0 04 1 31 c or 0 3 2 6 changes in average salinity concentrations increased by 0 001 0 002 psu at q12 and were considered negligible throughout the study area s table 4 3 2 effect of water velocity or hydraulic residence time changes annual average water velocity in the upper region increased by about 0 0 42 km day this velocity unit was used rather than m sec to convey flow in the reach due to the weir removal fig 3 and s table 5 however water velocity decreased by 0 04 0 53 km day in the middle region and 0 14 1 01 km day in the lower region therefore hydraulic residence time would decrease at the upper region q7 and increase in the middle region q10 and the lower region q12 which would affect the available time for algal growth in the respective region annual average water velocity was the lowest at q10 middle the deepest part in the study region due to its large cross sectional area these conditions may make q10 a region of more favorable for algal growth and also affect the greatest algal biomass in the lower region q12 each year reynolds and descy 1996 stated that in channel phytoplankton growth is strongly influenced by characteristics of the hydrologic stage however summer average velocity july september showed mixed results in the middle and lower regions except for 2014 and 2015 summer average velocity increased in the middle and lower regions after weir removal fig 3 and s table 5 in general the summer monsoon in korea results in higher flow rates during the flood season jones et al 2009 however summer discharges in 2014 and 2015 were reduced due to severe drought in those years s fig 1 summer velocity in the middle and lower regions decreased after the weir removal in those two years this finding indicates that though the weir removal can increase water velocity during the flood season but would decrease average water velocity in drought 3 3 effect of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria growth annual average phytoplankton as chlorophyll a decreased 1 7 or 1 3 mg m3 in all cases due to the weir removal except in the lower region in 2015 where it showed a modest increase of 0 21 mg m3 or 0 6 s table 6 annual average cyanobacteria decreased in the upper region in all years but showed varied results in the middle and lower regions during 2015 2016 average cyanobacteria biomass as chlorophyll a increased 3 4 or 0 23 0 37 mg m3 at q12 in summer july september when excessive cyanobacteria biomass can occur after the weir removal average cyanobacteria decreased by 0 6 5 4 in the upper region but increased by 0 2 15 3 in the lower region table 2 in particular in 2015 the cyanobacteria biomass in the lower region increased by 4 8 mg m3 15 3 however the weir removal did not noticeably change cyanobacteria biomass except in summer 2015 in the middle and lower regions after the weir removal simulations of the spatial distribution of cyanobacteria in late august 2015 showed greater uniformity in biomass within the water column especially in the deep area in the middle region near q10 fig 4 a and 4 b during summer 2015 cyanobacteria distribution would become more widely dispersed both horizontally and vertically in response to greater mixing due to increased tidal movement following the weir removal 3 4 changes in factors limiting algal growth following weir removal phosphorus promotes eutrophication and algal growth in freshwater correll 1998 however other factors such as physical conditions can be influential fig 5 shows a curvilinear tp chl a relation in temperate streams van nieuwenhuyse and jones 1996 with summer field data from the study sites superimposed on the relationship data from q1 q6 open circles represent upstream conditions where tp and chl a averaged 40 mg m3 and 13 2 mg m3 respectively data from q7 q14 black circles represent conditions in the reach polluted by wwtp discharge where tp and chl a averaged 162 mg m3 and 19 5 mg m3 respectively observed values in the upper reach averaged 27 greater than the temperate pattern while values from the nutrient rich lower reach were 7 below with extreme scatter in the data this comparison illustrates that factors other than tp can influence algal biomass in the han river algal growth rates depend on nutrient availability water temperature light intensity and salinity cerco and cole 1993 di toro et al 1971 supplemental equation 1 hereafter s eq 1 fig 6 and s table 7 summarize the changes in percentage for the growth limiting factors of summer cyanobacteria following weir removal positive values indicate more favorable growth conditions nutrient limitation of algal growth was estimated using liebig s law of the minimum principle odum and barrett 1971 s eq 2 in the model nitrogen limitation for cyanobacterial growth was not changed in most stations in the study area the smallest tn tp ratio and din dip ratio were calculated as 23 3 and 32 8 respectively s figure 8 these values indicate nitrogen was not a limiting factor in this system and would not likely affect changes in algal growth rate in the study site for the weir removal forsberg and ryding 1980 thomann and mueller 1987 in contrast phosphorus limitation was indicated especially in 2015 and 2016 percent changes in the summer nutrient limitation based on phosphorus were positive in the upper 5 26 and middle 1 09 regions and negative for the lower 0 29 region in 2015 the upper and middle regions showed an increase in nutrient concentration due to decreased water volume as discussed previously decreased phosphorus limitation in the lower region indicated the increased consumption of dip due to increased cyanobacteria growth in the middle region q10 similar findings were reported by kim et al 2021 during their algal bloom analysis in the geum river korea light limitation of algal growth was calculated using depth averaged steele s equation steele 1965 s eq 3 6 the extinction coefficient was calculated as functions of chl a organic matter and suspended solids di toro 1978 in the efdc model increased tss concentration due to the tidal effect by weir removal would increase light extinction and thus decrease light penetration while lower water levels resulting from weir removal would increase the average available light for algal growth therefore the overall light limitation would be a combination of above the two effects fig 6 shows the light limiting factor would decrease during summer especially in the middle and lower regions changes in the light growth limitation factor in the upper region were smaller than the other regions because tss concentrations increased due to tidal sediment were much less 1 6 mg l as shown in s table 4 temperature limitation for algal growth was calculated using the gaussian probability curve cerco and cole 1993 s eq 7 annual average temperature becomes 0 04 0 41 c higher in the middle and lower regions while it becomes 0 01 0 16 c lower in the upper region these changes in summer temperature growth limiting factor however seem negligible as shown in fig 6 through the middle region in 2015 increased slightly 0 005 0 010 following the weir removal salinity limitation for cyanobacterial growth was calculated using s eq 8 cerco and cole 1993 because salinity concentrations were close to 0 psu in both scenarios salinity limitation on cyanobacterial growth was considered negligible table 3 summarizes the changes in the total growth limiting factors of cyanobacteria in summer calculated by the multiplication of nutrient light temperature and salinity limiting factors in general growth limiting factors tended to increase with the weir removal this result suggests that the weir removal can enhance algal growth potential in the han river however differences in the net growth limitation factors were in the range of 0 001 and 0 031 which seemed unimportant it is notable that the summer growth limitation of 2015 in the lower region q12 was around 0 1 and this is the lowest in the study period light availability seems to be the major factor during the low flow year as shown in fig 6 3 5 headwater conditions following weir removal fig 7 shows paldang dam discharge rates and simulated cyanobacteria biomass changes in the summer with and without the weir there were no meaningful changes in cyanobacteria biomass due to the weir removal except during summer 2015 which is consistent with table 2 in 2015 the summer average and peak cyanobacteria in the lower q12 region increased by 15 or 4 8 mg m3 and 20 or 11 8 mg m3 in response to the weir removal noteworthy summer average cyanobacteria was highest in the middle q10 region only in 2015 while both average and peak values were highest in the lower q12 region in other years this may be caused by reduced water velocity in the middle region q10 following the weir removal as shown in fig 3 in 2015 with the weir removal the summer average water velocity in the middle q10 region was estimated to be 3 2 km day which indicates that it would take about 3 days to travel 10 km from q10 to q12 using this calculation protocol summer travel time between the middle and lower regions q10 q12 in 2014 and 2016 was estimated at approximately 2 days and 1 day respectively algal growth rate is an exponential function with time di toro et al 1971 so longer residence time would allow exponentially greater cyanobacterial biomass excessive growth of cyanobacteria would consume dip in the middle q10 region which would reduce nutrient availability in the lower q12 region kim et al 2021 reported that excessive growth of phytoplankton upstream can result in depletion of dip and reduced algal growth downstream in a large regulated river in contrast in 2013 and in 2017 when the average flows were greater than other years differences in summer cyanobacteria biomass due to the weir removal were modest with the maximum difference of 0 58 mg m3 therefore it can be concluded that the weir removal did not show an appreciable change in summer cyanobacteria dynamics in non drought years in 2014 and 2016 which are relatively low flow years the summer average and peak cyanobacteria increments were greater than in 2013 and 2017 fig 7 also shows that cyanobacteria dynamics exhibit exactly the opposite pattern with headwater discharge when there was increased flow cyanobacteria biomass declined rapidly and when the flow was reduced cyanobacteria biomass increased which emphasizes the importance of hydraulics on cyanobacterial growth this effect was especially pronounced in summer 2015 moreover the 2015 drought was a historically significant impact of the el niño southern oscillation enso philander 1983 which indicates severe cyanobacterial growth would intensify whenever similar enso conditions occur li et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in fig 7 the summer average flow rate and the number of days when dam discharge was less than 150 m3 s chosen by visual inspection during the summer were denoted when flow rates were continuously lower than this value cyanobacteria biomass continuously increased but with increased discharge cyanobacteria biomass dropped immediately according to table 3 and fig 7 these analyses emphasize the importance of hydraulics or residence time as the key factor controlling algal blooms in rivers with sufficient nutrients as reported by other researchers reynolds and descy 1996 jones and elliott 2007 li et al 2011 seo et al 2012 graham et al 2020 xia et al 2020 in conclusion if the algal growth potential is high but sufficient residence time is inadequate algal growth is limited in contrast if the growth potential of algae is low but sufficient residence time is adequate the algae proliferate 4 conclusions this study evaluated changes in water quality and cyanobacteria biovolume in the han river estuary with the removal of singok weir the 3 d hydrodynamics water quality and sediment transport models in efdc were applied in combination to account for complicated water movement water quality kinetics and algal growth responses responses in water quality total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biovolumes are different spatially and temporally the response analyses were performed intensively for three distinct locations q7 upstream q10 middle stream and q12 downstream each are 2 km 12 km and 24 km above singok weir respectively annual average nutrients and organic concentrations due to the weir removal were controlled by dilution from the headwater tributary flows wwtps and tidal flows each year as the annual average water level declined by 9 2 17 5 due to the weir removal concentrations of water quality constituents increased given the same waste load to the study site annual average tn and tp increased by 1 5 0 1 0 24 mg l 2 11 0 001 0 015 mg l respectively annual average tss increased 8 1 114 1 41 mg l due to increased sediment load from the tidal inflow annual average phytoplankton decreased by 1 7 1 3 mg chl a m3 annual average cyanobacteria biovolume decreased only in the upstream area while it showed mixed results in the other regions in summer july september average cyanobacteria decreased by up to 5 4 0 8 mg m3 in the upper region but increased by up to 15 3 4 8 mg m3 in the lower region due to the weir removal in particular in the driest year 2015 peak cyanobacteria biomass in the lower q12 region increased by 20 11 8 mg m3 the corresponding changes in hydraulic residence time seem to be the principal factor determining biomass however summer average cyanobacteria differences in most years were less than 1 0 mg chl a m3 except the extremely dry year 2015 during the summer cyanobacteria distribution would become more widely dispersed both horizontally and vertically in response to increased tidal movement this result emphasizes the importance of seasonal and hydrodynamic assessment when analyzing cyanobacteria in response to external changes which can be masked in annual average values by numerous factors factors for algal growth increased during summer suggesting that the weir removal can enhance seasonal algal growth potential in the han river the effect of the weir removal tended to be greater in the upper reach during low flow and light limitation seemed to be the dominant factor however differences in the increment in net growth limitation factors were modest 0 031 noteworthy the role of hydrology stood out as the major factor determining algal growth with greater relative importance than nutrients light and temperature the major factor determining factor for harmful algal growth in the lower area in 2015 was residence time which was affected by the discharge of headwater paldang dam when flow rates were continuously lower than 150 m3 s cyanobacteria biomass increased but with increased discharge cyanobacteria biomass dropped immediately in

24468,the singok weir an instream structure in the han river estuary constructed in the 1980s for multiple purposes has interfered with natural river flow removal of this structure has been considered to restore water quality including reducing algal blooms spatiotemporal changes in water quality hydrodynamics hydrology and algal growth resulting from the removal of the singok weir were analyzed using 3 d hydrodynamic water quality and sediment transport modules in the environmental fluid dynamics code model for a five year period 2013 2017 with field data weir removal decreased water depth and thus water volume by 10 which increased average nutrient concentrations given fixed pollutant inputs with the weir removal average cyanobacteria decreased in the upper region during summer but increased in the lower region however differences in cyanobacteria biomass were less than 1 0 mg chl a m3 except during 2015 the driest summer where peak cyanobacteria increased by 20 11 8 mg m3 factors limiting summer algal growth tended to increase modestly during normal flow 3 1 which suggests the weir removal can potentially enhance algal growth the role of hydrology stood out as the major factor determining algal growth with greater relative importance than nutrients light and temperature simulations showed minimum discharge of 150 m3 s from the paldang dam was required to avoid excessive cyanobacteria growth downstream hydraulic residence time during summer determined the growth potential of algae low discharge provided sufficient residence time for algae to proliferate and conversely this result also emphasizes the importance of seasonal and hydrodynamic assessments when analyzing cyanobacteria in response to external changes which can be masked in annual average values

stability and nutrients huisman et al 2018 available data suggest that algal community composition responds similarly to nutrient loading whether in lakes reservoirs or rivers smith 2003 in large rivers with adequate nutrients factors such as flow rate and turbidity determine algal growth reynolds and descy 1996 but river studies are challenging due to complex and variable hydrological

secondary influence of catchment size a surrogate for flow rate and residence time graham et al 2020 reported that nuisance algal blooms occur mainly in eutrophic rivers in north america and that algal toxins in rivers specifically regulated rivers are understudied relative to factors that promote habs in lakes estuaries and coastal regions hydraulic structures such as dams and weirs are known to adversely affect aquatic ecosystems due to the interference of water movement and disruption of river continuity bednarek et al 2001 the structures reduce horizontal flow velocity and make vertical movement dominant which favors particulate materials settling to the sediments construction of hydraulic structures generally reduces flow rates and increases both residence time and water volume seo et al 2012 reported that increased residence time by hydraulic structures may promote algal blooms even in river reaches with moderate nutrients feld et al 2011 suggested the removal of hydraulic structures can in time result in biological restoration though there may be a temporary negative impact from the disturbance in contrast cisowska and hutchins 2016 estimated that a weir in their study modestly reduced the annual fraction of nitrate load being retained behind the structure but was uncertain how the river would respond to increased nitrogen following weir removal cha et al 2017 suggested that summer cyanobacterial cell counts depended on residence time and water temperature in rivers regulated by weirs in korea the downstream reach of the han river traverses the seoul metropolitan area where 4 of the nation s largest wastewater treatment plants wwtps discharge effluent in 1988 an in stream structure the singok weir was constructed which blocked tidal seawater at the mouth of the river to reduce bridge scouring and provide an agricultural water supply consequently habs have continually occurred and become severe especially in 2015 many research shows that the construction of hydro structures deteriorates water quality and removal of the weir in the han river has been considered an option to alleviate nuisance habs and restore the ecosystem kim et al 2021 reported that the removal of weirs in a regulated river can reduce habs upstream due to increased flow velocity but may deteriorate water quality and promote habs further downstream the han river estuary has extremely complicated flow dynamics and water quality kinetics due to a mixture of incoming flows which includes discharge from paldang dam in the headwater effluents from wwtps inflows from urban and nonurban tributaries and appreciable tidal effects kim et al 2017 the complexity of this system makes it difficult to analyze the effects of weir removal based on insights from previous studies the aim of this study was to quantify the effects of hydraulic changes resulting from the removal of the hydraulic structure the singok weir on water quality and habs occurrences in the han river estuary a numerical model was applied to analyze cyanobacteria dynamics in an estuarine environment with complex hydrodynamic and sediment transport conditions due to tidal movements and with complicated biochemical interactions among pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and water quality the han river is the largest in korea with a length of 483 km and a basin area of 34 428

classified as oligotrophic mesotrophic 25 mg m3 in s fig 2 while the lower reaches q7 q14 would be considered mesotrophic eutrophic 75 mg m3 in s fig 2 however tn levels in the study site exceeded mesotrophic eutrophic criteria often by several fold 1 5 mg l dodds et al 1998 and could not be applied to the han river average chl a in all locations was below the mesotrophic eutrophic criteria 30 mg m3 dodds et al 1998 though individual values 50 mg m3 were common particularly in the lower reach q7 q14 in s fig 2 2 2 model development and boundary conditions water quality models provide a quantitative basis for comprehensive interpretation of complex water quality interactions and thus to develop management alternatives thomann and mueller 1987 chapra 1997 ambrose et al 2009 however in order to reflect and analyze various external and internal interactions it is important to ensure that the model adequately reflects these conditions first the physical transport of the hydraulic structure should be calculated with consideration of a tidal effect second the interaction between water quality variables and algae should be quantitatively linked third sediment transport should be considered to reflect key riverine processes these characteristics are particularly relevant in downstream regions and estuaries the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc model hamrick 1992 is used to simulate physical chemical and microbiological changes in aquatic systems such as rivers lakes estuaries and coastal areas park et al 2005 li et al 2011 wu and xu 2011 tang et al 2016 kim et al

orthogonal coordinate method and 2029 horizontal cells with the orthogonality deviation of 1 24 each cell was divided into 5 vertical layers to consider the stratification effect due to salinity from tidal effects efdc uses a stretched or sigma grid system for vertical layers and the same number of layers were used for the study area a three second time step was used to satisfy the cfl courant

and salinity for the estuary boundary condition were considered using data from q14 including tss values used in the sediment transport model salinity values were not available for the study area and were derived from water temperature and conductivity fofonoff and millard 1983 in the sediment transport model data were subdivided into cohesive and non cohesive sediment categories according to

analyze the effect of the weir removal the analysis was focused on the 30 km reach between jamsil weir and singok weir hereafter weir though model simulation was performed for the entire 71 km river

respectively s fig 4 volume weighted averages were used from 20 cells around each station to strengthen the representation of the area to avoid a possible bias of a value from a particular cell for the weighted averaged values simulated values for the without scenario were compared with the with scenario at the upper middle and lower regions respectively weir removal would reduce water levels by approximately 14 which may reduce water volume given that the river cross section is trapezoidal table 1 weir removal will restore the influence of tidal flow upstream the extent of tidal influence can be assessed by periodic water level fluctuations after removal of the weir water level fluctuation became greater up to the upper region q7 due to the increased tidal effect s fig 7 annual average water quality concentrations in the study area would largely be controlled by dilution from the mixture of headwater tributary flows wwtp discharges and tidal flow along with kinetic transformations as water levels declined due to the weir removal concentrations of water quality constituents increased with reduced water volume and unchanged waste loading introduced to the river tn and tp increased 1 5 and 2 11 respectively nh3 no3 or din dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dip also increased up to 5 2 and 37 respectively fig 2 and s table 4 increasing rates of tss were much greater at q12 lower 126 214 compared to at q7 upper 107 132 due to increased sediment resuspension and transport by tidal action following the weir removal van rijn 1993 temperature decreased modestly 0 01 0 06 c or 0 1 1 1 in the upper region and increased in the middle and lower region 0 04 1 31 c or 0 3 2 6 changes in average salinity concentrations increased by 0 001 0 002 psu at q12 and were considered negligible throughout the study area s table 4 3 2 effect of water velocity or hydraulic residence time changes annual average water velocity in the upper region increased by about 0 0 42 km day this velocity unit was used rather than m sec to convey flow in the reach due to the weir removal fig 3 and s table 5 however water velocity decreased by 0 04 0 53 km day in the middle region and 0 14 1 01 km day in the lower region therefore hydraulic residence time would decrease at the upper region q7 and increase in the middle region q10 and the lower region q12 which would affect the available time for algal growth in the respective region annual average water velocity was the lowest at q10 middle the deepest part in the study region due to its large cross sectional area these conditions may make q10 a region of more favorable for algal growth and also affect the greatest algal biomass in the lower region q12 each year reynolds and descy 1996 stated that in channel phytoplankton growth is strongly influenced by characteristics of the hydrologic stage however summer average velocity july september showed mixed results in the middle and lower regions except for 2014 and 2015 summer average velocity increased in the middle and lower regions after weir removal fig 3 and s table 5 in general the summer monsoon in korea results in higher flow rates during the flood season jones et al 2009 however summer discharges in 2014 and 2015 were reduced due to severe drought in those years s fig 1 summer velocity in the middle and lower regions decreased after the weir removal in those two years this finding indicates that though the weir removal can increase water velocity during the flood season but would decrease average water velocity in drought 3 3 effect of phytoplankton and cyanobacteria growth annual average phytoplankton as chlorophyll a decreased 1 7 or 1 3 mg m3 in all cases due to the weir removal except in the lower region in 2015 where it showed a modest increase of 0 21 mg m3 or 0 6 s table 6 annual average cyanobacteria decreased in the upper region in all years but showed varied results in the middle and lower regions during 2015 2016 average cyanobacteria biomass as chlorophyll a increased 3 4 or 0 23 0 37 mg m3 at q12 in summer july september when excessive cyanobacteria biomass can occur after the weir removal average cyanobacteria decreased by 0 6 5 4 in the upper region but increased by 0 2 15 3 in the lower region table 2 in particular in 2015 the cyanobacteria biomass in the lower region increased by 4 8 mg m3 15 3 however the weir removal did not noticeably change cyanobacteria biomass except in summer 2015 in the middle and lower regions after the weir removal simulations of the spatial distribution of cyanobacteria in late august 2015 showed greater uniformity in biomass within the water column especially in the deep area in the middle region near q10 fig 4 a and 4 b during summer 2015 cyanobacteria distribution would become more widely dispersed both horizontally and vertically in response to greater mixing due to increased tidal movement following the weir removal 3 4 changes in factors limiting algal growth following weir removal phosphorus promotes eutrophication and algal growth in freshwater correll 1998 however other factors such as physical conditions can be influential fig 5 shows a curvilinear tp chl a relation in temperate streams van nieuwenhuyse and jones 1996 with summer field data from the study sites superimposed on the relationship data from q1 q6 open circles represent upstream conditions where tp and chl a averaged 40 mg m3 and 13 2 mg m3 respectively data from q7 q14 black circles represent conditions in the reach polluted by wwtp discharge where tp and chl a averaged 162 mg m3 and 19 5 mg m3 respectively observed values in the upper reach averaged 27 greater than the temperate pattern while values from the nutrient rich lower reach were 7 below with extreme scatter in the data this comparison illustrates that factors other than tp can influence algal biomass in the han river algal growth rates depend on nutrient availability water temperature light intensity and salinity cerco and cole 1993 di toro et al 1971 supplemental equation 1 hereafter s eq 1 fig 6 and s table 7 summarize the changes in percentage for the growth limiting factors of summer cyanobacteria following weir removal positive values indicate more favorable growth conditions nutrient limitation of algal growth was estimated using liebig s law of the minimum principle odum and barrett 1971 s eq 2 in the model nitrogen limitation for cyanobacterial growth was not changed in most stations in the study area the smallest tn tp ratio and din dip ratio were calculated as 23 3 and 32 8 respectively s figure 8 these values indicate nitrogen was not a limiting factor in this system and would not likely affect changes in algal growth rate in the study site for the weir removal forsberg and ryding 1980 thomann and mueller 1987 in contrast phosphorus limitation was indicated especially in 2015 and 2016 percent changes in the summer nutrient limitation based on phosphorus were positive in the upper 5 26 and middle 1 09 regions and negative for the lower 0 29 region in 2015 the upper and middle regions showed an increase in nutrient concentration due to decreased water volume as discussed previously decreased phosphorus limitation in the lower region indicated the increased consumption of dip due to increased cyanobacteria growth in the middle region q10 similar findings were reported by kim et al 2021 during their algal bloom analysis in the geum river korea light limitation of algal growth was calculated using depth averaged steele s equation steele 1965 s eq 3 6 the extinction coefficient was calculated as functions of chl a organic matter and suspended solids di toro 1978 in the efdc model increased tss concentration due to the tidal effect by weir removal would increase light extinction and thus decrease light penetration while lower water levels resulting from weir removal would increase the average available light for algal growth therefore the overall light limitation would be a combination of above the two effects fig 6 shows the light limiting factor would decrease during summer especially in the middle and lower regions changes in the light growth limitation factor in the upper region were smaller than the other regions because tss concentrations increased due to tidal sediment were much less 1 6 mg l as shown in s table 4 temperature limitation for algal growth was calculated using the gaussian probability curve cerco and cole 1993 s eq 7 annual average temperature becomes 0 04 0 41 c higher in the middle and lower regions while it becomes 0 01 0 16 c lower in the upper region these changes in summer temperature growth limiting factor however seem negligible as shown in fig 6 through the middle region in 2015 increased slightly 0 005 0 010 following the weir removal salinity limitation for cyanobacterial growth was calculated using s eq 8 cerco and cole 1993 because salinity concentrations were close to 0 psu in both scenarios salinity limitation on cyanobacterial growth was considered negligible table 3 summarizes the changes in the total growth limiting factors of cyanobacteria in summer calculated by the multiplication of nutrient light temperature and salinity limiting factors in general growth limiting factors tended to increase with the weir removal this result suggests that the weir removal can enhance algal growth potential in the han river however differences in the net growth limitation factors were in the range of 0 001 and 0 031 which seemed unimportant it is notable that the summer growth limitation of 2015 in the lower region q12 was around 0 1 and this is the lowest in the study period light availability seems to be the major factor during the low flow year as shown in fig 6 3 5 headwater conditions following weir removal fig 7 shows paldang dam discharge rates and simulated cyanobacteria biomass changes in the summer with and without the weir there were no meaningful changes in cyanobacteria biomass due to the weir removal except during summer 2015 which is consistent with table 2 in 2015 the summer average and peak cyanobacteria in the lower q12 region increased by 15 or 4 8 mg m3 and 20 or 11 8 mg m3 in response to the weir removal noteworthy summer average cyanobacteria was highest in the middle q10 region only in 2015 while both average and peak values were highest in the lower q12 region in other years this may be caused by reduced water velocity in the middle region q10 following the weir removal as shown in fig 3 in 2015 with the weir removal the summer average water velocity in the middle q10 region was estimated to be 3 2 km day which indicates that it would take about 3 days to travel 10 km from q10 to q12 using this calculation protocol summer travel time between the middle and lower regions q10 q12 in 2014 and 2016 was estimated at approximately 2 days and 1 day respectively algal growth rate is an exponential function with time di toro et al 1971 so longer residence time would allow exponentially greater cyanobacterial biomass excessive growth of cyanobacteria would consume dip in the middle q10 region which would reduce nutrient availability in the lower q12 region kim et al 2021 reported that excessive growth of phytoplankton upstream can result in depletion of dip and reduced algal growth downstream in a large regulated river in contrast in 2013 and in 2017 when the average flows were greater than other years differences in summer cyanobacteria biomass due to the weir removal were modest with the maximum difference of 0 58 mg m3 therefore it can be concluded that the weir removal did not show an appreciable change in summer cyanobacteria dynamics in non drought years in 2014 and 2016 which are relatively low flow years the summer average and peak cyanobacteria increments were greater than in 2013 and 2017 fig 7 also shows that cyanobacteria dynamics exhibit exactly the opposite pattern with headwater discharge when there was increased flow cyanobacteria biomass declined rapidly and when the flow was reduced cyanobacteria biomass increased which emphasizes the importance of hydraulics on cyanobacterial growth this effect was especially pronounced in summer 2015 moreover the 2015 drought was a historically significant impact of the el niño southern oscillation enso philander 1983 which indicates severe cyanobacterial growth would intensify whenever similar enso conditions occur li et al 2020 liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in fig 7 the summer average flow rate and the number of days when dam discharge was less than 150 m3 s chosen by visual inspection during the summer were denoted when flow rates were continuously lower than this value cyanobacteria biomass continuously increased but with increased discharge cyanobacteria biomass dropped immediately according to table 3 and fig 7 these analyses emphasize the importance of hydraulics or residence time as the key factor controlling algal blooms in rivers with sufficient nutrients as reported by other researchers reynolds and descy 1996 jones and elliott 2007 li et al 2011 seo et al 2012 graham et al 2020 xia et al 2020 in conclusion if the algal growth potential is high but sufficient residence time is inadequate algal growth is limited in contrast if the growth potential of algae is low but sufficient residence time is adequate the algae proliferate 4 conclusions this study evaluated changes in water quality and cyanobacteria biovolume in the han river estuary with the removal of singok weir the 3 d hydrodynamics water quality and sediment transport models in efdc were applied in combination to account for complicated water movement water quality kinetics and algal growth responses responses in water quality total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biovolumes are different spatially and temporally the response analyses were performed intensively for three distinct locations q7 upstream q10 middle stream and q12 downstream each are 2 km 12 km and 24 km above singok weir respectively annual average nutrients and organic concentrations due to the weir removal were controlled by dilution from the headwater tributary flows wwtps and tidal flows each year as the annual average water level declined by 9 2 17 5 due to the weir removal concentrations of water quality constituents increased given the same waste load to the study site annual average tn and tp increased by 1 5 0 1 0 24 mg l 2 11 0 001 0 015 mg l respectively annual average tss increased 8 1 114 1 41 mg l due to increased sediment load from the tidal inflow annual average phytoplankton decreased by 1 7 1 3 mg chl a m3 annual average cyanobacteria biovolume decreased only in the upstream area while it showed mixed results in the other regions in summer july september average cyanobacteria decreased by up to 5 4 0 8 mg m3 in the upper region but increased by up to 15 3 4 8 mg m3 in the lower region due to the weir removal in particular in the driest year 2015 peak cyanobacteria biomass in the lower q12 region increased by 20 11 8 mg m3 the corresponding changes in hydraulic residence time seem to be the principal factor determining biomass however summer average cyanobacteria differences in most years were less than 1 0 mg chl a m3 except the extremely dry year 2015 during the summer cyanobacteria distribution would become more widely dispersed both horizontally and vertically in response to increased tidal movement this result emphasizes the importance of seasonal and hydrodynamic assessment when analyzing cyanobacteria in response to external changes which can be masked in annual average values by numerous factors factors for algal growth increased during summer suggesting that the weir removal can enhance seasonal algal growth potential in the han river the effect of the weir removal tended to be greater in the upper reach during low flow and light limitation seemed to be the dominant factor however differences in the increment in net growth limitation factors were modest 0 031 noteworthy the role of hydrology stood out as the major factor determining algal growth with greater relative importance than nutrients light and temperature the major factor determining factor for harmful algal growth in the lower area in 2015 was residence time which was affected by the discharge of headwater paldang dam when flow rates were continuously lower than 150 m3 s cyanobacteria biomass increased but with increased discharge cyanobacteria biomass dropped immediately in

24469,rangelands provide vital ecosystem services and comprise 36 of u s and 25 of world lands approximately 20 to 73 of these rangelands are already degraded soil erosion driven by winds is a significant cause of this degradation minimal work has been done to evaluate the influence of wind erosion on rangeland dominated landscapes or to assess the effect of landscape scale soil and water conservation and management practices on reducing wind erosion due to its inherent complexity and nonpoint source nature our approach is to use an integrated and holistic eco hydrologic model the main objective of this study is to integrate process based landscape wind erosion modeling schemes into the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model version 1905 apex1905 for simulating horizontal aeolian sediment transport and vertical particles transport on rangelands we demonstrate the performance and capability of the model using field data collected at the usda ars jornada experimental range in new mexico u s a benchmark apex1905 model that runs on high resolution sub daily wind speed data and daily average vegetation gap distribution derived from monthly field measurements the benchmark apex1905 model captured the variability in observed aeolian sediment transport during 2015 2017 reasonably well with an r2 0 58 and a rmse 2 60 when the highly variable sub daily measured wind speed and vegetation gap distribution data were substituted with the daily average wind speed and apex1905 estimated daily vegetation gap the apex1905 reproduced well the benchmark model estimates with the performance statistic of r2 0 77 and rmse 0 54 for the horizontal aeolian sediment transport and r2 0 82 and rmse 0 85 for vertical particle transport overall provided limited aeolian watershed data sets the apex1905 is demonstrated to be reliable in estimating wind erosion in arid desert rangeland landscapes using daily average wind speed and simulated vegetation characteristics benefiting from the long established algorithms of simulating plant growth dynamics and topsoil moisture content in apex apex1905 offers a robust and process based estimation of wind erosion in areas where wind and vegetation data are scarce keywords wind erosion simulation model coupling evaluation rangelands apex 1 introduction rangelands claim 36 of the united states jones et al 2018 and provide vital ecosystem services including water mineral and wood resources livestock grazing wildlife habitat recreation and archeological artifacts deleterious impairments of the rangeland environment such as soil degradation overgrazing desertification and reduced ecosystem services are a significant risk to the sustainability of rangelands in the united states an assessment by the u s department of agriculture natural resource conservation service usda nrcs suggests that approximately 21 of 160 million hectares of rangelands in the western u s has been degraded to some degree herrick et al 2010 based on a worldwide literature review weltz et al 2014 determined that wind erosion is a major contributing factor to rangeland erosion sediment loss and soil degradation duniway et al al 2019 stated that disturbances including fire domestic livestock grazing and off highway vehicles substantially increased horizontal aeolian flux and exacerbated dryland degradation on public rangelands wind driven soil loss and sediment redistribution processes influence ecosystem dynamics and alter the provision of ecosystem services natural resource managers face enormous challenges in managing wind erosion effects because their impacts are widespread across spatial scales and data are sparse pressures on land uses and development make it difficult to anticipate wind erosion potentials and manage risks webb et al 2017 in this regard reliable wind erosion models can provide means to monitor and predict how contributing factors affect wind erosion and assist with the implementation of conservation policies jarrah et al 2020 key physical processes that drive aeolian soil particle transport on rangelands are wind erosion occurs when the shear velocity of wind exceeds a threshold value at which particles start to get detached from the soil surface modeling approaches have been developed separately for rangelands due to the extent the factors affect erosion rates including 1 soil physical and chemical properties 2 roughness elements e g vegetation types and their spatial distribution patterns and 3 management practices that can differ greatly between rangelands and croplands li et al 2014 recently jarrah et al 2020 reviewed 12 widely used wind erosion models for cropland systems based on their data requirements process representations and applicability their review highlighted despite the improvements of wind erosion models from being empirical to process based their application is limited to agricultural fields for example the wind erosion prediction system weps fryrear et al 1991 wagner 2013 is a process based daily time step model that simulates weather field conditions and wind erosion on croplands in its current model structure weps model has limitations for applications in rolling terrain such as rangelands and requires a complex large topographic database preparation hagen 2004 jarrah et al 2020 tatarko et al 2016 on the other hand as presented in li et al 2014 2013 there are several rangeland wind erosion models that represent the horizontal sediment transport as a threshold controlled process where transport increases nonlinearly above the threshold shear velocity vegetation structural complexity and spatial scale are some of the factors that makes rangeland wind erosion modeling not trivial okin 2008 developed a new model that utilizes vegetation gap size to characterize the surface and thus explicitly accounts for spatial variability in the shear stress experienced by the soil li et al 2013 parameterized and validated the okin s wind erosion model on a variety of sites ranging from shrubby grassland to grassland and shrubland including both degraded and undegraded plant communities they reported that okin s wind erosion model was able to explain 45 of the observed horizontal sediment transport n 65 indicating the reliability of the model for rangeland wind erosion assessment our study proposes to dynamically link a processed based aeolian transport model to the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model williams et al 2008 for estimating daily landscape wind erosion in rangelands the apex model is a continuous process based agro hydrological model for simulating the impact of land management on environmental quality at various spatial scales plot watershed and regional scale the apex model has been developed and updated since its inception with advances in technological development process knowledge and many case studies with physical data as best possible gassman et al 2010 the apex model is publicly available and gets used and tested extensively in the u s and worldwide the apex model simulates surface subsurface hydrology and water quality production sustainable growth and competition of a wide range of crops grasses trees shrubs among several environmental variables choi et al 2017 gassman et al 2010 kamruzzaman et al 2020 mudgal et al 2010 saleh et al 2004 wang et al 2006 2008 2014 recent advances in apex code in rangeland simulation make apex a suitable model for evaluating land management effects on soil degradation water quality and plant communities in rangeland watersheds wang et al 2014 zilverberg et al 2017 2018 cheng et al 2021 the current version of apex version 1501 simulates wind erosion using the wind erosion continuous simulation wecs williams et al 2008 model on smooth bare soils using daily wind speed distribution utilizing the skidmore 1986 erosion equation the wecs method estimates actual soil erosion by adjusting the amount of potential erosion that includes four factors related to soil properties surface roughness plant cover and unsheltered distance across the field in the dominant wind direction without new updates the existing apex model has limitations for application in rangelands first the model is empirical and developed for agricultural system potter et al 1998 second it is data intensive and requires field properties such as ridge height and random surface height that are often difficult to measure on natural landscapes we argue that enhancing apex model capability for simulating wind erosion across different landcover types will be significantly beneficial because the model is being widely applied in cropland choi et al 2017 wang et al 2008 2006 and natural landscape cheng et al 2021 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2014 zilverberg et al 2018 additionally apex simulates landscape processes that strongly influence soil erosion including soil moisture dynamics plant growth and land management practices this is crucial to estimate wind erosion since collection of samples for soil and vegetation characteristics are often expensive and labor intensive coupling the landscape wind erosion model developed for rangeland ecosystems with apex can improve the estimation of soil loss including the effects of land management practices on rangelands the main objective of this research is the integration of landscape wind erosion processes into the apex hereafter referred to as apex1905 model for estimating the rate of horizontal and vertical sediment transport in rangelands 2 description of the study site and input data the study site is part of both the long term agro ecosystem research ltar network https ltar ars usda gov sites and the national wind erosion network nwen https winderosionnetwork org network sites the jornada experimental range jer is located within the jornada basin in new mexico at an elevation of 1323 m above sea level fig 1 this region is characterized by an arid to semi arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 261 mm 1960 2017 fig 2 a presents historical average monthly rainfall and maximum and minimum temperature at the study site based on 57 years of data seventy percent of the annual rainfall occurs from june through october fig 2a the vegetation comprises diverse community native species warm season c4 grasses perennial forbs and shrubs the grasses include dropseeds tobosa grass black grama and burrograss and are interspersed throughout the site along with moderately sized honey mesquite shrubs and scattered soaptree yucca the remote sensing based lai data from nasa 2002 2017 provides that the vegetation growth follows the region s seasonal rainfall distribution pattern the maximum lai values are observed in august and september fig 2b soil textures are primarily sandy loam to fine sandy loam the weather station provides wind speed data at 1 min intervals for heights ranging from 0 5 to 10 m and precipitation temperature and solar radiation data fig 1 vegetation gap height and cover fraction data were measured in 3 transect lines that are 100 m long fig 1 per month from august 2015 to december 2017 as it occurs wind erosion data are measured using the modified wilson and cooke mwac sampler goossens 2000 webb et al al 2015 provide the details about protocols on wind driven sediment flux measurements within the nwen a total of 27 mwac stems are distributed spatially across the site to monitor wind driven soil erosion fig 1 we acquired all the measured data related to wind erosion modeling from usda ars las cruces new mexico nicholas webb personal communication on november 30 2018 remote sensing based lai data were obtained from modis for 2002 2017 to calibrate the plant growth simulation in the apex1905 model 3 methods 3 1 apex model description apex is a process based agricultural and hydrologic model for simulating the impacts of land management on a variety of spatial and temporal scales williams et al 2008 williams et al 2008 described 12 principal components of the model including climate hydrology crop growth wind and water erosion nutrient cycling grazing and land management practices the model operates daily but can run a sub daily time step for rainfall runoff calculation and can simulate hundreds of years a watershed is divided into subareas in apex to achieve homogeneity concerning soil properties land use and management the apex model allows the user to configure a channel network and water bodies between subareas the channel routing module provides hydrologic routing and dynamic interactions between subareas involving surface runoff return flow sediment deposition and degradation chemical transport and groundwater return flow these hydrologic components encompass all critical processes that occur in the hydrologic cycle of the watershed williams et al 2008 wang et al 2012 recently the groundwater simulation in apex is enhanced by integrating with modflow a three dimensional physically based distributed finite difference groundwater model for variably saturated subsurface systems bailey et al 2021 plant canopies can intercept incoming precipitation the sum of the precipitation snowmelt water and or irrigation input is partitioned between surface runoff and soil infiltration thereby increasing the soil moisture content of the top layer of the root zone soil water is routed vertically and laterally based on soil hydraulic properties soil evaporation and plant root uptake drainage pipes often implemented in soils with a shallow groundwater table accelerate lateral drainage of excess soil water apex offers multiple options for simulating water transport processes for example five potential evapotranspiration equations six water erosion methods two peak runoff rate equations among others are available the apex plant growth module enables the growth and competition of multiple species within a plant community root zone competition includes water and nutrients while surface competition depends on solar radiation daily weather water and nutrients the user can prescribe plant population number of plants m2 for all perennial and annual plants the number of plants ha for trees 3 2 existing wind erosion model in apex for croplands the current wind erosion model in apex wind erosion continuous simulation wecs is an empirical approach and developed to simulate soil loss in agricultural management systems williams et al 2008 this model estimates potential wind erosion for a smooth bare soil surface by integrating the erosion equation through a day using the wind speed distribution eventually the potential erosion rate eq 1 is adjusted using four main controlling factors that reflects the field conditions including a soil erodibility factor soil surface roughness vegetation cover and unsheltered distance across the field in the wind direction 1 y w r c ρ a g u w 2 u t 2 0 5 s w w p 2 1 5 where ywr is the potential wind erosion rate kg m 1 s 1 c is an empirical parameter 2 5 ρ a is the air density kg m 3 g is gravitational constant 9 8 m s 2 u w is the shear velocity m s 1 and u t is the threshold shear velocity m s 1 sw and wp are the actual and 1500 kpa water content of the surface soil layer respectively the sw wp ratio is referred to as the surface water parameter the actual wind erosion estimate kg m 1 for a day yw is computed as 2 y w f i f r f f v f d y w r where fi is the soil erodibility factor frf is the surface roughness factor fv is the vegetative cover factor and fd is the mean unsheltered travel distance of the wind across a field factor note that ywr is the integral of the wind erosion rate over the duration of the wind speed greater than a threshold velocity more details about the computation of each factor is provided in williams et al 2008 and potter et al 1998 3 3 description of selected rangeland wind erosion equations for integration in apex this section provides a brief description of the main wind erosion processes that are considered to estimate wind driven soil erosion in rangelands for integration with apex1905 in general mass flux equations developed for rangelands represent the horizontal sediment transport as a threshold controlled process where transport increases nonlinearly above the threshold shear velocity li et al 2014 we considered reported evaluation results in okin 2008 and li et al 2014 2013 while selecting methods to integrate with apex1905 additionally we considered the model type i e being processed based and data requirement i e being less data intensive as criteria consequently we selected models such as okin 2008 model for surface shear stress partitioning iverson and white 1982 model for threshold shear velocity gillette and passi 1988 model for horizontal sediment transport and shao et al 2011 for vertical particle transport in this study the combination of these models to estimate wind driven soil erosion in rangelands referred as landscape wind erosion lwe model below a brief description of each component in the lwe model and their process representation are provided 3 3 1 shear stress partitioning on vegetated surfaces vegetation and nonerodable surface elements modulate the spatial distribution of shear stress near the surface okin 2008 thereby considerably influencing aeolian transport therefore it reasons that varying vegetation would impact the surface roughness causing increased uncertainty in wind erosion modeling due to the inherent variability in the surface roughness estimation horizontal sediment transport q is a function of the wind shear velocity u on the land surface that is in excess of a threshold friction velocity u t gillette and passi 1988 aeolian transport models estimate u w by relating to the wind speed u at height z m and the aerodynamic roughness height z₀ m through the logarithmic wind profile which does not consider the effect of surface roughness due to vegetation growth okin 2008 proposed a model that explicitly treats variability in surface shear stress by utilizing vegetation gap distances to characterize erodible soil surfaces this model defines a landscape as a collection of vegetation gaps each scaled by the height of the upwind sheltering plant with a gamma probability distribution the model uses the probability distribution of vegetation gaps between plants to determine the probability that any point in the landscape is distant from the nearest plant in the upwind direction okin 2008 in addition this model assumes that each plant is associated with a reduced shear stress wake zone using an exponential curve relationship per eq 3 okin 2008 3 u u w u u w x 0 1 u u w x 0 1 e c x h where u is the shear velocity in the leeward of a plant m s 1 u u w x 0 is the ratio of u and u w in the immediate leeward of a plant shear velocity ratio c is the e folding distance for the recovery of the shear velocity u in the lee of plants to the value it would have in the absence of vegetation u w x is the distance to the nearest upwind plant m and h is the mean canopy height m the wind shear velocity without windbreak u w is formulated as a function of the mean wind speed u at the height z eq 4 4 u w 0 4 u l n z z 0 wherez₀ is the aerodynamic roughness length m the threshold shear velocity u t is the minimum shear velocity required to initiate the motion of soil particles this variable depends on soil texture soil moisture salt concentration surface crusting and surface roughness elements iversen and white 1982 noted the importance of interparticle forces cohesive forces in determining threshold friction velocity the threshold friction velocity for a dry condition u t dry is determined first and subsequently modified for soil moisture and roughness factors in this study iversen and white s approach is used as formulated in eq 5 5 u t d r y a n ρ p g d ρ a γ ρ a d where ρα and ρp are the air and particle density respectively d is particle diameter a n and γ are empirical coefficients to account for soil moisture we use fecan et al 1999 approach the modifier for soil moisture fw is computed by considering clay content and soil water content to account for the interstitial water space as follows 6 f w 1 f o r w w 1 1 21 w w 0 68 0 5 f o r w w 6 1 w h e r e w 0 0014 c l a y 2 0 17 c l a y where w is the mass fraction of soil moisture content 3 3 2 horizontal sediment transport generally wind driven sediment flux has two main pathways horizontal sedimen transport q and vertical particles transport f the horizontal sediment transport comprises mainly saltating particles with diameters from 20 to 500 µm saltation sized particles travel close to the soil surface redistributing surface soils across the landscape the transport of particles is initiated when the wind shear velocity exceeds the threshold friction velocity li et al 2013 compared the performance of several aeolian transport models in estimating the horizontal sediment flux they suggested that the method gillette and passi 1988 proposed provides a more accurate estimation of horizontal sediment transport than other methods therefore this method is being used in apex1905 eq 7 7 q d 1 f g c a ρ a g u 4 1 u t u u u t 0 u u t where a is a dimensionless constant that may vary between 0 and 1 and fgc is the fraction of ground cover by vegetation 3 3 3 vertical particle transport vertical particle transport refers to the suspension of particles less than 20 µm that is emitted when saltating particles sandblast the soil surface overcoming the strong inter particle forces between fine particles li et al 2013 shao 2004 shao et al 2011 unlike particles in the horizontal sediment transport vertical flux particles are transported long distances outside their source area li et al 2014 shao et al 2011 proposed a scheme to estimate vertical particle transport that considers saltation bombardment and the disintegration of aggregates in this approach vertical particle transport is proportional to the horizontal sediment flux in which the proportionality depends on soil texture and soil plastic pressure this strategy was evaluated using observation data from several locations globally shao 2004 shao et al 2011 we utilized the same equation in apex1905 to simulate the vertical particle transport as follows 8 f d i d c y η f i 1 y y σ p 1 σ m g q d u 2 where f d i d is the vertical particle transport rate of the particle size d i from the ith size bin generated by saltation of particles cy is a dimensionless vertical particle transport coefficient and η f i is the amount of vertical particles emitted from the ith vertical particle bin in relation to the parent soil characteristics represented in the fully disturbed particle size distribution soil particle size distribution varies depending on the destructive forces applied to the soil sample during analysis to circumvent this problem shao et al 2011 defined two limiting particle size distributions 1 minimally disturbed particle size distribution p m d the limiting case in which the parent soil sample is analyzed with no disturbance and 2 fully disturbed particle size distribution p f d the limiting case in which aggregates are broken up as much as possible by mechanical forces σp is the ratio between the amount of free vertical particles p m d and that of aggregated vertical particles p f d the bombardment efficiency σ m is the ratio between the mass of particles ejected by bombardment and the mass of impacting particles and is computed by 9 σ m 12 u 2 ρ b p 1 14 u ρ b p where ρ b is the soil bulk density kg m 3 and p is the soil plastic pressure pa ϒ is a function that describes how easily aggregated vertical particles can be released and estimated as 10 y e x p k u u t 1 14 ρ b p 3 4 coupling the landscape wind erosion modules with apex1905 the selected core wind erosion processes that are developed for rangelands see section 3 3 were written in fortran and added to the apex model s source code fig 3 illustrates apex s main inputs and lwe core processes and outputs for rangelands the new component enables apex1905 to simulate wind driven horizontal sediment and vertical particle transport on a continuous daily time step using high resolution wind speed and vegetation gap distribution data at multiple spatial scales the apex1905 model can use daily average wind speed inputs simulated soil moisture and vegetation characteristics i e mean plant height vegetation fraction of cover mean vegetation gap in areas where observed data are limited this makes apex1905 uniquely valuable in data scarce regions to evaluate the effects of land management practices on wind degraded lands being a daily time step model apex model in general requires model input data pertinent to weather and state variables to be daily values the main input requirements to simulate lwe within apex1905 are the daily wind speed distribution fraction of vegetation cover vegetation height and vegetation gaps distribution additionally the lwe module requires simulated daily soil moisture fraction in the topsoil layer i e 5 mm and soil characteristics related to soil texture and particle size distribution wind probability functions are developed from daily wind speed data in apex weather inputs as presented in section 3 3 1 changes in vegetation gaps are estimated based on two state variables of apex including plant population and leaf area index see section 3 3 2 the probabilistic approach in the lwe takes advantage of the process based wind erosion equations for simulating soil erosion in rangelands 3 4 1 mean based daily wind speed distribution wind speed is often reported as the daily mean value however wind erosion models require wind speed distribution and use a stochastic wind generator this study developed an empirical method to estimate the wind speed distribution using the gamma model with specified shape location and scale parameters for a given mean wind speed a database of gamma distribution parameters covering the u s derived from long term re analysis climate data was used to find empirical relationships between mean wind speed and the gamma parameters we discovered a strong statistical correlation between gamma parameters and mean wind speed based on data randomly selected at 3000 locations for example fig 4 presents relationships between the shape a and location b parameters of the gamma function and their mean wind speed values 3 4 2 computing vegetation gap distribution the distribution of vegetation gaps on the landscape is crucial to compute the partitioning of shear stresses in okin s approach okin 2008 as demonstrated in eq 9 the vegetation gap gact is estimated as a function of plant population and lai this approach determines the maximum possible gap length i e diameter by assuming a circular area that corresponds to the length of a subarea given the dynamics in the plant growth during a growing season we used an exponential decline curve to reduce the gap between plants within the annual growth cycle fig 5 in eq 11 the maximum plant density i e prescribed plant population is associated with the minimum gap length and vice versa 11 g a c t g d e n 1 exp 2 5 l a i a d j f a c t o r where gden denotes the average gap between plants based on plant population number of plants m 2 prescribed in apex l a i a d j f a c t o r is an adjustment factor that ranges between 0 start of the growing season and 1 at maturity and mainly depends on a plant development stage 3 5 plot scale apex1905 model setup and calibration procedures we configured the apex1905 for the study site fig 1 with a single subarea using unique elevation soil and land use data a modified soil conservation service scs curve number method usda scs 1972 estimated surface runoff the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was selected for estimating daily potential evapotranspiration rates the site had mixed native species including c4 grasses and perennial shrubs and two dominant species black grama grass and honey mesquite were selected for simulation in apex1905 the simulation was run for 27 years 1988 2014 for parameter establishment and is considered as a warm up period to stabilize plant growth and state variables before running the evaluation period initially the calibration was performed to capture overall water balances based on literature values in the area once the apex model simulated local water balances for example confirming the dominant part of the precipitation translated to evapotranspiration historical lai values translated from modis datasets were used to calibrate the seasonal variability of plant growth details we used measured vegetation gaps vegetation cover fraction and canopy heights to constrain plant growth within apex1905 further next before calibrating wind erosion parameters we conducted a parameter sensitivity analysis using a one factor at a time approach to quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of the horizontal sediment transport and vertical particles transport to lwe parameters table 1 presents the lwe parameters and their value ranges as well as selected parameter values used in the sensitivity analysis the lwe parameters were manually adjusted to match the simulated horizontal sediment transport to observed values during calibration the calibration of wind erosion was carried out using 29 data points of horizontal sediment transport measured in 2015 2017 in contrast since no measured vertical particle data were available representative literature values were used for vertical particle data the goodness of fit of the simulated horizontal sediment transport was tested against observed values using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and percent of bias the sensitivity analysis and calibration were conducted using the apex1905 model with the lwe module that runs on high resolution sub daily wind speed data and monthly vegetation gap distribution derived from monthly field measurements this model is referred to as the benchmark model with which the additional simulations of apex1905 will be compared to evaluate the reliability of lwe module in apex1905 while using daily mean wind speed and vegetation gap as an input outputs from apex1905 simulations were compared with benchmark apex1905 simulations it is worth underscoring that the only difference between the benchmark 1905 and apex1905 models is their input data for the lwe module 4 results and discussion 4 1 daily wind speed and vegetation gap distribution estimations for limited observed data availability to evaluate the mean based daily wind speed distribution computed by the empirical method described in section 3 3 1 we compared multiple dispersion and skewness values at four national wind erosion network sites fig 1 wind speed was monitored at 1 min intervals table 2 presents a statistical summary of wind speed distributions for wind speed measurements in 2016 it is notable that skewness coefficients of the wind speed distribution calculated for the mean based approach range between 1 47 and 1 57 these values are comparable to observation based skewness values i e ranging from 1 37 to 1 86 it is worth noting that the statistical measures for variation and skewness from the observation and mean based methods are comparable indicating that the mean based approach can reasonably reproduce the probability distribution of daily wind speed fig 5 shows the simulated vegetation gap and lai relationship in a single year the measured mean vegetation gap ranges 0 6 m 1 0 m between 2015 and 2017 while the simulated gap ranges from 0 8 to 1 m for the same period indicating that the apex1905 simulated the mean vegetation gap for the study site is acceptable 4 2 sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 parameters related to sediment transport surface roughness height is a key parameter that strongly influences the distribution of surface shear stresses fig 6 therefore it is considerably influential in estimating horizontal sediment transport this entails that in a heterogeneous landscape the spatio temporal non linear response of shear stress to the surface roughness height makes it harder to determine a reliable representative quantity of horizontal sediment transport and can be a source of uncertainty fig 7 a depicts the effect of surface roughness height z₀ scaling factor a e folding distance for the recovery of the shear velocity c and shear velocity ratio in the immediate lee of a plant u u w x 0 selected parameter values ranging from lower par1 to higher par5 with respect to simulated horizontal sediment transport for instance roughness height values range from 10 7 to 10 1 m and the horizontal sediment transport estimates corresponding to these values range between 102 and 104 gd 1m 1 this demonstrates a strong sensitivity of the horizontal sediment transport to the surface roughness height parameter which is further highlighted by large ranges of rmse values in fig 7 b i e 0 53 to 1 24 gd 1m 1 the scaling factor a showed a linear pattern on the simulated horizontal sediment as shown in fig 7 a the changes in the exponential recovery rate for the shear velocity in the lee of a plant c from low to high values had an inverse relationship with simulated horizontal sediment transport as shown in fig 7 a the shear velocity ratio in the lee of a plant was less sensitive than other parameters yet an increase in shear ratio value increased horizontal sediment transport as shown in fig 7 a 4 2 2 parameters related to vertical particle transport vertical particles transport rate is proportional to streamwise saltation flux but the proportionality depends on soil texture and soil plastic pressure shao 2004 fig 8 shows low values of soil plastic pressure loose soils that tended to result in high vertical particle transport estimates the influence of the soil plastic pressure on selected values above 10 000 pa was minimal on simulated vertical particle transport the vertical particle transport coefficient and the shape factor for particle size distribution parameters strongly influenced the vertical particles transport fig 8 as suggested by shao et al 2011 a significant kappa coefficient value represents a soil with particle coats and aggregates which are easily broken while a small kappa value represents the opposite 4 3 evaluation of calibrated model performance hydrologic monitoring data at the location were unavailable to evaluate simulated outputs directly therefore we conducted a qualitative evaluation of the model table 3 lists apex1905 parameters that were calibrated manually the calibrated apex1905 model results indicated that a considerable portion of annual precipitation i e 88 returns to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration this is in agreement with templeton et al 2014 in which the authors noted a strong correlation between precipitation and evapotranspiration during summer months in the study area similarly a robust linear relationship r 0 82 was found between precipitation and simulated evapotranspiration indicating that the manually calibrated apex1905 model performed well on estimating water balances for the study field fig 9 the model suggested that the study field had low surface runoff volume which is well supported by hydrologic properties of the area such as sandy soil texture having high infiltration potential and a low slope gradient in general simulated hydrologic outputs from the apex1905 were consistent with underlying controlling factors and reported values in the region for the routine developed and keeping the parameters within acceptable ranges fig 10 depicts the comparison of simulated monthly lai with observed lai from modis from 2015 through 2017 overall the apex1905 simulated monthly lai dynamics matched well with modis lai r 0 86 and their agreement further improved when aggregated seasonally the apex1905 model over under estimates the peak minimum lai values compared to the modis estimates during the summer winter months the modis lai data has a 500 m pixel size while the jornada experimental range site has a 100 m by 100 m plot size thus the lai estimation error may be partly attributable to the difference in the spatial scale of sampling domains between simulated and observed values scarcity of local hydrologic data due to low rainfall under an arid and semi arid climate was a prodigious challenge in calibrating the apex1905 on water balances and plant growth simulation however these modeling simulations demonstrated that the apex1905 performance is acceptable after keeping parameters within viable parameter value ranges even with limited observation data the ability to simulate local soil moisture dynamics and plant growth responses to local weather in an arid climate is a key feature of apex1905 as a wind erosion simulator this new development accounts for local weather soil and vegetation conditions in simulating aeolian transport processes furthermore the holistic model approach of the apex1905 enables model users to evaluate the effect of various land management practices on wind erosion fig 11 compares observed and simulated horizontal sediment transport between 2015 and 2017 the calibrated benchmark model explains 58 of the observed variability in the horizontal sediment transport with low bias 2 6 indicating a good simulation it is evident from the measured data that the study area has a considerable temporal dynamic in horizontal sediment transports ranging from 2 to 1305 g m 1 d 1 there is a comparable range in the lwe benchmark model simulated with the horizontal sediment transports 9 1393 g m 1 d 1 for the same period indicating the capacity of the apex1905 to simulate sediment flux under extreme conditions in rangelands the monthly average vertical particle transport rate ranges from close to 0 0 to 0 38 g m 2 d 1 and the average is 0 081 g m 2 d 1 these estimates are comparable to reported vertical particle transport estimates for the cactus flats monitoring site new mexico of 0 015 g m 2 d 1 shrubland and 0 0083 g m 2 d 1 grassland g m 2 d 1 breshears et al 2003 4 4 comparison of the benchmark model with apex1905 as described in section 3 3 the sole difference between the lwe benchmark model and apex1905 used to simulate the jornada experimental range site data is the temporal resolution of time series input data with the latter being much coarser fig 12 illustrates simulated horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport using the lwe benchmark model and apex1905 despite less data intense inputs than the benchmark model the apex1905 reproduced both the horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport well without further refining parameters the results are r2 of 0 77 and 0 81 respectively the biases in apex1905 are low with rmse less than 1 0 given the substantial simplification and approximation in the input data preparation the apex1905 model was not expected to replicate measured horizontal sediment transport from individual wind erosion events however the model simulated monthly and annual average sediment transports as shown in figs 12 and 13 in fig 13 simulated average annual horizontal sediment transports from 2002 to 2017 lay within the observed interquartile range iqr indicating the reliability of the model output in simulating long term periods 4 5 benefits of the enhanced apex1905 model to simulate landscape wind erosion in rangelands continuous simulation of horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport using a stand alone aeolian erosion model e g okin 2008 often requires detailed field properties such as vegetation height canopy gap vegetation cover fraction soil moisture condition and wind speed distribution which is uncommon in the u s monitoring these properties for long periods is expensive and labor intensive the gaps in data availability make it worthwhile to integrate a landscape scale wind erosion model into the apex1905 agro hydrological watershed model the integrated model offers a cost effective tool to simulate horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle without intensive data collection fig 14 presents the mean canopy gap mean vegetation height and vegetation cover fraction estimated by apex1905 for the jornada experimental range site the model simulation shows a relatively big canopy gap and small vegetation cover during the winter than during growing seasons in summer and fall although grasses show seasonal variation in canopy height the simulated canopy height presents little temporal variability this is attributed to the minimal variation of canopy height for matured honey mesquite trees that grow interspersed with black grama grasses the apex1905 model provides the capability to simulate long term vertical particle transport as shown in fig 15 as expected estimated vertical particle transport is significantly driven by wind speed in the long term the years with high wind speed generally had high vertical particle transport rates 4 6 limitations and future research in this study the apex1905 model was evaluated at the usda ars new mexico jornada experimental range national wind erosion network site availability of additional data would ensure its applicability and reliability on simulating aeolian transport processes under a wide range of climatic conditions as more data becomes available the apex1905 model could be a valuable tool to evaluate the efficacy of land management practices on controlling wind erosion as a decision aid for land managers and policymakers for both croplands and rangelands 5 conclusion this study presented an integration of landscape wind erosion lwe processes to the apex model for simulating wind driven horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport for rangelands for the integration we selected aeolian modeling schemes that are process based and require minimal data because aeolian data are scarce in the united states and other countries the model s capabilities were evaluated using measured data and ranges for their representative parameters were identified we also tested the apex1905 simulated horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport against the benchmark model overall the benchmark model could reproduce 58 of the observed horizontal sediment transport variability between 2015 and 2017 with an rmse of 2 6 although the apex1905 was not expected to capture intra day variability in measured horizontal sediment transport due to daily averaging in wind speed and gap distribution data the model simulated horizontal and vertical particle transport well compared with the benchmark model r2 0 77 and 0 81 respectively the performance metric of the apex1905 model improved when outputs were evaluated at the monthly or the annual time scale suggesting that apex1905 can be helpful to assess long term land management practices and restoration efforts as well as climatic impacts at a coarse time interval the enhanced apex model can be applied to any rangeland to simulate soil erosion driven by winds this model is a crucial application tool in rangelands where monitoring vegetation characteristics soil moisture and sub daily wind speed is limited labor intensive and expensive reliable and comprehensive modeling tools provide a means to understand the implications of rangeland soil erosion and or land use change and evaluate the effect of various soil and water management practices and environmental policies simulation models help acquire critical insights on the environmental impacts of alternative management or climate change over different periods the integration of aeolian processes to account for landscape wind erosion on rangelands into the apex model will provide model users and land and policy managers with

24469,rangelands provide vital ecosystem services and comprise 36 of u s and 25 of world lands approximately 20 to 73 of these rangelands are already degraded soil erosion driven by winds is a significant cause of this degradation minimal work has been done to evaluate the influence of wind erosion on rangeland dominated landscapes or to assess the effect of landscape scale soil and water conservation and management practices on reducing wind erosion due to its inherent complexity and nonpoint source nature our approach is to use an integrated and holistic eco hydrologic model the main objective of this study is to integrate process based landscape wind erosion modeling schemes into the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model version 1905 apex1905 for simulating horizontal aeolian sediment transport and vertical particles transport on rangelands we demonstrate the performance and capability of the model using field data collected at the usda ars jornada experimental range in new mexico u s a benchmark apex1905 model that runs on high resolution sub daily wind speed data and daily average vegetation gap distribution derived from monthly field measurements the benchmark apex1905 model captured the variability in observed aeolian sediment transport during 2015 2017 reasonably well with an r2 0 58 and a rmse 2 60 when the highly variable sub daily measured wind speed and vegetation gap distribution data were substituted with the daily average wind speed and apex1905 estimated daily vegetation gap the apex1905 reproduced well the benchmark model estimates with the performance statistic of r2 0 77 and rmse 0 54 for the horizontal aeolian sediment transport and r2 0 82 and rmse 0 85 for vertical particle transport overall provided limited aeolian watershed data sets the apex1905 is demonstrated to be reliable in estimating wind erosion in arid desert rangeland landscapes using daily average wind speed and simulated vegetation characteristics benefiting from the long established algorithms of simulating plant growth dynamics and topsoil moisture content in apex apex1905 offers a robust and process based estimation of wind erosion in areas where wind and vegetation data are scarce keywords wind erosion simulation model coupling evaluation rangelands apex 1 introduction rangelands claim 36 of the united states jones et al 2018 and provide vital ecosystem services including water mineral and wood resources livestock grazing wildlife habitat recreation and archeological artifacts deleterious impairments of the rangeland environment such as soil degradation overgrazing desertification and reduced ecosystem services are a significant risk to the sustainability of rangelands in the united states an assessment by the u s department of agriculture natural resource conservation service usda nrcs suggests that approximately 21 of 160 million hectares of rangelands in the western u s has been degraded to some degree herrick et al 2010 based on a worldwide literature review weltz et al 2014 determined that wind erosion is a major contributing factor to rangeland erosion sediment loss and soil degradation duniway et al al 2019 stated that disturbances including fire domestic livestock grazing and off highway vehicles substantially increased horizontal aeolian flux and exacerbated dryland degradation on public rangelands wind driven soil loss and sediment redistribution processes influence ecosystem dynamics and alter the provision of ecosystem services natural resource managers face enormous challenges in managing wind erosion effects because their impacts are widespread across spatial scales and data are sparse pressures on land uses and development make it difficult to anticipate wind erosion potentials and manage risks webb et al 2017 in this regard reliable wind erosion models can provide means to monitor and predict how contributing factors affect wind erosion and assist with the implementation of conservation policies jarrah et al 2020 key physical processes that drive aeolian soil particle transport on rangelands are wind erosion occurs when the shear velocity of wind exceeds a threshold value at which particles start to get detached from the soil surface modeling approaches have been developed separately for rangelands due to the extent the factors affect erosion rates including 1 soil physical and chemical properties 2 roughness elements e g vegetation types and their spatial distribution patterns and 3 management practices that can differ greatly between rangelands and croplands li et al 2014 recently jarrah et al 2020 reviewed 12 widely used wind erosion models for cropland systems based on their data requirements process representations and applicability their review highlighted despite the improvements of wind erosion models from being empirical to process based their application is limited to agricultural fields for example the wind erosion prediction system weps fryrear et al 1991 wagner 2013 is a process based daily time step model that simulates weather field conditions and wind erosion on croplands in its current model structure weps model has limitations for applications in rolling terrain such as rangelands and requires a complex large topographic database preparation hagen 2004 jarrah et al 2020 tatarko et al 2016 on the other hand as presented in li et al 2014 2013 there are several rangeland wind erosion models that represent the horizontal sediment transport as a threshold controlled process where transport increases nonlinearly above the threshold shear velocity vegetation structural complexity and spatial scale are some of the factors that makes rangeland wind erosion modeling not trivial okin 2008 developed a new model that utilizes vegetation gap size to characterize the surface and thus explicitly accounts for spatial variability in the shear stress experienced by the soil li et al 2013 parameterized and validated the okin s wind erosion model on a variety of sites ranging from shrubby grassland to grassland and shrubland including both degraded and undegraded plant communities they reported that okin s wind erosion model was able to explain 45 of the observed horizontal sediment transport n 65 indicating the reliability of the model for rangeland wind erosion assessment our study proposes to dynamically link a processed based aeolian transport model to the agricultural policy environmental extender apex model williams et al 2008 for estimating daily landscape wind erosion in rangelands the apex model is a continuous process based agro hydrological model for simulating the impact of land management on environmental quality at various spatial scales plot watershed and regional scale the apex model has been developed and updated since its inception with advances in technological development process knowledge and many case studies with physical data as best possible gassman et al 2010 the apex model is publicly available and gets used and tested extensively in the u s and worldwide the apex model simulates surface subsurface hydrology and water quality production sustainable growth and competition of a wide range of crops grasses trees shrubs among several environmental variables choi et al 2017 gassman et al 2010 kamruzzaman et al 2020 mudgal et al 2010 saleh et al 2004 wang et al 2006 2008 2014 recent advances in apex code in rangeland simulation make apex a suitable model for evaluating land management effects on soil degradation water quality and plant communities in rangeland watersheds wang et al 2014 zilverberg et al 2017 2018 cheng et al 2021 the current version of apex version 1501 simulates wind erosion using the wind erosion continuous simulation wecs williams et al 2008 model on smooth bare soils using daily wind speed distribution utilizing the skidmore 1986 erosion equation the wecs method estimates actual soil erosion by adjusting the amount of potential erosion that includes four factors related to soil properties surface roughness plant cover and unsheltered distance across the field in the dominant wind direction without new updates the existing apex model has limitations for application in rangelands first the model is empirical and developed for agricultural system potter et al 1998 second it is data intensive and requires field properties such as ridge height and random surface height that are often difficult to measure on natural landscapes we argue that enhancing apex model capability for simulating wind erosion across different landcover types will be significantly beneficial because the model is being widely applied in cropland choi et al 2017 wang et al 2008 2006 and natural landscape cheng et al 2021 kim et al 2020 wang et al 2014 zilverberg et al 2018 additionally apex simulates landscape processes that strongly influence soil erosion including soil moisture dynamics plant growth and land management practices this is crucial to estimate wind erosion since collection of samples for soil and vegetation characteristics are often expensive and labor intensive coupling the landscape wind erosion model developed for rangeland ecosystems with apex can improve the estimation of soil loss including the effects of land management practices on rangelands the main objective of this research is the integration of landscape wind erosion processes into the apex hereafter referred to as apex1905 model for estimating the rate of horizontal and vertical sediment transport in rangelands 2 description of the study site and input data the study site is part of both the long term agro ecosystem research ltar network https ltar ars usda gov sites and the national wind erosion network nwen https winderosionnetwork org network sites the jornada experimental range jer is located within the jornada basin in new mexico at an elevation of 1323 m above sea level fig

temperature at the study site based on 57 years of data seventy percent of the annual rainfall occurs from june through october fig 2a the vegetation comprises diverse community native species warm season c4 grasses perennial forbs and shrubs the grasses include dropseeds tobosa grass black grama and burrograss and are interspersed throughout the site along with moderately sized honey mesquite shrubs and scattered soaptree yucca the remote sensing based lai data from nasa 2002 2017 provides that the vegetation growth follows the region s seasonal rainfall distribution pattern the maximum lai values are observed in august and september fig 2b soil textures are primarily sandy loam to fine sandy loam the weather station provides wind speed data at 1 min intervals for heights ranging

august 2015 to december 2017 as it occurs wind erosion data are measured using the modified wilson and cooke mwac sampler goossens 2000 webb et al al 2015 provide the details about protocols on wind driven sediment flux measurements within the nwen a total of 27 mwac stems are distributed spatially across the site to monitor wind driven soil erosion fig 1 we acquired all the measured data related to wind erosion modeling from usda ars las cruces new mexico nicholas webb personal communication on november 30 2018 remote sensing based lai data were obtained from modis for 2002 2017 to calibrate the plant growth simulation in the apex1905 model 3 methods 3 1 apex model description apex is a process based agricultural and hydrologic model for simulating the impacts of land management on a variety of spatial and temporal scales williams et al 2008 williams et al 2008 described 12 principal components of the model including climate hydrology crop growth wind and water erosion nutrient cycling grazing and land management practices the model operates daily but can run a sub daily time step for rainfall runoff calculation and can simulate hundreds of years a watershed is divided into subareas in apex to achieve homogeneity concerning soil properties land use and management the apex model allows the user to configure a channel network and water bodies between subareas the channel routing module provides hydrologic routing and dynamic interactions between subareas involving surface runoff return flow sediment deposition and degradation chemical transport and groundwater return flow these hydrologic components encompass all critical processes that occur in the hydrologic cycle of the watershed williams et al 2008 wang et al 2012 recently the groundwater simulation in apex is enhanced by integrating with modflow a three dimensional physically based distributed finite difference groundwater model for variably saturated subsurface systems bailey et al 2021 plant canopies can intercept incoming precipitation the sum of the precipitation snowmelt water and or irrigation input is partitioned between surface runoff and soil infiltration thereby increasing the soil moisture content of the top layer of the root zone soil water is routed vertically and laterally based on soil hydraulic properties soil evaporation and plant root uptake drainage pipes often implemented in soils with a shallow groundwater table accelerate lateral drainage of excess soil water apex offers multiple options for simulating water transport processes for example five potential evapotranspiration equations six water erosion methods two peak runoff rate equations among others are available the apex plant growth module enables the growth and competition of multiple species within a plant community root zone competition includes water and nutrients while surface competition depends on solar radiation daily weather water and nutrients the user can prescribe plant population number of plants m2 for all perennial and annual plants the number of plants ha for trees 3 2 existing wind erosion model in apex for croplands the current wind erosion model in apex wind erosion continuous simulation wecs is an empirical approach and developed to simulate soil loss in agricultural management systems williams et al 2008 this model estimates potential wind erosion for a smooth bare soil surface by integrating the erosion equation through a day using the wind speed distribution eventually the potential erosion rate eq 1 is adjusted using four main controlling factors

greater than a threshold velocity more details about the computation of each factor is provided in williams et al 2008 and potter et al 1998 3 3 description of selected rangeland wind erosion equations for integration in apex this section provides a brief description of the main wind erosion processes that are considered to estimate wind driven soil erosion in rangelands for integration with apex1905 in general mass flux equations developed for rangelands represent the horizontal sediment transport as a threshold controlled process where transport increases nonlinearly above the threshold shear velocity li et al 2014 we considered reported evaluation results in okin 2008 and li et al 2014 2013 while selecting methods to integrate with apex1905 additionally we considered the model type i e being processed based and data requirement i e being less data intensive as criteria consequently we selected models such as okin 2008 model for surface shear stress partitioning iverson and white 1982 model for threshold shear velocity gillette and passi 1988 model for horizontal sediment transport and shao et al 2011 for vertical particle transport in this study the combination of these models to estimate wind driven soil erosion in rangelands referred as landscape wind erosion lwe model below a brief description of each component in the lwe model and their process representation are provided 3 3 1 shear stress partitioning on vegetated surfaces vegetation and nonerodable surface elements modulate the spatial distribution of shear stress near the surface okin 2008 thereby considerably influencing aeolian transport therefore it reasons that varying vegetation would impact the surface roughness causing increased uncertainty in wind erosion modeling due to the inherent variability in the surface roughness estimation horizontal sediment transport q is a function of the wind shear velocity u on the land surface that is in excess of a threshold friction velocity u t gillette and passi 1988 aeolian transport models estimate u w by relating to the wind speed u at height z m and the aerodynamic roughness height z₀ m through the logarithmic wind profile which does not consider the effect of surface roughness due to vegetation growth okin 2008 proposed a model that explicitly treats variability in surface shear stress by utilizing vegetation gap distances to characterize erodible soil surfaces this model defines a landscape as a collection of vegetation gaps each scaled by the height of the upwind sheltering plant with a gamma probability distribution the model uses the probability distribution of vegetation gaps between plants to determine the probability that any point in the landscape is distant from the nearest plant in the upwind direction okin 2008 in addition this model assumes that each plant is associated with a reduced shear stress wake zone using an exponential curve relationship per eq 3 okin 2008 3 u u w u u w x 0 1 u u w x 0 1 e c x h where u is the shear velocity in the leeward of a plant m s 1 u u w x 0 is the ratio of u and u w in the immediate leeward of a plant shear velocity ratio c is the e folding distance for the recovery of the shear velocity u in the lee of plants to the value it would have in the absence of vegetation u w x is the distance to the nearest upwind plant m and h is the mean canopy height m the wind shear velocity without windbreak u w is formulated as a function of the mean wind speed u at the height z eq 4 4 u w 0 4 u l n z z 0 wherez₀ is the aerodynamic roughness length m the threshold shear velocity u t is the minimum shear velocity required to initiate the motion of soil particles this variable depends on soil texture soil moisture salt concentration surface crusting and surface roughness elements iversen and white 1982 noted the importance of interparticle forces cohesive forces in determining threshold friction velocity the threshold friction velocity for a dry condition u t dry is determined first and subsequently modified for soil moisture and roughness factors in this study iversen and white s approach is used as formulated in eq 5 5 u t d r y a n ρ p g d ρ a γ ρ a d where ρα and ρp are the air and particle density respectively d is particle diameter a n and γ are empirical coefficients to account for soil moisture we use fecan et al 1999 approach the modifier for soil moisture fw is computed by considering clay content and soil water content to account for the interstitial water space as follows 6 f w 1 f o r w w 1 1 21 w w 0 68 0 5 f o r w w 6 1 w h e r e w 0 0014 c l a y 2 0 17 c l a y where w is the mass fraction of soil moisture content 3 3 2 horizontal sediment transport generally wind driven sediment flux has two main pathways horizontal sedimen transport q and vertical particles transport f the horizontal sediment transport comprises mainly saltating particles with diameters from 20 to 500 µm saltation sized particles travel close to the soil surface redistributing surface soils across the landscape the transport of particles is initiated when the wind shear velocity exceeds the threshold friction velocity li et al 2013 compared the performance of several aeolian transport models in estimating the horizontal sediment flux they suggested that the method gillette and passi 1988 proposed provides a more accurate estimation of horizontal sediment transport than other methods therefore this method is being used in apex1905 eq 7 7 q d 1 f g c a ρ a g u 4 1 u t u u u t 0 u u t where a is a dimensionless constant that may vary between 0 and 1 and fgc is the fraction of ground cover by vegetation 3 3 3 vertical particle transport vertical particle transport refers to the suspension of particles less than 20 µm that is emitted when saltating particles sandblast the soil surface overcoming the strong inter particle forces between fine particles li et al 2013 shao 2004 shao et al 2011 unlike particles in the horizontal sediment transport vertical flux particles are transported long distances outside their source area li et al 2014 shao et al 2011 proposed a scheme to estimate vertical particle transport that considers saltation bombardment and the disintegration of aggregates in this approach vertical particle transport is proportional to the horizontal sediment flux in which the proportionality depends on soil texture and soil plastic pressure this strategy was evaluated using observation data from several locations globally shao 2004 shao et al 2011 we utilized the same equation in apex1905 to simulate the vertical particle transport as follows 8 f d i d c y η f i 1 y y σ p 1 σ m g q d u 2 where f d i d is the vertical particle transport rate of the particle size d i from the ith size bin generated by saltation of particles cy is a dimensionless vertical particle transport coefficient and η f i is the amount of vertical particles emitted from the ith vertical particle bin in relation to the parent soil characteristics represented in the fully disturbed particle size distribution soil particle size distribution varies depending on the destructive forces applied to the soil sample during analysis to circumvent this problem shao et al 2011 defined two limiting particle size distributions 1 minimally disturbed particle size distribution p m d the limiting case in which the parent soil sample is analyzed with no disturbance and 2 fully disturbed particle size distribution p f d the limiting case in which aggregates are broken up as much as possible by mechanical forces σp is the ratio between the amount of free vertical particles p m d and that of aggregated vertical particles p f d the bombardment efficiency σ m is the ratio between the mass of particles ejected by bombardment and the mass of impacting particles and is computed by 9 σ m 12 u 2 ρ b p 1 14 u ρ b p where ρ b is the soil bulk density kg m 3 and p is the soil plastic pressure pa ϒ is a function that describes how easily aggregated vertical particles can be released and estimated as 10 y e x p k u u t 1 14 ρ b p 3 4 coupling the landscape wind erosion modules with apex1905 the selected core wind erosion processes that are developed for rangelands see section 3 3 were written in fortran and added to the apex model s source code fig 3 illustrates apex s main inputs and lwe core processes and outputs for rangelands the new component enables apex1905 to simulate wind driven horizontal sediment and vertical particle transport on a continuous daily time step using high resolution wind speed and vegetation gap distribution data at multiple spatial scales the apex1905 model can use daily average wind speed inputs simulated soil moisture and vegetation characteristics i e mean plant height vegetation fraction of cover mean vegetation gap in areas where observed data are limited this makes apex1905 uniquely valuable in data scarce regions to evaluate the effects of land management practices on wind degraded lands being a daily time step model apex model in general requires model input data pertinent to weather and state variables to be daily values the main input requirements to simulate lwe within apex1905 are the daily wind speed distribution fraction of vegetation cover vegetation height and vegetation gaps distribution additionally the lwe module requires simulated daily soil moisture fraction in the topsoil layer i e 5 mm and soil characteristics related to soil texture and particle size distribution wind probability functions are developed from daily wind speed data in apex weather inputs as presented in section 3 3 1 changes in vegetation gaps are estimated based on two state variables of apex including plant population and leaf area index see section 3 3 2 the probabilistic approach in the lwe takes advantage of the process based wind erosion equations for simulating soil erosion in rangelands 3 4 1 mean based daily wind speed distribution wind speed is often reported as the daily mean value however wind erosion models require wind speed distribution and use a stochastic wind generator this study developed an empirical method to estimate the wind speed distribution using the gamma model with specified shape location and scale parameters for a given mean wind speed a database of gamma distribution parameters covering the u s derived from long term re analysis climate data was used to find empirical relationships between mean wind speed and the gamma parameters we discovered a strong statistical correlation between gamma parameters and mean wind speed based on data randomly selected at 3000 locations for example fig 4 presents relationships between the shape a and location b parameters of the gamma function and their mean wind speed values 3 4 2 computing vegetation gap distribution the distribution of vegetation gaps on the landscape is crucial to compute the partitioning of shear stresses in okin s approach okin 2008 as demonstrated in eq 9 the vegetation gap gact is estimated as a function of plant population and lai this approach determines the maximum possible gap length i e diameter by assuming a circular area that corresponds to the length of a subarea given the dynamics in the plant growth during a growing season we used an exponential decline curve to reduce the gap between plants within the annual growth cycle fig 5 in eq 11 the maximum plant density i e prescribed plant population is associated with the minimum gap length and vice versa 11 g a c t g d e n 1 exp 2 5 l a i a d j f a c t o r where gden denotes the average gap between plants based on plant population number of plants m 2 prescribed in apex l a i a d j f a c t o r is an adjustment factor that ranges between 0 start of the growing season and 1 at maturity and mainly depends on a plant development stage 3 5 plot scale apex1905 model setup and calibration procedures we configured the apex1905 for the study site fig 1 with a single subarea using unique elevation soil and land use data a modified soil conservation service scs curve number method usda scs 1972 estimated surface runoff the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 was selected for estimating daily potential evapotranspiration rates the site had mixed native species including c4 grasses and perennial shrubs and two dominant species black grama grass and honey mesquite were selected for simulation in apex1905 the simulation was run for 27 years 1988 2014 for parameter establishment and is considered as a warm up period to stabilize plant growth and state variables before running the evaluation period initially the calibration was performed to capture overall water balances based on literature values in the area once the apex model simulated local water balances for example confirming the dominant part of the precipitation translated to evapotranspiration historical lai values translated from modis datasets were used to calibrate the seasonal variability of plant growth details we used measured vegetation gaps vegetation cover fraction and canopy heights to constrain plant growth within apex1905 further next before calibrating wind erosion parameters we conducted a parameter sensitivity analysis using a one factor at a time approach to quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of the horizontal sediment transport and vertical particles transport to lwe parameters table 1 presents the lwe parameters and their value ranges as well as selected parameter values used in the sensitivity analysis the lwe parameters were manually adjusted to match the simulated horizontal sediment transport to observed values during calibration the calibration of wind erosion was carried out using 29 data points of horizontal sediment transport measured in 2015 2017 in contrast since no measured vertical particle data were available representative literature values were used for vertical particle data the goodness of fit of the simulated horizontal sediment transport was tested against observed values using the coefficient of determination r2 root mean squared error rmse and percent of bias the sensitivity analysis and calibration were conducted using the apex1905 model with the lwe module that runs on high resolution sub daily wind speed data and monthly vegetation gap distribution derived from monthly field measurements this model is referred to as the benchmark model with which the additional simulations of apex1905 will be compared to evaluate the reliability of lwe module in apex1905 while using daily mean wind speed and vegetation gap as an input outputs from apex1905 simulations were compared with benchmark apex1905 simulations it is worth underscoring that the only difference between the benchmark 1905 and apex1905 models is their input data for the lwe module 4 results and discussion 4 1 daily wind speed and vegetation gap distribution estimations for limited observed data availability to evaluate the mean based daily wind speed distribution computed by the empirical method described in section 3 3 1 we compared multiple dispersion and skewness values at four national wind erosion network sites fig 1 wind speed was monitored at 1 min intervals table 2 presents a statistical summary of wind speed distributions for wind speed measurements in 2016 it is notable that skewness coefficients of the wind speed distribution calculated for the mean based approach range between 1 47 and 1 57 these values are comparable to observation based skewness values i e ranging from 1 37 to 1 86 it is worth noting that the statistical measures for variation and skewness from the observation and mean based methods are comparable indicating that the mean based approach can reasonably reproduce the probability distribution of daily wind speed fig 5 shows the simulated vegetation gap and lai relationship in a single year the measured mean vegetation gap ranges 0 6 m 1 0 m between 2015 and 2017 while the simulated gap ranges from 0 8 to 1 m for the same period indicating that the apex1905 simulated the mean vegetation gap for the study site is acceptable 4 2 sensitivity analysis 4 2 1 parameters related to sediment transport surface roughness height is a key parameter that strongly influences the distribution of surface shear stresses fig 6 therefore it is considerably influential in estimating horizontal sediment transport this entails that in a heterogeneous landscape the spatio temporal non linear response of shear stress to the surface roughness height makes it harder to determine a reliable representative quantity of horizontal sediment transport and can be a source of uncertainty fig 7 a depicts the effect of surface roughness height z₀ scaling factor a e folding distance for the recovery of the shear velocity c and shear velocity ratio in the immediate lee of a plant u u w x 0 selected parameter values ranging from lower par1 to higher par5 with respect to simulated horizontal sediment transport for instance roughness height values range from 10 7 to 10 1 m and the horizontal sediment transport estimates corresponding to these values range between 102 and 104 gd 1m 1 this demonstrates a strong sensitivity of the horizontal sediment transport to the surface roughness height parameter which is further highlighted by large ranges of rmse values in fig 7 b i e 0 53 to 1 24 gd 1m 1 the scaling factor a showed a linear pattern on the simulated horizontal sediment as shown in fig 7 a the changes in the exponential recovery rate for the shear velocity in the lee of a plant c from low to high values had an inverse relationship with simulated horizontal sediment transport as shown in fig 7 a the shear velocity ratio in the lee of a plant was less sensitive than other parameters yet an increase in shear ratio value increased horizontal sediment transport as shown in fig 7 a 4 2 2 parameters related to vertical particle transport vertical particles transport rate is proportional to streamwise saltation flux but the proportionality depends on soil texture and soil plastic pressure shao 2004 fig 8 shows low values of soil plastic pressure loose soils that tended to result in high vertical particle transport estimates the influence of the soil plastic pressure on selected values above 10 000 pa was minimal on simulated vertical particle transport the vertical particle transport coefficient and the shape factor for particle size distribution parameters strongly influenced the vertical particles transport fig 8 as suggested by shao et al 2011 a significant kappa coefficient value represents a soil with particle coats and aggregates which are easily broken while a small kappa value represents the opposite 4 3 evaluation of calibrated model performance hydrologic monitoring data at the location were unavailable to evaluate simulated outputs directly therefore we conducted a qualitative evaluation of the model table 3 lists apex1905 parameters that were calibrated manually the calibrated apex1905 model results indicated that a considerable portion of annual precipitation i e 88 returns to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration this is in agreement with templeton et al 2014 in which the authors noted a strong correlation between precipitation and evapotranspiration during summer months in the study area similarly a robust linear relationship r 0 82 was found between precipitation and simulated evapotranspiration indicating that the manually calibrated apex1905 model performed well on estimating water balances for the study field fig 9 the model suggested that the study field had low surface runoff volume which is well supported by hydrologic properties of the area such as sandy soil texture having high infiltration potential and a low slope gradient in general simulated hydrologic outputs from the apex1905 were consistent with underlying controlling factors and reported values in the region for the routine developed and keeping the parameters within acceptable ranges fig 10 depicts the comparison of simulated monthly lai with observed lai from modis from 2015 through 2017 overall the apex1905 simulated monthly lai dynamics matched well with modis lai r 0 86 and their agreement further improved when aggregated seasonally the apex1905 model over under estimates the peak minimum lai values compared to the modis estimates during the summer winter months the modis lai data has a 500 m pixel size while the jornada experimental range site has a 100 m by 100 m plot size thus the lai estimation error may be partly attributable to the difference in the spatial scale of sampling domains between simulated and observed values scarcity of local hydrologic data due to low rainfall under an arid and semi arid climate was a prodigious challenge in calibrating the apex1905 on water balances and plant growth simulation however these modeling simulations demonstrated that the apex1905 performance is acceptable after keeping parameters within viable parameter value ranges even with limited observation data the ability to simulate local soil moisture dynamics and plant growth responses to local weather in an arid climate is a key feature of apex1905 as a wind erosion simulator this new development accounts for local weather soil and vegetation conditions in simulating aeolian transport processes furthermore the holistic model approach of the apex1905 enables model users to evaluate the effect of various land management practices on wind erosion fig 11 compares observed and simulated horizontal sediment transport between 2015 and 2017 the calibrated benchmark model explains 58 of the observed variability in the horizontal sediment transport with low bias 2 6 indicating a good simulation it is evident from the measured data that the study area has a considerable temporal dynamic in horizontal sediment transports ranging from 2 to 1305 g m 1 d 1 there is a comparable range in the lwe benchmark model simulated with the horizontal sediment transports 9 1393 g m 1 d 1 for the same period indicating the capacity of the apex1905 to simulate sediment flux under extreme conditions in rangelands the monthly average vertical particle transport rate ranges from close to 0 0 to 0 38 g m 2 d 1 and the average is 0 081 g m 2 d 1 these estimates are comparable to reported vertical particle transport estimates for the cactus flats monitoring site new mexico of 0 015 g m 2 d 1 shrubland and 0 0083 g m 2 d 1 grassland g m 2 d 1 breshears et al 2003 4 4 comparison of the benchmark model with apex1905 as described in section 3 3 the sole difference between the lwe benchmark model and apex1905 used to simulate the jornada experimental range site data is the temporal resolution of time series input data with the latter being much coarser fig 12 illustrates simulated horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport using the lwe benchmark model and apex1905 despite less data intense inputs than the benchmark model the apex1905 reproduced both the horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport well without further refining parameters the results are r2 of 0 77 and 0 81 respectively the biases in apex1905 are low with rmse less than 1 0 given the substantial simplification and approximation in the input data preparation the apex1905 model was not expected to replicate measured horizontal sediment transport from individual wind erosion events however the model simulated monthly and annual average sediment transports as shown in figs 12 and 13 in fig 13 simulated average annual horizontal sediment transports from 2002 to 2017 lay within the observed interquartile range iqr indicating the reliability of the model output in simulating long term periods 4 5 benefits of the enhanced apex1905 model to simulate landscape wind erosion in rangelands continuous simulation of horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport using a stand alone aeolian erosion model e g okin 2008 often requires detailed field properties such as vegetation height canopy gap vegetation cover fraction soil moisture condition and wind speed distribution which is uncommon in the u s monitoring these properties for long periods is expensive and labor intensive the gaps in data availability make it worthwhile to integrate a landscape scale wind erosion model into the apex1905 agro hydrological watershed model the integrated model offers a cost effective tool to simulate horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle without intensive data collection fig 14 presents the mean canopy gap mean vegetation height and vegetation cover fraction estimated by apex1905 for the jornada experimental range site the model simulation shows a relatively big canopy gap and small vegetation cover during the winter than during growing seasons in summer and fall although grasses show seasonal variation in canopy height the simulated canopy height presents little temporal variability this is attributed to the minimal variation of canopy height for matured honey mesquite trees that grow interspersed with black grama grasses the apex1905 model provides the capability to simulate long term vertical particle transport as shown in fig 15 as expected estimated vertical particle transport is significantly driven by wind speed in the long term the years with high wind speed generally had high vertical particle transport rates 4 6 limitations and future research in this study the apex1905 model was evaluated at the usda ars new mexico jornada experimental range national wind erosion network site availability of additional data would ensure its applicability and reliability on simulating aeolian transport processes under a wide range of climatic conditions as more data becomes available the apex1905 model could be a valuable tool to evaluate the efficacy of land management practices on controlling wind erosion as a decision aid for land managers and policymakers for both croplands and rangelands 5 conclusion this study presented an integration of landscape wind erosion lwe processes to the apex model for simulating wind driven horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport for rangelands for the integration we selected aeolian modeling schemes that are process based and require minimal data because aeolian data are scarce in the united states and other countries the model s capabilities were evaluated using measured data and ranges for their representative parameters were identified we also tested the apex1905 simulated horizontal sediment transport and vertical particle transport against the benchmark model overall the benchmark model could reproduce 58 of the observed horizontal sediment transport variability between 2015 and 2017 with an rmse of 2 6 although the apex1905 was not expected to capture intra day variability in measured horizontal sediment transport due to daily averaging in wind speed and gap distribution data the model simulated horizontal and vertical particle transport well compared with the benchmark model r2 0 77 and 0 81 respectively the performance metric of the apex1905 model improved when outputs were evaluated at the monthly or the annual time scale suggesting that apex1905 can be helpful to assess long term land management practices and restoration efforts as well as climatic impacts at a coarse time interval the enhanced apex model can be applied to any rangeland to simulate soil erosion driven by winds this model is a crucial application tool in rangelands where monitoring vegetation characteristics soil moisture and sub daily wind speed is limited labor intensive and expensive reliable and comprehensive modeling tools provide a means to understand the implications of rangeland soil erosion and or land use change and evaluate the effect of various soil and water management practices and environmental policies simulation models help acquire critical insights on the environmental impacts of alternative management or climate change over different periods the integration of aeolian processes to account for landscape wind erosion on rangelands into the apex model will provide model users and land and policy managers with
