19490,this work presents a method to emulate the flow dynamics of physically based hydrodynamic simulators under variations of time dependent rainfall and parametric scenarios although surrogate modelling is often employed to deal with the computational burden of this type of simulators common techniques used for model emulation as polynomial expansions or gaussian processes cannot deal with large parameter space dimensionality this restricts their applicability to a reduced number of static parameters under a fixed rainfall process the technique presented combines the use of a modified unit hydrograph uh scheme and a polynomial chaos expansion pce to emulate flow from physically based hydrodynamic models the novel element of the proposed methodology is that the emulator compensates for the errors induced by the assumptions of proportionality and superposition of the uh theory when dealing with non linear model structures whereas it approximates properly the behaviour of a physically based simulator to new spatially uniform rainfall time series and parametric scenarios the computational time is significantly reduced which makes the practical use of the model feasible e g real time control flood warning schemes hydraulic structures design parametric inference etc the applicability of this methodology is demonstrated in three case studies through the emulation of a simplified non linear tank in series routing structure and of the 2d shallow water equations 2d swe solution flow r2d in two computational domains results indicate that the proposed emulator can approximate with a high degree of accuracy the behaviour of the original models under a wide range of rainfall inputs and parametric values graphical abstract image 1 keywords uncertainty propagation flow modelling emulator surrogate model unit hydrograph 2d shallow water equations 1 introduction the simulation of surface water flow dynamics in urban and rural catchment scale is of great importance in water management during the past four decades several distributed or semi distributed models having a physical basis have been developed such as mike she swat or topkapi software abbott et al 1986 mazzetti 2015 neitsch et al 2002 among others these conceptualisations simulate several processes infiltration interception snow melting overland flow groundwater flow etc included in the water cycle using either differential or empirical equations usually the overland flow propagation is approximated by simplified methods such as the kinematic or dynamic wave equations and therefore cannot capture the non linearities observed especially in extreme events such as floods costabile et al 2012a liang 2010 singh et al 2014 in the last few years there is an increasing trend to simulate overland flow dynamics at catchment scale using the full form of the two dimensional shallow water equations 2d swe fiedler and ramirez 2000 and esteves et al 2000 represent early attempts to use numerical solvers based on the full form of 2d swe to simulate the rainfall runoff process in micro scale catchments the rapid increase in computational power led to several examples of application to real catchments costabile et al 2012b 2013 liang et al 2007 nguyen et al 2016 singh et al 2014 although the implementation of this kind of simulators is currently feasible in large scale scenarios the required computational time is a substantial limitation in the order of hours days therefore the use of this type of physically based flow simulators in practice is still hampered e g hydraulic design real time flood warning schemes uncertainty analysis or parametric calibration accelerating the sampling of hydrodynamic models is an area of high interest several approaches focus on exploiting the benefits of high performance computing kalyanapu et al 2011 vacondio et al 2014 or efficient grid definitions stelling 2012 these strategies reduce the time required for computing events of interest however the computational burden is still prohibitive for intensive model evaluation the use of surrogate modelling is an alternative to approximate the behaviour of dynamic simulators at output variables of interest several authors have presented methods in which a large physically based model is substituted by a fast surrogate conceptual version bermúdez et al 2018 meert et al 2018 van daal rombouts et al 2016 other strategy focuses on learning directly the behaviour of the original simulator building an interpolator between the parametric and output spaces for instance wang et al 2015 presented a data driven emulator to facilitate uncertainty analysis in hydrologic modelling a similar application for groundwater modelling can be found in laloy et al 2013 carbajal et al 2017 described a comparison of surrogate methods mechanistic vs data driven based on gaussian processes to emulate the dynamics of urban drainage routing models more applications can be found in urban hydrology machac et al 2016a 2016b these methods have the advantage of representing a mapping between model parameters and the simulator output space which allow for a direct use in calibration inference or uncertainty analysis schemes however they are generally hard bounded to the rainfall time series in which they were trained this means that the model emulator is only valid for changes in the parametric space under a particular rainfall event and boundary conditions outside those conditions a new sampling and training would be necessary this has posed a strong limitation on the application of data driven emulators in hydrology a potential approach to incorporate the rainfall variability in the data driven emulator is to encode the rainfall process as a set of discrete parameters representing rainfall intensity at each time step which is added to the model parametric space to be emulated mahmoodian et al 2017 however common techniques used for model emulation as polynomial chaos expansion pce or gaussian processes gp are sensitive to the dimensionality of the parameter space allowing only for a reduced number of parameters to be accounted for this technique is limited to only short rainfall events or very coarsely discretised another surrogate approach could be the use of recurrent neural networks rnn e g long short term memory configurations hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 these structures are designed to accommodate time dependent processes however rnn implementations are expected to require a prohibitive number of simulator samples to guarantee that variations of time dependent rainfall are sufficiently explored sajikumar and thandeveswara 1999 provided an early example describing a rainfall runoff process using a neural network by learning patterns from monitoring data although this could replicate the behaviour of a given status of the system it did not allow for representing parameter variations or virtual changes in the system a way to cope with the approximation of physically based flow simulators responses to new rainfall series is the hybrid combination of the hydrological unit hydrograph uh theory with hydrodynamic modelling bellos and tsakiris 2016 with this technique an uh is derived using a physically based 2d hydrodynamic simulator then the rainfall event is simulated abstracting from the precipitation losses due to infiltration sewer drainage interception etc and composing the total flow response using proportionality and superposition of the uh with this scheme a flood event can be readily evaluated nevertheless the derivation of the uh is parameter dependent and thus practical model use is still severely hampered e g quantification of uncertainty sensitivity analysis calibration etc bellos et al 2017 addressed this issue by generalising the uh derivation with the use of a surrogate model for a uniform distribution of manning coefficient values thus including the parameter dependency however the solution of the 2d swe is often highly non linear which is strongly manifested when dealing with small catchments characterised by fast response this violates the assumption of linearity in the uh theory thus rendering significant errors in the estimated hydrograph in this work we present a new methodology to emulate physically based hydrodynamic simulators this is based on encoding the rainfall process as unitary responses through a dedicated sampling scheme and the use of a polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model which compensates for the effect of non linearities due to the superposition and proportionality composition of the uh the mismatch observed in the results derived by the hybrid technique and the full implementation of the physically based model in previous attempts bellos and tsakiris 2016 bellos et al 2017 is significantly reduced this new surrogate technique allows the modeller to capture the behaviour of the real model to variations of time dependent rainfall spatially uniform and parameter scenarios at a significant computational time reduction in the order of milliseconds seconds in order to demonstrate the presented methodology we compare the results derived by a simulator the conventional use of uh linear theory and the new proposed surrogate model in three case studies a synthetic catchment which is represented by a simplified non linear tank in series flow routing structure and two catchment geometries where the rainfall runoff process is described by the full form of 2d swe 2 methods and materials 2 1 model based unit hydrograph the unit hydrograph uh theory dooge 1959 is based on the assumption that there is a unique runoff response after a unitary rainfall depth during a specific time interval for every catchment a commonly accepted unitary depth is 10 mm l m 2 of rainfall whereas the time interval varies and depends on the characteristics of the catchment such as the size time of concentration etc with a given uh of a catchment every runoff can be derived using as input data the rainfall event based on the principles of the proportionality and superposition the runoff response for rainfall depth in every time step is derived assuming that this rainfall depth is proportional to the corresponding unitary depth and therefore the responses should be proportional as well principle of proportionality the individual runoff responses are composed in time to represent the response for the given rainfall event principle of the superposition the uh theory has been often used to approximate the behaviour of catchments where limited data is available ungauged basins this is done using synthetic uhs which are derived based on the catchment s characteristics e g snyder s us or the soil conservation service uh etc alternatively uhs of several durations can be derived from monitoring data when available in this particular case the objective is to represent the behaviour of a hydrodynamic simulator thus a set of tailored simulations can be drawn from the model in order to capture its unitary reaction by using the principles of uh theory from this set of samples an emulator structure was applied to generate an interpolation map between new parameter and rainfall scenarios and the approximated response of the hydrodynamic simulator 2 2 polynomial chaos expansion pce a weighted sum of orthogonal polynomials can be used to link a vector of random variables to space time model outputs xiu and karniadakis 2003 xiu 2010 if the mapping is smooth in this case we denote a deterministic flow model m as 1 q t m m 0 i t θ which has a set of initial conditions m 0 time dependent inputs i t ℝ m and a vector of model parameters θ ℝ d and which solution renders the simulated flow dynamics at a certain location q t ℝ m then we aim to find a linear combination of polynomials only dependent on the parametric space which approximate a map between θ and q t θ as 2 q t θ c t t ϕ θ in which ϕ θ ℝ n x 1 is a series of n orthogonal polynomials constructed as basis of the joint probability density function of the parameter space θ and c t ℝ n x 1 is a vector of coefficients c i t ℝ m to be fitted to the particular model response the output space q t θ is interpolated through a weighted sum of polynomials the fitting process is performed by deriving the model output at i 1 k known parameter combinations θ q i as m m 0 i t θ q i q t q i the model samples and the polynomial approximation can be written as a system of equations 3 q t q 1 q t q k ϕ 1 q 1 ϕ n q 1 ϕ 1 q k ϕ n q k c 1 t c n t in which the only unknown factors are the coefficients c i t this system can be expressed in matrix form as 4 q t q p q c t for which p ℝ k x n is the matrix of polynomials values corresponding to each parameter sample by ensuring that the system is overdetermined k n this system can be approximated by a least squares minimisation 5 c t p q t p q 1 p q t q t q thus the values of c t are approximated so they map the selected polynomial basis ϕ θ and the sampled output series q t q then the expression of equation 2 can be used to interpolate the targeted output series to different values of the parameter set this is known as a non intrusive collocation method other fitting methods and sampling strategies are discussed in hadigol and doostan 2018 the orthogonal polynomials should be chosen as basis of the parameter probabilistic space xiu and karniadakis 2002 provided a range of known polynomial basis and stochastic variable distributions in this case training parameter distributions were always considered independent and uniformly distributed this has associated the legendre polynomials the creation of orthogonal polynomial series was done using the implementation of gautschi 1994 which uses a three term recursion relation for univariate polynomials 6 ϕ n 1 θ i ϕ n θ i θ i a n ϕ n 1 θ i b n a n e θ i ϕ n 2 e ϕ n 2 b n e ϕ n 2 e ϕ n 1 2 ϕ 1 0 ϕ 0 1 where ϕ n θ i represents the nth polynomial of the ith parameter as the parametric space is considered stochastically independent the multivariate orthogonal expansion was obtained by multiplying the univariate ones 7 ϕ n θ ϕ n θ 1 ϕ n θ d in practice the polynomial series is truncated at a certain order p which is selected such that a desired level of accuracy is achieved then the number of polynomials and thus of associated c i t to be approximated is 8 n p d p d which is related to the polynomial truncation order p and to the dimensionality of the parameter vector d 2 3 emulator structure a polynomial chaos emulator can be used to represent an interpolation map between model parameters and the model unitary hydrograph response bellos et al 2017 this is done by propagating a unitary rainfall event of 10 mm at combinations of model parameter θ q i and fitting a pce as described previously to the output unitary response u h 10 m m t θ 9 u h 10 m m t θ c 10 m m t t ϕ 10 m m θ the total hydrograph shape is then reconstructed for any given rainfall event and combination of parameters this relies on the proportionality and superposition assumptions of the uh theory which has proven insufficient to capture the real model dynamics in previous attempts bellos et al 2017 the observed error in the comparison between the hydrodynamic simulator and the composition of the uh was separated in two sources a error due to the proportionality assumption b error due to the superposition assumption according to the proportionality principle the uh relates linearly to rainfall intensity this assumption is not valid when dealing with a non linear model structure in order to correct for this error source the behaviour of the unitary hydrograph to rainfall intensity was transferred to the pce emulator this was achieved by training the emulator through variations of the model parametric space and of the unitary rainfall intensity r instead of using a fixed 10 mm event to derivate the uh 10 u h p t θ r c p t t ϕ p θ r with this approach the emulator uhp included the proportional non linear effect this corrected for the proportionality error of the classical uh theory which was tested by reproducing the behaviour of a non linear tank in series model to variations of unitary rainfall intensity on the other hand the superposition error is linked to the model dynamic state according to uh theory the flow response is unitary and independent in previous states and therefore fails to capture non linear processes in order to transfer the information of the system state to the emulator structure we propose a new method to sample the real simulator and to build a unitary rainfall emulator uhps fig 1 depicts the emulator development process this structure was based on two simplification phases first a pce emulator scheme was built following these steps 1 a series of samples were drawn from the model parametric space θ q i and from two extra parameters r and r p which represented two consecutive unitary rainfall steps with duration d t selected following the uh theory 2 two samples were drawn from the original simulator using the same parameter sample q i but using a rainfall time series input of r t t r p r 0 0 d t and r p t r p 0 0 0 d t respectively which are vectors of input rainfall intensity at a given d t time step the difference between the two output hydrographs was computed as m θ q i r t t m θ q i r p t which provided an approximation of the state response of the model equations when a rainfall intensity r p preceded a rainfall intensity r this response contains the proportionality non linear error information along with the superposition error at one rainfall lag the set of unitary responses was stored in a database 3 the model unitary responses from the database were used to train a pce emulator as 11 u h p s t θ r r p c p s t t ϕ p s θ r r p 4 the performance of the unitary emulator was tested on several samples which were not used to train the model once fitted the interpolator pce a second simplification phase is performed 5 the unitary responses from uhps are used to reconstruct new rainfall parametric scenarios 6 effective rainfall is computed if required and 7 superposing all unitary model responses obtained from equation 11 which corresponds to the unitary response of the model under the parameter set θ and the given rainfall event additionally initial boundary conditions can also be included in the emulation phase by conceptualising them as extra model parameters 2 4 case studies 2 4 1 simplified flow model in order to illustrate the impact of non linearities in the basic assumptions of the unit hydrograph theory superposition and proportionality a basic synthetic model was used fig 2 this simple rainfall runoff model structure was conceptualised as a chain of non linear tanks 12 d v i d t q i n q o u t q o u t a v i b where v i represents the volume stored at the i th tank q i n the flow entering in the tank from the previous structure and q o u t represents the outflow which follows a non linear relationship with the current tank storage eq 1 the discharge is driven by a proportional coefficient a and an exponential parameter b the runoff was calculated as q i n t a n k s a r from a certain area a and was separated in two lines of five and three tanks which converged at the outflow fig 2 both tank lines shared the exponential parameter b but had different proportional coefficients namely a and a r infiltration was set to 0 thus the model was composed by a set of ordinary differential equations odes 13 q o u t f l o w m s i m p l i f i e d a a r b a r t represented by m s i m p l i f i e d which depends in the set of tank parameters the catchment s area a and in a rainfall input r t the parameters were manually selected a 1 4 a r 2 2 b 1 2 and a 5 in order to force a non linear dynamic behaviour rainfall time series were supplied with a frequency of 10 min the effect of non linearities and its correction through the use of the proposed emulator were computed on the simplified model at the fixed set of parameters additionally an example is provided in which the full parameter space was used as an input for the emulator the surrogate structure was trained using 3000 samples drawn from a latin hypercube sampling lhs scheme of the full parametric space a a r b a r r p where the first four elements referred to model parameters and the last two encoded the rainfall process distribution and ranges used at the training dataset are described in table 1 an uncertainty analysis scheme was also implemented using the emulated structure from an elicited parameter probability distribution table 2 a total of 1000 samples were drawn from a monte carlo sampling scheme assuming independency of parameters this contained the four model parameters a a r a b and a rainfall multiplier k r a i n f a l l which modified the rainfall input 2 4 2 physically based flow model the applicability of the proposed emulation technique in physically based real scale models was tested by representing the dynamic response of the full solution of the 2d swe in two synthetic studies a computational domain was created using a parabolic shape to represent a surface elevation model fig 3 the surface elevation model z x y in meters adopted the following form 14 z x y α α 0 x y y 0 2 β x c where α 10 4 α 0 1 5 x 10 7 y 0 250 β 5 x 10 3 and c 10 the computational domain was discretised in square shaped cells of 10 10 m whereas a gate of 100 m width was located at the outlet of the catchment where runoff was measured the system had a surface of 0 26 km2 which is representative of a small catchment characterised by fast response model swe parabola additionally a set of five obstacles square reflective boundaries was located near the centre of the computational domain model swe urban the numerical solver used for the flow dynamics simulation was the flow r2d model which solves the full form of 2d swe the implementation consisted on the finite difference method and a modified version of mccormack numerical scheme bellos and tsakiris 2015 the time step was δt 0 01 s whereas for the diffusion factor a typical value of ω 0 999 was selected the manning equation was used to represent friction the threshold which distinguishes wet and dry cells was selected equal to h dry 10 4 m for numerical reasons an initial thin film of water equal to 1 1 10 5 m was set up in the catchment this film was infiltrated in the first 15 min through the sink term of the mass equation of the 2d swe in a constant rate in order to preserve mass balance between rainfall and runoff volumes the boundaries of the catchment were set as walls through the reflection boundary technique in order to preserve mass balance as well whereas the outlet of the catchment was set as open boundaries tsakiris and bellos 2014 a rainfall input series with a time step of 15 min the emulator scheme was implemented using variations of the surface manning roughness n as a model parameter constant in the spatial domain table 3 presents the parametric distributions at training a total of 300 samples were performed on the two simulators drawn from a lhs the 2d swe simulator generated numerical instabilities at very low rainfall intensities thus the sampling scheme was reduced to r p 0 2 and r 0 2 from the remaining dataset 264 samples were used for training and 30 for validation of the pce accuracy a 5th order legendre polynomial set was used in both cases additionally a validation set of rainfall and parametric scenarios table b 1 was used to compare the fit between the original simulators and the proposed surrogate models 2 5 performance indicators the fit between model and emulator derived flow time series was assessed by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 15 n s e 1 t 0 t e t s t 2 t 0 t s t s 2 where e t denoted the emulated and s t the simulated values at time t and s the mean value of the simulated series besides a peak relative error pre index was used in order to assess the accuracy of the flow maximum peak emulation which follows 16 p r e s p e a k e p e a k s p e a k where s p e a k and e p e a k are the simulated and emulated values associated with the peak flow of the hydrograph 3 results and discussion 3 1 correcting uh errors due to non linearities the simplified tank in series model was used to test the effect of superposition and proportionality assumptions in the reconstruction of hydrographs based in the uh linear theory the model parameters were defined as described in the materials section to force a non linear routing process b 1 2 fig 4 shows the mismatch between a uh linear derived hydrograph reconstruction from a 10 mm 10 min rainfall and the original simulator in the x axis a set of unitary 10 min rainfall events is supplied with a ramping intensity between 1 and 50 mm the color map represents hydrograph response the normalised residuals at each time step are shown below which were computed as 17 ε t s t e t s t where s t is the flow simulated at time t and e t the corresponding emulated values in the right fig 4 the simulated approximated by the uh theory and residual values are shown for a 30 mm unitary rainfall the residual structure indicates that for rainfall intensities above or below 10 mm the performance of the uh reconstruction rapidly decreases this is due to the non linear behaviour of the flow propagation which explains why higher intensities are heavily underestimated and lower intensities overestimated through the linear representation of the uh fig 5 shows the effect of proportionality when using the uhp emulator in this case the rainfall intensity is included in the surrogate structure and thus the unitary response derivation represents the effect of non linearities due to proportionality the residual structure indicates a high similarity between the emulator simulator outputs when using only unitary rainfall at varying intensities fig 6 depicts the errors due to the superposition of the unit hydrograph in the x axis a set of 100 rainfall events with varying duration and intensity were used as input for the simulator and for the uhp emulator the rainfall events had a random duration of between 10 and 50 min and a rainfall intensity ranging from 2 to 18 mm 10min the x axis was sorted by rainfall volume in the right the effect of a constant rainfall intensity of 12 mm 10min during 30 min is shown the effect of non linearities is still present in this case although the proportional factor was corrected as shown in fig 5 this indicates that the system state influences the response and thus should be accounted for in non linear systems fig 7 shows the correction done by the use of the proposed emulator structure uhps this structure partially compensates for the proportional and the superposition effects the residual plot in fig 7 shows that these errors are significantly reduced in comparison with the previous scheme uhp the effect of the linear assumptions of the uh theory in hydrograph approximation have been reported in the literature for rural and urban catchments ding 2011 minshall 1960 musy 1998 the example presented shows the separated effect of the superposition and proportionality simplifications of a unit hydrograph and a strategy to correct them in the emulator structure with the use of the tank in series model it was possible to modify the level of non linearity by changing the tank exponent b the reader is directed to the additional material figure a 1 and a 2 where the same effect was computed for the case b 1 which shows the applicability of the uh theory in linear cases nevertheless flow propagation processes are seldom linear and thus this effect is expected to be relevant in most applications 3 2 emulation of the simplified flow model once trained the behaviour of the uhps emulator was compared with the simplified model response for combinations of rainfall and parametric scenarios to that effect 1000 samples were drawn from a monte carlo sampling scheme of an elicited parameter distribution table 2 this contained the four model parameters a a r a b and a rainfall multiplier k r a i n f a l l fig 8 displays the distribution of the performance indicators pre and nse between uhps and the original simulator nse is close to one indicating an accurate fit between simulated emulated time series pre reports the relative error in the peak reproduction which is around 1 2 of the maximum flow fig 9 shows the graphical comparison of the uhps emulator and the simulator for the initial parameter sample at a particular rainfall series along with the mean and 95 interval of the 1000 parameter samples performed on the emulator 3 3 emulation of the 2 d shallow water equations the dynamics of the 2d swe were emulated following the same process as in the simplified example fig 10 shows the nse values for the emulated simulated unitary responses at 30 combinations of parameters contained in the testing dataset this served to validate the emulator of the unitary responses we compared the emulator uhps which takes into account the error due to proportionality and superposition the emulator uhp only the proportionality error the conventional composition of the uh linear using 10 mm unitary rainfall and the results derived from the 2d swe hydrodynamic simulators swe parabola and swe urban in a set of 8 validation scenarios appendix b table b 1 for varying rainfall time series and roughness coefficient values table 4 presents the nse and pre values for all cases comparing with the hydrodynamic simulator there is a clear increase in performance by the use of the proposed emulator structure uhps when approximating the flow dynamics this increase is denoted by the high nse values and a pre one order of magnitude lower than the other emulator structures in general the use of the proportional correction uhp is not sufficient and although it reproduces the hydrograph peak better than the simple use of the linear uh structure denoted by the lower pre values specially in rainfall events where the maximum intensity differs from 10 mm as in validation events 0 to 3 it is heavily affected by the superposition error as seen in the validation events 4 to 7 the use of uhps improves the reconstruction of the simulated hydrograph and it captures the timing of the flow peak in all tested cases for both geometrical scenarios fig 11 shows a graphical comparison between the emulated and simulated values for the validation 0 and validation 1 scenarios for the simulator swe urban uhps has a close fit to the simulator dynamics with an error in the peak estimation of 1 5 the comparison of swe parabola and swe urban are also shown in fig 11 were the effect of geometrical obstacles of the second scheme generates a slightly delayed and attenuated flow response which led to a decrease in performance of uhlinear and uhp the reader is directed to the additional material for the graphical comparison at the 8 validation scenarios for the two simulators figure b 1 and b 2 one of the advantages of the proposed methodology uhps structure is that the emulation errors can be decomposed directly in two sources a errors in the emulation of the unitary responses through a pce and b errors in the reconstruction of the hydrograph by composition of the unitary responses the errors in phase a can be described by comparing the pce emulator and the simulator in a set of test parameter scenarios this source is dependent on the capability of the emulation technique used to represent the link between the unitary response and the parameter space which can be reduced in two ways 1 by carefully selecting the emulator structure which should be capable of representing a dynamic output such as a pce xiu and karniadakis 2002 by using a gaussian process as in carbajal et al 2017 bayesian networks conti and o hagan 2010 or recurrent neural networks gers et al 2002 2 by increasing the training dataset size sampling from the simulator phase b involves reconstructing the hydrograph from the unitary responses the effect of the proportionality simplification is well represented by including the rainfall intensity in the emulator structure however the superposition composition has a dependency on the system dynamics and the unitary rainfall length for highly dynamic systems high frequency rainfall data could be necessary and thus accounting for only one temporal step in the superposition scheme might not be sufficient a limitation of the proposed methodology is that its applicability is restricted to rainfall spatial homogeneity the generalisation to spatio temporal rainfall variability poses a challenge since it will increase significantly the degrees of freedom of the unitary response which should be captured by the emulator phase thus requiring a much larger number of samples from the real simulator also in practice the number of accounted parameters is limited in this approach when using the pce emulator the number of polynomials follows equation 8 which depends on the dimension of the parameter space d and the grade of the polynomial series p this relationship grows rapidly forcing to increase the number of samples from the original model thus for large dimensional spaces the number of required model samples could render the training impractical for instance the training of the swe parabola and swe urban emulators was done through 260 unitary responses requiring a total of 1040 2080 computation hours training was performed in the hpc platform of the computational centre of the national technical university of athens details are provided in table 5 the emulator sampling at the validation tests took 40 ms per iteration in a 2 2 ghz intel core i7 which represents a significant time reduction the benefit of proposing an emulator is strongly case dependent and is linked to the number of required parameters and shape of the simulator response fig 12 provides a measure for the increase in performance measured by the decrease in l2 norm with the training data set size for the three tested emulators the stabilization of performance can be used to design a sequential sampling scheme which can reduce the number of simulator samples 4 conclusion in this work a novel methodology to perform emulation of flow derived from hydrodynamic simulators is presented this method allows approximating hydrographs generated by physically based hydrodynamic modelling under variations of model parameter values and rainfall series this method is based on the combined use of the unit hydrograph theory uh and a polynomial chaos expansion pce emulator the use of the unit hydrograph theory is based upon the assumption that the underlying process is linear this assumption is seldom met in physically based hydrodynamic simulators since the driving equations are fundamentally non linear in this new approach information of the non linear reaction of the model is encoded in the pce structure by means of a dedicated sampling scheme the performance of the emulator was tested in three case studies a a simplified flow routing model based on a non linear tank cascade b c two synthetic computational domains simulated through the full form of the 2d shallow water equations in the three simulators the proposed emulator structure could approximate an output hydrograph under various combinations of rainfall time series and model parameters a comparison between the performance of the proposed emulator structure uhps and the use of the classical uh theory is also provided this demonstrated that errors induced by the linear assumption of the uh theory can be significant when dealing with simulators based on the solution of the 2d swe the method still has several limitations for instance the emulator can only accept spatially uniform rainfall time series this can pose a severe constrain when dealing with large scale catchments also rainfall series inputs should have a constant sampling frequency errors in the emulator simulator structure are expected to increase if the selected rainfall step duration is much smaller than the catchment s concentration time for highly non linear models since the unit hydrograph superposition error will become dominant the number of independent parameters is also limited in practice this is a limitation of the emulator structure used pce since the number of required model samples increases rapidly with the dimensionality of the parametric space nonetheless other data driven surrogate strategies can be easily implemented further research should be conducted in these areas the proposed methodology has the potential to significantly increase the range of applications of physically based flow propagation schemes which is currently hampered by the computational burden author contributions amr developed the required software and carried out the simulations and data analysis vb produced the

of the computation facilities appendix a uh simplification in linear models when using a linear model the assumptions of proportionality and superposition of the unit hydrograph are congruent with the underlying dynamics figure a 1 shows the comparison between the simplified model described in the first case study using b 1 thus a set of linear tanks and the use of a unit hydrograph derived from the response at 10 mm rainfall for an increasing unitary rainfall intensity from 1 to 50 mm 10min figure shows the same comparison for the joint proportionality and superposition assumptions for rainfall inputs of varying length 10 50 min and intensity 1 20 mm 10min in those cases the classical uh theory can describe the model behaviour correctly which is denoted by the almost null residual

19490,this work presents a method to emulate the flow dynamics of physically based hydrodynamic simulators under variations of time dependent rainfall and parametric scenarios although surrogate modelling is often employed to deal with the computational burden of this type of simulators common techniques used for model emulation as polynomial expansions or gaussian processes cannot deal with large parameter space dimensionality this restricts their applicability to a reduced number of static parameters under a fixed rainfall process the technique presented combines the use of a modified unit hydrograph uh scheme and a polynomial chaos expansion pce to emulate flow from physically based hydrodynamic models the novel element of the proposed methodology is that the emulator compensates for the errors induced by the assumptions of proportionality and superposition of the uh theory when dealing with non linear model structures whereas it approximates properly the behaviour of a physically based simulator to new spatially uniform rainfall time series and parametric scenarios the computational time is significantly reduced which makes the practical use of the model feasible e g real time control flood warning schemes hydraulic structures design parametric inference etc the applicability of this methodology is demonstrated in three case studies through the emulation of a simplified non linear tank in series routing structure and of the 2d shallow water equations 2d swe solution flow r2d in two computational domains results indicate that the proposed emulator can approximate with a high degree of accuracy the behaviour of the original models under a wide range of rainfall inputs and parametric values graphical abstract image 1 keywords uncertainty propagation flow modelling emulator surrogate model unit hydrograph 2d shallow water equations 1 introduction the simulation of surface water flow dynamics in urban and rural catchment scale is of great importance in water management during the past four decades several distributed or semi distributed models having a physical basis have been developed such as mike she swat or topkapi software abbott et al 1986 mazzetti 2015 neitsch et al 2002 among others these conceptualisations simulate several processes infiltration interception snow melting overland flow groundwater flow etc included in the water cycle using either differential or empirical equations usually the overland flow propagation is approximated by simplified methods such as the kinematic or dynamic wave equations and therefore cannot capture the non linearities observed especially in extreme events such as floods costabile et al 2012a liang 2010 singh et al 2014 in the last few years there is an increasing trend to simulate overland flow dynamics at catchment scale using the full form of the two dimensional shallow water equations 2d swe fiedler and ramirez 2000 and esteves et al 2000 represent early attempts to use numerical solvers based on the full form of 2d swe to simulate the rainfall runoff process in micro scale catchments the rapid increase in computational power led to several examples of application to real catchments costabile et al 2012b 2013 liang et al 2007 nguyen et al 2016 singh et al 2014 although the implementation of this kind of simulators is currently feasible in large scale scenarios the required computational time is a substantial limitation in the order of hours days therefore the use of this type of physically based flow simulators in practice is still hampered e g hydraulic design real time flood warning schemes uncertainty analysis or parametric calibration accelerating the sampling of hydrodynamic models is an area of high interest several approaches focus on exploiting the benefits of high performance computing kalyanapu et al 2011 vacondio et al 2014 or efficient grid definitions stelling 2012 these strategies reduce the time required for computing events of interest however the computational burden is still prohibitive for intensive model evaluation the use of surrogate modelling is an alternative to approximate the behaviour of dynamic simulators at output variables of interest several authors have presented methods in which a large physically based model is substituted by a fast surrogate conceptual version bermúdez et al 2018 meert et al 2018 van daal rombouts et al 2016 other strategy focuses on learning directly the behaviour of the original simulator building an interpolator between the parametric and output spaces for instance wang et al 2015 presented a data driven emulator to facilitate uncertainty analysis in hydrologic modelling a similar application for groundwater modelling can be found in laloy et al 2013 carbajal et al 2017 described a comparison of surrogate methods mechanistic vs data driven based on gaussian processes to emulate the dynamics of urban drainage routing models more applications can be found in urban hydrology machac et al 2016a 2016b these methods have the advantage of representing a mapping between model parameters and the simulator output space which allow for a direct use in calibration inference or uncertainty analysis schemes however they are generally hard bounded to the rainfall time series in which they were trained this means that the model emulator is only valid for changes in the parametric space under a particular rainfall event and boundary conditions outside those conditions a new sampling and training would be necessary this has posed a strong limitation on the application of data driven emulators in hydrology a potential approach to incorporate the rainfall variability in the data driven emulator is to encode the rainfall process as a set of discrete parameters representing rainfall intensity at each time step which is added to the model parametric space to be emulated mahmoodian et al 2017 however common techniques used for model emulation as polynomial chaos expansion pce or gaussian processes gp are sensitive to the dimensionality of the parameter space allowing only for a reduced number of parameters to be accounted for this technique is limited to only short rainfall events or very coarsely discretised another surrogate approach could be the use of recurrent neural networks rnn e g long short term memory configurations hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 these structures are designed to accommodate time dependent processes however rnn implementations are expected to require a prohibitive number of simulator samples to guarantee that variations of time dependent rainfall are sufficiently explored sajikumar and thandeveswara 1999 provided an early example describing a rainfall runoff process using a neural network by learning patterns from monitoring data although this could replicate the behaviour of a given status of the system it did not allow for representing parameter variations or virtual changes in the system a way to cope with the approximation of physically based flow simulators responses to new rainfall series is the hybrid combination of the hydrological unit hydrograph uh theory with hydrodynamic modelling bellos and tsakiris 2016 with this technique an uh is derived using a physically based 2d hydrodynamic simulator then the rainfall event is simulated abstracting from the precipitation losses due to infiltration sewer drainage interception etc and composing the total flow response using proportionality and superposition of the uh with this scheme a flood event can be readily evaluated nevertheless the derivation of the uh is parameter dependent and thus practical model use is still severely hampered e g quantification of uncertainty sensitivity analysis calibration etc bellos et al 2017 addressed this issue by generalising the uh derivation with the use of a surrogate model for a uniform distribution of manning coefficient values thus including the parameter dependency however the solution of the 2d swe is often highly non linear which is strongly manifested when dealing with small catchments characterised by fast response this violates the assumption of linearity in the uh theory thus rendering significant errors in the estimated hydrograph in this work we present a new methodology to emulate physically based hydrodynamic simulators this is based on encoding the rainfall process as unitary responses through a dedicated sampling scheme and the use of a polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model which compensates for the effect of non linearities due to the superposition and proportionality composition of the uh the mismatch observed in the results derived by the hybrid technique and the full implementation of the physically based model in previous attempts bellos and tsakiris 2016 bellos et al 2017 is significantly reduced this new surrogate technique allows the modeller to capture the behaviour of the real model to variations of time dependent rainfall spatially uniform and parameter scenarios at a significant computational time reduction in the order of milliseconds seconds in order to demonstrate the presented methodology we compare the results derived by a simulator the conventional use of uh linear theory and the new proposed surrogate model in three case studies a synthetic catchment which is represented by a simplified non linear tank in series flow routing structure and two catchment geometries where the rainfall runoff process is described by the full form of 2d swe 2 methods and materials 2 1 model based unit hydrograph the unit hydrograph uh theory dooge 1959 is based on the assumption that there is a unique runoff response after a unitary rainfall depth during a specific time interval for every catchment a commonly accepted unitary depth is 10 mm l m 2 of rainfall whereas the time interval varies and depends on the characteristics of the catchment such as the size time of concentration etc with a given uh of a catchment every runoff can be derived using as input data the rainfall event based on the principles of the proportionality and superposition the runoff response for rainfall depth in every time step is derived assuming that this rainfall depth is proportional to the corresponding unitary depth and therefore the responses should be proportional as well principle of proportionality the individual runoff responses are composed in time to represent the response for the given rainfall event principle of the superposition the uh theory has been often used to approximate the behaviour of catchments where limited data is available ungauged basins this is done using synthetic uhs which are derived based on the catchment s characteristics e g snyder s us or the soil conservation service uh etc alternatively uhs of several durations can be derived from monitoring data when available in this particular case the objective is to represent the behaviour of a hydrodynamic simulator thus a set of tailored simulations can be drawn from the model in order to capture its unitary reaction by using the principles of uh theory from this set of samples an emulator structure was applied to generate an interpolation map between new parameter and rainfall scenarios and the approximated response of the hydrodynamic simulator 2 2 polynomial chaos expansion pce a weighted sum of orthogonal polynomials can be used to link a vector of random variables to space time model outputs xiu and karniadakis 2003 xiu 2010 if the mapping is smooth in this case we denote a deterministic flow model m as 1 q t m m 0 i t θ which has a set of initial conditions m 0 time dependent inputs i t ℝ m and a vector of model parameters θ ℝ d and which solution renders the simulated flow dynamics at a certain location q t ℝ m then we aim to find a linear combination of polynomials only dependent on the parametric space which approximate a map between θ and q t θ as 2 q t θ c t t ϕ θ in which ϕ θ ℝ n x 1 is a series of n orthogonal polynomials constructed as basis of the joint probability density function of the parameter space θ and c t ℝ n x 1 is a vector of coefficients c i t ℝ m to be fitted to the particular model response the output space q t θ is interpolated through a weighted sum of polynomials the fitting process is performed by deriving the model output at i 1 k known parameter combinations θ q i as m m 0 i t θ q i q t q i the model samples and the polynomial approximation can be written as a system of equations 3 q t q 1 q t q k ϕ 1 q 1 ϕ n q 1 ϕ 1 q k ϕ n q k c 1 t c n t in which the only unknown factors are the coefficients c i t this system can be expressed in matrix form as 4 q t q p q c t for which p ℝ k x n is the matrix of polynomials values corresponding to each parameter sample by ensuring that the system is overdetermined k n this system can be approximated by a least squares minimisation 5 c t p q t p q 1 p q t q t q thus the values of c t are approximated so they map the selected polynomial basis ϕ θ and the sampled output series q t q then the expression of equation 2 can be used to interpolate the targeted output series to different values of the parameter set this is known as a non intrusive collocation method other fitting methods and sampling strategies are discussed in hadigol and doostan 2018 the orthogonal polynomials should be chosen as basis of the parameter probabilistic space xiu and karniadakis 2002 provided a range of known polynomial basis and stochastic variable distributions in this case training parameter distributions were always considered independent and uniformly distributed this has associated the legendre polynomials the creation of orthogonal polynomial series was done using the implementation of gautschi 1994 which uses a three term recursion relation for univariate polynomials 6 ϕ n 1 θ i ϕ n θ i θ i a n ϕ n 1 θ i b n a n e θ i ϕ n 2 e ϕ n 2 b n e ϕ n 2 e ϕ n 1 2 ϕ 1 0 ϕ 0 1 where ϕ n θ i represents the nth polynomial of the ith parameter as the parametric space is considered stochastically independent the multivariate orthogonal expansion was obtained by multiplying the univariate ones 7 ϕ n θ ϕ n θ 1 ϕ n θ d in practice the polynomial series is truncated at a certain order p which is selected such that a desired level of accuracy is achieved then the number of polynomials and thus of associated c i t to be approximated is 8 n p d p d which is related to the polynomial truncation order p and to the dimensionality of the parameter vector d 2 3 emulator structure a polynomial chaos emulator can be used to represent an interpolation map between model parameters and the model unitary hydrograph response bellos et al 2017 this is done by propagating a unitary rainfall event of 10 mm at combinations of model parameter θ q i and fitting a pce as described previously to the output unitary response u h 10 m m t θ 9 u h 10 m m t θ c 10 m m t t ϕ 10 m m θ the total hydrograph shape is then reconstructed for any given rainfall event and combination of parameters this relies on the proportionality and superposition assumptions of the uh theory which has proven insufficient to capture the real model dynamics in previous attempts bellos et al 2017 the observed error in the comparison between the hydrodynamic simulator and the composition of the uh was separated in two sources a error due to the proportionality assumption b error due to the superposition assumption according to the proportionality principle the uh relates linearly to rainfall intensity this assumption is not valid when dealing with a non linear model structure in order to correct for this error source the behaviour of the unitary hydrograph to rainfall intensity was transferred to the pce emulator this was achieved by training the emulator through variations of the model parametric space and of the unitary rainfall intensity r instead of using a fixed 10 mm event to derivate the uh 10 u h p t θ r c p t t ϕ p θ r with this approach the emulator uhp included the proportional non linear effect this corrected for the proportionality error of the classical uh theory which was tested by reproducing the behaviour of a non linear tank in series model to variations of unitary rainfall intensity on the other hand the superposition error is linked to the model dynamic state according to uh theory the flow response is unitary and independent in previous states and therefore fails to capture non linear processes in order to transfer the information of the system state to the emulator structure we propose a new method to sample the real simulator and to build a unitary rainfall emulator uhps fig 1 depicts the emulator development process this structure was based on two simplification phases first a pce emulator scheme was built following these steps 1 a series of samples were drawn from the model parametric space θ q i and from two extra parameters r and r p which represented two consecutive unitary rainfall steps with duration d t selected following the uh theory 2 two samples were drawn from the original simulator using the same parameter sample q i but using a rainfall time series input of r t t r p r 0 0 d t and r p t r p 0 0 0 d t respectively which are vectors of input rainfall intensity at a given d t time step the difference between the two output hydrographs was computed as m θ q i r t t m θ q i r p t which provided an approximation of the state response of the model equations when a rainfall intensity r p preceded a rainfall intensity r this response contains the proportionality non linear error information along with the superposition error at one rainfall lag the set of unitary responses was stored in a database 3 the model unitary responses from the database were used to train a pce emulator as 11 u h p s t θ r r p c p s t t ϕ p s θ r r p 4 the performance of the unitary emulator was tested on several samples which were not used to train the model once fitted the interpolator pce a second simplification phase is performed 5 the unitary responses from uhps are used to reconstruct new rainfall parametric scenarios 6 effective rainfall is computed if required and 7 superposing all unitary model responses obtained from equation 11 which corresponds to the unitary response of the model under the parameter set θ and the given rainfall event additionally initial boundary conditions can also be included in the emulation phase by conceptualising them as extra model parameters 2 4 case studies 2 4 1 simplified flow model in order to illustrate the impact of non linearities in the basic assumptions of the unit hydrograph theory superposition and proportionality a basic synthetic model was used fig 2 this simple rainfall runoff model structure was conceptualised as a chain of non linear tanks 12 d v i d t q i n q o u t q o u t a v i b where v i represents the volume stored at the i th tank q i n the flow entering in the tank from the previous structure and q o u t represents the outflow which follows a non linear relationship with the current tank storage eq 1 the discharge is driven by a proportional coefficient a and an exponential parameter b the runoff was calculated as q i n t a n k s a r from a certain area a and was separated in two lines of five and three tanks which converged at the outflow fig 2 both tank lines shared the exponential parameter b but had different proportional coefficients namely a and a r infiltration was set to 0 thus the model was composed by a set of ordinary differential equations odes 13 q o u t f l o w m s i m p l i f i e d a a r b a r t represented by m s i m p l i f i e d which depends in the set of tank parameters the catchment s area a and in a rainfall input r t the parameters were manually selected a 1 4 a r 2 2 b 1 2 and a 5 in order to force a non linear dynamic behaviour rainfall time series were supplied with a frequency of 10 min the effect of non linearities and its correction through the use of the proposed emulator were computed on the simplified model at the fixed set of parameters additionally an example is provided in which the full parameter space was used as an input for the emulator the surrogate structure was trained using 3000 samples drawn from a latin hypercube sampling lhs scheme of the full parametric space a a r b a r r p where the first four elements referred to model parameters and the last two encoded the rainfall process distribution and ranges used at the training dataset are described in table 1 an uncertainty analysis scheme was also implemented using the emulated structure from an elicited parameter probability distribution table 2 a total of 1000 samples were drawn from a monte carlo sampling scheme assuming independency of parameters this contained the four model parameters a a r a b and a rainfall multiplier k r a i n f a l l which modified the rainfall input 2 4 2 physically based flow model the applicability of the proposed emulation technique in physically based real scale models was tested by representing the dynamic response of the full solution of the 2d swe in two synthetic studies a computational domain was created using a parabolic shape to represent a surface elevation model fig 3 the surface elevation model z x y in meters adopted the following form 14 z x y α α 0 x y y 0 2 β x c where α 10 4 α 0 1 5 x 10 7 y 0 250 β 5 x 10 3 and c 10 the computational domain was discretised in square shaped cells of 10 10 m whereas a gate of 100 m width was located at the outlet of the catchment where runoff was measured the system had a surface of 0 26 km2 which is representative of a small catchment characterised by fast response model swe parabola additionally a set of five obstacles square reflective boundaries was located near the centre of the computational domain model swe urban the numerical solver used for the flow dynamics simulation was the flow r2d model which solves the full form of 2d swe the implementation consisted on the finite difference method and a modified version of mccormack numerical scheme bellos and tsakiris 2015 the time step was δt 0 01 s whereas for the diffusion factor a typical value of ω 0 999 was selected the manning equation was used to represent friction the threshold which distinguishes wet and dry cells was selected equal to h dry 10 4 m for numerical reasons an initial thin film of water equal to 1 1 10 5 m was set up in the catchment this film was infiltrated in the first 15 min through the sink term of the mass equation of the 2d swe in a constant rate in order to preserve mass balance between rainfall and runoff volumes the boundaries of the catchment were set as walls through the reflection boundary technique in order to preserve mass balance as well whereas the outlet of the catchment was set as open boundaries tsakiris and bellos 2014 a rainfall input series with a time step of 15 min the emulator scheme was implemented using variations of the surface manning roughness n as a model parameter constant in the spatial domain table 3 presents the parametric distributions at training a total of 300 samples were performed on the two simulators drawn from a lhs the 2d swe simulator generated numerical instabilities at very low rainfall intensities thus the sampling scheme was reduced to r p 0 2 and r 0 2 from the remaining dataset 264 samples were used for training and 30 for validation of the pce accuracy a 5th order legendre polynomial set was used in both cases additionally a validation set of rainfall and parametric scenarios table b 1 was used to compare the fit between the original simulators and the proposed surrogate models 2 5 performance indicators the fit between model and emulator derived flow time series was assessed by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 15 n s e 1 t 0 t e t s t 2 t 0 t s t s 2 where e t denoted the emulated and s t the simulated values at time t and s the mean value of the simulated series besides a peak relative error pre index was used in order to assess the accuracy of the flow maximum peak emulation which follows 16 p r e s p e a k e p e a k s p e a k where s p e a k and e p e a k are the simulated and emulated values associated with the peak flow of the hydrograph 3 results and discussion 3 1 correcting uh errors due to non linearities the simplified tank in series model was used to test the effect of superposition and proportionality assumptions in the reconstruction of hydrographs based in the uh linear theory the model parameters were defined as described in the materials section to force a non linear routing process b 1 2 fig 4 shows the mismatch between a uh linear derived hydrograph reconstruction from a 10 mm 10 min rainfall and the original simulator in the x axis a set of unitary 10 min rainfall events is supplied with a ramping intensity between 1 and 50 mm the color map represents hydrograph response the normalised residuals at each time step are shown below which were computed as 17 ε t s t e t s t where s t is the flow simulated at time t and e t the corresponding emulated values in the right fig 4 the simulated approximated by the uh theory and residual values are shown for a 30 mm unitary rainfall the residual structure indicates that for rainfall intensities above or below 10 mm the performance of the uh reconstruction rapidly decreases this is due to the non linear behaviour of the flow propagation which explains why higher intensities are heavily underestimated and lower intensities overestimated through the linear representation of the uh fig 5 shows the effect of proportionality when using the uhp emulator in this case the rainfall intensity is included in the surrogate structure and thus the unitary response derivation represents the effect of non linearities due to proportionality the residual structure indicates a high similarity between the emulator simulator outputs when using only unitary rainfall at varying intensities fig 6 depicts the errors due to the superposition of the unit hydrograph in the x axis a set of 100 rainfall events with varying duration and intensity were used as input for the simulator and for the uhp emulator the rainfall events had a random duration of between 10 and 50 min and a rainfall intensity ranging from 2 to 18 mm 10min the x axis was sorted by rainfall volume in the right the effect of a constant rainfall intensity of 12 mm 10min during 30 min is shown the effect of non linearities is still present in this case although the proportional factor was corrected as shown in fig 5 this indicates that the system state influences the response and thus should be accounted for in non linear systems fig 7 shows the correction done by the use of the proposed emulator structure uhps this structure partially compensates for the proportional and the superposition effects the residual plot in fig 7 shows that these errors are significantly reduced in comparison with the previous scheme uhp the effect of the linear assumptions of the uh theory in hydrograph approximation have been reported in the literature for rural and urban catchments ding 2011 minshall 1960 musy 1998 the example presented shows the separated effect of the superposition and proportionality simplifications of a unit hydrograph and a strategy to correct them in the emulator structure with the use of the tank in series model it was possible to modify the level of non linearity by changing the tank exponent b the reader is directed to the additional material figure a 1 and a 2 where the same effect was computed for the case b 1 which shows the applicability of the uh theory in linear cases nevertheless flow propagation processes are seldom linear and thus this effect is expected to be relevant in most applications 3 2 emulation of the simplified flow model once trained the behaviour of the uhps emulator was compared with the simplified model response for combinations of rainfall and parametric scenarios to that effect 1000 samples were drawn from a monte carlo sampling scheme of an elicited parameter distribution table 2 this contained the four model parameters a a r a b and a rainfall multiplier k r a i n f a l l fig 8 displays the distribution of the performance indicators pre and nse between uhps and the original simulator nse is close to one indicating an accurate fit between simulated emulated time series pre reports the relative error in the peak reproduction which is around 1 2 of the maximum flow fig 9 shows the graphical comparison of the uhps emulator and the simulator for the initial parameter sample at a particular rainfall series along with the mean and 95 interval of the 1000 parameter samples performed on the emulator 3 3 emulation of the 2 d shallow water equations the dynamics of the 2d swe were emulated following the same process as in the simplified example fig 10 shows the nse values for the emulated simulated unitary responses at 30 combinations of parameters contained in the testing dataset this served to validate the emulator of the unitary responses we compared the emulator uhps which takes into account the error due to proportionality and superposition the emulator uhp only the proportionality error the conventional composition of the uh linear using 10 mm unitary rainfall and the results derived from the 2d swe hydrodynamic simulators swe parabola and swe urban in a set of 8 validation scenarios appendix b table b 1 for varying rainfall time series and roughness coefficient values table 4 presents the nse and pre values for all cases comparing with the hydrodynamic simulator there is a clear increase in performance by the use of the proposed emulator structure uhps when approximating the flow dynamics this increase is denoted by the high nse values and a pre one order of magnitude lower than the other emulator structures in general the use of the proportional correction uhp is not sufficient and although it reproduces the hydrograph peak better than the simple use of the linear uh structure denoted by the lower pre values specially in rainfall events where the maximum intensity differs from 10 mm as in validation events 0 to 3 it is heavily affected by the superposition error as seen in the validation events 4 to 7 the use of uhps improves the reconstruction of the simulated hydrograph and it captures the timing of the flow peak in all tested cases for both geometrical scenarios fig 11 shows a graphical comparison between the emulated and simulated values for the validation 0 and validation 1 scenarios for the simulator swe urban uhps has a close fit to the simulator dynamics with an error in the peak estimation of 1 5 the comparison of swe parabola and swe urban are also shown in fig 11 were the effect of geometrical obstacles of the second scheme generates a slightly delayed and attenuated flow response which led to a decrease in performance of uhlinear and uhp the reader is directed to the additional material for the graphical comparison at the 8 validation scenarios for the two simulators figure b 1 and b 2 one of the advantages of the proposed methodology uhps structure is that the emulation errors can be decomposed directly in two sources a errors in the emulation of the unitary responses through a pce and b errors in the reconstruction of the hydrograph by composition of the unitary responses the errors in phase a can be described by comparing the pce emulator and the simulator in a set of test parameter scenarios this source is dependent on the capability of the emulation technique used to represent the link between the unitary response and the parameter space which can be reduced in two ways 1 by carefully selecting the emulator structure which should be capable of representing a dynamic output such as a pce xiu and karniadakis 2002 by using a gaussian process as in carbajal et al 2017 bayesian networks conti and o hagan 2010 or recurrent neural networks gers et al 2002 2 by increasing the training dataset size sampling from the simulator phase b involves reconstructing the hydrograph from the unitary responses the effect of the proportionality simplification is well represented by including the rainfall intensity in the emulator structure however the superposition composition has a dependency on the system dynamics and the unitary rainfall length for highly dynamic systems high frequency rainfall data could be necessary and thus accounting for only one temporal step in the superposition scheme might not be sufficient a limitation of the proposed methodology is that its applicability is restricted to rainfall spatial homogeneity the generalisation to spatio temporal rainfall variability poses a challenge since it will increase significantly the degrees of freedom of the unitary response which should be captured by the emulator phase thus requiring a much larger number of samples from the real simulator also in practice the number of accounted parameters is limited in this approach when using the pce emulator the number of polynomials follows equation 8 which depends on the dimension of the parameter space d and the grade of the polynomial series p this relationship grows rapidly forcing to increase the number of samples from the original model thus for large dimensional spaces the number of required model samples could render the training impractical for instance the training of the swe parabola and swe urban emulators was done through 260 unitary responses requiring a total of 1040 2080 computation hours training was performed in the hpc platform of the computational centre of the national technical university of athens details are provided in table 5 the emulator sampling at the validation tests took 40 ms per iteration in a 2 2 ghz intel core i7 which represents a significant time reduction the benefit of proposing an emulator is strongly case dependent and is linked to the number of required parameters and shape of the simulator response fig 12 provides a measure for the increase in performance measured by the decrease in l2 norm with the training data set size for the three tested emulators the stabilization of performance can be used to design a sequential sampling scheme which can reduce the number of simulator samples 4 conclusion in this work a novel methodology to perform emulation of flow derived from hydrodynamic simulators is presented this method allows approximating hydrographs generated by physically based hydrodynamic modelling under variations of model parameter values and rainfall series this method is based on the combined use of the unit hydrograph theory uh and a polynomial chaos expansion pce emulator the use of the unit hydrograph theory is based upon the assumption that the underlying process is linear this assumption is seldom met in physically based hydrodynamic simulators since the driving equations are fundamentally non linear in this new approach information of the non linear reaction of the model is encoded in the pce structure by means of a dedicated sampling scheme the performance of the emulator was tested in three case studies a a simplified flow routing model based on a non linear tank cascade b c two synthetic computational domains simulated through the full form of the 2d shallow water equations in the three simulators the proposed emulator structure could approximate an output hydrograph under various combinations of rainfall time series and model parameters a comparison between the performance of the proposed emulator structure uhps and the use of the classical uh theory is also provided this demonstrated that errors induced by the linear assumption of the uh theory can be significant when dealing with simulators based on the solution of the 2d swe the method still has several limitations for instance the emulator can only accept spatially uniform rainfall time series this can pose a severe constrain when dealing with large scale catchments also rainfall series inputs should have a constant sampling frequency errors in the emulator simulator structure are expected to increase if the selected rainfall step duration is much smaller than the catchment s concentration time for highly non linear models since the unit hydrograph superposition error will become dominant the number of independent parameters is also limited in practice this is a limitation of the emulator structure used pce since the number of required model samples increases rapidly with the dimensionality of the parametric space nonetheless other data driven surrogate strategies can be easily implemented further research should be conducted in these areas the proposed methodology has the potential to significantly increase the range of applications of physically based flow propagation schemes which is currently hampered by the computational burden author contributions amr developed the required software and carried out the simulations and data analysis vb produced the

underlying dynamics figure a 1 shows the comparison between the simplified model described in the first case study using b 1 thus a set of linear tanks and the use of a unit hydrograph derived from the response at 10 mm rainfall for an increasing unitary rainfall intensity from 1 to 50 mm 10min figure shows the same comparison for the joint proportionality and superposition assumptions for rainfall inputs of varying length 10 50 min and intensity 1 20 mm 10min in those cases the classical uh theory can describe the model behaviour correctly which is denoted by the almost null residual

19491,uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops that efficiently eliminate organic pollutants during water treatment have been the subject of numerous investigations most organic pollutants are not completely mineralized during uv aops but are partially oxidized into transformation products tps thereby adding complexity to the treated water and posing risks to humans ecological systems and the environment while the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of pollutants have been widely documented there is little information about the risks associated with tps in this review we have collated recent knowledge about the harmful tps that are generated in uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis two uv aops that have been studied extensively toxic and assimilable tps were ubiquitously observed in more than 80 of uv aops of organic pollutants of which the toxicity and assimilability levels changed with variations in the reaction conditions such as the uv fluence and oxidant dosage previous studies and modeling assessments showed that toxic and assimilable tps may be generated during hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination among various reactions tps generated from dealkylation and decarboxylation were generally less and more toxic than the parent pollutants respectively tps generated from decarboxylation and deamination were generally less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants respectively there is also potential concern about the sensory unpleasant tps generated by oxidations and subsequent metabolism of microorganisms in this overview we stress the need to include both the concentrations of organic pollutants and the evaluations of the risks from tps for the quality assessments of the water treated by uv aops graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv advanced oxidation process organic pollutants transformation products toxicity assimilability risk 1 introduction over the centuries water treatment has made a remarkable contribution to the development of society and the integrity of ecosystems by ensuring a clean drinking water supply removing contaminants from wastewater and reducing the burden on ecosystems and the environment council 1999 wiesmann et al 2007 sun et al 2016 increases in the population and rates of urbanization pose serious challenges to water treatment such as severe water shortages and the deterioration of water quality ternes et al 2004 michael et al 2013 luo et al 2014 unwwap 2015 chen et al 2017 in response to the challenges of availability and quality advanced treatments are being developed to work

of treated water parsons 2004 yang et al 2014 gmurek et al 2017 in uv aops uv light and chemical oxidants e g h2o2 persulfate and chlorine or photocatalysts work synergistically to degrade pollutants by generating highly oxidative radical species such as oh so4 cl and co3 with reductive potentials of 2 80 2 51 2 40 and 1 78 v respectively asghar et al 2015 wang et al 2016 lai et al 2017 radical quantum yields of 0 57 2 8 were reported for uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv chlorine heidt et al 1948 goldstein et al 2007 remucal and manley 2016 and oh quantum yield of 0 01 0 05 was reported for uv photocatalysis these reported quantum yields indicate that the fluence of uv photocatalysis was expected to be higher for removing recalcitrant pollutants than uv h2o2 uv persulfate and uv chlorine pelaez et al 2012 collins and bolton 2016 studies have reported applications of uv aops to attenuate pharmaceuticals remove taste and odor compounds and reduce disinfection byproduct precursors in both drinking water and reclaimed water treatment matilainen and sillanpää 2010 antonopoulou et al 2014 zoschke et al 2014 barbosa et al 2016 stefan 2017 in most cases organic pollutants are not completely mineralized by uv aops but are partially oxidized into transformation products tps being ubiquitously detected in the treated water and adding complexity to the cocktail of the treated water as shown in fig 1 although present at low concentrations tps may threaten the health of humans and living organisms and may also damage eco systems and impede the smooth operation of uv aops escher and fenner 2011 haddad et al 2015 prasse et al 2015 wang et al 2018 we should therefore be mindful of the concerns about harmful tps generated in uv aops of drinking water and reclaimed water in addition more attention should be paid to the treatment of reclaimed water as higher concentrations and more kinds of organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matter dom were generally observed in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent than those in surface water in this review we have mainly considered harmful tps that are generated by uv aops especially during those frequently used such as uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis harmful tps can be classified into toxic tps assimilable tps and sensory unpleasant tps by their potential risk fig 1 toxic tps may have various adverse effects on a wide range of organisms such as inhibiting the activity of luminescent bacteria being cytotoxic or genotoxic to mammalian cell and being eco toxic to microalgae daphnia manga and fish cao et al 2009 stalter et al 2010 hofman caris et al 2015 assimilable tps can support the proliferation of heterotrophic microorganisms resulting in a decrease in biostability and an increase in the risks for the treated water coelho et al 2009 lester et al 2013 li et al 2017 assimilable tps may also induce the accumulation of biomass such that the quality of the treated water deteriorates and sensory unpleasant products are produced sensory unpleasant tps can decrease the organoleptic quality and increase the impacts on humans from unpleasant tastes and odors antonopoulou et al 2014 the sensory unpleasant tps in the treated water are mainly derived from and so are closely related to assimilable tps zhao 2014 the toxicity and assimilability of tps influence the safety of the treated water information about the relative toxicity or relative assimilability of tps to the parent pollutants is therefore important so that we can carry out comprehensive assessments of the performance of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis here we review the potential risks posed by toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant tps generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matter dom we first provide a summary of the general characteristics of harmful tps including changes in the levels of harmful tps and the factors that influence the generation of harmful tps we also review representative tps generated during a range of specific reactions and assess the levels of harmful tps with a particular focus on organic micropollutants 2 toxic transformation products 2 1 toxicity of the treated pollutants 2 1 1 toxicity changes versus concentration changes while analytical methods can be used to provide accurate measurements of the pollutant concentrations in water treated by uv aops they cannot appropriately evaluate either the changes in toxicity or the risks from the treated pollutants as a complement to chemical analysis toxicological assays are increasingly used to assess the toxicity of treated water cwiertny et al 2014 microorganisms plants and algae invertebrates and fishes are commonly used in these assays because they are easy to monitor and are sensitive to contaminants rizzo 2011 we summarized the changes in the toxicity and the concentrations of some common organic micropollutants in pure solutions during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis as shown in fig 2 where three most widely used toxicological organisms were chosen bioluminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna the relative toxicity r toxicity and the relative concentration r concentration were used to indicate the changes in toxicity and concentration respectively and are defined as follows 1 r toxicity toxicity t toxicity 0 2 r concentration c t c 0 where toxicityt and toxicity0 are the toxicities of the treated and parent pollutants respectively and c t and c 0 are the concentrations of the treated and parent pollutants respectively the relationship between r toxicity and r concentration during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis can be divided into three regions i ii and iii as shown in fig 2 in a perfect situation region i in fig 2 the toxicity or risk should be simultaneously removed as the parent pollutant degrades for example the toxicities of parathion and trifluralin to luminescent bacteria kim et al 2006 chelme ayala et al 2010 fenofibric acid to microalgae rizzo et al 2009 and atenolol to daphnia magna hapeshi et al 2010 were removed as the parent pollutant degraded and non toxic tps were generated however the removal rate of toxicity is often slower than the rate at which the pollutant concentration decreases region ii in fig 2 as has been reported for the toxicities of bisphenol a and triclosan to luminescent bacteria stamatis et al 2014 olmez hanci et al 2015 dipyrone and reactive black 5 to microalgae balcioglu et al 2001 and diuron and ibuprofen to daphnia magna malato et al 2003 candido et al 2016 in these cases some tps that were less toxic than the parent pollutant were generated in the third scenario the treated pollutant may be more toxic than the parent pollutants region iii in fig 2 as was found for the toxicity of sulfamethoxazole tetracycline and trimethoprim to luminescent bacteria lópez peñalver et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 diclofenac and ibuprofen to microalgae rizzo et al 2009 candido et al 2016 and diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole to daphnia magna nasuhoglu et al 2011 michael et al 2014 in these cases tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants were generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis toxic tps were also generated during the degradation of bulk dom by uv aops studies have shown that doms from drinking water source surface water or wwtp effluent can be oxidized by uv photocatalysis or uv h2o2 and generate some tps that are more toxic to daphnia magna or luminescence bacteria than the parent dom rizzo et al 2014 rueda márquez et al 2015 2016 as well as causing acute toxicity to the organisms mentioned above e g luminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna some toxic tps that induce mutagenic toxicity genotoxicity or estrogenic toxicity can be generated during uv aops of micropollutants and dom vasquez et al 2013b diniz et al 2015 hofman caris et al 2015 mboula et al 2015 skoutelis et al 2017 therefore we need to quantify the toxicity of tps produced in uv aops of micropollutants or dom 2 1 2 toxicity levels of tps using data from the studies listed in text s1 we quantitatively evaluated the relative toxicities r toxicity of the treated pollutants to the parent pollutants organic micropollutants and dom we used a range of toxicological assays to indicate changes in toxicity such as acute toxicity to luminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna and other toxicity e g endocrine activity genotoxicity and cytotoxicity as shown in fig 3 the r toxicity varied as the removals of the parent pollutants varied i when the removal efficiency was 50 r concentration 0 5 the r toxicity ranged from 0 02 to 4 40 5th to 95th percentile with average and median values of 1 50 and 1 09 respectively less than 20 of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis resulted in an r toxicity of less than 0 5 when the r concentration was 0 5 indicating that the probability was higher than 80 for the generation of toxic tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants what s worse the probability exceeded 51 for generating tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants ii toxic tps were more prominent at removal efficiencies of 90 r concentration 0 1 than at 50 the r toxicity ranged from 0 03 to 11 3 5th to 95th percentile when the r concentration was 0 1 with average and median values of 3 1 and 1 3 respectively which were higher than those when the r concentration was 0 5 less than 13 of the uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis resulted in r toxicity values of less than 0 1 when the r concentration was 0 1 suggesting that the probability was greater than 86 for generating toxic tps while the probability was around 57 for generating more toxic tps than the parent pollutants iii in the scenario that the toxic tps accumulated to a maximum the r toxicity ranged from 1 0 to 20 0 5th to 95th percentile with average and median values of 5 6 and 2 0 respectively which were much higher than those for r concentration of 0 5 and 0 1 toxic tps were also commonly observed during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of bulk dom because it is difficult to quantitatively assess the degradation of dom values of the r toxicity were statistically evaluated for the worst scenario where the toxic tps accumulated to a maximum the r toxicity ranged from 1 03 to 12 5 5th to 95th percentile with average and median values of 4 1 and 3 8 respectively being comparable to the values for organic micropollutants these results highlight several points i toxic tps are commonly generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants 80 of oxidations and tps that were more toxic than the parent micropollutants were generated in more than 51 cases of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis ii uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis need to operate in optimal conditions so that toxic tps cannot accumulate and the worst scenario can be avoided iii assessments of the pollutant elimination efficiency for uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis should include both chemical analysis of pollutant concentrations and toxicological bioassay of risk from tps 2 2 influencing factors 2 2 1 organic micropollutants uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis include direct photolysis and indirect oxidation radical species oxidation e g oh h and e the concentrations and toxicities of tps generated by direct photolysis or indirect oxidation vary with changes in the operational parameters such as the uv fluence oxidant dose h2o2 or photocatalyst and the solution ph as previously reported the tps generated by direct photolysis of organic micropollutants in pure solutions under both low lpuv and medium mpuv pressure hg uv lamps accumulated as the uv fluence increased and were toxic to organisms such as luminescent bacteria microalgae daphnia magna and zebrafish this was observed during mpuv direct photolysis of ibuprofen li et al 2015 gabapentin herrmann et al 2015 thalidomide mahmoud et al 2014 diclofenac diniz et al 2015 and carbamazepine donner et al 2013 and lpuv direct photolysis of fenofibric acid tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole jiao et al 2008 nasuhoglu et al 2011 santiago et al 2011 toxic tps also accumulated during solar uv photolysis of cephalosporin antibiotics wang and lin 2012 and during solar photolysis of a mixture of 27 pharmaceuticals wang and lin 2014 as the uv fluence increased further toxic tps may in a few cases be reduced by direct photolysis as has been reported for lpuv photolysis of oxytetracycline doxycycline and ciprofloxacin at uv fluences of more than 4000 mj cm2 yuan et al 2011 in contrast to direct photolysis toxic tps generated from uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants in pure solution were only observed when the uv fluence was low and then were destroyed when the uv fluence was high i toxic tps were generated during uv photocatalysis of venlafaxine tradolm and oxazaphosphorine when the uv fluence was low in a luminescent bacteria bioassay system but were destroyed under a high uv fluence lai et al 2015 antonopoulou and konstantinou 2016 lambropoulou et al 2017 similar patterns were also observed during the uv photocatalysis of ibuprofen ofloxacin triclosan and diclofenac with daphnia magna or microalgae as the toxicological bioassays michael et al 2014 stamatis et al 2014 candido et al 2016 ii toxic tps were generated in uv h2o2 systems when the uv fluence was low and then were transferred into tps with reduced toxicity when the uv fluence was high this pattern was observed during the degradation of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole oxytetracycline doxycycline ciprofloxacin and bisphenol a with luminescent bacteria as the toxicological species yuan et al 2011 olmez hanci et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and was also observed during the degradation of imidazole compounds atrazine caffeine diclofenac and fenofibric acid with daphnia magna or microalgae as the toxicological species santiago et al 2011 kotnik et al 2016 spasiano et al 2016a b in a few cases uv h2o2 oxidation gave exceptional results for example santiago et al 2011 observed that lpuv h2o2 of fenofibric acid generated tps that were either non toxic or less toxic to microalgae p subcapitata than the parent pollutant even under low fluence gu et al 2017 observed that lpuv h2o2 of 2 4 6 tribromophenol generated tps that were either non toxic or less toxic to microorganisms in active sludge than the parent pollutant alharbi et al 2017 also reported that at h2o2 dose of 120 mg l and uv fluence of 1200 mj cm2 lpuv h2o2 oxidation of diclofenac carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim generated tps that are non toxic to luminescent bacteria the dose of h2o2 or the photocatalyst and the solution ph are expected to influence the generation or accumulation of toxic tps for example in lpuv photocatalysis cyclophosphamide became more toxic to luminescent bacteria and the increase in toxicity was more significant for lower rather than higher dose of the photocatalyst lin and lin 2014 lu et al 2018 reported that toxic tps were generated during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of microcystin lr and that the toxicity of treated mr lc increased as the h2o2 microcystin lr ratio increased from 10 to 1000 few studies however have investigated how tps are generated and accumulate under different operational conditions such as different oxidant doses and solution ph values 2 2 2 dissolved organic matter the factors that influenced the generation of toxic tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis direct photolysis was also included of dom were more complex than those of organic micropollutants here we reviewed doms from different water matrices including surface water ground water wwtp effluent and reverse osmosis concentrates first uv light source affects the generation of toxic tps mutagenic or genotoxic tps were generated during mpuv direct photolysis or mpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from ground water and surface water heringa et al 2011 hofman caris et al 2015 martijn et al 2015 but genotoxic or mutagenic tps or tps that were toxic to daphnia magna and medaka fish embryos were not generated in lpuv direct photolysis or lpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from ground water or municipal wwtp effluent haider et al 2002 cao et al 2009 heringa et al 2011 richard et al 2014 in addition more toxic tps were generated during mpuv photolysis of dom than during mpuv h2o2 second the generation of toxic tps varied as the dom sources varied tps that were toxic to luminescent bacteria p lividus or dna structures were generated during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from synthetic wastewater petroleum wwtp effluent or biodiesel effluents penders et al 2012 rueda márquez et al 2015 2016 but were not observed during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from ground water or municipal wwtp effluent third the h2o2 dose may also affect the generation of toxic tps during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of dom from biodiesel effluents costa et al 2017 found that tps with similar toxicity to the parent dom were generated at h2o2 doses of less than 4 g l and the toxic tps decreased significantly as the h2o2 continuously increased to 7 g l previous studies suggested that toxic tps were generated during mpuv photolysis in a mixture of other matrices and dom such as nitrate nitrate heringa et al 2011 and martijn et al 2015 found that genotoxic tps increased during mpuv photolysis of a mixture of nitrate nitrite and dom as nitrogenous aromatic structures such as nitrated phenol derivatives 2 and 4 nitrophenol 4 nitrocatechol and 2 6 dinitrotoluene were generated during nitrate nitrite photolysis combined with dom photolysis martijn et al 2014 there is evidence that more genotoxic tps were generated during mpuv photolysis of dom when the nitrate concentration is higher or the transmittance of quartz sleeves of mpuv is higher martijn and kruithof 2012 our assessment of the factors that influence the process indicates that there is always an optimal uv fluence oxidant or photocatalyst loading and light source to achieve low toxicity during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dom however in most recent studies optimization of the operational parameters for uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis has been studied based on the degradation kinetics or mechanisms of pollutants rather than on the toxicity of treated pollutants multiple factors affect the generation of toxic tps so further studies should explore how the toxicity can be optimized and controlled during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis 2 3 representative toxic tps 2 3 1 reactions during uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis the indirect oxidation initiated by oh is the main driver for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis wols and hofman caris 2012 in this review therefore we have mainly discussed tps that are typically generated by indirect radical oxidation of oh radical oh is electrophilic and is ready to be added to unsaturated bonds olefin and aromatic rings abstract hydrogen and cleave bonds resulting in the generation of alcohols ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids minakata et al 2009 we have classified the destruction of pollutants by oh into hydroxylation and related kentonization or carboxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination as shown in fig 4 hydroxylation which occurs on olefins or aromatic rings of pollutants generates hydroxylated tps that will be further oxidized by oh via kentonization and carboxylation the final tps may be aldehydes and aliphatic acids fig 4 a morris et al 1971 alnaizy and akgerman 2000 the tps generated from dealkylation on c n or c o bonds during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of contaminants have been studied frequently fig 4 b lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 kanakaraju et al 2015 jallouli et al 2016 decarboxylation and deamination have also been observed frequently on alkyl chains or aromatic rings of organic pollutants during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis fig 4 c d vogna et al 2004 santiago et al 2011 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 lai et al 2017 2 3 2 representative toxic tps reported in the literature various tps have been detected in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants to facilitate further evaluation we classified the tps as either small molecule tps e g aldehydes aliphatic acids and ketones or primary tps with complex chemical structures it is relatively easy to assay the toxicity of small molecule tps such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes because of the availability of pure chemicals previous investigations reported that carboxylic acids were moderately toxic to luminescent bacteria zhao et al 2017 while ketones and aldehydes were reported to be more toxic than many parent micropollutants when exposed to luminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna zhao et al 2017 it is very difficult to assay experimentally the toxicity of most primary tps because of the lack of pure chemicals some investigations have tried to determine the relationship between the changes in toxicity and the evolution of primary tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis and speculated what toxic tps might result as summarized in table 1 dealkylation especially dealkylation on c n and c o bonds can produce toxic tps for example occurred during dealkylation of venlafaxine lambropoulou et al 2017 methotrexate lai et al 2017 tramadol antonopoulou et al 2016 and atrazine choi et al 2013 toxic tps were also generated in other reactions such as hydroxylation of atrazine choi et al 2013 gabapentin herrmann et al 2015 and diuron solís et al 2016 deamination of carbamazepine donner et al 2013 and methotrexate lai et al 2017 and decarboxylation of ibuprofen michael et al 2014 however few studies have quantitatively reported the toxicity of specific tps 2 3 3 modeling results of the representative tps a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model software ecosar usepa was used to assess the toxicities of tps generated by hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination of pollutants the ecosar model can give the 50 effective concentrations ec50 based on the chemical structures of pollutants or tps the toxicities of tps are expressed as 1 ec50 in this review because a qsar model needs the definite chemical structures of tps it can only be used for organic micropollutants as there is insufficient information about dom the representative tps generated during different organic micropollutants reactions are listed in tables s1 s4 the predicted toxicities of parent pollutants and tps to fish daphnia and algae are shown in fig 5 including the toxicity relationship of tps parent pollutant and the relative toxicity of tp to the parent pollutant toxicitytp toxicity0 the predicted results suggest that to some extent most tps were toxic to fish daphnia or algae 1 ec50 0 01 united nations 2011 with the toxicity lower or higher than that of parent pollutants the toxicities of the tps generated from hydroxylation and deamination were evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line fig 5 a d the modeling result suggested that it s hard to get a uniform rule for the changes in toxicity during hydroxylation and deamination the probability was 40 45 for generating tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants during hydroxylation similarly the probability was 31 69 during deamination with the toxicity to daphnia being most sensitive however most dealkylated tps 63 83 probability were less toxic than the parent pollutants and the probability was more than 90 for generating more toxic tps than the parent pollutants during decarboxylation to further understand the generation of toxic tps some representative tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants were numbered in fig 5 and were examined in more detail in table 2 tps with oh added onto the aromatic ring or the unsaturated n heterocycles were generally more toxic than the parent pollutants as were tps generated from kentonization on aromatic rings however tps with di oh added were predicted to be less toxic than the parent pollutants such as di oh tps generated from oh oxidation of ibuprofen carbamazepine bezafibrate and diclofenac table s1 deaminated tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants were mostly generated from the cleavage of amido bonds or deamination on the unsaturated n heterocyclic the deaminated tps may also result in additions of di oh that is generally less toxic than the parent pollutants the results from the qsar modeling assessment suggest that it would be difficult to establish uniform rules about the toxicities of tps generated by hydroxylation and deamination while that tps are less and more toxic than the parent pollutants in dealkylation and decarboxylation respectively previous studies and our modeling results highlight some representative toxic tps and their associated reactions however the interactions of tps e g synergistic or antagonistic effects on the toxicological results are still unknown further the generation of toxic tps in real surface water or wastewater wwtp effluent may be affected by the matrices e g dom resulting in much more complex situations so far this aspect has not been full considered and further studies should concentrate on the toxicity changes of dom and organic micropollutants in real surface water or wastewater 3 assimilable transformation products the degradation of organic pollutants by uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis generally results in the generation of smaller and more polar tps that are susceptible to biodegradation thayanukul et al 2013 these tps favor the subsequent biological treatment and the mineralization of organic pollutants however can also serve as assimilable carbon and support the proliferation of microorganisms in treated water therefore while uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis may act as pretreatments for biological degradation they may also diminish the biostability of the treated water we quantified the assimilability of tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis the assimilability was surrogated by the normalized values as shown in eq 3 and ranged from 0 low assimilability to 1 high assimilability further we used the relative assimilability r assimilability to compare the assimilability before and after uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis as shown in eq 4 3 assimilability bdoc doc aoc doc or bod cod 4 r assimilability assimilability a f t e r a s s i m i l a b i l t i y b e f o r e where doc dissolved organic carbon represents the total concentration of organic pollutants bdoc biodegradable doc represents the doc that can be mineralized by microorganisms aoc represents the doc that can be converted into biomass by microorganisms bod biological oxygen demand and cod chemical oxygen demand represent the oxygen consumed by microorganisms and chemical reductants respectively and assimilability before and assimilability after represent the assimilability of organic pollutants before and after uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis respectively 3 1 assimilability of the treated pollutants both organic micropollutants and dom treated by uv aops i e uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis in this review were generally more assimilable than the parent pollutants fig 6 a c indicating that more readily biodegraded tps were generated however there were some differences between the patterns for organic micropollutants and dom i the assimilability of micropollutants increased under uv aops but not under direct uv photolysis while the assimilability of dom increased under both direct photolysis and uv aops for instance uv photolysis did not affect the assimilability of ofloxacin solution but uv photocatalyzed ofloxacin was more assimilable than the parent pollutant vasquez et al 2013a the photolysis of dom was reported to convert very hydrophobic acid into hydrophilic charged and hydrophilic neutral fractions that are more assimilable buchanan et al 2005 2008 assimilable tps are mainly generated during uv aops of dom when oh attacks the aromatic ring or olefin of dom bazri et al 2012 black and berube 2014 ii most organic micropollutants had extremely low assimilability 0 1 and then were oxidized into tps that were much more assimilable than the parent pollutants most doms however showed low assimilability between 0 1 and 0 4 and then were oxidized into tps that were moderately more biodegradable than the parent pollutants as shown in fig 6 a c the assimilability of the micropollutants in a few cases was enhanced by 1 5 times the region between the 1 1 line and the 5 1 line and in most cases was enhanced by more than 5 times the region between 5 1 line and vertical axis the opposite was true for dom and the assimilability of dom was in most cases enhanced by 1 5 times from our analysis we found that the assimilability of micropollutants was promoted from around a median of 0 05 0 44 while that of dom was promoted from a median of 0 11 0 29 the frequency distribution of the relative assimilability r assimilability was employed to quantitatively depict the changes in assimilability of micropollutants and dom fig 6 b d the r assimilability of micropollutants ranged from 1 48 to 30 8 5th and 95th percentile with average and median values of 11 1 and 9 1 respectively the r assimilability of dom ranged from 0 90 to 9 61 5th and 95th percentile with average and median values of 3 7 and 2 8 respectively from our analysis we found that moderate promotion 1 5 times and high promotion more than 5 times during the oxidation of micropollutants accounted for about 35 and 64 respectively while moderate and high promotion during the oxidation of dom accounted for about 85 and 15 respectively these results confirm that there was more significant promotion of the assimilability of micropollutants than of dom above results suggested that micropollutants should be more refractory to uv photolysis than dom phenomenon i and that a greater proportion of micropollutants might be converted to assimilable tps than dom during uv aops phenomenon ii this interesting result may be related to the structures of micropollutants and dom most micropollutants include functional groups persisting to biological processes and may be more readily biodegraded after powerful chemical oxidations hübner et al 2015 being partially biodegradable dom have more complex structures than micropollutants even after powerful chemical oxidation the assimilability of dom can only be partially improved in most cases or completely improved if dom are completely converted into tps that are easily biodegraded in a few cases the relationship between the assimilability of treated dom and the concentration of assimilable tps with small molecules has been reported in literature for example in the uv photocatalysis for the concentrates of municipal reverse osmosis changes in the assimilability fit well with changes in the assimilable tps of acetate propionate formate pyruvate and oxalate westerhoff et al 2009 similarly in lpuv h2o2 of nom from surface water aldehydes of propanal butanal acetaldehyde and formaldehyde increased at a pace that was similar to the assimilability of treated dom sarathy and mohseni 2008 3 2 influencing factors on assimilable tps 3 2 1 organic micropollutants the uv fluence oxidant dose h2o2 dose or photocatalysis dose and solution ph are expected to affect the generation of assimilable tps of these however only the influence of the uv fluence is well documented with only limited information about the other two factors assimilable tps accumulate as the uv fluence increases in mpuv h2o2 or lpuv h2o2 as has been reported during mpuv h2o2 of iopromide keen et al 2016 and lpuv h2o2 of aromatic carboxylic acids sulfoaromatics and tri n butyl phosphate and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate watts and linden 2008 kalinski et al 2014 milovac et al 2014 uv photocatalysis usually results in the accumulation of assimilable tps as the uv fluence increases as has been reported during uv photocatalysis of metoprolol oxytetracycline and dimethoate arques et al 2007 pereira et al 2011 romero et al 2014 some investigations also reported that uv photocatalysis could oxidize the assimilable tps when the uv fluence was higher than a specified value for example during uv photocatalysis of sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole baran et al 2006 singh et al 2015 observed similar results in uv photocatalysis of ampicillin tylosin doxycycline and sulfathiazole dissolved oxygen can also influence the generation of assimilable tps mendez arriaga et al 2008 observed that assimilable tps formed only under saturated dissolved oxygen conditions during solar photocatalysis of ibuprofen 3 2 2 dissolved organic matter the uv fluence was reported to play a dual role in the generation of assimilable tps in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of dom i the generated assimilable tps increase continuously as the uv fluence increases as occurred during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of dom from municipal wwtp reverse osmosis concentrate umar et al 2016 municipal wwtp effluent puspita et al 2015 surface water sarathy and mohseni 2008 bazri and mohseni 2016 ii the generation of assimilable tps reached a maximum and then decreased as uv irradiation continued to increase in lpuv h2o2 or vacuum uv h2o2 of dom from municipal wwtp effluent liu et al 2011 and uv photocatalysis of municipal reverse osmosis concentrate westerhoff et al 2009 these two different trends may be attributed to the fact that oh on the one hand transfers the non assimilable tps to assimilable tps but on the other hand degrades assimilable fractions and tps thus the difference between the generation rate and the degradation rate of assimilable tps triggers phenomenon i or phenomenon ii the oxidant dose also affects the generation of assimilable tps liu et al 2011 reported that the generation of assimilable tps reached a maximum when the h2o2 dosage was between 78 and 102 mg l in lpuv h2o2 and vacuum uv h2o2 of municipal wwtp effluent also during oxidation of phenols h2o2 levels were optimal when the h2o2 phenol molar ratio was between 100 and 250 alnaizy and akgerman 2000 in contrast however costa et al 2017 observed that assimilable tps that were generated from lpuv h2o2 of biodiesel effluents decreased as the h2o2 dose increased from 1 to 7 g l alnaizy and akgerman 2000 reported that the solution ph had a limited influence on the lpuv h2o2 of phenols however we need to further determine how the solution ph influences uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of dom 3 3 representative assimilable tps 3 3 1 representative assimilable tps reported in the literature as illustrated in fig 4 small molecular weight products of aliphatic alcohols ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids that are more polar and assimilable than the parent pollutants are generated for example improvements in the assimilability were related to aliphatic tps produced during uv h2o2 oxidation of 1 2 ethanediol 1 4 dioxane stefan and bolton 1998 aromatic carboxylic acids milovac et al 2014 and phenolic compounds nitro hydroxyl and methyl phenols juretic et al 2013 some assimilable tps with complex chemical structures were also generated through reactions on special reactive sites for example pyrazole cleavage tps were generated in uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis of dipyrone giri and golder 2014 hydroxylation tps were generated in uv h2o2 of carbamazepine keen et al 2012 tps with butylaldehyde were generated in uv h2o2 of tri alkyl phosphates watts and linden 2008 and dechlorination and hydroxylation tps were generated in uv photocatalysis of 2 chlorophenol rao et al 2003 3 3 2 modeling results of the representative tps a quantitative structure biodegradability relationships qsbr model software biowin usepa was employed to assess the assimilability of tps generated by hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination of organic micropollutants the miti database which includes 884 organic chemicals tested with the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti protocol was used in this model the representative reactions and corresponding tps for organic micropollutants used in the assimilability assessment are listed in tables s1 s4 the assimilability is reflected by the degradation probability which ranged from 0 low assimilability to 1 0 high assimilability the modeling results for the assimilability of tps and parent pollutants and the statistical results for the relative assimibility r assimilability of tps to parent pollutants are presented in fig 7 tps that are both more assimilable and less assimilable than the parent pollutants are generated by hydroxylation and dealkylation the probabilities that tps are more assimilable than their parent pollutants are 62 and 67 for hydroxylation and dealkylation respectively however tps are less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants for decarboxylation and deamination respectively we find that decarboxylated tps are less assimilable than the parent pollutants a previous study about ozonation of muconic type compounds oxidation of carboxyl groups also reported similar results hübner et al 2015 the carboxyl group generally causes increases in the polarity and bio utility and compounds with carboxyl are generally considered more degradable than those without the reactions listed in tables s1 s4 show that hydroxylation occurs on the olefin amino or aromatic sites hübner et al 2015 assessed the biodegradability of ozonation tps based on the reaction sites with qbsr model and found that tps from olefin ozonation were more biodegradable than the parent pollutants tps from aliphatic amine ozonation were slightly more biodegradable than the parent pollutants and tps from aromatic ring hydroxylation were similarly biodegradable as the parent pollutants 4 sensory unpleasant transformation products compounds with color taste and odor properties can induce unpleasant sensory experiences thereby decreasing the organoleptic quality of drinking water or reclaimed water many researchers have used chemical oxidations e g uv h2o2 chlorination and ozonation to efficiently degrade taste and odor causing pollutants antonopoulou et al 2014 xie et al 2015 however chemical oxidations may also induce the generation of some taste and odor causing tps froese et al 1999 observed that chlorination of dom in drinking water generated odorous aldehydes with low molecular weights that were marshy or swampy and chlorophenols that were medicinal anselme et al 1985 and mallevialle and suffet 1981 observed odorous aldehydes that were fruity or fragrant in ozonated dom however while there are no published investigations of odorous aldehydes we propose that they pose potential risks in uv aops of organic pollutants as shown in fig 8 a we consider the generation of odorous tps in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis should be qualitatively and quantitatively investigated in the future it is widely acknowledged that higher levels of aoc or bdoc cause more rapid proliferation of microorganisms and more rapid deterioration of water quality prest et al 2016 thus taste and odor causing compounds are considered to be generated from the metabolism of microorganisms in the presence of assimilable tps that are generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants especially on microorganism biofilms as shown in fig 8 b zhou et al 2017 for example earthy and musty odors of halo anisoles were generated from halo phenols and methyl donors during metabolism of bacteria including strains of rhodococcus acinetobacter and pseudomonas and fungi including strains of trichoderma strains álvarez rodríguez et al 2002 coque et al 2003 zhou et al 2017 swampy and marshy sulfurous odors were generated from thio containing compounds during the metabolism of various bacteria including thiobacillus sp thiothrix sp rhodobacter sp and sulfuricurvum sp scott and pepper 2010 5 conclusions we have provided an overview of the risks posed by toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant tps generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dom toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant tps are commonly observed and are potential barriers for practical applications of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis the collated literature and modeling results provide a comprehensive understanding of how toxic and assimilable tps are generated from typical oh reactions in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis the key points from our review are as follows toxic tps more toxic or less toxic than the parent pollutants were commonly generated during uv aops i e uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis in this review of organic micropollutants and dom the amounts of toxic tps varied as the removal efficiency of organic pollutants varied the probability of generating toxic tps was 81 during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants of which there was a 50 probability that the generated tps would be more toxic than the parent pollutants previous studies indicate that the toxic tps may be generated from the four representative reactions discussed in this review e g hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination the modeling results show that tps that are more toxic and less toxic than the parent pollutants were generated during hydroxylation and deamination while tps generated from dealkylation and decarboxylation were generally less and more toxic than the parent pollutants respectively in addition the toxicological properties of tps and the corresponding reactions the synergistic and antagonistic effects between tps and the influence of water matrices should be studied in further investigations assimilable tps were generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dom the assimilabilities of treated pollutants were generally 5 times 64 probability and 1 5 times 85 probability that of the parent pollutants for organic micropollutants and dom respectively previous studies indicate that the dealkylation and hydroxylation during ozonation of micropollutants usually results in assimilable tps while our modeling assessment indicated that the tps generated during hydroxylation and dealkylation were either more or less assimilable than the parent pollutants and that the tps generated by the decarboxylation or deamination were generally less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants respectively further experimental information about the assimilability of specific tps is still in shortage during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis and further studies should be conducted for the assimilability assessment the generation of toxic and assimilable tps varied under different operational parameters in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of these the uv fluence was frequently mentioned in future studies the control of harmful tps and the optimal thresholds for uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis should be considered more fully information about ozonation and chlorination of organic pollutants suggests that the direct oxidation and the subsequent metabolism of microorganism may result in sensory unpleasant tps there is potential concern that sensory unpleasant tps may be generated in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants but to date no evidence of this has been published acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51738005 and the

19491,uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops that efficiently eliminate organic pollutants during water treatment have been the subject of numerous investigations most organic pollutants are not completely mineralized during uv aops but are partially oxidized into transformation products tps thereby adding complexity to the treated water and posing risks to humans ecological systems and the environment while the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of pollutants have been widely documented there is little information about the risks associated with tps in this review we have collated recent knowledge about the harmful tps that are generated in uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis two uv aops that have been studied extensively toxic and assimilable tps were ubiquitously observed in more than 80 of uv aops of organic pollutants of which the toxicity and assimilability levels changed with variations in the reaction conditions such as the uv fluence and oxidant dosage previous studies and modeling assessments showed that toxic and assimilable tps may be generated during hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination among various reactions tps generated from dealkylation and decarboxylation were generally less and more toxic than the parent pollutants respectively tps generated from decarboxylation and deamination were generally less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants respectively there is also potential concern about the sensory unpleasant tps generated by oxidations and subsequent metabolism of microorganisms in this overview we stress the need to include both the concentrations of organic pollutants and the evaluations of the risks from tps for the quality assessments of the water treated by uv aops graphical abstract image 1

completely mineralized by uv aops but are partially oxidized into transformation products tps being ubiquitously detected in the treated water and adding complexity to the cocktail of the treated water as shown in fig 1 although present at low concentrations tps may threaten the health of humans and living organisms and may also damage eco systems and impede the smooth operation of uv aops escher and fenner 2011 haddad et al 2015 prasse et al 2015 wang et al 2018 we should therefore be mindful of the concerns about harmful tps generated in uv aops of drinking water and reclaimed water in addition more attention should be paid to the treatment of reclaimed water as higher concentrations and more kinds of organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matter dom were generally observed in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent than those in surface water in this review we have mainly considered harmful tps that are generated by uv aops especially during those frequently used such as uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis harmful tps can be classified into toxic tps assimilable tps and sensory unpleasant tps by their potential risk fig 1 toxic tps may have various adverse effects on a wide range of organisms such as inhibiting the activity of luminescent bacteria being cytotoxic or genotoxic to mammalian cell and being eco toxic to microalgae daphnia manga and fish cao et al 2009 stalter et al 2010 hofman caris et al 2015 assimilable tps can support the proliferation of heterotrophic microorganisms resulting in a decrease in biostability and an increase in the risks for the treated water coelho et al 2009 lester et al 2013 li et al 2017 assimilable tps may also induce the accumulation of biomass such that the quality of the treated water deteriorates and sensory unpleasant products are produced sensory unpleasant tps can decrease the organoleptic quality and increase the impacts on humans from unpleasant tastes and odors antonopoulou et al 2014 the sensory unpleasant tps in the treated water are mainly derived from and so are closely related to assimilable tps zhao 2014 the toxicity and assimilability of tps influence the safety of the treated water information about the relative toxicity or relative assimilability of tps to the parent pollutants is therefore important so that we can carry out comprehensive assessments of the performance of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis here we review the potential risks posed by toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant tps generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dissolved organic matter dom we first provide a summary of the general characteristics of harmful tps including changes in the levels of harmful tps and the factors that influence the generation of harmful tps we also review representative tps generated during a range of specific reactions and assess the levels of harmful tps with a particular focus on organic micropollutants 2 toxic transformation products 2 1 toxicity of the treated pollutants 2 1 1 toxicity changes versus concentration changes while analytical methods can be used to provide accurate measurements of the pollutant concentrations in water treated by uv aops they cannot appropriately evaluate either the changes in toxicity or the risks from the treated pollutants as a complement to chemical analysis toxicological assays are increasingly used to assess the toxicity of treated water cwiertny et al 2014 microorganisms plants and algae invertebrates and fishes are commonly used in these assays because they are easy to monitor and are sensitive to contaminants rizzo 2011 we summarized the changes in the toxicity and the concentrations of some common organic micropollutants in pure solutions during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis as shown in fig 2 where three most widely used toxicological organisms were chosen bioluminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna the relative toxicity r toxicity and the relative concentration r concentration were used to indicate the changes in toxicity and concentration respectively and are defined as follows 1 r toxicity toxicity t toxicity 0 2 r concentration c t c 0 where toxicityt and toxicity0 are the toxicities of the treated and parent pollutants respectively and c t and c 0 are the concentrations of the treated and parent pollutants respectively the relationship between r toxicity and r concentration during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis can be divided into three regions i ii and iii as shown in fig 2 in a perfect situation region i in fig 2 the toxicity or risk should be simultaneously removed as the parent pollutant degrades for example the toxicities of parathion and trifluralin to luminescent bacteria kim et al 2006 chelme ayala et al 2010 fenofibric acid to microalgae rizzo et al 2009 and atenolol to daphnia magna hapeshi et al 2010 were removed as the parent pollutant degraded and non toxic tps were generated however the removal rate of toxicity is often slower than the rate at which the pollutant concentration decreases region ii in fig 2 as has been reported for the toxicities of bisphenol a and triclosan to luminescent bacteria stamatis et al 2014 olmez hanci et al 2015 dipyrone and reactive black 5 to microalgae balcioglu et al 2001 and diuron and ibuprofen to daphnia magna malato et al 2003 candido et al 2016 in these cases some tps that were less toxic than the parent pollutant were generated in the third scenario the treated pollutant may be more toxic than the parent pollutants region iii in fig 2 as was found for the toxicity of sulfamethoxazole tetracycline and trimethoprim to luminescent bacteria lópez peñalver et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 diclofenac and ibuprofen to microalgae rizzo et al 2009 candido et al 2016 and diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole to daphnia magna nasuhoglu et al 2011 michael et al 2014 in these cases tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants were generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis toxic tps were also generated during the degradation of bulk dom by uv aops studies have shown that doms from drinking water source surface water or wwtp effluent can be oxidized by uv photocatalysis or uv h2o2 and generate some tps that are more toxic to daphnia magna or luminescence bacteria than the parent dom rizzo et al 2014 rueda márquez et al 2015 2016 as well as causing acute toxicity to the organisms mentioned above e g luminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna some toxic tps that induce mutagenic toxicity genotoxicity or estrogenic toxicity can be generated during uv aops of micropollutants and dom vasquez et al 2013b diniz et al 2015 hofman caris et al 2015 mboula et al 2015 skoutelis et al 2017 therefore we need to quantify the toxicity of tps produced in uv aops of micropollutants or dom 2 1 2 toxicity levels of tps using data from the studies listed in text s1 we quantitatively evaluated the relative toxicities r toxicity of the treated pollutants to the parent pollutants organic micropollutants and dom we used a range of toxicological assays to indicate changes in toxicity such as acute toxicity to luminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna and other toxicity e g endocrine activity genotoxicity and cytotoxicity as shown in fig 3 the r toxicity varied as the removals of the parent pollutants varied i when the removal efficiency was 50 r concentration 0 5 the r toxicity ranged from 0 02 to 4 40 5th to 95th percentile with average and median values of 1 50 and 1 09 respectively less than 20 of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis resulted in an r toxicity of less than 0 5 when the r concentration was 0 5 indicating that the probability was higher than 80 for the generation of toxic tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants what s worse the probability exceeded 51 for generating tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants ii toxic tps were more prominent at removal efficiencies of 90 r concentration 0 1 than at 50 the r toxicity ranged from 0 03 to 11 3 5th to 95th percentile when the r concentration was 0 1 with average and median values of 3 1 and 1 3 respectively which were higher than those when the r concentration was 0 5 less than 13 of the uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis resulted in r toxicity values of less than 0 1 when the r concentration was 0 1 suggesting that the probability was greater than 86 for generating toxic tps while the probability was around 57 for generating more toxic tps than the parent pollutants iii in the scenario that the toxic tps accumulated to a maximum the r toxicity ranged from 1 0 to 20 0 5th to 95th percentile with average and median values of 5 6 and 2 0 respectively which were much higher than those for r concentration of 0 5 and 0 1 toxic tps were also commonly observed during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of bulk dom because it is difficult to quantitatively assess the degradation of dom values of the r toxicity were statistically evaluated for the worst scenario where the toxic tps accumulated to a maximum the r toxicity ranged from 1 03 to 12 5 5th to 95th percentile with average and median values of 4 1 and 3 8 respectively being comparable to the values for organic micropollutants these results highlight several points i toxic tps are commonly generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants 80 of oxidations and tps that were more toxic than the parent micropollutants were generated in more than 51 cases of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis ii uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis need to operate in optimal conditions so that toxic tps cannot accumulate and the worst scenario can be avoided iii assessments of the pollutant elimination efficiency for uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis should include both chemical analysis of pollutant concentrations and toxicological bioassay of risk from tps 2 2 influencing factors 2 2 1 organic micropollutants uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis include direct photolysis and indirect oxidation radical species oxidation e g oh h and e the concentrations and toxicities of tps generated by direct photolysis or indirect oxidation vary with changes in the operational parameters such as the uv fluence oxidant dose h2o2 or photocatalyst and the solution ph as previously reported the tps generated by direct photolysis of organic micropollutants in pure solutions under both low lpuv and medium mpuv pressure hg uv lamps accumulated as the uv fluence increased and were toxic to organisms such as luminescent bacteria microalgae daphnia magna and zebrafish this was observed during mpuv direct photolysis of ibuprofen li et al 2015 gabapentin herrmann et al 2015 thalidomide mahmoud et al 2014 diclofenac diniz et al 2015 and carbamazepine donner et al 2013 and lpuv direct photolysis of fenofibric acid tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole jiao et al 2008 nasuhoglu et al 2011 santiago et al 2011 toxic tps also accumulated during solar uv photolysis of cephalosporin antibiotics wang and lin 2012 and during solar photolysis of a mixture of 27 pharmaceuticals wang and lin 2014 as the uv fluence increased further toxic tps may in a few cases be reduced by direct photolysis as has been reported for lpuv photolysis of oxytetracycline doxycycline and ciprofloxacin at uv fluences of more than 4000 mj cm2 yuan et al 2011 in contrast to direct photolysis toxic tps generated from uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants in pure solution were only observed when the uv fluence was low and then were destroyed when the uv fluence was high i toxic tps were generated during uv photocatalysis of venlafaxine tradolm and oxazaphosphorine when the uv fluence was low in a luminescent bacteria bioassay system but were destroyed under a high uv fluence lai et al 2015 antonopoulou and konstantinou 2016 lambropoulou et al 2017 similar patterns were also observed during the uv photocatalysis of ibuprofen ofloxacin triclosan and diclofenac with daphnia magna or microalgae as the toxicological bioassays michael et al 2014 stamatis et al 2014 candido et al 2016 ii toxic tps were generated in uv h2o2 systems when the uv fluence was low and then were transferred into tps with reduced toxicity when the uv fluence was high this pattern was observed during the degradation of trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole oxytetracycline doxycycline ciprofloxacin and bisphenol a with luminescent bacteria as the toxicological species yuan et al 2011 olmez hanci et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 and was also observed during the degradation of imidazole compounds atrazine caffeine diclofenac and fenofibric acid with daphnia magna or microalgae as the toxicological species santiago et al 2011 kotnik et al 2016 spasiano et al 2016a b in a few cases uv h2o2 oxidation gave exceptional results for example santiago et al 2011 observed that lpuv h2o2 of fenofibric acid generated tps that were either non toxic or less toxic to microalgae p subcapitata than the parent pollutant even under low fluence gu et al 2017 observed that lpuv h2o2 of 2 4 6 tribromophenol generated tps that were either non toxic or less toxic to microorganisms in active sludge than the parent pollutant alharbi et al 2017 also reported that at h2o2 dose of 120 mg l and uv fluence of 1200 mj cm2 lpuv h2o2 oxidation of diclofenac carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim generated tps that are non toxic to luminescent bacteria the dose of h2o2 or the photocatalyst and the solution ph are expected to influence the generation or accumulation of toxic tps for example in lpuv photocatalysis cyclophosphamide became more toxic to luminescent bacteria and the increase in toxicity was more significant for lower rather than higher dose of the photocatalyst lin and lin 2014 lu et al 2018 reported that toxic tps were generated during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of microcystin lr and that the toxicity of treated mr lc increased as the h2o2 microcystin lr ratio increased from 10 to 1000 few studies however have investigated how tps are generated and accumulate under different operational conditions such as different oxidant doses and solution ph values 2 2 2 dissolved organic matter the factors that influenced the generation of toxic tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis direct photolysis was also included of dom were more complex than those of organic micropollutants here we reviewed doms from different water matrices including surface water ground water wwtp effluent and reverse osmosis concentrates first uv light source affects the generation of toxic tps mutagenic or genotoxic tps were generated during mpuv direct photolysis or mpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from ground water and surface water heringa et al 2011 hofman caris et al 2015 martijn et al 2015 but genotoxic or mutagenic tps or tps that were toxic to daphnia magna and medaka fish embryos were not generated in lpuv direct photolysis or lpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from ground water or municipal wwtp effluent haider et al 2002 cao et al 2009 heringa et al 2011 richard et al 2014 in addition more toxic tps were generated during mpuv photolysis of dom than during mpuv h2o2 second the generation of toxic tps varied as the dom sources varied tps that were toxic to luminescent bacteria p lividus or dna structures were generated during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from synthetic wastewater petroleum wwtp effluent or biodiesel effluents penders et al 2012 rueda márquez et al 2015 2016 but were not observed during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of doms from ground water or municipal wwtp effluent third the h2o2 dose may also affect the generation of toxic tps during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of dom from biodiesel effluents costa et al 2017 found that tps with similar toxicity to the parent dom were generated at h2o2 doses of less than 4 g l and the toxic tps decreased significantly as the h2o2 continuously increased to 7 g l previous studies suggested that toxic tps were generated during mpuv photolysis in a mixture of other matrices and dom such as nitrate nitrate heringa et al 2011 and martijn et al 2015 found that genotoxic tps increased during mpuv photolysis of a mixture of nitrate nitrite and dom as nitrogenous aromatic structures such as nitrated phenol derivatives 2 and 4 nitrophenol 4 nitrocatechol and 2 6 dinitrotoluene were generated during nitrate nitrite photolysis combined with dom photolysis martijn et al 2014 there is evidence that more genotoxic tps were generated during mpuv photolysis of dom when the nitrate concentration is higher or the transmittance of quartz sleeves of mpuv is higher martijn and kruithof 2012 our assessment of the factors that influence the process indicates that there is always an optimal uv fluence oxidant or photocatalyst loading and light source to achieve low toxicity during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dom however in most recent studies optimization of the operational parameters for uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis has been studied based on the degradation kinetics or mechanisms of pollutants rather than on the toxicity of treated pollutants multiple factors affect the generation of toxic tps so further studies should explore how the toxicity can be optimized and controlled during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis 2 3 representative toxic tps 2 3 1 reactions during uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis the indirect oxidation initiated by oh is the main driver for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis wols and hofman caris 2012 in this review therefore we have mainly discussed tps that are typically generated by indirect radical oxidation of oh radical oh is electrophilic and is ready to be added to unsaturated bonds olefin and aromatic rings abstract hydrogen and cleave bonds resulting in the generation of alcohols ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids minakata et al 2009 we have classified the destruction of pollutants by oh into hydroxylation and related kentonization or carboxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination as shown in fig 4 hydroxylation which occurs on olefins or aromatic rings of pollutants generates hydroxylated tps that will be further oxidized by oh via kentonization and carboxylation the final tps may be aldehydes and aliphatic acids fig 4 a morris et al 1971 alnaizy and akgerman 2000 the tps generated from dealkylation on c n or c o bonds during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of contaminants have been studied frequently fig 4 b lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 kanakaraju et al 2015 jallouli et al 2016 decarboxylation and deamination have also been observed frequently on alkyl chains or aromatic rings of organic pollutants during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis fig 4 c d vogna et al 2004 santiago et al 2011 semitsoglou tsiapou et al 2016 lai et al 2017 2 3 2 representative toxic tps reported in the literature various tps have been detected in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants to facilitate further evaluation we classified the tps as either small molecule tps e g aldehydes aliphatic acids and ketones or primary tps with complex chemical structures it is relatively easy to assay the toxicity of small molecule tps such as carboxylic acids and aldehydes because of the availability of pure chemicals previous investigations reported that carboxylic acids were moderately toxic to luminescent bacteria zhao et al 2017 while ketones and aldehydes were reported to be more toxic than many parent micropollutants when exposed to luminescent bacteria microalgae and daphnia magna zhao et al 2017 it is very difficult to assay experimentally the toxicity of most primary tps because of the lack of pure chemicals some investigations have tried to determine the relationship between the changes in toxicity and the evolution of primary tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis and speculated what toxic tps might result as summarized in table 1 dealkylation especially dealkylation on c n and c o bonds can produce toxic tps for example occurred during dealkylation of venlafaxine lambropoulou et al 2017 methotrexate lai et al 2017 tramadol antonopoulou et al 2016 and atrazine choi et al 2013 toxic tps were also generated in other reactions such as hydroxylation of atrazine choi et al 2013 gabapentin herrmann et al 2015 and diuron solís et al 2016 deamination of carbamazepine donner et al 2013 and methotrexate lai et al 2017 and decarboxylation of ibuprofen michael et al 2014 however few studies have quantitatively reported the toxicity of specific tps 2 3 3 modeling results of the representative tps a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model software ecosar usepa was used to assess the toxicities of tps generated by hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination of pollutants the ecosar model can give the 50 effective concentrations ec50 based on the chemical structures of pollutants or tps the toxicities of tps are expressed as 1 ec50 in this review because a qsar model needs the definite chemical structures of tps it can only be used for organic micropollutants as there is insufficient information about dom the representative tps generated during different organic micropollutants reactions are listed in tables s1 s4 the predicted toxicities of parent pollutants and tps to fish daphnia and algae are shown in fig 5 including the toxicity relationship of tps parent pollutant and the relative toxicity of tp to the parent pollutant toxicitytp toxicity0 the predicted results suggest that to some extent most tps were toxic to fish daphnia or algae 1 ec50 0 01 united nations 2011 with the toxicity lower or higher than that of parent pollutants the toxicities of the tps generated from hydroxylation and deamination were evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line fig 5 a d the modeling result suggested that it s hard to get a uniform rule for the changes in toxicity during hydroxylation and deamination the probability was 40 45 for generating tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants during hydroxylation similarly the probability was 31 69 during deamination with the toxicity to daphnia being most sensitive however most dealkylated tps 63 83 probability were less toxic than the parent pollutants and the probability was more than 90 for generating more toxic tps than the parent pollutants during decarboxylation to further understand the generation of toxic tps some representative tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants were numbered in fig 5 and were examined in more detail in table 2 tps with oh added onto the aromatic ring or the unsaturated n heterocycles were generally more toxic than the parent pollutants as were tps generated from kentonization on aromatic rings however tps with di oh added were predicted to be less toxic than the parent pollutants such as di oh tps generated from oh oxidation of ibuprofen carbamazepine bezafibrate and diclofenac table s1 deaminated tps that were more toxic than the parent pollutants were mostly generated from the cleavage of amido bonds or deamination on the unsaturated n heterocyclic the deaminated tps may also result in additions of di oh that is generally less toxic than the parent pollutants the results from the qsar modeling assessment suggest that it would be difficult to establish uniform rules about the toxicities of tps generated by hydroxylation and deamination while that tps are less and more toxic than the parent pollutants in dealkylation and decarboxylation respectively previous studies and our modeling results highlight some representative toxic tps and their associated reactions however the interactions of tps e g synergistic or antagonistic effects on the toxicological results are still unknown further the generation of toxic tps in real surface water or wastewater wwtp effluent may be affected by the matrices e g dom resulting in much more complex situations so far this aspect has not been full considered and further studies should concentrate on the toxicity changes of dom and organic micropollutants in real surface water or wastewater 3 assimilable transformation products the degradation of organic pollutants by uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis generally results in the generation of smaller and more polar tps that are susceptible to biodegradation thayanukul et al 2013 these tps favor the subsequent biological treatment and the mineralization of organic pollutants however can also serve as assimilable carbon and support the proliferation of microorganisms in treated water therefore while uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis may act as pretreatments for biological degradation they may also diminish the biostability of the treated water we quantified the assimilability of tps during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis the assimilability was surrogated by the normalized values as shown in eq 3 and ranged from 0 low assimilability to 1 high assimilability further we used the relative assimilability r assimilability to compare the assimilability before and after uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis as shown in eq 4 3 assimilability bdoc doc aoc doc or bod cod 4 r assimilability assimilability a f t e r a s s i m i l a b i l t i y b e f o r e where doc dissolved organic carbon represents the total concentration of organic pollutants bdoc biodegradable doc represents the doc that can be mineralized by microorganisms aoc represents the doc that can be converted into biomass by microorganisms bod biological oxygen demand and cod chemical oxygen demand represent the oxygen consumed by microorganisms and chemical reductants respectively and assimilability before and assimilability after represent the assimilability of organic pollutants before and after uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis respectively 3 1 assimilability of the treated pollutants both organic micropollutants and dom treated by uv aops i e uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis in this review were generally more assimilable than the parent pollutants fig 6 a c indicating that more readily biodegraded tps were generated however there were some differences between the patterns for organic micropollutants and dom i the assimilability of micropollutants increased under uv aops but not under direct uv photolysis while the assimilability of dom increased under both direct photolysis and uv aops for instance uv photolysis did not affect the assimilability of ofloxacin solution but uv photocatalyzed ofloxacin was more assimilable than the parent pollutant vasquez et al 2013a the photolysis of dom was reported to convert very hydrophobic acid into hydrophilic charged and hydrophilic neutral fractions that are more assimilable buchanan et al 2005 2008 assimilable tps are mainly generated during uv aops of dom when oh attacks the aromatic ring or olefin of dom bazri et al 2012 black and berube 2014 ii most organic micropollutants had extremely low assimilability 0 1 and then were oxidized into tps that were much more assimilable than the parent pollutants most doms however showed low assimilability between 0 1 and 0 4 and then were oxidized into tps that were moderately more biodegradable than the parent pollutants as shown in fig 6 a c the assimilability of the micropollutants in a few cases was enhanced by 1 5 times the region between the 1 1 line and the 5 1 line and in most cases was enhanced by more than 5 times the region between 5 1 line and vertical axis the opposite was true for dom and the assimilability of dom was in most cases enhanced by 1 5 times from our analysis we found that the assimilability of micropollutants was promoted from around a median of 0 05 0 44 while that of dom was promoted from a median of 0 11 0 29 the frequency distribution of the relative assimilability r assimilability was employed to quantitatively depict the changes in assimilability of micropollutants and dom fig 6 b d the r assimilability of micropollutants ranged from 1 48 to 30 8 5th and 95th percentile with average and median values of 11 1 and 9 1 respectively the r assimilability of dom ranged from 0 90 to 9 61 5th and 95th percentile with average and median values of 3 7 and 2 8 respectively from our analysis we found that moderate promotion 1 5 times and high promotion more than 5 times during the oxidation of micropollutants accounted for about 35 and 64 respectively while moderate and high promotion during the oxidation of dom accounted for about 85 and 15 respectively these results confirm that there was more significant promotion of the assimilability of micropollutants than of dom above results suggested that micropollutants should be more refractory to uv photolysis than dom phenomenon i and that a greater proportion of micropollutants might be converted to assimilable tps than dom during uv aops phenomenon ii this interesting result may be related to the structures of micropollutants and dom most micropollutants include functional groups persisting to biological processes and may be more readily biodegraded after powerful chemical oxidations hübner et al 2015 being partially biodegradable dom have more complex structures than micropollutants even after powerful chemical oxidation the assimilability of dom can only be partially improved in most cases or completely improved if dom are completely converted into tps that are easily biodegraded in a few cases the relationship between the assimilability of treated dom and the concentration of assimilable tps with small molecules has been reported in literature for example in the uv photocatalysis for the concentrates of municipal reverse osmosis changes in the assimilability fit well with changes in the assimilable tps of acetate propionate formate pyruvate and oxalate westerhoff et al 2009 similarly in lpuv h2o2 of nom from surface water aldehydes of propanal butanal acetaldehyde and formaldehyde increased at a pace that was similar to the assimilability of treated dom sarathy and mohseni 2008 3 2 influencing factors on assimilable tps 3 2 1 organic micropollutants the uv fluence oxidant dose h2o2 dose or photocatalysis dose and solution ph are expected to affect the generation of assimilable tps of these however only the influence of the uv fluence is well documented with only limited information about the other two factors assimilable tps accumulate as the uv fluence increases in mpuv h2o2 or lpuv h2o2 as has been reported during mpuv h2o2 of iopromide keen et al 2016 and lpuv h2o2 of aromatic carboxylic acids sulfoaromatics and tri n butyl phosphate and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate watts and linden 2008 kalinski et al 2014 milovac et al 2014 uv photocatalysis usually results in the accumulation of assimilable tps as the uv fluence increases as has been reported during uv photocatalysis of metoprolol oxytetracycline and dimethoate arques et al 2007 pereira et al 2011 romero et al 2014 some investigations also reported that uv photocatalysis could oxidize the assimilable tps when the uv fluence was higher than a specified value for example during uv photocatalysis of sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole baran et al 2006 singh et al 2015 observed similar results in uv photocatalysis of ampicillin tylosin doxycycline and sulfathiazole dissolved oxygen can also influence the generation of assimilable tps mendez arriaga et al 2008 observed that assimilable tps formed only under saturated dissolved oxygen conditions during solar photocatalysis of ibuprofen 3 2 2 dissolved organic matter the uv fluence was reported to play a dual role in the generation of assimilable tps in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of dom i the generated assimilable tps increase continuously as the uv fluence increases as occurred during lpuv h2o2 oxidation of dom from municipal wwtp reverse osmosis concentrate umar et al 2016 municipal wwtp effluent puspita et al 2015 surface water sarathy and mohseni 2008 bazri and mohseni 2016 ii the generation of assimilable tps reached a maximum and then decreased as uv irradiation continued to increase in lpuv h2o2 or vacuum uv h2o2 of dom from municipal wwtp effluent liu et al 2011 and uv photocatalysis of municipal reverse osmosis concentrate westerhoff et al 2009 these two different trends may be attributed to the fact that oh on the one hand transfers the non assimilable tps to assimilable tps but on the other hand degrades assimilable fractions and tps thus the difference between the generation rate and the degradation rate of assimilable tps triggers phenomenon i or phenomenon ii the oxidant dose also affects the generation of assimilable tps liu et al 2011 reported that the generation of assimilable tps reached a maximum when the h2o2 dosage was between 78 and 102 mg l in lpuv h2o2 and vacuum uv h2o2 of municipal wwtp effluent also during oxidation of phenols h2o2 levels were optimal when the h2o2 phenol molar ratio was between 100 and 250 alnaizy and akgerman 2000 in contrast however costa et al 2017 observed that assimilable tps that were generated from lpuv h2o2 of biodiesel effluents decreased as the h2o2 dose increased from 1 to 7 g l alnaizy and akgerman 2000 reported that the solution ph had a limited influence on the lpuv h2o2 of phenols however we need to further determine how the solution ph influences uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of dom 3 3 representative assimilable tps 3 3 1 representative assimilable tps reported in the literature as illustrated in fig 4 small molecular weight products of aliphatic alcohols ketones aldehydes and carboxylic acids that are more polar and assimilable than the parent pollutants are generated for example improvements in the assimilability were related to aliphatic tps produced during uv h2o2 oxidation of 1 2 ethanediol 1 4 dioxane stefan and bolton 1998 aromatic carboxylic acids milovac et al 2014 and phenolic compounds nitro hydroxyl and methyl phenols juretic et al 2013 some assimilable tps with complex chemical structures were also generated through reactions on special reactive sites for example pyrazole cleavage tps were generated in uv h2o2 and uv photocatalysis of dipyrone giri and golder 2014 hydroxylation tps were generated in uv h2o2 of carbamazepine keen et al 2012 tps with butylaldehyde were generated in uv h2o2 of tri alkyl phosphates watts and linden 2008 and dechlorination and hydroxylation tps were generated in uv photocatalysis of 2 chlorophenol rao et al 2003 3 3 2 modeling results of the representative tps a quantitative structure biodegradability relationships qsbr model software biowin usepa was employed to assess the assimilability of tps generated by hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination of organic micropollutants the miti database which includes 884 organic chemicals tested with the japanese ministry of international trade and industry miti protocol was used in this model the representative reactions and corresponding tps for organic micropollutants used in the assimilability assessment are listed in tables s1 s4 the assimilability is reflected by the degradation probability which ranged from 0 low assimilability to 1 0 high assimilability the modeling results for the assimilability of tps and parent pollutants and the statistical results for the relative assimibility r assimilability of tps to parent pollutants are presented in fig 7 tps that are both more assimilable and less assimilable than the parent pollutants are generated by hydroxylation and dealkylation the probabilities that tps are more assimilable than their parent pollutants are 62 and 67 for hydroxylation and dealkylation respectively however tps are less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants for decarboxylation and deamination respectively we find that decarboxylated tps are less assimilable than the parent pollutants a previous study about ozonation of muconic type compounds oxidation of carboxyl groups also reported similar results hübner et al 2015 the carboxyl group generally causes increases in the polarity and bio utility and compounds with carboxyl are generally considered more degradable than those without the reactions listed in tables s1 s4 show that hydroxylation occurs on the olefin amino or aromatic sites hübner et al 2015 assessed the biodegradability of ozonation tps based on the reaction sites with qbsr model and found that tps from olefin ozonation were more biodegradable than the parent pollutants tps from aliphatic amine ozonation were slightly more biodegradable than the parent pollutants and tps from aromatic ring hydroxylation were similarly biodegradable as the parent pollutants 4 sensory unpleasant transformation products compounds with color taste and odor properties can induce unpleasant sensory experiences thereby decreasing the organoleptic quality of drinking water or reclaimed water many researchers have used chemical oxidations e g uv h2o2 chlorination and ozonation to efficiently degrade taste and odor causing pollutants antonopoulou et al 2014 xie et al 2015 however chemical oxidations may also induce the generation of some taste and odor causing tps froese et al 1999 observed that chlorination of dom in drinking water generated odorous aldehydes with low molecular weights that were marshy or swampy and chlorophenols that were medicinal anselme et al 1985 and mallevialle and suffet 1981 observed odorous aldehydes that were fruity or fragrant in ozonated dom however while there are no published investigations of odorous aldehydes we propose that they pose potential risks in uv aops of organic pollutants as shown in fig 8 a we consider the generation of odorous tps in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis should be qualitatively and quantitatively investigated in the future it is widely acknowledged that higher levels of aoc or bdoc cause more rapid proliferation of microorganisms and more rapid deterioration of water quality prest et al 2016 thus taste and odor causing compounds are considered to be generated from the metabolism of microorganisms in the presence of assimilable tps that are generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants especially on microorganism biofilms as shown in fig 8 b zhou et al 2017 for example earthy and musty odors of halo anisoles were generated from halo phenols and methyl donors during metabolism of bacteria including strains of rhodococcus acinetobacter and pseudomonas and fungi including strains of trichoderma strains álvarez rodríguez et al 2002 coque et al 2003 zhou et al 2017 swampy and marshy sulfurous odors were generated from thio containing compounds during the metabolism of various bacteria including thiobacillus sp thiothrix sp rhodobacter sp and sulfuricurvum sp scott and pepper 2010 5 conclusions we have provided an overview of the risks posed by toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant tps generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dom toxic assimilable and sensory unpleasant tps are commonly observed and are potential barriers for practical applications of uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis the collated literature and modeling results provide a comprehensive understanding of how toxic and assimilable tps are generated from typical oh reactions in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis the key points from our review are as follows toxic tps more toxic or less toxic than the parent pollutants were commonly generated during uv aops i e uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis in this review of organic micropollutants and dom the amounts of toxic tps varied as the removal efficiency of organic pollutants varied the probability of generating toxic tps was 81 during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants of which there was a 50 probability that the generated tps would be more toxic than the parent pollutants previous studies indicate that the toxic tps may be generated from the four representative reactions discussed in this review e g hydroxylation dealkylation decarboxylation and deamination the modeling results show that tps that are more toxic and less toxic than the parent pollutants were generated during hydroxylation and deamination while tps generated from dealkylation and decarboxylation were generally less and more toxic than the parent pollutants respectively in addition the toxicological properties of tps and the corresponding reactions the synergistic and antagonistic effects between tps and the influence of water matrices should be studied in further investigations assimilable tps were generated during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic micropollutants and dom the assimilabilities of treated pollutants were generally 5 times 64 probability and 1 5 times 85 probability that of the parent pollutants for organic micropollutants and dom respectively previous studies indicate that the dealkylation and hydroxylation during ozonation of micropollutants usually results in assimilable tps while our modeling assessment indicated that the tps generated during hydroxylation and dealkylation were either more or less assimilable than the parent pollutants and that the tps generated by the decarboxylation or deamination were generally less and more assimilable than the parent pollutants respectively further experimental information about the assimilability of specific tps is still in shortage during uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis and further studies should be conducted for the assimilability assessment the generation of toxic and assimilable tps varied under different operational parameters in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of these the uv fluence was frequently mentioned in future studies the control of harmful tps and the optimal thresholds for uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis should be considered more fully information about ozonation and chlorination of organic pollutants suggests that the direct oxidation and the subsequent metabolism of microorganism may result in sensory unpleasant tps there is potential concern that sensory unpleasant tps may be generated in uv h2o2 oxidation and uv photocatalysis of organic pollutants but to date no evidence of this has been published acknowledgements this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 51738005 and the

milliliter scale reactors jadhav et al 2017 santoro et al 2017 one of the main limitations that restrict the application of larger scaled mfcs for practical wastewater treatment is the diminished treating ability this is due to the poor design of scaled up reactor configuration and complicated properties of real municipal wastewater like low buffer ability low conductivity and low biodegradability logan et al 2015 oliot et al 2016 popat and torres 2016 the organic matter degradation in mfc is catalyzed by microorganisms attached on the electrode according to classic monod model the substrate with low concentration and low biodegradability would restrict the bioactivity torres et al 2008 as an essentially chemical cell mfc s power output is also greatly affected by the wastewater properties such as the buffer ability and conductivity madjarov et al 2017 given these negative effects of real municipal wastewater on mfc s performance researchers should be mindful of the configuration of scaled up reactor to ensure its treating ability to scale up the mfc reactor the use of modularized mfc reactors was proved more efficient than merely increasing the size of a single reactor there are two reasons one is that the single reactor in large scale inevitably losses potential due to the increase of electrode distance in addition the output voltage of a single reactor is greatly limited generally 0 8 v by only one pair of electrodes ge and he 2016 an mfc with a size of 250 l in plug flow operation was constructed for municipal wastewater treatment but only delivered a power density of 0 47 w m ³ feng et al 2014 however another mfc with a similar size 200 l consisted of 96 modules has been proved to successfully power a 12 v water pump ge and he 2016 regarding the output voltage a tested mfc stack consisted of 40 small units in series connection delivered an open circuit voltage ocv up to 13 03 v ledezma et al 2013 however the configuration of the modularized mfc at pilot scale should be carefully considered including the electrode types current collector electrical connection and the water flow connection when a high quality effluent and a high power generation are both required for example the largest modularized mfc with a total liquid volume of 1 m3 constructed in queensland australia in 2007 was reported to generate limited current mainly due to the water leakage of the tubular shaped design and the low solution conductivity logan 2010 a stacked 72 l mfc was recently constructed in our laboratory as a preparation for further scaling up and a high power density of 50 9 1 7 w m 3 was achieved when the mfc was fed with well buffered artificial media wu et al 2016 packed bed electrodes with granular activated carbon gac was applied in this mfc to maintain a large ratio of electrode surface area against reactor volume sonawane et al 2017 in this study a 1000 l modularized mfc system consisting of 50 modules was constructed the largest volume ever tested and operated in two municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtp two types of water flow connections were proposed to treat practical municipal wastewaters with low and high cod concentration respectively the mfc system s performance for contaminant removal and electricity generation was evaluated during long term operation for more than one year 2 materials and methods 2 1 modularized mfc system construction the modularized mfc system with a total volume of 1000 l comprised 50 stacked mfc modules each with a volume of 20 l and equal dimension 60 cm 33 cm 24 cm compared with our previous study this mfc system was made to have smaller weight and contact resistance and the least potential of water leakage wu et al 2016 each mfc module was consisted of three anode chambers and three cathode chambers made of polyvinyl chloride pvc with equal dimension 60 cm 33 cm 3 cm all of which were separated by cation exchange membranes cem tianwei company shandong china and clamped together by stainless steel bolts fig 1 a the details of the mfc used was shown in figure s2 in supporting information the coal gac 1 55 mm in diameter 4 6 mm in length was used both in the anode and cathode chamber as shown in fig s2 each chamber was filled with 1 25 kg gac thus 375 kg gac was used in total in this 1000 l modularized mfc compared with our previously reported pilot scale stacked mfc wu et al 2016 the mfc structure in this study has three advantages firstly titanium screws 5 mm in diameter were applied as the wires to connect the inner current collectors while in our previous study titanium wires 0 2 mm in diameter were used three holes were opened in each of the chamber for the insert of titanium screws secondly the titanium meshes and titanium screws were tightly fixed with stainless steel screws to decrease the contact resistance fig s1b and also to prevent water leakage the holes on the chambers for screws were fully sealed with glue to avoid water leakage fig s1c the overall image of lead electric material when connected with wires of a single stacked mfc was shown in fig s1d thirdly three types of water flow connection were tested in this study as a reference for practical experience 2 2 inoculation and operational methods the mfc system was firstly inoculated with the effluent of an acetate fed mfc operated for half a year in our laboratory jiang et al 2017a before the tests of scaled up mfc system a small mfc module with a size of 20 l was operated for 200 days with artificial wastewater containing 1 64 g l 1 sodium acetate according to our previous study wu et al 2016 to investigate its power generation fig 1b all experimental conditions were summarized in table 1 three stages were observed for the module s output voltage including a startup stage 0 30 days stage i maximum voltage output stage 30 80 days stage ii and steady stage 80 200 days stage iii polarization curve and power density curve were obtained for stage ii and iii then the scaled up mfc system with a total volume of 1000 l was constructed with 50 modules each module was parallel connected with an external resistance of 10 ω the 1000 l mfc system was fed with real municipal wastewater from two mwtps considering the different cod concentrations of two influents two water flow connections were proposed to ensure that the effluent could meet the level a of the first class in discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant dspmwtp when fed with municipal wastewater from xiao jiahe mwtp beijing china which had a relatively low cod concentration 60 100 mg l 1 the water flow connections were completed within a single stacked mfc module fig 1c the municipal wastewater was fed into three anode chambers in series the effluent of the 3rd anode chamber was pumped with air and then forced to flow through three cathode chambers in series finally the effluent of the 3rd cathode chamber was discharged the mfc system were operated for 225 days with this single module based water flow connection when fed with municipal wastewater from yong feng mwtp beijing china which had a relatively high cod concentration 200 400 mg l 1 a new water flow connection was proposed by connecting every 3 mfc modules as an assembly in order to realize the step wise cod removal fig 1d the total empty bed volume of anode and cathode chamber is 1000 l and working volume is 600 l after filling of gac when treating the practical municipal wastewater from xiao jiahe mwtp the working volume of mfc for wastewater treatment was 600 l fig 1c when treating the artificial wastewater and the practical municipal wastewater from yong feng mwtp fig 1b and d the working volume of mfc for wastewater treatment was 300 l due to the use of artificial catholyte long term operation of 365 days was carried out to investigate the treating ability of the mfc system the artificial catholyte was prepared by dissolving 1 91 g nahco3 0 13 g kcl 0 125 g nh4cl 12 5 ml trace minerals solution and 5 ml vitamin solution in 1 l of 50 mm pbs solution 2 3 measurements and calculation the cell voltage across the external resistor was recorded automatically by a data acquisition system with daq2213 card adlink china linked with labview computer program the polarization curves and power density curves were obtained by varying the external resistance stepwise at a time interval of 25 min jiang et al 2017b the internal resistance was obtained from the power density curves which was equal to the slope of polarization curve logan et al 2006 the power output of the mfc system was normalized by the anode liquid volume w m 3 or by the projected area w m 2 of a single piece of cem served as the separator according to previous studies lu et al 2017 wu et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 the cod concentration was determined according to the standard methods coulombic efficiency ce was calculated based on the cod removal and the integration of the current with the time the gac in both the 3 anodes and 3 cathodes of a single mfc were cut off to analyze the microbial community composition total genomic dna was extracted using a tianamp bacteria dna kit tiangen biotech co ltd china the amplicons from each sample were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform san diego ca usa the energy recovery was determined based on the calculation of total stable electric energy output of the 50 mfc modules and the hydraulic retention time hrt of anode chamber 3 results and discussion 3 1 power output and wastewater treatment 3 1 1 maximum power output using artificial wastewater the mfc system was firstly fed with artificial wastewater as described in our previous study wu et al 2016 the output voltage by a 20 l mfc reactor was recorded fig 2 a the maximum power output was 125 w m ³ in stage ii fig 2b and decreased to 50 w m 3 in stage iii fig 2c this decrease was normally observed in similar studies which was attributed to the growth of none electrochemical active microorganisms the congestion inside the reactor and membrane fouling ge and he 2016 lu et al 2017 3 1 2 treatment of municipal wastewater with low cod concentration when fed with municipal wastewater from xiao jiahe mwtp the water flow connection was completed within a single stacked mfc as shown in fig 1b this influent has a fluctuated ph in the range of 6 5 7 0 a conductivity of 1200 μs cm 1 and a relatively low cod concentration of 60 100 mg l 1 the hrt in cathode chamber was investigated as previous studies suggested that long hrt led to insufficient dissolved oxygen supply as the final electron acceptor due to the step utilization in similar water flow connection li et al 2017 yuan et al 2016 the maximum power output was found decreased from 24 2 to 7 7 w m 3 when the hrt was extended from 15 to 30 min and it remained at 7 1 w m 3 when the hrt increased to 60 min fig 3 a meanwhile an increase of internal resistance from 0 3 to 1 1 ω was observed indicating that the internal resistance of the mfc module was greatly affected by the performance of the cathode as reported by previous studies using biocathode for oxygen reduction li et al 2017 santini et al 2017 the cod effluent was always lower than 50 mg l 1 fig 3b which were 18 1 mg l 1 15 min hrt 13 2 mg l 1 30 min hrt and 27 2 mg l 1 60 min hrt generally a lower cod effluent was expected with a lower hrt in cathode due to the high efficiency of oxygen supply however when the hrt was decreased to 15 min the water leakage of catholyte from the cathode chamber into the anode chamber was observed due to the increase of pressure in the cathode chamber the leakage of catholyte decreased the anode s performance for cod removal thus the optimal hrt in cathode was 30 min when the hrt in cathode chamber was extended from 15 to 60 min cod removal loading rate increased from 19 5 2 1 to 27 5 1 4 mg l 1 h 1 while the ce decreased from 75 to 41 fig 3b in this period the cod removed by the cathode greatly increased accounting from 4 2 to 26 2 of the total cod removal while the contribution of anode in cod removal decreased from 66 4 to 49 2 fig 3c when the hrt approached longer in the cathode chamber more cod was oxidized by heterotrophic microorganisms attached on the cathode unlike the cod removal in anode chamber that recovers electric power the consumption of cod in cathode chamber would lead to the decrease of ce for all tested hrts at the cathode the cod concentrations in the discharge of mfc system were always below 25 mg l 1 which met the level a of the first class in dspmwtp in other words the discharge of this mfc system could be reused for urban landscape and other general reuses 3 1 3 treatment of municipal wastewaters with high cod concentration although single mfc module discharged a cod concentration below 25 mg l 1 fig 3b when the influent was at low cod concentration 60 100 mg l 1 it failed to treat the municipal wastewater at a high cod concentration of 200 400 mg l 1 in yong feng mwtp the cod concentration in the effluent was above 50 mg l 1 and the cod removal rate was merely 33 as shown in fig 4d and fig s3 given this fact three mfc modules were connected together as an assembly for the step wise cod removal fig 1c and there were 17 assemblies in total the mfc modules that firstly met the influent were classified into mfc1 group and the next two modules as the influent flew through were mfc2 and mfc3 group respectively it was noticeable from different water flow connections illustrated in fig 1 that both the anode and cathode contributed to the cod removal when a single mfc module was applied to treat the municipal wastewater of xiao jiahe mwtp but only the anode was available for cod removal when three mfc modules worked together to treat the influent for yong feng treatment plant the use of a single mfc module for these two types of practical municipal wastewater achieved similar cod removal loading rate 20 30 mg l 1 h 1 the 50 mfc modules were firstly fed with artificial acetate based wastewater as described in our previous study for start up wu et al 2016 the maximum power output average of 125 12 w m 3 here was much higher than that reported in the literature average of 50 9 w m 3 however a decrease in maximum power output and an increase in internal resistance were observed when switched to the practical municipal wastewater fig 4 a and b the 1st mfc module always generated more power and delivered smaller internal resistance than the rest two modules with either influent fig 4b this was attributed to the decrease of cod concentration biodegradability of dissolved organic matters and ph caused by the step wise cod removal in the three anode chambers dhar et al 2017 pandey et al 2016 high cod removal rate of 70 80 was achieved but the contribution of three mfc modules declined in turn because each module merely removed 30 of cod from its influent the cod concentration discharged from the assembly was always below 50 mg l 1 in all tested conditions which stably met the level a of the first class in dspmwtp the 1000 l modularized mfc system was operated for more than one year to study its long term performance fig 5 after feeding with artificial wastewater for 150 days all mfc modules delivered a highly parallel voltage output that stabilized in the range of approximately 0 74 0 77 v however a decreased unstable voltage output was observed when the assemblies were pumped with practical municipal wastewater 0 67 0 70 v during 150 365 days the comparison of voltage output of mfc reactors classified into different groups during wastewater treatment process was provided fig s4 generally the voltage output was more effected by the type of wastewater rather than the classified groups according to water flow connection the maximum power output and internal resistance were obtained from polarization curve and power density curve during the long term operation table s1 the unstable power generation observed was similar to that revealed in a recent study using mfc to treat practical low strength domestic wastewater stager et al 2017 an energy recovery of 0 033 0 005 kwh per cubic meter of practical municipal wastewater was achieved lower than that reported in previous study 0 056 0 097 kwh m 3 dong et al 2015 one possible reason was the passive energy harvest method applied in this study when a fixed external resistance of 10 ω was connected with an mfc module this external resistance was much higher than mfc s internal resistance 0 5 ω and it turned out that the power output of the mfc module was much lower than the maximum power point houghton et al 2016 another recent study also suggested that applying a fixed external resistance for passive energy harvesting was inappropriate for high energy recovery from mfc lobo et al 2017 given these considerations an optimized method for active energy generation would potentially increase the energy recovery from the mfc system additional test was carried to analysis the microbial community and some electrifying bacteria at genus level e g geobacter and pseudomonas were identified fig s5 3 2 comparison of large scale mfcs we summarize the mfc reactors with a volume larger than 10 l in previous literatures to compare their configurations and performances table 2 it can be concluded that mfcs with packed electrode with gac or activated semicoke generally deliver higher cod removal rate and power density researchers has noticed that packing the electrodes with gac was feasible to maintain a large ratio of electrode surface area against reactor volume when the reactor was scaled up logan et al 2015 sonawane et al 2017 in addition gac has good adsorption ability and would facilitate the cod removal as packing materials for low strength wastewater treatment wu et al 2015 the scaled up mfc system constructed in this study has the largest volume so far and delivers considerable high cod removal rate and power generation in summary it removed 80 90 of cod from artificial acetate based wastewater and 70 80 of cod from practical municipal wastewater regarding electricity generation a maximum power density of 125 w m 3 7 58 w m 2 was achieved when treating the artificial wastewater pretty higher than previously reported mfc studies with a size larger than 10 l 0 009 50 9 w m 3 and equally 0 002 2 19 w m 2 the power output became unstable within a large range of 7 60 w m 3 0 42 3 64 w m 2 when the reactor was fed with practical municipal wastewater it was notable that ce was easily affected by reactor design substrate type and the operational mode table 1 an mfc reactor in laboratory scale was reported to output a ce up to 100 for synthetic wastewater treatment aelterman et al 2008 and as low as 0 2 for real wastewater treatment lefebvre et al 2011 the ce achieved in this study lay in a range of 41 75 slightly higher than those delivered by previous mfc reactors with a size larger than 10 l 0 3 53 double benefits of pollution removal and electric energy recovery are expected when researchers apply mfc technology to treat wastewater this study recovered the energy from the 1000 l modularized mfc system with a 10 ω external resistance as most previous studies did but some recent studies reported another active energy harvest strategy for laboratory scale mfc and increased the energy recovery ge et al 2014 wang et al 2012 2015 more energy would be collected from pilot scale mfc when this strategy is applied in addition to the energy harvest strategy the development of modern electrode materials elmekawy et al 2017 sonawane et al 2017 and utilization of novel hybrid reactors design ferreira mercuri et al 2016 jiang et al 2017c tee et al 2016 the exploring of electron transfer mechanisms involved with solid electrodes kumar et al 2017 pous et al 2016 are all expected to improve the ability of mfc for practical energy recovery from wastewater treatment process 3 3 economic cost analysis a total of 36 thousand us dollars kusd were invested in preparing the 1000 l modularized mfc system consisted of 50 modules of which the distribution was illustrated in fig s6 the investment for a single mfc module with a volume of 20 l was 0 72 kusd the cost of this 1000 l mfc reactor was similar to those reported in previous studies when normalized to the reactor volume however the cost of the components for those mfc reactors were quite different the pvc based chambers and titanium mesh based current collector accounted for up to 80 of the total investment in this study but for another 200 l mfc system with 96 tubular modules over 60 of the cost 6 06 kusd was consumed by the use of cem ge and he 2016 applying gac based biocathode in this study cost much less than air cathode applied in previous researches especially those used precious platinum as the catalyst feng et al 2014 logan 2010 the cost of the mfc reactor operated in this study can still be further reduced nearly 60 of pvc materials were abandoned when the pvc based chambers were hollowed out the cost of the chambers would reduce by 80 by applying low cost mixed pvc material without caring the reactor s weight the cost of current collector would reduce by 40 if the titanium mesh is replaced by cheaper metal based materials such as stainless steel mesh the expensive cem used in this study has high strength to resist the scratch caused by the packed gac and the high hydraulic pressure it would become unnecessary if the chamber and packing patterns can be further optimized it is noticeable that the low cost materials that work well in laboratory scaled mfc reactors have rarely been tested in pilot scaled reactors and need further evaluation in future pilot scale mfc studies 4 conclusions this study constructed a 1000 l modularized mfc system consisted of 50 modules to treat real municipal wastewater with both high and low cod concentration and to generate electric power during one year operation the cod concentration in the effluent discharged by the mfc system was kept below 50 mg l 1 with a removal rate of 70 90 which stably met the level a of the first class in dspmwtp the mfc system output an unstable maximum power density within the range of 7 60 w m 3 0 42 3 64 w m 2 and delivered an energy recovery of 0 033 0 005 kwh per m3 of municipal wastewater the investment for the mfc system was similar to other scaled up reactors reported when normalized to its volume detailed cost analysis suggested that this investment could be reduced by saving expensive raw materials or replacing them with cheaper ones acknowledgments this work was supported by the national

wastewater treatment 3 1 1 maximum power output using artificial wastewater the mfc system was firstly fed with artificial wastewater as described in our previous study wu et al 2016 the output voltage by a 20 l mfc reactor was recorded fig 2 a the maximum power output was 125 w m ³ in stage ii fig 2b and decreased to 50 w m 3 in stage iii fig 2c this decrease was normally observed in similar studies which was attributed to the growth of none electrochemical active microorganisms the congestion inside the reactor and membrane fouling ge and he 2016 lu et al 2017 3 1 2 treatment of municipal wastewater with low cod concentration when fed with municipal wastewater from xiao jiahe mwtp the water flow connection was completed within a single stacked mfc as shown in fig 1b this influent has a fluctuated ph in the range of 6 5 7 0 a conductivity of 1200 μs cm 1 and a relatively low cod concentration of 60 100 mg l 1 the hrt in cathode chamber was investigated as previous studies suggested that long hrt led to insufficient dissolved oxygen supply as the final electron acceptor due to the step utilization in similar water flow connection li et al 2017 yuan et al 2016 the maximum power output was found decreased from 24 2 to 7 7 w m 3 when the hrt was extended from 15 to 30 min and it remained at 7 1 w m 3 when the hrt increased to 60 min fig 3 a meanwhile an increase of internal resistance from 0 3 to 1 1 ω was observed indicating that the internal resistance of the mfc module was greatly affected by the performance of the cathode as reported by previous studies using biocathode for oxygen reduction li et al 2017 santini et al 2017 the cod effluent was always lower than 50 mg l 1 fig 3b which were 18 1 mg l 1 15 min hrt 13 2 mg l 1 30 min hrt and 27 2 mg l 1 60 min hrt generally a lower cod effluent was expected with a lower hrt in cathode due to the high efficiency of oxygen supply however when the hrt was decreased to 15 min the water leakage of catholyte from the cathode chamber into the anode chamber was observed due to the increase of pressure in the cathode chamber the leakage of catholyte decreased the anode s performance for cod removal thus the optimal hrt in cathode was 30 min when the hrt in cathode chamber was extended from 15 to 60 min cod removal loading rate increased from 19 5 2 1 to 27 5 1 4 mg l 1 h 1 while the ce decreased from 75 to 41 fig 3b in this period the cod removed by the cathode greatly increased accounting from 4 2 to 26 2 of the total cod removal while the contribution of anode in cod removal decreased from 66 4 to 49 2 fig 3c when the hrt approached longer in the cathode chamber more cod was oxidized by heterotrophic microorganisms attached on the cathode unlike the cod removal in anode chamber that recovers electric power the consumption of cod in cathode chamber would lead to the decrease of ce for all tested hrts at the cathode the cod concentrations in the discharge of mfc system were always below 25 mg l 1 which met the level a of the first class in dspmwtp in other words the discharge of this mfc system could be reused for urban landscape and other general reuses 3 1 3 treatment of municipal wastewaters with high cod concentration although single mfc module discharged a cod concentration below 25 mg l 1 fig 3b when the influent was at low cod concentration 60 100 mg l 1 it failed to treat the municipal wastewater at a high cod concentration of 200 400 mg l 1 in yong feng mwtp the cod concentration in the effluent was above 50 mg l 1 and the cod removal rate was merely 33 as shown in fig 4d and fig s3 given this fact three mfc modules were connected together as an assembly for the step wise cod removal fig 1c and there were 17 assemblies in total the mfc modules that firstly met the influent were classified into mfc1 group and the next two modules as the influent flew through were mfc2 and mfc3 group respectively it was noticeable from different water flow connections illustrated in fig 1 that both the anode and cathode contributed to the cod removal when a single mfc module was applied to treat the municipal wastewater of xiao jiahe mwtp but only the anode was available for cod removal when three mfc modules worked together to treat the influent for yong feng treatment plant the use of a single mfc module for these two types of practical municipal wastewater achieved similar cod removal loading rate 20 30 mg l 1 h 1 the 50 mfc modules were firstly fed with artificial acetate based wastewater as described in our previous study for start up wu et al 2016 the maximum power output average of 125 12 w m 3 here was much higher than that reported in the literature average of 50 9 w m 3 however a decrease in maximum power output and an increase in internal resistance were observed when switched to the practical municipal wastewater fig 4 a and b the 1st mfc module always generated more power and delivered smaller internal resistance than the rest two modules with either influent fig 4b this was attributed to the decrease of cod concentration biodegradability of dissolved organic matters and ph caused by the step wise cod removal in the three anode chambers dhar et al 2017 pandey et al 2016 high cod removal rate of 70 80 was achieved but the contribution of three mfc modules declined in turn because each module merely removed 30 of cod from its influent the cod concentration discharged from the assembly was always below 50 mg l 1 in all tested conditions which stably met the level a of the first class in dspmwtp the 1000 l modularized mfc system was operated for more than one year to study its long term performance fig 5 after feeding with artificial wastewater for 150 days all mfc modules delivered a highly parallel voltage output that stabilized in the range of approximately 0 74 0 77 v however a decreased unstable voltage output was observed when the assemblies were pumped with practical municipal wastewater 0 67 0 70 v during 150 365 days the comparison of voltage output of mfc reactors classified into different groups during wastewater treatment process was provided fig s4 generally the voltage output was more effected by the type of wastewater rather than the classified groups according to water flow connection the maximum power output and internal resistance were obtained from polarization curve and power density curve during the long term operation table s1 the unstable power generation observed was similar to that revealed in a recent study using mfc to treat practical low strength domestic wastewater stager et al 2017 an energy recovery of 0 033 0 005 kwh per cubic meter of practical municipal wastewater was achieved lower than that reported in previous study 0 056 0 097 kwh m 3 dong et al 2015 one possible reason was the passive energy harvest method applied in this study when a fixed external resistance of 10 ω was connected with an mfc module this external resistance was much higher than mfc s internal resistance 0 5 ω and it turned out that the power output of the mfc module was much lower than the maximum power point houghton et al 2016 another recent study also suggested that applying a fixed external resistance for passive energy harvesting was inappropriate for high energy recovery from mfc lobo et al 2017 given these considerations an optimized method for active energy generation would potentially increase the energy recovery from the mfc system additional test was carried to analysis the microbial community and some electrifying bacteria at genus level e g geobacter and pseudomonas were identified fig s5 3 2 comparison of large scale mfcs we summarize the mfc reactors with a volume larger than 10 l in previous literatures to compare their configurations and performances table 2 it can be concluded that mfcs with packed electrode with gac or activated semicoke generally deliver higher cod removal rate and power density researchers has noticed that packing the electrodes with gac was feasible to maintain a large ratio of electrode surface area against reactor volume when the reactor was scaled up logan et al 2015 sonawane et al 2017 in addition gac has good adsorption ability and would facilitate the cod removal as packing materials for low strength wastewater treatment wu et al 2015 the scaled up mfc system constructed in this study has the largest volume so far and delivers considerable high cod removal rate and power generation in summary it removed 80 90 of cod from artificial acetate based wastewater and 70 80 of cod from practical municipal wastewater regarding electricity generation a maximum power density of 125 w m 3 7 58 w m 2 was achieved when treating the artificial wastewater pretty higher than previously reported mfc studies with a size larger than 10 l 0 009 50 9 w m 3 and equally 0 002 2 19 w m 2 the power output became unstable within a large range of 7 60 w m 3 0 42 3 64 w m 2 when the reactor was fed with practical municipal wastewater it was notable that ce was easily affected by reactor design substrate type and the operational mode table 1 an mfc reactor in laboratory scale was reported to output a ce up to 100 for synthetic wastewater treatment aelterman et al 2008 and as low as 0 2 for real wastewater treatment lefebvre et al 2011 the ce achieved in this study lay in a range of 41 75 slightly higher than those delivered by previous mfc reactors with a size larger than 10 l 0 3 53 double benefits of pollution removal and electric energy recovery are expected when researchers apply mfc technology to treat wastewater this study recovered the energy from the 1000 l modularized mfc system with a 10 ω external resistance as most previous studies did but some recent studies reported another active energy harvest strategy for laboratory scale mfc and increased the energy recovery ge et al 2014 wang et al 2012 2015 more energy would be collected from pilot scale mfc when this strategy is applied in addition to the energy harvest strategy the development of modern electrode materials elmekawy et al 2017 sonawane et al 2017 and utilization of novel hybrid reactors design ferreira mercuri et al 2016 jiang et al 2017c tee et al 2016 the exploring of electron transfer mechanisms involved with solid electrodes kumar et al 2017 pous et al 2016 are all expected to improve the ability of mfc for practical energy recovery from wastewater treatment process 3 3 economic cost analysis a total of 36 thousand us dollars kusd were invested in preparing the 1000 l modularized mfc system consisted of 50 modules of which the distribution was illustrated in fig s6 the investment for a single mfc module with a volume of 20 l was 0 72 kusd the cost of this 1000 l mfc reactor was similar to those reported in previous studies when normalized to the reactor volume however the cost of the components for those mfc reactors were quite different the pvc based chambers and titanium mesh based current collector accounted for up to 80 of the total investment in this study but for another 200 l mfc system with 96 tubular modules over 60 of the cost 6 06 kusd was consumed by the use of cem ge and he 2016 applying gac based biocathode in this study cost much less than air cathode applied in previous researches especially those used precious platinum as the catalyst feng et al 2014 logan 2010 the cost of the mfc reactor operated in this study can still be further reduced nearly 60 of pvc materials were abandoned when the pvc based chambers were hollowed out the cost of the chambers would reduce by 80 by applying low cost mixed pvc material without caring the reactor s weight the cost of current collector would reduce by 40 if the titanium mesh is replaced by cheaper metal based materials such as stainless steel mesh the expensive cem used in this study has high strength to resist the scratch caused by the packed gac and the high hydraulic pressure it would become unnecessary if the chamber and packing patterns can be further optimized it is noticeable that the low cost materials that work well in laboratory scaled mfc reactors have rarely been tested in pilot scaled reactors and need further evaluation in future pilot scale mfc studies 4 conclusions this study constructed a 1000 l modularized mfc system consisted of 50 modules to treat real municipal wastewater with both high and low cod concentration and to generate electric power during one year operation the cod concentration in the effluent discharged by the mfc system was kept below 50 mg l 1 with a removal rate of 70 90 which stably met the level a of the first class in dspmwtp the mfc system output an unstable maximum power density within the range of 7 60 w m 3 0 42 3 64 w m 2 and delivered an energy recovery of 0 033 0 005 kwh per m3 of municipal wastewater the investment for the mfc system was similar to other scaled up reactors reported when normalized to its volume detailed cost analysis suggested that this investment could be reduced by saving expensive raw materials or replacing them with cheaper ones acknowledgments this work was supported by the national

19493,the recently developed denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process has demonstrated simultaneous removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus with minimal sludge production in the treatment of saline brackish wastewater its performance however is sensitive to operating and environmental conditions in this study the effects of temperature 20 25 30 and 35 c and the ratio of influent acetate to propionate 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 and 0 100 on anaerobic metabolism were investigated and their optimal values controls for performance optimization were identified a mature ds ebpr sludge enriched with approximately 30 sulfate reducing bacteria srb and 33 sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob was used in this study the anaerobic stoichiometry of this process was insensitive to temperature or changes in the carbon source however an increase in temperature from 20 to 35 c accelerated the kinetic reactions of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and raised the energy requirement for their anaerobic maintenance while a moderate temperature 25 30 c resulted in better p removal 93 18 6 mg p l removal from total 20 mg p l in the influent with a maximum sulfur conversion of approximately 16 mg s l these results indicate that the functional bacteria are likely to be mesophilic when a mixed carbon source 75 25 and 50 50 acetate to propionate ratios was supplied ds ebpr achieved a stable p removal 89 17 8 mg p l for 400 mg cod l in the influent with sulfur conversions at around 23 mg s l suggesting the functional bacteria could effectively adapt to changes in acetate or propionate as the carbon source the optimal temperatures or carbon source conditions maximized the functional bacteria competition against glycogen accumulating organisms by favoring their activity and synergy therefore the ds ebpr process can be optimized by setting the temperature in the appropriate range 25 30 c and or manipulating influent carbon sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfur conversion enhanced biological phosphorus removal anaerobic metabolism optimization temperature carbon source 1 introduction in densely populated cities where freshwater is scarce using seawater or brackish water for sanitation can reduce fresh water consumption and save energy tang et al 2007 leung et al 2012 but the saline sewage produced is rich in sulfate and must undergo treatment before it can be discharged into the sea the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal cebpr process that utilizes enriched polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos wentzel et al 1989 kuba et al 1993 smolders et al 1994 does not work well under high levels of sulfate yamamoto ikemoto et al 1991 baetens 2001 and salinity welles et al 2014 these conditions promote the overgrowth of unwelcome glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which compete against paos for the limited carbon sources and limit the application and performance of cebpr in treating saline sulfate rich sewage the denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process was subsequently developed for the removal of phosphorus p from saline brackish wastewater in tropical and subtropical coastal regions such as hong kong saline sewage normally contains sulfate levels over 200 mg s l wu et al 2016 and salt levels over 2 w v nacl bear et al 1999 xiao and roberts 2010 in the ds ebpr process sulfate reducing bacteria srb e g desulfobacter desulfobulbus desulfuromonas and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob e g thiohalomonas thiotrichaceae thiobacillus likely work synergistically to achieve p release and uptake and compete against gaos for carbon source i e volatile fatty acids vfas guo et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 specifically under anaerobic conditions srb and sob may cooperate in sulfate reduction to form polysulfide and or elemental sulfur poly s but they may simultaneously compete against each other for carbon source guo et al 2016a b zhang et al 2017 subsequently under anoxic conditions sob seemingly play the same role in ds ebpr as conventional paos do in cebpr by oxidizing intracellular poly β hydroxyalkanoates pha and poly s as the energy source for p uptake guo et al 2016a b indeed rubio rincón et al 2017 recently found that thiothrix caldifontis a mixotrophic sob could store carbon anaerobically as pha and use both pha and poly s to generate energy for aerobic phosphorus uptake in a cebpr system this novel ebpr process benefits from the sulfur s conversion involved i e sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation due to lower energy yields wu et al 2014 the process can simultaneously remove organics nitrogen n and p with minimal sludge production guo et al 2016b however changes in operating or environmental conditions can lead to the overgrowth of gaos resulting in unstable system performance guo et al 2017 control strategies are needed to suppress the proliferation of gaos and achieve stable optimal ds ebpr performance but such strategies require an understanding of how operating or environmental conditions affect the competition between the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and the hostile gaos in biological p removal processes certain operating and environmental conditions have been identified as key factors influencing the competition between paos and gaos these factors include ph type of carbon source present in the influent e g acetate hac or propionate hpr the two most common vfas in municipal wastewater oehmen et al 2007 temperature and the phosphorus to vfa ratio in the influent oehmen et al 2007 lopez vazquez et al 2009 although several primary operating and environmental factors such as nitrate concentration yu et al 2016 salinity wu et al 2014 sludge concentration mixing intensity guo et al 2016a b and ph guo et al 2017 have been examined in the ds ebpr process its performance still fluctuated in previous studies wu et al 2014 guo et al 2016a b 2017 thus it is necessary to examine more comprehensively the optimal conditions for the functional bacteria and the disadvantageous for gaos in ds ebpr such as temperature and carbon source which have not been explored in ds ebpr to date both temperature and carbon source vary diurnally and seasonally in practical wastewater treatment processes such undesired fluctuations may adversely affect the functional bacteria of the ds ebpr process including their ability to metabolize s n and p moreover studying the anaerobic metabolism of the functional bacteria and gaos under different temperature and carbon source conditions is an effective way to understanding their competition oehmen et al 2005 lopez vazquez et al 2007 this study therefore aims to investigate the short term effects of temperature and the ratio of hac to hpr on ds ebpr the temperatures investigated were 20 25 30 and 35 c while the ratios of hac to hpr tested determined on the basis of mg toc l of influent were 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 and 0 100 the stoichiometry and kinetics which reflect the anaerobic metabolism and the reactor performance in terms of p removal and s conversion were evaluated the results are compared with those on the behavior of enriched paos gaos and s bacterial cultures published previously finally strategies based on manipulating the temperature and the carbon source are proposed for optimizing this technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 continuous operation of the sequencing batch reactor a tightly sealed lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 20 l was used to enrich the functional bacteria of ds ebpr i e srb and sob the reactor had been continuously operated for over 500 days with approximately 9 6 g total suspended solid tss l of sludge and a ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss to tss of 0 72 as detailed in our previous work guo et al 2017 the sbr was operated cyclically under alternating anaerobic and anoxic conditions the durations of the anaerobic and anoxic phases were varied to allow the target metabolic reactions to be completed such as p release uptake carbon source uptake and nitrate consumption wu et al 2013 the reactor temperature was controlled at 30 1 c using a water bath to mimic the typical sewage temperature in hong kong and the ph was maintained between 7 2 and 7 9 by adding a 0 5 m hcl solution and or a 0 5 m naoh solution as necessary using a ph controller the sludge retention time srt was maintained at about 30 days by periodically withdrawing approximately 6 4 g tss d of sludge which includes tss loss via the effluent and routine sampling the total phosphorus content in mlvss and an average p mass balance analysis are shown in the supplementary information si synthetic saline sewage containing 20 seawater and 80 freshwater 0 7 salinity in the mixture was prepared to simulate the influent carbon to sulfur c s ratio of typical saline sewage in hong kong approximately 1 0 mg c mg s as described in guo et al 2016a the synthetic saline sewage was composed of 60 mg of nh4 n l 20 mg of po4 3 p l 267 mg of hac as chemical oxygen demand cod l equivalent to 100 mg toc l and 133 mg of hpr as cod l equivalent to 50 mg toc l resulting in a ratio of acetate to propionate of 67 33 in the influent to simulate the common conditions in wastewater oehmen et al 2007 this gave a total concentration of organics of 400 mg cod l equivalent to 150 mg toc l and 150 200 mg s l of sulfate on average the influent exchange volume ratio was 0 5 2 2 batch experiments a test was carried out in duplicate to examine the cyclic behavior of the functional bacteria in the ds ebpr sbr on day 455 see guo et al 2017 for details at the end of the anoxic phase on day 465 and day 470 2000 and 2500 ml of mixed ds ebpr sludge were taken from the sbr for short term temperature and carbon source batch tests respectively see table 1 the sludge was prepared as detailed in guo et al 2017 the sludge mixed liquor taken from the sbr was evenly transferred into four or five 500 ml batch reactors and mixed in an orbital shaker then 250 ml of the same synthetic saline wastewater as described in section 2 1 above were quickly added to each batch reactor at the beginning of the operating cycle except that in carbon source tests different ratios of influent hac to hpr were applied n gas was bubbled into each suspension at a rate of 1 0 l min for 10 min at the beginning of the anaerobic phase in batch tests to purge oxygen for short term temperature batch tests four reactors were controlled at 20 25 30 and 35 c with ph at 7 2 7 9 and the ratio of influent hac to hpr at 67 33 for carbon source batch tests five reactors were used with different ratios of influent hac to hpr at 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 0 100 and with ph at 7 2 7 9 and temperature at 30 c all of the batch reactors were operated with alternating anaerobic for 120 or 180 min and anoxic for 60 or 90 min phases 12 5 ml of the 2 g n l sodium nitrate solution were added to the batch reactor at the beginning of the anoxic phase corresponding to 50 5 mg nitrate n l in each reactor samples were taken at 15 60 min intervals from each reactor to determine the cyclic profiles described in guo et al 2017 all of the batch tests were conducted in duplicate and the average results and standard deviations are reported besides in order to further verify the findings the above batch assay was run for four continues cycles under similar conditions and the results are provided in the si 2 3 anaerobic maintenance tests at different temperatures the energy required for anaerobic maintenance expressed as the specific anaerobic maintenance coefficient m atp an in the unit of mol adenosine triphosphate atp c mol biomass h was determined according to guo et al 2017 similar to those batch tests described in section 2 2 above sludge was exposed to anaerobic conditions at different temperatures 20 25 30 35 c the tests were conducted in duplicate for 6 h in the absence of carbon source lopez vazquez et al 2007 during this period samples were measured for their orthophosphate and sulfate concentrations every hour details of m atp an determination are provided in the si 2 4 analytical methods tss mlvss total phosphorus tp and sulfide were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 key anions in the bulk liquid e g hac hpr chloride nitrite nitrate phosphorus sulfate and thiosulfate were analyzed using ion chromatography lc 20a super shimadzu the analytical methods for determining the anaerobic stoichiometry reflected by the conversions of relevant compounds such as polyphosphate degradation p to vfa ratio glycogen gly degradation pha and poly s production are described in detail in wu et al 2013 the sulfur conversion is calculated as the average value of anaerobic sulfate reduction and anoxic sulfate production the anaerobic kinetics reflected by the maximum uptake rates of anaerobic vfas i e hac and or hpr in the unit of mol c c mol biomass h were determined from the vfas consumption profile within the first 30 min of reaction and the active biomass concentration the active biomass concentration c x in the unit of c mol was determined from the measured mlvss biomass generated from influent biodegradable organics via the growth process see the si for a detailed description minus the polyhydroxybutyrate phb polyhydroxyvalerate phv and gly contents i e c x mlvss phb phv gly lopez vazquez et al 2007 simultaneously taking into account the empirical formula that henze et al 2008 proposed for the active biomass composition of ch1 4o0 4n0 2p0 017 molecular weight 23 1 g c mol 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the ds ebpr sbr the ds ebpr sbr was continuously operated for around 500 days and reached steady state conditions on day 370 see fig 1 the typical cycle profile of the ds ebpr sbr revealed a highly effective performance with 88 3 phosphorus removal 17 7 mg p l removal from 20 mg p l in the influent and 15 7 mg s l of sulfur conversion on average specifically in the cyclic tests nearly all of the sulfate reduced was stored as poly s in the sludge with almost no sulfide and thiosulfate not shown escaping to the bulk fluid furthermore the microbial community in the ds ebpr sbr examined through the high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene analysis indicated that srb 30 1 and sob 33 3 were the dominant organisms with the gao candidatus competibacter forming a small proportion 1 5 specifically desulfobacter and desulfobulbus were found to be the dominant srb genera and accounted for 24 1 and 6 0 of the total bacterial community respectively while sob mainly consisted of 22 2 thiobacillus and 11 1 thiohalomonas see guo et al 2017 for more details overall process control in the ds ebpr sbr promoted the enrichment of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob in favorable conditions and ensured stable enhanced phosphorus removal 3 2 effects of temperature and carbon source on anaerobic metabolism and performance 3 2 1 anaerobic stoichiometry polyphosphate degradation provides the energy atp needed for vfa uptake and transportation and is represented by the phosphorus to vfa ratio which is correlated with the abundance and activity of paos oehmen et al 2007 internal polymers such as pha and poly s are necessary for generating the energy required for p removal in the ds ebpr process guo et al 2016a 3 2 1 1 temperature effects the ratio of p to vfa 0 07 0 10 mol p mol c remained fairly stable as the temperature changed from 20 to 35 c see table 2 the production of pha and poly s changed slightly by approximately 10 as the temperature increased from 20 to 35 c indicating their production is also insensitive to temperature changes however at a higher temperature 35 c the glycogen degradation was 27 37 higher than that at other operating temperatures see fig 4 d suggesting additional glycogen might be degraded to supply energy for anaerobic maintenance wang et al 2013 the insensitivity of the anaerobic stoichiometry to temperature changes in terms of the p to vfa ratio and the production of pha and poly s in the ds ebpr system is similar to findings reported by brdjanovic et al 1997 1998 for paos at 5 30 c and findings reported by lopez vazquez et al 2007 for gaos at 15 35 c wu et al 2014 also found that the stoichiometric ratios of ds ebpr behaved stably under the operating temperatures of 10 20 and 30 c this confirms that although there are different functional bacteria or strains present their anaerobic stoichiometry has a similar temperature dependence indeed temperature seems to affect the kinetic rates of the bioreactions rather than the stoichiometric ratios during the anaerobic phase in ds ebpr see section 3 2 2 below for more discussion 3 2 1 2 carbon source effects the ratio of p to vfa decreased from 0 14 to 0 08 mol p mol c as the ratio of influent hac to hpr changed from 100 to 0 to 0 100 such that anaerobic p release was greatest when hac was fed as the sole carbon source this phenomenon is reminiscent of the slightly higher energy needed for 1 mol c of hac uptake and transportation than that for hpr in cebpr oehmen et al 2005 the production of pha and poly s changed only slightly by roughly 10 as the ratio of influent hac to hpr changed from 100 to 0 to 0 100 see fig 4c d indicating that their production is insensitive to carbon source variations and more likely correlated with the amount of carbon available in the influent the phv to pha ratio increased significantly from 0 40 to 0 64 as the ratio of influent hac to hpr changed from 100 to 0 to 0 100 this is consistent with the proposed anaerobic stoichiometry for hac and or hpr in cebpr that a higher fraction of phv in pha is produced when hpr is the carbon source lopez vazquez et al 2009 meanwhile when hac or hpr was used as the sole carbon source the glycogen degradation was 4 19 higher than that when both were used see fig 4d the ratio of p release to vfa uptake obtained in the temperature or carbon source batch tests in the present study 0 07 0 14 mol p mol c was significantly lower than those reported for paos 0 3 0 6 mol p mol c wentzel et al 1989 smolders et al 1994 brdjanovic et al 1997 1998 this ratio is influenced by a lower p content in the sludge for ds ebpr 27 87 mg p g vss vs 60 150 mg p g vss for cebpr due to the consumption of a fraction of the cod for sulfate reduction as described in guo et al 2017 see the si for details about the p content accumulated in the sludge and a p mass balance analysis in this study and henze et al 2008 for results for cebpr notably a higher temperature 35 c and the use of hac or hpr as the sole carbon source resulted in the functional bacteria degrading more glycogen than under other conditions during the anaerobic phase the enhanced glycogen degradation has been reported to induce paos to behave like gaos using glycogen as their main energy source or to shift the microbial community from a pao referring to srb and sob species in the present study dominant one to a gao dominant one wang et al 2013 thus avoiding such unfavorable conditions is important to ensure the stable long term performance of ds ebpr systems 3 2 2 maximum anaerobic vfa uptake rate in ds ebpr the functional bacteria i e srb and sob compete with gaos for the limited amount of carbon available in the system organisms with a lower rate of vfa uptake are thus at a greater disadvantage 3 2 2 1 temperature effects the rates of maximum vfa uptake at each temperature are presented in fig 5 a the highest vfa uptake rate 0 05 0 06 mol c c mol biomass h occurred at 30 35 c a lower temperature 20 25 c slowed the vfa uptake so that the anaerobic phase was extended from 2 h at 30 35 c to 3 h for complete vfa uptake see fig 2a f specifically the hac uptake rate increased with temperature while hpr was consistently consumed within 30 min in all temperature tests see fig 2b e h and k according to a previous study the vfa especially hac uptake rate of a pao culture remained almost constant when temperature increased from 20 to 35 c while the rate for a gao culture increased with temperature lopez vazquez et al 2007 see fig 5b the vfa uptake rates obtained in the ds ebpr system 0 03 0 06 mol c c mol biomass h were much lower than the 0 12 0 30 mol c c mol biomass h for gaos observed by lopez vazquez et al 2007 which might cause severe competition between functional bacteria and gaos and instability of the ds ebpr guo et al 2017 however other factors such as nitrate level ph and duration of anaerobic anoxic phases rather than temperature alone may also limit the absence or presence of gaos in ds ebpr systems guo et al 2017 an increase in temperature could induce a higher specific activity of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and thus a higher vfa uptake rate in ds ebpr which is consistent with findings in van den brand et al 2014 and wu et al 2014 in general srb include both mesophilic and thermophilic strains and their growth and sulfate reduction kinetics are affected significantly by temperature tang et al 2009 for instance moosa et al 2005 and poinapen et al 2009 found that when temperature increased from 20 to 35 c the sulfate reduction rate of a mixed srb population increased significantly while a further increase to 40 c led to decreased bacterial activity although low temperatures will extend the acclimation period of srb once the population is acclimatized the effect of temperature becomes insignificant tang et al 2009 the second group of functional bacteria in ds ebpr i e sob are known to have a broad range of growth temperatures between 4 and 90 c the majority of well studied chemolithotrophic sob are mesophilic in which thiobacillus is the only genus currently known to encompass both mesophiles and thermophiles tang et al 2009 maintaining a relatively high temperature of 30 35 c will accelerate the kinetic reactions subsequently shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt of ds ebpr process which is a key purpose for its application however temperatures of 35 c or above would lower the p removal performance see section 3 2 4 below for details thus operating the process at a moderate temperature e g 30 c can be considered as a compromise between shortening the process hrt and keeping the reactor performance stable notably hac was observed as an intermediate and was consumed during sulfate reduction when hpr was used as the sole carbon source see fig 3m and n this is typical of certain srb groups e g desulfobulbus liu and conrad 2017 that are characterized by an inability to completely oxidize hpr to carbon dioxide during sulfate reduction as observed in ds ebpr 3 2 3 anaerobic maintenance coefficient the specific anaerobic maintenance coefficient m a t p a n corresponding to different temperatures is shown in fig 6 a it is not necessary to study the effects of carbon source on the anaerobic maintenance coefficient as only internal sources of carbon are consumed in this period of metabolic activity 3 2 3 1 temperature effects when the temperature was increased from 20 to 35 c m a t p a n also increased from 0 6 to 1 1 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h see fig 6a this shows that an increase in temperature raises the energy demand for the anaerobic maintenance of the functional bacteria in ds ebpr as is the case for paos and gaos as well lopez vazquez et al 2007 indeed a higher temperature can induce a higher specific activity of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob hao et al 2014 tang et al 2009 thus increasing the energy for their anaerobic maintenance the m a t p a n values of 0 6 1 5 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h in this study were 25 85 lower than those reported for paos which fall in the range of 2 0 4 0 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h and 38 82 lower than those reported for gaos which fall in the range of 2 4 3 3 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h lopez vazquez et al 2007 see fig 6b a 38 82 lower m atp an suggests that the functional bacteria i e srb and sob can better survive anaerobic starvation conditions than gaos guo et al 2017 regardless of temperature changes 3 2 4 phosphorus and sulfur conversions 3 2 4 1 temperature effects when the temperature was kept at moderate values 25 30 c ds ebpr achieved a high p removal 93 18 6 mg p l with maximum s conversions 15 9 16 4 mg s l see table 2 at a low 20 c or a high temperature 35 c ds ebpr showed a significant deterioration in p removal in fact the anoxic p uptake was reduced compared with that in the parent reactor during the period this suggests that short term exposure to a low 20 c or a high temperature 35 c hindered the p uptake activity of potential sob thus the functional bacteria especially sob are likely to be mesophilic microorganisms however these rapid short term temperature changes from 30 c the culture temperature of the parent reactor to the batch test temperatures may also have upset the functional organisms it has been reported that temperature has a strong effect on most anoxic aerobic processes in cebpr lopez vazquez et al 2007 thus research into the effects of temperature on the anoxic metabolism of ds ebpr is needed in the future especially under long term operating conditions 3 2 4 2 carbon source effects when hac and hpr were simultaneously supplied hac to hpr ratios of 75 25 and 50 50 ds ebpr achieved a better p removal 89 17 8 mg p l with stable s conversion at around 23 mg s l see table 2 using hac or hpr as the sole carbon source reduced the p removal performance but had minimal effects on the s conversion as the parent reactor was fed with hac and hpr at a ratio of 67 33 the functional bacteria were capable of utilizing both carbon sources ensuring their easy adaptation to changes in either one the reduction in p removal with a sole carbon source indicates that the functional bacteria present probably preferred both substrates together and were not able to quickly or efficiently switch to a sole substrate in the anaerobic phase thus affecting the subsequent anoxic p uptake most studies have shown improved stabilized p removal performance with a mixture of carbon sources including hpr in cebpr systems compared with using hac only oehmen et al 2007 this study supports this observation for the ds ebpr system fed with a mixture of carbon sources the p removal was stronger with two carbon sources hac and hpr studies have shown that temperature and the type of carbon source strongly influence the competition between paos and gaos in cebpr such that a mixture of hac and hpr in the influent at a ratio of 75 25 or 50 50 and a relatively low temperature 20 c can help paos compete against gaos oehmen et al 2007 lopez vazquez et al 2009 in ds ebpr optimum p removal occurred when hac and hpr were simultaneously supplied hac to hpr ratios of 75 25 and 50 50 and temperatures were relatively warm 25 30 c which was further supported by the findings of four continues cycle tests of the ds ebpr system with different carbon sources and temperatures see detailed results in the si under such conditions p removal exceeded 89 with higher sulfur conversions see table 2 suggesting that such conditions favor the activity and synergy of srb and sob in converting p carbon and s indeed the optimum conditions identified such as ph 7 0 7 5 0 2 guo et al 2017 temperature 30 1 c and carbon source a hac to hpr ratio of 67 33 were applied to the ds ebpr sbr s operation from day 470 onward under these optimum conditions it was found that the p removal performance increased from about 75 to over 90 see fig 1 conversely when using hac or hpr as the sole carbon source a low 20 c or a high temperature 35 c negatively affected the performance in p and or s conversion specifically excessive anaerobic p release or higher phv production was observed when hac or hpr was used as the sole carbon source respectively see table 2 while the total production of pha and poly s changed slightly with the variation in carbon source as reported elsewhere the organisms may not be able to anoxically metabolize phv as quickly as they do phb in a transition period of only one cycle which subsequently reduces the activities of the functional bacteria for p removal wang et al 2011 since a similar amount of internal polymers pha and poly s served as the energy source for anoxic p removal in the ds ebpr system excessive anaerobic p release or higher phv production induced by a sole carbon source would result in a reduced p removal performance besides almost no anoxic p uptake was observed at 20 or 35 c suggesting an irreversible enzymatic inactivation of functional bacteria especially sob bazin and prosser 2000 which may lead to a collapse of the p removal performance the batch tests lasted for a few hours only so the microbial community cannot be expected to have changed or adapted long term testing of the effects of temperature and carbon source should be carried out to account for potential population changes and adaptations 3 3 implications for optimizing ds ebpr systems the findings of the present study are important for obtaining a better understanding of the anaerobic metabolism of ds ebpr and the interaction between the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and gaos the results show that the optimal operating conditions of ds ebpr are different from those of cebpr in particular the optimum temperature range is different and so different strategies should be applied to control the temperature and the percentage of vfas in the influent for maximum performance unfortunately the optimal temperature range 25 30 c is also highly suitable for the growth of gaos lopez vazquez et al 2009 as a result controlling the temperature within this range may not be enough to eliminate gaos if they have become highly enriched in ds ebpr this can happen because gaos possess a higher affinity for the carbon sources as indicated by their higher vfa uptake rate thus it is important to prevent the growth of gaos throughout the cultivation period from a long term perspective after a ds ebpr process has reached stability it may still be applied in relatively warm regions or in treating warm wastewater with a temperature of 25 30 c indeed a mixture of hac and hpr has been found to support a stronger removal of p driven by s conversion which maximizes the functional bacteria s ability to compete against gaos in practice full scale plants receive both hac and hpr from wastewater which potentially provides competitive advantages to ds ebpr using prefermenters to manipulate the percentage of vfas in the influent and hence increase the percentage of hpr in wastewater or adding hpr as a supplementary carbon source may also improve the reliability and efficiency of ds ebpr systems many researchers have used prefermenters containing long chain carbon e g molasses primary sewage sludge and slaughterhouse wastewater to generate additional short chain vfas especially hpr in order to meet the carbon demand for nutrient i e n and p removal in both lab and full scale wastewater treatment systems thomas et al 2003 merzouki et al 2005 zeng et al 2006 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of temperature ranging from 20 to 35 c and influent carbon sources hac to hpr ratios between 0 100 and 100 0 on the anaerobic metabolism and performance of ds ebpr a moderate temperature 25 30 c and a mixture of carbon sources hac to hpr ratios of 75 25 and 50 50 were found to maximize the functional bacteria i e srb and sob competing against gaos by favoring their activity and synergy sulfur driven p removal was also enhanced under these conditions consequently the functional bacteria could be considered as mesophilic microorganisms preferring mixed vfa carbon sources although the bacteria displayed a much lower rate of vfa uptake than gaos their lower maintenance requirements afford them metabolic advantages under anaerobic starvation conditions thus the optimal temperature control should be applied and the influent carbon sources should be manipulated to optimize ds ebpr performance acknowledgments the research was supported by

19493,the recently developed denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process has demonstrated simultaneous removal of organics nitrogen and phosphorus with minimal sludge production in the treatment of saline brackish wastewater its performance however is sensitive to operating and environmental conditions in this study the effects of temperature 20 25 30 and 35 c and the ratio of influent acetate to propionate 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 and 0 100 on anaerobic metabolism were investigated and their optimal values controls for performance optimization were identified a mature ds ebpr sludge enriched with approximately 30 sulfate reducing bacteria srb and 33 sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob was used in this study the anaerobic stoichiometry of this process was insensitive to temperature or changes in the carbon source however an increase in temperature from 20 to 35 c accelerated the kinetic reactions of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and raised the energy requirement for their anaerobic maintenance while a moderate temperature 25 30 c resulted in better p removal 93 18 6 mg p l removal from total 20 mg p l in the influent with a maximum sulfur conversion of approximately 16 mg s l these results indicate that the functional bacteria are likely to be mesophilic when a mixed carbon source 75 25 and 50 50 acetate to propionate ratios was supplied ds ebpr achieved a stable p removal 89 17 8 mg p l for 400 mg cod l in the influent with sulfur conversions at around 23 mg s l suggesting the functional bacteria could effectively adapt to changes in acetate or propionate as the carbon source the optimal temperatures or carbon source conditions maximized the functional bacteria competition against glycogen accumulating organisms by favoring their activity and synergy therefore the ds ebpr process can be optimized by setting the temperature in the appropriate range 25 30 c and or manipulating influent carbon sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfur conversion enhanced biological phosphorus removal anaerobic metabolism optimization temperature carbon source 1 introduction in densely populated cities where freshwater is scarce using seawater or brackish water for sanitation can reduce fresh water consumption and save energy tang et al 2007 leung et al 2012 but the saline sewage produced is rich in sulfate and must undergo treatment before it can be discharged into the sea the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal cebpr process that utilizes enriched polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos wentzel et al 1989 kuba et al 1993 smolders et al 1994 does not work well under high levels of sulfate yamamoto ikemoto et al 1991 baetens 2001 and salinity welles et al 2014 these conditions promote the overgrowth of unwelcome glycogen accumulating organisms gaos which compete against paos for the limited carbon sources and limit the application and performance of cebpr in treating saline sulfate rich sewage the denitrifying sulfur conversion associated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ds ebpr process was subsequently developed for the removal of phosphorus p from saline brackish wastewater in tropical and subtropical coastal regions such as hong kong saline sewage normally contains sulfate levels over 200 mg s l wu et al 2016 and salt levels over 2 w v nacl bear et al 1999 xiao and roberts 2010 in the ds ebpr process sulfate reducing bacteria srb e g desulfobacter desulfobulbus desulfuromonas and sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob e g thiohalomonas thiotrichaceae thiobacillus likely work synergistically to achieve p release and uptake and compete against gaos for carbon source i e volatile fatty acids vfas guo et al 2016a zhang et al 2017 specifically under anaerobic conditions srb and sob may cooperate in sulfate reduction to form polysulfide and or elemental sulfur poly s but they may simultaneously compete against each other for carbon source guo et al 2016a b zhang et al 2017 subsequently under anoxic conditions sob seemingly play the same role in ds ebpr as conventional paos do in cebpr by oxidizing intracellular poly β hydroxyalkanoates pha and poly s as the energy source for p uptake guo et al 2016a b indeed rubio rincón et al 2017 recently found that thiothrix caldifontis a mixotrophic sob could store carbon anaerobically as pha and use both pha and poly s to generate energy for aerobic phosphorus uptake in a cebpr system this novel ebpr process benefits from the sulfur s conversion involved i e sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation due to lower energy yields wu et al 2014 the process can simultaneously remove organics nitrogen n and p with minimal sludge production guo et al 2016b however changes in operating or environmental conditions can lead to the overgrowth of gaos resulting in unstable system performance guo et al 2017 control strategies are needed to suppress the proliferation of gaos and achieve stable optimal ds ebpr performance but such strategies require an understanding of how operating or environmental conditions affect the competition between the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and the hostile gaos in biological p removal processes certain operating and environmental conditions have been identified as key factors influencing the competition between paos and gaos these factors include ph type of carbon source present in the influent e g acetate hac or propionate hpr the two most common vfas in municipal wastewater oehmen et al 2007 temperature and the phosphorus to vfa ratio in the influent oehmen et al 2007 lopez vazquez et al 2009 although several primary operating and environmental factors such as nitrate concentration yu et al 2016 salinity wu et al 2014 sludge concentration mixing intensity guo et al 2016a b and ph guo et al 2017 have been examined in the ds ebpr process its performance still fluctuated in previous studies wu et al 2014 guo et al 2016a b 2017 thus it is necessary to examine more comprehensively the optimal conditions for the functional bacteria and the disadvantageous for gaos in ds ebpr such as temperature and carbon source which have not been explored in ds ebpr to date both temperature and carbon source vary diurnally and seasonally in practical wastewater treatment processes such undesired fluctuations may adversely affect the functional bacteria of the ds ebpr process including their ability to metabolize s n and p moreover studying the anaerobic metabolism of the functional bacteria and gaos under different temperature and carbon source conditions is an effective way to understanding their competition oehmen et al 2005 lopez vazquez et al 2007 this study therefore aims to investigate the short term effects of temperature and the ratio of hac to hpr on ds ebpr the temperatures investigated were 20 25 30 and 35 c while the ratios of hac to hpr tested determined on the basis of mg toc l of influent were 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 and 0 100 the stoichiometry and kinetics which reflect the anaerobic metabolism and the reactor performance in terms of p removal and s conversion were evaluated the results are compared with those on the behavior of enriched paos gaos and s bacterial cultures published previously finally strategies based on manipulating the temperature and the carbon source are proposed for optimizing this technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 continuous operation of the sequencing batch reactor a tightly sealed lab scale sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 20 l was used to enrich the functional bacteria of ds ebpr i e srb and sob the reactor had been continuously operated for over 500 days with approximately 9 6 g total suspended solid tss l of sludge and a ratio of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss to tss of 0 72 as detailed in our previous work guo et al 2017 the sbr was operated cyclically under alternating anaerobic and anoxic conditions the durations of the anaerobic and anoxic phases were varied to allow the target metabolic reactions to be completed such as p release uptake carbon source uptake and nitrate consumption wu et al 2013 the reactor temperature was controlled at 30 1 c using a water bath to mimic the typical sewage temperature in hong kong and the ph was maintained between 7 2 and 7 9 by adding a 0 5 m hcl solution and or a 0 5 m naoh solution as necessary using a ph controller the sludge retention time srt was maintained at about 30 days by periodically withdrawing approximately 6 4 g tss d of sludge which includes tss loss via the effluent and routine sampling the total phosphorus content in mlvss and an average p mass balance analysis are shown in the supplementary information si synthetic saline sewage containing 20 seawater and 80 freshwater 0 7 salinity in the mixture was prepared to simulate the influent carbon to sulfur c s ratio of typical saline sewage in hong kong approximately 1 0 mg c mg s as described in guo et al 2016a the synthetic saline sewage was composed of 60 mg of nh4 n l 20 mg of po4 3 p l 267 mg of hac as chemical oxygen demand cod l equivalent to 100 mg toc l and 133 mg of hpr as cod l equivalent to 50 mg toc l resulting in a ratio of acetate to propionate of 67 33 in the influent to simulate the common conditions in wastewater oehmen et al 2007 this gave a total concentration of organics of 400 mg cod l equivalent to 150 mg toc l and 150 200 mg s l of sulfate on average the influent exchange volume ratio was 0 5 2 2 batch experiments a test was carried out in duplicate to examine the cyclic behavior of the functional bacteria in the ds ebpr sbr on day 455 see guo et al 2017 for details at the end of the anoxic phase on day 465 and day 470 2000 and 2500 ml of mixed ds ebpr sludge were taken from the sbr for short term temperature and carbon source batch tests respectively see table 1 the sludge was prepared as detailed in guo et al 2017 the sludge mixed liquor taken from the sbr was evenly transferred into four or five 500 ml batch reactors and mixed in an orbital shaker then 250 ml of the same synthetic saline wastewater as described in section 2 1 above were quickly added to each batch reactor at the beginning of the operating cycle except that in carbon source tests different ratios of influent hac to hpr were applied n gas was bubbled into each suspension at a rate of 1 0 l min for 10 min at the beginning of the anaerobic phase in batch tests to purge oxygen for short term temperature batch tests four reactors were controlled at 20 25 30 and 35 c with ph at 7 2 7 9 and the ratio of influent hac to hpr at 67 33 for carbon source batch tests five reactors were used with different ratios of influent hac to hpr at 100 0 75 25 50 50 25 75 0 100 and with ph at 7 2 7 9 and temperature at 30 c all of the batch reactors were operated with alternating anaerobic for 120 or 180 min and anoxic for 60 or 90 min phases 12 5 ml of the 2 g n l sodium nitrate solution were added to the batch reactor at the beginning of the anoxic phase corresponding to 50 5 mg nitrate n l in each reactor samples were taken at 15 60 min intervals from each reactor to determine the cyclic profiles described in guo et al 2017 all of the batch tests were conducted in duplicate and the average results and standard deviations are reported besides in order to further verify the findings the above batch assay was run for four continues cycles under similar conditions and the results are provided in the si 2 3 anaerobic maintenance tests at different temperatures the energy required for anaerobic maintenance expressed as the specific anaerobic maintenance coefficient m atp an in the unit of mol adenosine triphosphate atp c mol biomass h was determined according to guo et al 2017 similar to those batch tests described in section 2 2 above sludge was exposed to anaerobic conditions at different temperatures 20 25 30 35 c the tests were conducted in duplicate for 6 h in the absence of carbon source lopez vazquez et al 2007 during this period samples were measured for their orthophosphate and sulfate concentrations every hour details of m atp an determination are provided in the si 2 4 analytical methods tss mlvss total phosphorus tp and sulfide were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 key anions in the bulk liquid e g hac hpr chloride nitrite nitrate phosphorus sulfate and thiosulfate were analyzed using ion chromatography lc 20a super shimadzu the analytical methods for determining the anaerobic stoichiometry reflected by the conversions of relevant compounds such as polyphosphate degradation p to vfa ratio glycogen gly degradation pha and poly s production are described in detail in wu et al 2013 the sulfur conversion is calculated as the average value of anaerobic sulfate reduction and anoxic sulfate production the anaerobic kinetics reflected by the maximum uptake rates of anaerobic vfas i e hac and or hpr in the unit of mol c c mol biomass h were determined from the vfas consumption profile within the first 30 min of reaction and the active biomass concentration the active biomass concentration c x in the unit of c mol was determined from the measured mlvss biomass generated from influent biodegradable organics via the growth process see the si for a detailed description minus the polyhydroxybutyrate phb polyhydroxyvalerate phv and gly contents i e c x mlvss phb phv gly lopez vazquez et al 2007 simultaneously taking into account the empirical formula that henze et al 2008 proposed for the active biomass composition of ch1 4o0 4n0 2p0 017 molecular weight 23 1 g c mol 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of the ds ebpr sbr the ds ebpr sbr was continuously operated for around 500 days and reached steady state conditions on day 370 see fig 1 the typical cycle profile of the ds ebpr sbr revealed a highly effective performance with 88 3 phosphorus removal 17 7 mg p l removal from 20 mg p l in the influent and 15 7 mg s l of sulfur conversion on average specifically in the cyclic tests nearly all of the sulfate reduced was stored as poly s in the sludge with almost no sulfide and thiosulfate not shown escaping to the bulk fluid furthermore the microbial community in the ds ebpr sbr examined through the high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene analysis indicated that srb 30 1 and sob 33 3 were the dominant organisms with the gao candidatus competibacter forming a small proportion 1 5 specifically desulfobacter and desulfobulbus were found to be the dominant srb genera and accounted for 24 1 and 6 0 of the total bacterial community respectively while sob mainly consisted of 22 2 thiobacillus and 11 1 thiohalomonas see guo et al 2017 for more details overall process control in the ds ebpr sbr promoted the enrichment of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob in favorable conditions and ensured stable enhanced phosphorus removal 3 2 effects of temperature and carbon source on anaerobic metabolism and performance 3 2 1 anaerobic stoichiometry polyphosphate degradation provides the energy atp needed for vfa uptake and transportation and is represented by the phosphorus to vfa ratio which is correlated with the abundance and activity of paos oehmen et al 2007 internal polymers such as pha and poly s are necessary for generating the energy required for p removal in the ds ebpr process guo et al 2016a 3 2 1 1 temperature effects the ratio of p to vfa 0 07 0 10 mol p mol c remained fairly stable as the temperature changed from 20 to 35 c see table 2 the production of pha and poly s changed slightly by approximately 10 as the temperature increased from 20 to 35 c indicating their production is also insensitive to temperature changes however at a higher temperature 35 c the glycogen degradation was 27 37 higher than that at other operating temperatures see fig 4 d suggesting additional glycogen might be degraded to supply energy for anaerobic maintenance wang et al 2013 the insensitivity of the anaerobic stoichiometry to temperature changes in terms of the p to vfa ratio and the production of pha and poly s in the ds ebpr system is similar to findings reported by brdjanovic et al 1997 1998 for paos at 5 30 c and findings reported by lopez vazquez et al 2007 for gaos at 15 35 c wu et al 2014 also found that the stoichiometric ratios of ds ebpr behaved stably under the operating temperatures of 10 20 and 30 c this confirms that although there are different functional bacteria or strains present their anaerobic stoichiometry has a similar temperature dependence indeed temperature seems to affect the kinetic rates of the bioreactions rather than the stoichiometric ratios during the anaerobic phase in ds ebpr see section 3 2 2 below for more discussion 3 2 1 2 carbon source effects the ratio of p to vfa decreased from 0 14 to 0 08 mol p mol c as the ratio of influent hac to hpr changed from 100 to 0 to 0 100 such that anaerobic p release was greatest when hac was fed as the sole carbon source this phenomenon is reminiscent of the slightly higher energy needed for 1 mol c of hac uptake and transportation than that for hpr in cebpr oehmen et al 2005 the production of pha and poly s changed only slightly by roughly 10 as the ratio of influent hac to hpr changed from 100 to 0 to 0 100 see fig 4c d indicating that their production is insensitive to carbon source variations and more likely correlated with the amount of carbon available in the influent the phv to pha ratio increased significantly from 0 40 to 0 64 as the ratio of influent hac to hpr changed from 100 to 0 to 0 100 this is consistent with the proposed anaerobic stoichiometry for hac and or hpr in cebpr that a higher fraction of phv in pha is produced when hpr is the carbon source lopez vazquez et al 2009 meanwhile when hac or hpr was used as the sole carbon source the glycogen degradation was 4 19 higher than that when both were used see fig 4d the ratio of p release to vfa uptake obtained in the temperature or carbon source batch tests in the present study 0 07 0 14 mol p mol c was significantly lower than those reported for paos 0 3 0 6 mol p mol c wentzel et al 1989 smolders et al 1994 brdjanovic et al 1997 1998 this ratio is influenced by a lower p content in the sludge for ds ebpr 27 87 mg p g vss vs 60 150 mg p g vss for cebpr due to the consumption of a fraction of the cod for sulfate reduction as described in guo et al 2017 see the si for details about the p content accumulated in the sludge and a p mass balance analysis in this study and henze et al 2008 for results for cebpr notably a higher temperature 35 c and the use of hac or hpr as the sole carbon source resulted in the functional bacteria degrading more glycogen than under other conditions during the anaerobic phase the enhanced glycogen degradation has been reported to induce paos to behave like gaos using glycogen as their main energy source or to shift the microbial community from a pao referring to srb and sob species in the present study dominant one to a gao dominant one wang et al 2013 thus avoiding such unfavorable conditions is important to ensure the stable long term performance of ds ebpr systems 3 2 2 maximum anaerobic vfa uptake rate in ds ebpr the functional bacteria i e srb and sob compete with gaos for the limited amount of carbon available in the system organisms with a lower rate of vfa uptake are thus at a greater disadvantage 3 2 2 1 temperature effects the rates of maximum vfa uptake at each temperature are presented in fig 5 a the highest vfa uptake rate 0 05 0 06 mol c c mol biomass h occurred at 30 35 c a lower temperature 20 25 c slowed the vfa uptake so that the anaerobic phase was extended from 2 h at 30 35 c to 3 h for complete vfa uptake see fig 2a f specifically the hac uptake rate increased with temperature while hpr was consistently consumed within 30 min in all temperature tests see fig 2b e h and k according to a previous study the vfa especially hac uptake rate of a pao culture remained almost constant when temperature increased from 20 to 35 c while the rate for a gao culture increased with temperature lopez vazquez et al 2007 see fig 5b the vfa uptake rates obtained in the ds ebpr system 0 03 0 06 mol c c mol biomass h were much lower than the 0 12 0 30 mol c c mol biomass h for gaos observed by lopez vazquez et al 2007 which might cause severe competition between functional bacteria and gaos and instability of the ds ebpr guo et al 2017 however other factors such as nitrate level ph and duration of anaerobic anoxic phases rather than temperature alone may also limit the absence or presence of gaos in ds ebpr systems guo et al 2017 an increase in temperature could induce a higher specific activity of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and thus a higher vfa uptake rate in ds ebpr which is consistent with findings in van den brand et al 2014 and wu et al 2014 in general srb include both mesophilic and thermophilic strains and their growth and sulfate reduction kinetics are affected significantly by temperature tang et al 2009 for instance moosa et al 2005 and poinapen et al 2009 found that when temperature increased from 20 to 35 c the sulfate reduction rate of a mixed srb population increased significantly while a further increase to 40 c led to decreased bacterial activity although low temperatures will extend the acclimation period of srb once the population is acclimatized the effect of temperature becomes insignificant tang et al 2009 the second group of functional bacteria in ds ebpr i e sob are known to have a broad range of growth temperatures between 4 and 90 c the majority of well studied chemolithotrophic sob are mesophilic in which thiobacillus is the only genus currently known to encompass both mesophiles and thermophiles tang et al 2009 maintaining a relatively high temperature of 30 35 c will accelerate the kinetic reactions subsequently shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt of ds ebpr process which is a key purpose for its application however temperatures of 35 c or above would lower the p removal performance see section 3 2 4 below for details thus operating the process at a moderate temperature e g 30 c can be considered as a compromise between shortening the process hrt and keeping the reactor performance stable notably hac was observed as an intermediate and was consumed during sulfate reduction when hpr was used as the sole carbon source see fig 3m and n this is typical of certain srb groups e g desulfobulbus liu and conrad 2017 that are characterized by an inability to completely oxidize hpr to carbon dioxide during sulfate reduction as observed in ds ebpr 3 2 3 anaerobic maintenance coefficient the specific anaerobic maintenance coefficient m a t p a n corresponding to different temperatures is shown in fig 6 a it is not necessary to study the effects of carbon source on the anaerobic maintenance coefficient as only internal sources of carbon are consumed in this period of metabolic activity 3 2 3 1 temperature effects when the temperature was increased from 20 to 35 c m a t p a n also increased from 0 6 to 1 1 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h see fig 6a this shows that an increase in temperature raises the energy demand for the anaerobic maintenance of the functional bacteria in ds ebpr as is the case for paos and gaos as well lopez vazquez et al 2007 indeed a higher temperature can induce a higher specific activity of the functional bacteria i e srb and sob hao et al 2014 tang et al 2009 thus increasing the energy for their anaerobic maintenance the m a t p a n values of 0 6 1 5 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h in this study were 25 85 lower than those reported for paos which fall in the range of 2 0 4 0 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h and 38 82 lower than those reported for gaos which fall in the range of 2 4 3 3 10 3 mol atp c mol biomass h lopez vazquez et al 2007 see fig 6b a 38 82 lower m atp an suggests that the functional bacteria i e srb and sob can better survive anaerobic starvation conditions than gaos guo et al 2017 regardless of temperature changes 3 2 4 phosphorus and sulfur conversions 3 2 4 1 temperature effects when the temperature was kept at moderate values 25 30 c ds ebpr achieved a high p removal 93 18 6 mg p l with maximum s conversions 15 9 16 4 mg s l see table 2 at a low 20 c or a high temperature 35 c ds ebpr showed a significant deterioration in p removal in fact the anoxic p uptake was reduced compared with that in the parent reactor during the period this suggests that short term exposure to a low 20 c or a high temperature 35 c hindered the p uptake activity of potential sob thus the functional bacteria especially sob are likely to be mesophilic microorganisms however these rapid short term temperature changes from 30 c the culture temperature of the parent reactor to the batch test temperatures may also have upset the functional organisms it has been reported that temperature has a strong effect on most anoxic aerobic processes in cebpr lopez vazquez et al 2007 thus research into the effects of temperature on the anoxic metabolism of ds ebpr is needed in the future especially under long term operating conditions 3 2 4 2 carbon source effects when hac and hpr were simultaneously supplied hac to hpr ratios of 75 25 and 50 50 ds ebpr achieved a better p removal 89 17 8 mg p l with stable s conversion at around 23 mg s l see table 2 using hac or hpr as the sole carbon source reduced the p removal performance but had minimal effects on the s conversion as the parent reactor was fed with hac and hpr at a ratio of 67 33 the functional bacteria were capable of utilizing both carbon sources ensuring their easy adaptation to changes in either one the reduction in p removal with a sole carbon source indicates that the functional bacteria present probably preferred both substrates together and were not able to quickly or efficiently switch to a sole substrate in the anaerobic phase thus affecting the subsequent anoxic p uptake most studies have shown improved stabilized p removal performance with a mixture of carbon sources including hpr in cebpr systems compared with using hac only oehmen et al 2007 this study supports this observation for the ds ebpr system fed with a mixture of carbon sources the p removal was stronger with two carbon sources hac and hpr studies have shown that temperature and the type of carbon source strongly influence the competition between paos and gaos in cebpr such that a mixture of hac and hpr in the influent at a ratio of 75 25 or 50 50 and a relatively low temperature 20 c can help paos compete against gaos oehmen et al 2007 lopez vazquez et al 2009 in ds ebpr optimum p removal occurred when hac and hpr were simultaneously supplied hac to hpr ratios of 75 25 and 50 50 and temperatures were relatively warm 25 30 c which was further supported by the findings of four continues cycle tests of the ds ebpr system with different carbon sources and temperatures see detailed results in the si under such conditions p removal exceeded 89 with higher sulfur conversions see table 2 suggesting that such conditions favor the activity and synergy of srb and sob in converting p carbon and s indeed the optimum conditions identified such as ph 7 0 7 5 0 2 guo et al 2017 temperature 30 1 c and carbon source a hac to hpr ratio of 67 33 were applied to the ds ebpr sbr s operation from day 470 onward under these optimum conditions it was found that the p removal performance increased from about 75 to over 90 see fig 1 conversely when using hac or hpr as the sole carbon source a low 20 c or a high temperature 35 c negatively affected the performance in p and or s conversion specifically excessive anaerobic p release or higher phv production was observed when hac or hpr was used as the sole carbon source respectively see table 2 while the total production of pha and poly s changed slightly with the variation in carbon source as reported elsewhere the organisms may not be able to anoxically metabolize phv as quickly as they do phb in a transition period of only one cycle which subsequently reduces the activities of the functional bacteria for p removal wang et al 2011 since a similar amount of internal polymers pha and poly s served as the energy source for anoxic p removal in the ds ebpr system excessive anaerobic p release or higher phv production induced by a sole carbon source would result in a reduced p removal performance besides almost no anoxic p uptake was observed at 20 or 35 c suggesting an irreversible enzymatic inactivation of functional bacteria especially sob bazin and prosser 2000 which may lead to a collapse of the p removal performance the batch tests lasted for a few hours only so the microbial community cannot be expected to have changed or adapted long term testing of the effects of temperature and carbon source should be carried out to account for potential population changes and adaptations 3 3 implications for optimizing ds ebpr systems the findings of the present study are important for obtaining a better understanding of the anaerobic metabolism of ds ebpr and the interaction between the functional bacteria i e srb and sob and gaos the results show that the optimal operating conditions of ds ebpr are different from those of cebpr in particular the optimum temperature range is different and so different strategies should be applied to control the temperature and the percentage of vfas in the influent for maximum performance unfortunately the optimal temperature range 25 30 c is also highly suitable for the growth of gaos lopez vazquez et al 2009 as a result controlling the temperature within this range may not be enough to eliminate gaos if they have become highly enriched in ds ebpr this can happen because gaos possess a higher affinity for the carbon sources as indicated by their higher vfa uptake rate thus it is important to prevent the growth of gaos throughout the cultivation period from a long term perspective after a ds ebpr process has reached stability it may still be applied in relatively warm regions or in treating warm wastewater with a temperature of 25 30 c indeed a mixture of hac and hpr has been found to support a stronger removal of p driven by s conversion which maximizes the functional bacteria s ability to compete against gaos in practice full scale plants receive both hac and hpr from wastewater which potentially provides competitive advantages to ds ebpr using prefermenters to manipulate the percentage of vfas in the influent and hence increase the percentage of hpr in wastewater or adding hpr as a supplementary carbon source may also improve the reliability and efficiency of ds ebpr systems many researchers have used prefermenters containing long chain carbon e g molasses primary sewage sludge and slaughterhouse wastewater to generate additional short chain vfas especially hpr in order to meet the carbon demand for nutrient i e n and p removal in both lab and full scale wastewater treatment systems thomas et al 2003 merzouki et al 2005 zeng et al 2006 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of temperature ranging from 20 to 35 c and influent carbon sources hac to hpr ratios between 0 100 and 100 0 on the anaerobic metabolism and performance of ds ebpr a moderate temperature 25 30 c and a mixture of carbon sources hac to hpr ratios of 75 25 and 50 50 were found to maximize the functional bacteria i e srb and sob competing against gaos by favoring their activity and synergy sulfur driven p removal was also enhanced under these conditions consequently the functional bacteria could be considered as mesophilic microorganisms preferring mixed vfa carbon sources although the bacteria displayed a much lower rate of vfa uptake than gaos their lower maintenance requirements afford them metabolic advantages under anaerobic starvation conditions thus the optimal temperature control should be applied and the influent carbon sources should be manipulated to optimize ds ebpr performance acknowledgments the research was supported by

respectively with average counts of 3 65 oocysts 10 l and 12 58 cysts 10 l respectively six cryptosporidium species and three giardia lamblia assemblages were confirmed with molecular analyses the

importance of controlling the proportion of exposed individuals and reducing the frequency of exposure the methodology and results of this study will allow us to better evaluate and reduce the burden of cryptosporidium and or giardia infections associated with recreational water use in china and other countries graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra cryptosporidium giardia genotyping recreational water 1 introduction cryptosporidium and giardia are critical parasites in the etiology of diarrhea worldwide and they often cause waterborne outbreaks during the period from 2011 to 2016 at least 239 and 142 waterborne outbreaks were attributed to cryptosporidium and giardia respectively and most of them occurred in developed countries efstratiou et al 2017 rosado garcia et al 2017 although few waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis were reported in developing countries it is clear that this distorted picture is attributable to the lack of surveillance systems including a failure to identify any of the parasites or to provide reports of outbreak events efstratiou et al 2017 in the most populous developing country china cryptosporidium and giardia are not usually detected because neither of these protozoans is listed as a routine inspection item in cases of diarrhea wang et al 2011b therefore the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis among the chinese is probably underestimated nevertheless these parasites have been widely detected in the feces of farm wild laboratory and zoo animals as well as house pets in china karanis et al 2007 li et al 2005 lv et al 2009 wang et al 2011a xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 they have also been detected in wastewater liu et al 2011 reclaimed water zhang et al 2015 and source water hu et al 2014 however the occurrence and risk of these protozoa in recreational waters in china have been unclear until now which makes it difficult to properly manage recreational waters and to develop reasonable standards of water quality the species genotypes of cryptosporidium and giardia present in the environment is an important factor affecting the risk of human infection and have often been ignored in previous studies that have assessed the risk these protozoa pose some cryptosporidium and giardia species are host specific and have been only found in animals laishram et al 2012 moore et al 2016 ryan et al 2014 zahedi et al 2016 of the nearly 20 species genotypes of cryptosporidium reported in humans c parvum c hominis c ubiquitum and c meleagridis are the commonest causative agents of cryptosporidiosis ryan et al 2014 similarly g lamblia also known as g duodenalis and g intestinalis is the only known giardia species that causes human disease it is divided at the genetic level into eight assemblages a h with different host specificities two of which a and b are the main etiological agents of human giardiasis ryan and cacciò 2013 therefore the identification of environmental protozoan species or assemblages should help to control the risks they pose to public health quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a useful method of predicting the human health risk of pathogens and it has been widely used to assess the infection risk of cryptosporidium and or giardia in various types of water de man et al 2014 ehsan et al 2015 pintar et al 2010 schoen and ashbolt 2010 zhang et al 2015 for instance the risk of recreational lake related cryptosporidium infection in canada was estimated to be as high as 10 infections per 1000 swims 95 confidence interval ci 2 30 or 1 0 10 2 per swim per person for children and 4 infections per 1000 swims 95 ci 4 10 for adults pintar et al 2010 lower risks were identified in belgium where the infection risk associated with recreational lakes was 2 79 5 74 10 5 for cryptosporidium and 0 704 1 46 10 4 for giardia per swim per person ehsan et al 2015 however as mentioned earlier risk assessments of these parasites rarely take into account information on the species genotypes that are infectious to humans which may lead to an overestimation of the risk lapen et al 2016 furthermore most previous studies have focused on the annual individual probability of infection without considering the severity of the disease which has made it difficult to compare the risks of different symptoms or illnesses to provide greater insight into the importance of recreational water in the transmission of these pathogenic parasites we undertook the present study to determine the occurrence genotypes and health risks of cryptosporidium and giardia in recreational water during the high occurrence season for waterborne cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis efstratiou et al 2017 hopkins et al 2013 loganthan et al 2012 perkins and trimmier 2017 rosado garcia et al 2017 compared with previous studies of the risks presented by these parasites this study has the following characteristics i different factors including multiple exposure routes age and sex were considered when assessing exposure ii the gastroenteritis burden was calculated separately by its severity category i e differences in duration and disability and iii the fraction of oo cysts infectious to humans was considered the methodology used and our results will be helpful in better evaluating and reducing the burden of protozoan infection associated with recreational water in china and other regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and water sampling the tianjin waterpark 39 080 39 095 n 117 159 117 174 e is the largest urban park and recreation area within the city boundaries of tianjin china fig s1 in the supplemental material the park is an aaaa level tourist attraction awarded by the national tourism administration of the people s republic of china and attracts many chinese and foreign tourists in the summer festival the number of daily visitors to the park reaches nearly 100 000 the water area in the park is about 75 hectares and all the lakes are interconnected the replenishment pattern of the lakes is mainly by tap water and occasional heavy rainstorms the lakes in the park are used for a variety of purposes including limited water contact recreational activities such as rowing wading splashing and playing in interactive fountains although swimming is not allowed in the lakes hundreds of people mainly elderly residents from nearby swim there in the early morning in summer a total of 52 water samples were collected at the sampling points shown in fig s1 for the detection of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts at 10 day intervals during the busiest season of water related activity june october which is also the rainy season in the study area fig s2 each sample was 20 l and was used for both microscopic and molecular analyses 10 l for each 2 2 detection and enumeration of parasitic pathogens the morphological examination and enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts were performed by using previously described methods involving filtration flotation labeling with a monoclonal antibody and microscopic analysis xiao et al 2012b quality control tests in which 10 l of distilled water was seeded with a known number of oo cysts revealed that the method permitted an average recovery rate of 41 25 for cryptosporidium oocysts and 38 32 for giardia cysts table s1 which met the acceptance criteria more than 38 and 27 respectively of the united states environmental protection agency method 1623 1 2 3 molecular characterization of cryptosporidium and giardia the concentrated pellet from another 10 l of each samples was processed for dna extraction with the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france according to the manufacturer s instructions and eluted in 50 μl of reagent grade water as described previously xiao et al 2012b two step nested pcrs were used to amplify a 435 bp fragment of the cryptosporidium small subunit ssu rrna locus and a 292 bp fragment of the giardia ssu rrna gene respectively the primers and amplification conditions table s2 were adapted from plutzer et al 2008 the second pcr products positive for cryptosporidium or giardia were sent to beijing augct co ltd for direct sequencing with the second pcr primers on an abi 3730 automated dna sequencer bigdye terminator chemistry multiple alignment analyses with the appropriate reference sequences obtained from genbank were performed with clustal w in mega version 7 0 to identify the cryptosporidium species and giardia assemblages in the samples phylogenetic analyses based on the neighbor joining method were performed with the same software de lucio et al 2016 2 4 analyses of turbidity and total coliforms the turbidity of the samples was measured on site for each sample with a portable photometer and the results were expressed in nephelometric turbidity units ntu total coliform counts were determined with a five tube most probable numbers mpn method according to the chinese standard examination method for drinking water microbiological parameters gb t5750 12 2006 2007 briefly 1 0 ml of each stage of a 10 fold serial dilution was transferred into five tubes of lactose peptone broth 10 0 ml with inverted durham tubes after incubation for 24 2 h at 37 c the tubes that showed an acidic reaction or gas production were further tested for confirmation of coliforms using eosin methylene blue agar medium according to the above standard gb t5750 12 2006 2007 2 5 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra 2 5 1 exposure assessment the observed protozoan concentrations c o and the recovery r of the detection method were fitted using a continuous distribution similar to that used in previous studies verbyla et al 2016 xiao et al 2012a and were used to estimate the real concentrations c r of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts in the lakes the methodology described by sales ortells and medema 2015 was used and the concentrations were calculated with eq 1 1 c r c o gamma c o 1 1 r r considering the purposes of the lakes studied two main exposure routes were examined in this study among the many potential exposure routes full contact recreation i e swimming and limited water contact activities i e rowing wading and playing in interactive fountains many studies have evaluated the amount of water swallowed during swimming and the estimates ranged from 10 ml to 50 ml however recent studies have shown that there is a significant difference in the volumes of water ingested between peoples in different age groups and of different sexes because their rates of ingestion and the time spent in the water differ dufour et al 2017 suppes et al 2016 the geometric mean of the water ingestion rate i for child swimmers was estimated to be 23 7 ml h 95 ci 17 33 whereas those for female and male adults were 9 4 ml h 95 ci 8 11 and 16 4 ml h 95 ci 13 20 respectively dufour et al 2017 similar results with an average i of 24 2 ml h and 6 3 ml h for children and adult swimmers respectively were obtained by suppes et al 2016 the time t spent in swimming which varied from 40 25 to 65 00 min for differently aged people table s3 were taken from the highlights of the chinese exposure factors handbook duan et al 2015 when assessing interactive fountain activity the water ingestion rate by inhalation hand to mouth contact and droplet ingestion was 7 04 ml h 95 ci 0 43 21 68 de man et al 2014 and the duration of exposure was 0 5 2 5 h with a mean value of 1 6 h hoebe et al 2004 to account for any uncertainty lognormal distributions were used to describe the water ingestion rate and the duration of activity as in previous similar risk assessments dufour et al 2017 soller et al 2010 suppes et al 2016 the ingested dose d was then calculated with eq 2 2 d c r i t for the other limited water contact activities the volume of water ingested v per event was estimated to be 3 9 ml for rowing and 3 7 ml for wading dorevitch et al 2011 we assumed that v followed a lognormal distribution with scale parameters derived from the estimated v and the corresponding 95th percentile 11 8 for rowing and 11 2 for wading the exposure dose by this route was consequently estimated with eq 3 3 d c r v 2 5 2 dose response assessment a dose response analysis is used to calculate the probability of infection p d inf after exposure to the pathogen of interest various dose response models have been shown to be appropriate for measuring microbial risk such as the exponential log normal weibull and beta poisson models messner and berger 2016 teunis and havelaar 2000 of these the exponential model is widely applied to many protozoa and viruses at a low dose exposure brouwer et al 2017 chhipi shrestha et al 2017 verbyla et al 2016 xiao et al 2018 the probability of infection per exposure event for cryptosporidium or giardia was calculated with eq 4 4 p d inf 1 exp r d fi where r is the fraction of oocysts or cysts that will successfully initiate an infection if ingested by any human host who 2009 and fi is the fraction of protozoa potentially infectious to humans the parameter r was estimated to be 0 09 for cryptosporidium schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2010 usepa 2005 and 0 02 for giardia mcbride et al 2013 schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2010 it is noteworthy that r represents the infection response mounted by healthy volunteers and is therefore not representative of the responses of children or the elderly usepa 2005 nevertheless we separated the risks for children and adults primarily based on different levels of exposure rather than on their different dose response functions pintar et al 2010 we assumed the same dose response function for children and adults as in previous studies ehsan et al 2015 pintar et al 2010 xiao et al 2012a and the parameter r followed a beta distribution with shape parameters α and β ehsan et al 2015 for cryptosporidium α and β were set at 5 13 and 51 87 respectively for giardia these values were set at 1 83 and 90 05 respectively these values were derived from the estimated r and the corresponding range 0 036 0 140 for cryptosporidium usepa 2005 and the 97 5th percentile 0 057 for giardia ehsan et al 2015 we assumed that all the genotypes of cryptosporidium and giardia that have been reported in humans are infectious for humans and there was no provision for the potential die off of oo cysts caused by sunlight predation or other factors because the resistance of thick walled oo cysts to environmental factors is extreme zhang et al 2015 the estimated fi was therefore calculated as the number of samples containing human infectious genotypes divided by the number of samples successfully genotyped eq 5 5 fi number of samples containing human infectious genotypes number of samples successfully genotyped 2 5 3 risk characterization the annual probability of infection p y inf was calculated from the variable outcome p d inf estimates and the frequency of events n in 1 year using eq 6 according to the highlights of the chinese exposure factors handbook duan et al 2015 only 1 96 of chinese people swim in surface water and the frequency of swimming is eight times a month during summer generally between june and october the fraction f and frequency of limited water contact activities were assumed to be the same as those for swimming the probability of illness p ill inf attributable to infection is often calculated by fitting with different statistical distributions based on studies of disease outbreaks and epidemiological investigations and the mean values were calculated to be 0 71 for cryptosporidium xiao et al 2012a and 0 45 for giardia chhipi shrestha et al 2017 therefore the annual risk of illness in the population p y ill was calculated with eq 7 6 p y inf 1 1 p d inf n 7 p y ill p y inf p ill inf f the endpoint of the risk assessment was characterized as an annual health burden b expressed in disability adjusted life years dalys dalys can be defined as the total years of life lost yll due to premature mortality and years lived with disability yld eq 8 the yll metric essentially corresponds to the number of deaths d j multiplied by the standard life expectancy e j at the age j at which death occurs eq 9 according to the national bureau of statistics of china www stats gov cn the life expectancies of chinese females and males in 2016 were 79 43 and 73 64 years respectively table s3 the case fatality rate cfr for cryptosporidiosis was estimated to be 1 0 10 5 based on the outbreak in milwaukee usa in 1993 addiss et al 1996 xiao et al 2012a whereas giardiasis is generally considered nonfatal gibney et al 2014 laishram et al 2012 8 b yyl yld 9 yyls j n d j e j to estimate yld on a population basis the number of disability cases n j was multiplied by the average duration of the disease l j and a disability weight w j that reflects the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 perfect health to 1 dead considering the differences of the duration and disability weight for different levels of severity of acute gastroenteritis age caused by cryptosporidium or giardia the ylds of the three case types i e 1 mild 2 outpatient and 3 hospitalized were calculated separately and their proportions p in the cases were taken into account table s4 consequently yld of the parasitic diseases in the population was calculated with eq 10 10 yld j n i 3 n j p i l j i w j i 2 6 data analysis the pasw statistics 18 computer software package was used to calculate the summary statistics the nonparametric spearman s correlation two tailed test was used to evaluate the relationships among total coliforms turbidity and protozoan concentrations a χ2 test was used to calculate possible significant differences between the concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia as in a previous study carmena et al 2007 statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 probability distribution fitting monte carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses were conducted with risk version 5 5 palisade corporation usa from each distribution input summarized in table 1 10 000 values were randomly sampled for each model to account for the uncertainty and variability 3 results 3 1 occurrence of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts a total of 52 water samples from the recreational lakes were examined during the period between june and october 2015 with cryptosporidium oocysts detected in 43 82 7 samples and giardia cysts in 51 98 1 the percentage detection of oocysts and cysts did not change much 69 2 92 3 for cryptosporidium and 92 3 100 0 for giardia at the four sampling sites p 0 05 the counts of cryptosporidium oocysts in all the samples ranged between 0 and 15 per 10 l with a mean of 3 65 oocysts per 10 l whereas the mean concentration of giardia was 12 58 cysts per 10 l ranging from 0 to 43 cysts per 10 l fig 1 similar to the positive detection rates there was no significant difference in the concentrations of the two protozoa in the water samples collected at different sites the variations in the cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations in the water samples at different times are shown in fig s3 the mean concentrations of both parasites in the lakes declined generally during the study except for the peaks that occurred in late july the lowest cryptosporidium and giardia levels were both detected in early october with average ranges of 0 0 5 oocysts per 10 l and 4 5 5 3 cysts per 10 l respectively 3 2 molecular identification of parasites to identify the genotypes and possible transmission patterns of the parasites nested pcrs were performed on all 52 samples to amplify the partial ssu rrna genes of cryptosporidium and giardia respectively thirteen samples yielded the expected amplification products which were sequenced successfully according to the sequence analysis six cryptosporidium species c parvum c andersoni c hominis c meleagridis c fragile and c ubiquitum and three giardia lamblia assemblages a b and d were identified except for two water samples that contained both cryptosporidium and giardia each pcr positive sample contained only one protozoan species or assemblage the distributions of parasite species and or assemblages at different sampling sites are shown in table 2 the commonest protozoan genotypes were c parvum c andersoni and giardia assemblage a 3 3 relationship among total coliforms turbidity and parasitic protozoa total coliforms were detected in all the water samples at concentrations ranging from 2 103 mpn l to 6 5 105 mpn l the turbidity values varied between 19 and 134 ntu the statistical analysis revealed a strong linear correlation p 0 01 between the counts of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts weak associations were detected between turbidity and both cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations fig 2 no correlation was found between the number of total coliforms and the protozoan concentrations data not shown 3 4 health risk characterization the estimated annual incidence of diarrhea attributable to infection with cryptosporidium and or giardia associated with various recreational activities in the lakes is shown in table 3 the exposure scenario of full water contact recreation i e swimming in the lakes had the highest incidence risk of 5 72 10 4 per person per year pppy 95 ci 0 03 43 33 10 4 for cryptosporidium and 4 04 10 4 pppy 95 ci 0 01 32 66 10 4 for giardia whereas the exposure while wading had the lowest risks of morbidity caused by cryptosporidium and giardia which were 2 20 10 4 pppy 95 ci 0 02 14 87 10 4 and 1 70 10 4 pppy 95 ci 0 01 11 77 10 4 respectively the average annual burdens of cryptosporidium and giardia infections attributable to all recreational activities were estimated to be 3 44 dalys per 1 000 000 individuals per year 95 ci 0 04 23 51 and 1 81 dalys per 1 000 000 individuals per year 95 ci 0 01 12 96 respectively table 3 as expected the highest combined health burdens of recreational water related cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis were for swimming in the lakes 1 87 10 6 dalys pppy followed by playing in interactive fountains 1 82 10 6 dalys pppy rowing 0 80 10 6 dalys pppy and wading 0 75 10 6 dalys pppy fig 3 shows the age distribution of the chinese population and the recreational water associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis burdens most 65 71 of the total health burden on the population measured in dalys was associated with the group aged 15 60 years whereas only 21 16 of the burden was associated with the group aged 15 years and 13 13 was associated with people aged 60 years however given the proportion of each age group in the total population the burden of the protozoan disease in adults aged 15 60 years at the individual level was lower than that in children whereas it was higher than that in the elderly table 4 the odds ratios presented in table 4 also demonstrate that the disease burdens caused by cryptosporidium and giardia in the recreational lakes were more likely to affect males than females in terms of the severity of gastroenteritis most 87 8 of the total cryptosporidium and giardia associated gastroenteritis was mild whereas 12 20 of patients visited a general practitioner and 1 10 of them were hospitalized fig 4 however the highest contribution by severity to the total dalys was made by the outpatient cases followed by the mild hospitalized and fatal cases fig 4 3 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed by measuring spearman s rank order correlation to study the effects of the variation in the model inputs on the final output of the disease burden the results showed that the most sensitive input parameters in assessing the health burden imposed by water associated recreational activities were the fraction of the population exposed f and the frequency of exposure per year n other important influential factors included the concentration of protozoa in the water c o the water ingested rate i i the duration t i at interactive fountain play and the protozoan infectivity constants r of the exponential dose response model fig 5 4 discussion cryptosporidium and giardia are commonly found in recreational waters and cause outbreaks of disease hlavsa et al 2011 2015 in the present study cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts were detected at all the sampling sites in the lakes of tianjin waterpark fig s1 with average densities of 3 46 3 85 oocysts per 10 l and 11 15 14 54 cysts per 10 l respectively fig 1 much higher concentrations of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts with ranges of 10 600 oocysts and 10 1600 cysts per 10 l respectively were reported in recreational rivers in spain castro hermida et al 2010 whereas similar contamination levels were found in some recreational lake waters in the netherlands 1 4 cryptosporidium oocysts per 10 l and 1 8 giardia cysts per 10 l schets et al 2008 in malaysia which is an asian country like china a density of 1 7 11 cysts per 10 l of giardia was detected but no cryptosporidium oocysts were found lim et al 2009b therefore the protozoan levels in the recreational waters of this study fall within the ranges reported elsewhere a certain time characteristic was observed in the protozoan contamination of the tianjin lakes with the exception of the observed peak concentrations the concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia decreased over time fig s3 previous studies have shown that there is a short period of high concentrations of microorganisms in surface waters after heavy rainfall events which are attributed to sewage overflow and surface runoff bertone et al 2016 eregno et al 2016 serdarevic et al 2012 as shown in fig s2 the weather pattern during the study period was that of a typical rainy season with several heavy rain events the strong washing effect of the heavy rainfall on 19 july 2015 might explain the peaks in protozoan levels observed in late july sterk et al 2016 in contrast the declining concentrations of protozoans with time suggest that these parasites were not discharged continuously into the lakes these variations in protozoan concentrations were consistent with our field investigation that showed that the lakes were mainly replenished with tap water and occasionally with heavy rainfall molecular analyses confirmed that six cryptosporidium species and three g lamblia assemblages were present in the examined water samples all of them have been well documented in animals worldwide ryan and cacciò 2013 ryan et al 2014 2016 squire and ryan 2017 it is noteworthy that c fragile which was detected here has only been found in amphibians ryan et al 2014 considering that there are amphibians and many other animals in the nearby zoo protozoan contamination in the lakes studied may be related to this proximity in fact it has been demonstrated that zoos that house a wide range of captive wildlife are ideal reservoirs of a myriad of pathogens karanis et al 2007 lim et al 2009a as discussed earlier the lakes are mainly replenished with tap water and occasionally with rainwater so the latter may be the major contributor to its contamination it can be speculated that surface runoff from the zoo reaching the lakes during heavy rainfall events is one source of the protozoan contamination in the lakes disturbance factors such as rowing mix the lake waters which may be why there was no significant difference in the concentrations of protozoa at different sampling sites highly positive correlations were observed between the cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations and each of them was associated with the level of turbidity in this study similar results were reported for both parasites and turbidity in samples from reservoirs in spain carmena et al 2007 and china xiao et al 2013 in terms of microbiological parameters xiao et al 2013 found that both total coliforms and escherichia coli which are used worldwide as indicator organisms for fecal contamination and microbial water hygiene carmena et al 2007 and enterococci correlated significantly with one another p 0 01 in surface waters whereas none of them adequately indicated the presence of protozoa in natural waters this is consistent with the finding that no protozoan concentration was related to the level of total coliforms in the present study in contrast several studies have found that counts of fecal bacteria were associated with the concentrations of protozoa in surface waters graczyk et al 2010 mons et al 2009 both cryptosporidium and giardia are highly resistant to environmental stress and can survive under stress longer than indicator bacteria who 2009 this may be one of the reasons for the different results in the studies cites above graczyk et al 2010 also noted that whether contaminated water is sampled and tested at a specific time would affects any correlation between fecal indicator bacteria and protozoa because 100 5 5 of the giardia assemblages and 90 9 10 of the cryptosporidium species except c fragile table 2 identified in this study have been reported in humans laishram et al 2012 ryan and cacciò 2013 ryan et al 2014 we assessed the public health risk of cryptosporidium and giardia infections attributable to recreational activities in the lakes morbidity was estimated here to be 158 5 cases 95 ci 1 8 1104 7 and 128 3 cases 95 ci 0 7 832 7 per 100 000 individuals per year for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis respectively a similar result of 208 69 per 100 000 individuals per year for both protozoan diseases was obtained in the three gorges reservoir with exposure during swimming and diving xiao et al 2013 however much higher incidence rates have been observed in other developing countries for example the rates of cryptosporidiosis among children and healthy people in iran were estimated to be 3 65 i e 3650 per 100 000 persons and 2 94 respectively berahmat et al 2017 and that of giardiasis in india was 8 in children and 37 1 in adults laishram et al 2012 the main reason may be that transmission through recreational water is just a small part of the many routes of transmission of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis the estimated disease burden caused by cryptosporidium during swimming and playing in interactive fountains 1 23 10 6 and 1 21 10 6 dalys pppy respectively was higher than the level of acceptable risk from waterborne exposure of 1 00 10 6 dalys pppy who 2011 however the risk for people who were involved in other recreational activities would be considered acceptable table 3 in contrast the burden of diarrhea disease in china among all ages is estimated to be 305 10 6 dalys pppy 95 ci 260 355 10 6 gbd diarrhoeal diseases collaborators 2017 this means that the burden attributable to recreational water associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis may be only a small fraction of the burden of diarrheal diseases in the studied region the present study also shows that most of the burden of disease is borne by adults aged 15 years because of the high proportion of this age group in the population fig 3 however the health burden of protozoa associated diarrheal disease in children should be highlighted because children were more likely to have an individual disease burden than adults table 4 in fact at the global level the diarrhea dalys for children younger than 5 years 14 8 10 4 dalys per child per year are nearly 5 fold higher than those for all people 3 05 10 4 dalys pppy gbd diarrhoeal diseases collaborators 2017 with respect to sex alone the health risk of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis associated with recreational water is higher for male than for female this is attributable to the fact that males tend to swallow more water than females during recreational activities dufour et al 2017 comparison of the daly results between studies is affected by the inconsistent use of disability weights and duration estimates gibney et al 2014 diarrheal diseases have three severity levels mild moderate and severe gbd diarrhoeal diseases collaborators 2017 in the present study to calculate the dalys we used different disability weights salomon et al 2012 and durations gibney et al 2014 for each level of severity of age rather than an average severity weight and duration as have been used in most previous daly studies of age chhipi shrestha et al 2017 havelaar and melse 2003 vijgen et al 2007 our dalys per 1000 cases estimate table 3 for cryptosporidiosis was higher than a previous australian estimate 2 17 vs 1 7 respectively gibney et al 2014 but lower than that estimated in the netherlands 2 17 vs 2 9 respectively havelaar et al 2012 our result for giardiasis was similar to an australian result 1 58 vs 1 6 respectively gibney et al 2014 but again lower than that of the dutch 1 58 vs 2 1 respectively havelaar et al 2012 in addition to life expectancy the differences among the cfrs used in these studies were the main contributors to these differences no cryptosporidium or giardia associated death was reported in the australian study whereas each of the diseases caused two deaths in the 16 5 million dutch populations besides the protozoan concentration c o and infectivity constant r the fraction of the population exposed f the frequency of exposure per year n the water ingestion rate and the duration of interactive fountain play were the most sensitive parameters fig 5 indicating that the behavioral characteristics of the recreational participants were the most important factors affecting the variability in the disease burdens of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis it should be noted that the fraction of the population exposed 1 96 was an average value across china and that this was lower than that reported in zhejiang province china 10 5 21 6 an et al 2011 according to our model the health burden of recreational water associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis would increase to 171 10 6 dalys pppy for a population fraction of 55 2 95 upper confidence limit for f and to 19 4 10 6 dalys pppy for an exposure frequency of 145 95 upper confidence limit of n fig 6 consequently controlling the proportion of people exposed and reducing the number of times of exposure would be the most cost effective intervention for reducing diarrheal disease associated with recreational water use 5 conclusions the incidence genotypes and risks of cryptosporidium and giardia were studied simultaneously in multipurpose recreational lakes for the first time our results show that 1 the protozoa were common in the lakes and that the surface runoff from a nearby zoo during heavy rainfall events might be one of the main sources of protozoan contamination 2 molecular analyses showed that all of the detected g lamblia assemblages and cryptosporidium species detected except c fragile have been reported previously in humans 3 the disease burden of cryptosporidiosis attributable to exposure by swimming or playing in interactive fountains was estimated to be slightly above the reference risk level set by who of 1 00 10 6 dalys pppy 4 controlling the proportion of people exposed and reducing the number of times they are exposed could reduce the risk of diarrheal

recreational lakes was investigated with molecular characterization and a comprehensive quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of protozoan infections was performed considering multiple exposure pathways differences in age sex and disease severity and the genotypes of the protozoa forty three 82 7 and 51 98 1 water samples were positive for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts respectively with average counts of 3 65 oocysts 10 l and 12 58 cysts 10 l respectively six cryptosporidium species and three giardia lamblia assemblages were confirmed with molecular analyses the

importance of controlling the proportion of exposed individuals and reducing the frequency of exposure the methodology and results of this study will allow us to better evaluate and reduce the burden of cryptosporidium and or giardia infections associated with recreational water use in china and other countries graphical abstract image 1 keywords quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra cryptosporidium giardia genotyping recreational water 1 introduction cryptosporidium and giardia are critical parasites in the etiology of diarrhea worldwide and they often cause waterborne outbreaks during the period from 2011 to 2016 at least 239 and 142 waterborne outbreaks were attributed to cryptosporidium and giardia respectively and most of them occurred in developed countries efstratiou et al 2017 rosado garcia et al 2017 although few waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis were reported in developing countries it is clear that this distorted picture is attributable to the lack of surveillance systems including a failure to identify any of the parasites or to provide reports of outbreak events efstratiou et al 2017 in the most populous developing country china cryptosporidium and giardia are not usually detected because neither of these protozoans is listed as a routine inspection item in cases of diarrhea wang et al 2011b therefore the incidence of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis among the chinese is probably underestimated nevertheless these parasites have been widely detected in the feces of farm wild laboratory and zoo animals as well as house pets in china karanis et al 2007 li et al 2005 lv et al 2009 wang et al 2011a xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 they have also been detected in wastewater liu et al 2011 reclaimed water zhang et al 2015 and source water hu et al 2014 however the occurrence and risk of these protozoa in recreational waters in china have been unclear until now which makes it difficult to properly manage recreational waters and to develop reasonable standards of water quality the species genotypes of cryptosporidium and giardia present in the environment is an important factor affecting the risk of human infection and have often been ignored in previous studies that have assessed the risk these protozoa pose some cryptosporidium and giardia species are host specific and have been only found in animals laishram et al 2012 moore et al 2016 ryan et al 2014 zahedi et al 2016 of the nearly 20 species genotypes of cryptosporidium reported in humans c parvum c hominis c ubiquitum and c meleagridis are the commonest causative agents of cryptosporidiosis ryan et al 2014 similarly g lamblia also known as g duodenalis and g intestinalis is the only known giardia species that causes human disease it is divided at the genetic level into eight assemblages a h with different host specificities two of which a and b are the main etiological agents of human giardiasis ryan and cacciò 2013 therefore the identification of environmental protozoan species or assemblages should help to control the risks they pose to public health quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a useful method of predicting the human health risk of pathogens and it has been widely used to assess the infection risk of cryptosporidium and or giardia in various types of water de man et al 2014 ehsan et al 2015 pintar et al 2010 schoen and ashbolt 2010 zhang et al 2015 for instance the risk of recreational lake related cryptosporidium infection in canada was estimated to be as high as 10 infections per 1000 swims 95 confidence interval ci 2 30 or 1 0 10 2 per swim per person for children and 4 infections per 1000 swims 95 ci 4 10 for adults pintar et al 2010 lower risks were identified in belgium where the infection risk associated with recreational lakes was 2 79 5 74 10 5 for cryptosporidium and 0 704 1 46 10 4 for giardia per swim per person ehsan et al 2015 however as mentioned earlier risk assessments of these parasites rarely take into account information on the species genotypes that are infectious to humans which may lead to an overestimation of the risk lapen et al 2016 furthermore most previous studies have focused on the annual individual probability of infection without considering the severity of the disease which has made it difficult to compare the risks of different symptoms or illnesses to provide greater insight into the importance of recreational water in the transmission of these pathogenic parasites we undertook the present study to determine the occurrence genotypes and health risks of cryptosporidium and giardia in recreational water during the high occurrence season for waterborne cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis efstratiou et al 2017 hopkins et al 2013 loganthan et al 2012 perkins and trimmier 2017 rosado garcia et al 2017 compared with previous studies of the risks presented by these parasites this study has the following characteristics i different factors including multiple exposure routes age and sex were considered when assessing exposure ii the gastroenteritis burden was calculated separately by its severity category i e differences in duration and disability and iii the fraction of oo cysts infectious to humans was considered the methodology used and our results will be helpful in better evaluating and reducing the burden of protozoan infection associated with recreational water in china and other regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and water sampling the tianjin waterpark 39 080 39 095 n 117 159 117 174 e is the largest urban park and recreation area within the city boundaries of tianjin china fig s1 in the supplemental material the park is an aaaa level tourist attraction awarded by the national tourism administration of the people s republic of china and attracts many chinese and foreign tourists in the summer festival the number of daily visitors to the park reaches nearly 100 000 the water area in the park is about 75 hectares and all the lakes are interconnected the replenishment pattern of the lakes is mainly by tap water and occasional heavy rainstorms the lakes in the park are used for a variety of purposes including limited water contact recreational activities such as rowing wading splashing and playing in interactive fountains although swimming is not allowed in the lakes hundreds of people mainly elderly residents from nearby swim there in the early morning in summer a total of 52 water samples were collected at the sampling points shown in fig s1 for the detection of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts at 10 day intervals during the busiest season of water related activity june october which is also the rainy season in the study area fig s2 each sample was 20 l and was used for both microscopic and molecular analyses 10 l for each 2 2 detection and enumeration of parasitic pathogens the morphological examination and enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts were performed by using previously described methods involving filtration flotation labeling with a monoclonal antibody and microscopic analysis xiao et al 2012b quality control tests in which 10 l of distilled water was seeded with a known number of oo cysts revealed that the method permitted an average recovery rate of 41 25 for cryptosporidium oocysts and 38 32 for giardia cysts table s1 which met the acceptance criteria more than 38 and 27 respectively of the united states environmental protection agency method 1623 1 2 3 molecular characterization of cryptosporidium and giardia the concentrated pellet from another 10 l of each samples was processed for dna extraction with the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals france according to the manufacturer s instructions and eluted in 50 μl of reagent grade water as described previously xiao et al 2012b two step nested pcrs were used to amplify a 435 bp fragment of the cryptosporidium small subunit ssu rrna locus and a 292 bp fragment of the giardia ssu rrna gene respectively the primers and amplification conditions table s2 were adapted from plutzer et al 2008 the second pcr products positive for cryptosporidium or giardia were sent to beijing augct co ltd for direct sequencing with the second pcr primers on an abi 3730 automated dna sequencer bigdye terminator chemistry multiple alignment analyses with the appropriate reference sequences obtained from genbank were performed with clustal w in mega version 7 0 to identify the cryptosporidium species and giardia assemblages in the samples phylogenetic analyses based on the neighbor joining method were performed with the same software de lucio et al 2016 2 4 analyses of turbidity and total coliforms the turbidity of the samples was measured on site for each sample with a portable photometer and the results were expressed in nephelometric turbidity units ntu total coliform counts were determined with a five tube most probable numbers mpn method according to the chinese standard examination method for drinking water microbiological parameters gb t5750 12 2006 2007 briefly 1 0 ml of each stage of a 10 fold serial dilution was transferred into five tubes of lactose peptone broth 10 0 ml with inverted durham tubes after incubation for 24 2 h at 37 c the tubes that showed an acidic reaction or gas production were further tested for confirmation of coliforms using eosin methylene blue agar medium according to the above standard gb t5750 12 2006 2007 2 5 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra 2 5 1 exposure assessment the observed protozoan concentrations c o and the recovery r of the detection method were fitted using a continuous distribution similar to that used in previous studies verbyla et al 2016 xiao et al 2012a and were used to estimate the real concentrations c r of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts in the lakes the methodology described by sales ortells and medema 2015 was used and the concentrations were calculated with eq 1 1 c r c o gamma c o 1 1 r r considering the purposes of the lakes studied two main exposure routes were examined in this study among the many potential exposure routes full contact recreation i e swimming and limited water contact activities i e rowing wading and playing in interactive fountains many studies have evaluated the amount of water swallowed during swimming and the estimates ranged from 10 ml to 50 ml however recent studies have shown that there is a significant difference in the volumes of water ingested between peoples in different age groups and of different sexes because their rates of ingestion and the time spent in the water differ dufour et al 2017 suppes et al 2016 the geometric mean of the water ingestion rate i for child swimmers was estimated to be 23 7 ml h 95 ci 17 33 whereas those for female and male adults were 9 4 ml h 95 ci 8 11 and 16 4 ml h 95 ci 13 20 respectively dufour et al 2017 similar results with an average i of 24 2 ml h and 6 3 ml h for children and adult swimmers respectively were obtained by suppes et al 2016 the time t spent in swimming which varied from 40 25 to 65 00 min for differently aged people table s3 were taken from the highlights of the chinese exposure factors handbook duan et al 2015 when assessing interactive fountain activity the water ingestion rate by inhalation hand to mouth contact and droplet ingestion was 7 04 ml h 95 ci 0 43 21 68 de man et al 2014 and the duration of exposure was 0 5 2 5 h with a mean value of 1 6 h hoebe et al 2004 to account for any uncertainty lognormal distributions were used to describe the water ingestion rate and the duration of activity as in previous similar risk assessments dufour et al 2017 soller et al 2010 suppes et al 2016 the ingested dose d was then calculated with eq 2 2 d c r i t for the other limited water contact activities the volume of water ingested v per event was estimated to be 3 9 ml for rowing and 3 7 ml for wading dorevitch et al 2011 we assumed that v followed a lognormal distribution with scale parameters derived from the estimated v and the corresponding 95th percentile 11 8 for rowing and 11 2 for wading the exposure dose by this route was consequently estimated with eq 3 3 d c r v 2 5 2 dose response assessment a dose response analysis is used to calculate the probability of infection p d inf after exposure to the pathogen of interest various dose response models have been shown to be appropriate for measuring microbial risk such as the exponential log normal weibull and beta poisson models messner and berger 2016 teunis and havelaar 2000 of these the exponential model is widely applied to many protozoa and viruses at a low dose exposure brouwer et al 2017 chhipi shrestha et al 2017 verbyla et al 2016 xiao et al 2018 the probability of infection per exposure event for cryptosporidium or giardia was calculated with eq 4 4 p d inf 1 exp r d fi where r is the fraction of oocysts or cysts that will successfully initiate an infection if ingested by any human host who 2009 and fi is the fraction of protozoa potentially infectious to humans the parameter r was estimated to be 0 09 for cryptosporidium schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2010 usepa 2005 and 0 02 for giardia mcbride et al 2013 schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2010 it is noteworthy that r represents the infection response mounted by healthy volunteers and is therefore not representative of the responses of children or the elderly usepa 2005 nevertheless we separated the risks for children and adults primarily based on different levels of exposure rather than on their different dose response functions pintar et al 2010 we assumed the same dose response function for children and adults as in previous studies ehsan et al 2015 pintar et al 2010 xiao et al 2012a and the parameter r followed a beta distribution with shape parameters α and β ehsan et al 2015 for cryptosporidium α and β were set at 5 13 and 51 87 respectively for giardia these values were set at 1 83 and 90 05 respectively these values were derived from the estimated r and the corresponding range 0 036 0 140 for cryptosporidium usepa 2005 and the 97 5th percentile 0 057 for giardia ehsan et al 2015 we assumed that all the genotypes of cryptosporidium and giardia that have been reported in humans are infectious for humans and there was no provision for the potential die off of oo cysts caused by sunlight predation or other factors because the resistance of thick walled oo cysts to environmental factors is extreme zhang et al 2015 the estimated fi was therefore calculated as the number of samples containing human infectious genotypes divided by the number of samples successfully genotyped eq 5 5 fi number of samples containing human infectious genotypes number of samples successfully genotyped 2 5 3 risk characterization the annual probability of infection p y inf was calculated from the variable outcome p d inf estimates and the frequency of events n in 1 year using eq 6 according to the highlights of the chinese exposure factors handbook duan et al 2015 only 1 96 of chinese people swim in surface water and the frequency of swimming is eight times a month during summer generally between june and october the fraction f and frequency of limited water contact activities were assumed to be the same as those for swimming the probability of illness p ill inf attributable to infection is often calculated by fitting with different statistical distributions based on studies of disease outbreaks and epidemiological investigations and the mean values were calculated to be 0 71 for cryptosporidium xiao et al 2012a and 0 45 for giardia chhipi shrestha et al 2017 therefore the annual risk of illness in the population p y ill was calculated with eq 7 6 p y inf 1 1 p d inf n 7 p y ill p y inf p ill inf f the endpoint of the risk assessment was characterized as an annual health burden b expressed in disability adjusted life years dalys dalys can be defined as the total years of life lost yll due to premature mortality and years lived with disability yld eq 8 the yll metric essentially corresponds to the number of deaths d j multiplied by the standard life expectancy e j at the age j at which death occurs eq 9 according to the national bureau of statistics of china www stats gov cn the life expectancies of chinese females and males in 2016 were 79 43 and 73 64 years respectively table s3 the case fatality rate cfr for cryptosporidiosis was estimated to be 1 0 10 5 based on the outbreak in milwaukee usa in 1993 addiss et al 1996 xiao et al 2012a whereas giardiasis is generally considered nonfatal gibney et al 2014 laishram et al 2012 8 b yyl yld 9 yyls j n d j e j to estimate yld on a population basis the number of disability cases n j was multiplied by the average duration of the disease l j and a disability weight w j that reflects the severity of the disease on a scale from 0 perfect health to 1 dead considering the differences of the duration and disability weight for different levels of severity of acute gastroenteritis age caused by cryptosporidium or giardia the ylds of the three case types i e 1 mild 2 outpatient and 3 hospitalized were calculated separately and their proportions p in the cases were taken into account table s4 consequently yld of the parasitic diseases in the population was calculated with eq 10 10 yld j n i 3 n j p i l j i w j i 2 6 data analysis the pasw statistics 18 computer software package was used to calculate the summary statistics the nonparametric spearman s correlation two tailed test was used to evaluate the relationships among total coliforms turbidity and protozoan concentrations a χ2 test was used to calculate possible significant differences between the concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia as in a previous study carmena et al 2007 statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 probability distribution fitting monte carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses were conducted with risk version 5 5 palisade corporation usa from each distribution input summarized in table 1 10 000 values were randomly sampled for each model to account for the uncertainty and variability 3 results 3 1 occurrence of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts a total of 52 water samples from the recreational lakes were examined during the period between june and october 2015 with cryptosporidium oocysts detected in 43 82 7 samples and giardia cysts in 51 98 1 the percentage detection of oocysts and cysts did not change much 69 2 92 3 for cryptosporidium and 92 3 100 0 for giardia at the four sampling sites p 0 05 the counts of cryptosporidium oocysts in all the samples ranged between 0 and 15 per 10 l with a mean of 3 65 oocysts per 10 l whereas the mean concentration of giardia was 12 58 cysts per 10 l ranging from 0 to 43 cysts per 10 l fig 1 similar to the positive detection rates there was no significant difference in the concentrations of the two protozoa in the water samples collected at different sites the variations in the cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations in the water samples at different times are shown in fig s3 the mean concentrations of both parasites in the lakes declined generally during the study except for the peaks that occurred in late july the lowest cryptosporidium and giardia levels were both detected in early october with average ranges of 0 0 5 oocysts per 10 l and 4 5 5 3 cysts per 10 l respectively 3 2 molecular identification of parasites to identify the genotypes and possible transmission patterns of the parasites nested pcrs were performed on all 52 samples to amplify the partial ssu rrna genes of cryptosporidium and giardia respectively thirteen samples yielded the expected amplification products which were sequenced successfully according to the sequence analysis six cryptosporidium species c parvum c andersoni c hominis c meleagridis c fragile and c ubiquitum and three giardia lamblia assemblages a b and d were identified except for two water samples that contained both cryptosporidium and giardia each pcr positive sample contained only one protozoan species or assemblage the distributions of parasite species and or assemblages at different sampling sites are shown in table 2 the commonest protozoan genotypes were c parvum c andersoni and giardia assemblage a 3 3 relationship among total coliforms turbidity and parasitic protozoa total coliforms were detected in all the water samples at concentrations ranging from 2 103 mpn l to 6 5 105 mpn l the turbidity values varied between 19 and 134 ntu the statistical analysis revealed a strong linear correlation p 0 01 between the counts of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts weak associations were detected between turbidity and both cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations fig 2 no correlation was found between the number of total coliforms and the protozoan concentrations data not shown 3 4 health risk characterization the estimated annual incidence of diarrhea attributable to infection with cryptosporidium and or giardia associated with various recreational activities in the lakes is shown in table 3 the exposure scenario of full water contact recreation i e swimming in the lakes had the highest incidence risk of 5 72 10 4 per person per year pppy 95 ci 0 03 43 33 10 4 for cryptosporidium and 4 04 10 4 pppy 95 ci 0 01 32 66 10 4 for giardia whereas the exposure while wading had the lowest risks of morbidity caused by cryptosporidium and giardia which were 2 20 10 4 pppy 95 ci 0 02 14 87 10 4 and 1 70 10 4 pppy 95 ci 0 01 11 77 10 4 respectively the average annual burdens of cryptosporidium and giardia infections attributable to all recreational activities were estimated to be 3 44 dalys per 1 000 000 individuals per year 95 ci 0 04 23 51 and 1 81 dalys per 1 000 000 individuals per year 95 ci 0 01 12 96 respectively table 3 as expected the highest combined health burdens of recreational water related cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis were for swimming in the lakes 1 87 10 6 dalys pppy followed by playing in interactive fountains 1 82 10 6 dalys pppy rowing 0 80 10 6 dalys pppy and wading 0 75 10 6 dalys pppy fig 3 shows the age distribution of the chinese population and the recreational water associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis burdens most 65 71 of the total health burden on the population measured in dalys was associated with the group aged 15 60 years whereas only 21 16 of the burden was associated with the group aged 15 years and 13 13 was associated with people aged 60 years however given the proportion of each age group in the total population the burden of the protozoan disease in adults aged 15 60 years at the individual level was lower than that in children whereas it was higher than that in the elderly table 4 the odds ratios presented in table 4 also demonstrate that the disease burdens caused by cryptosporidium and giardia in the recreational lakes were more likely to affect males than females in terms of the severity of gastroenteritis most 87 8 of the total cryptosporidium and giardia associated gastroenteritis was mild whereas 12 20 of patients visited a general practitioner and 1 10 of them were hospitalized fig 4 however the highest contribution by severity to the total dalys was made by the outpatient cases followed by the mild hospitalized and fatal cases fig 4 3 5 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed by measuring spearman s rank order correlation to study the effects of the variation in the model inputs on the final output of the disease burden the results showed that the most sensitive input parameters in assessing the health burden imposed by water associated recreational activities were the fraction of the population exposed f and the frequency of exposure per year n other important influential factors included the concentration of protozoa in the water c o the water ingested rate i i the duration t i at interactive fountain play and the protozoan infectivity constants r of the exponential dose response model fig 5 4 discussion cryptosporidium and giardia are commonly found in recreational waters and cause outbreaks of disease hlavsa et al 2011 2015 in the present study cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts were detected at all the sampling sites in the lakes of tianjin waterpark fig s1 with average densities of 3 46 3 85 oocysts per 10 l and 11 15 14 54 cysts per 10 l respectively fig 1 much higher concentrations of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts with ranges of 10 600 oocysts and 10 1600 cysts per 10 l respectively were reported in recreational rivers in spain castro hermida et al 2010 whereas similar contamination levels were found in some recreational lake waters in the netherlands 1 4 cryptosporidium oocysts per 10 l and 1 8 giardia cysts per 10 l schets et al 2008 in malaysia which is an asian country like china a density of 1 7 11 cysts per 10 l of giardia was detected but no cryptosporidium oocysts were found lim et al 2009b therefore the protozoan levels in the recreational waters of this study fall within the ranges reported elsewhere a certain time characteristic was observed in the protozoan contamination of the tianjin lakes with the exception of the observed peak concentrations the concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia decreased over time fig s3 previous studies have shown that there is a short period of high concentrations of microorganisms in surface waters after heavy rainfall events which are attributed to sewage overflow and surface runoff bertone et al 2016 eregno et al 2016 serdarevic et al 2012 as shown in fig s2 the weather pattern during the study period was that of a typical rainy season with several heavy rain events the strong washing effect of the heavy rainfall on 19 july 2015 might explain the peaks in protozoan levels observed in late july sterk et al 2016 in contrast the declining concentrations of protozoans with time suggest that these parasites were not discharged continuously into the lakes these variations in protozoan concentrations were consistent with our field investigation that showed that the lakes were mainly replenished with tap water and occasionally with heavy rainfall molecular analyses confirmed that six cryptosporidium species and three g lamblia assemblages were present in the examined water samples all of them have been well documented in animals worldwide ryan and cacciò 2013 ryan et al 2014 2016 squire and ryan 2017 it is noteworthy that c fragile which was detected here has only been found in amphibians ryan et al 2014 considering that there are amphibians and many other animals in the nearby zoo protozoan contamination in the lakes studied may be related to this proximity in fact it has been demonstrated that zoos that house a wide range of captive wildlife are ideal reservoirs of a myriad of pathogens karanis et al 2007 lim et al 2009a as discussed earlier the lakes are mainly replenished with tap water and occasionally with rainwater so the latter may be the major contributor to its contamination it can be speculated that surface runoff from the zoo reaching the lakes during heavy rainfall events is one source of the protozoan contamination in the lakes disturbance factors such as rowing mix the lake waters which may be why there was no significant difference in the concentrations of protozoa at different sampling sites highly positive correlations were observed between the cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations and each of them was associated with the level of turbidity in this study similar results were reported for both parasites and turbidity in samples from reservoirs in spain carmena et al 2007 and china xiao et al 2013 in terms of microbiological parameters xiao et al 2013 found that both total coliforms and escherichia coli which are used worldwide as indicator organisms for fecal contamination and microbial water hygiene carmena et al 2007 and enterococci correlated significantly with one another p 0 01 in surface waters whereas none of them adequately indicated the presence of protozoa in natural waters this is consistent with the finding that no protozoan concentration was related to the level of total coliforms in the present study in contrast several studies have found that counts of fecal bacteria were associated with the concentrations of protozoa in surface waters graczyk et al 2010 mons et al 2009 both cryptosporidium and giardia are highly resistant to environmental stress and can survive under stress longer than indicator bacteria who 2009 this may be one of the reasons for the different results in the studies cites above graczyk et al 2010 also noted that whether contaminated water is sampled and tested at a specific time would affects any correlation between fecal indicator bacteria and protozoa because 100 5 5 of the giardia assemblages and 90 9 10 of the cryptosporidium species except c fragile table 2 identified in this study have been reported in humans laishram et al 2012 ryan and cacciò 2013 ryan et al 2014 we assessed the public health risk of cryptosporidium and giardia infections attributable to recreational activities in the lakes morbidity was estimated here to be 158 5 cases 95 ci 1 8 1104 7 and 128 3 cases 95 ci 0 7 832 7 per 100 000 individuals per year for cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis respectively a similar result of 208 69 per 100 000 individuals per year for both protozoan diseases was obtained in the three gorges reservoir with exposure during swimming and diving xiao et al 2013 however much higher incidence rates have been observed in other developing countries for example the rates of cryptosporidiosis among children and healthy people in iran were estimated to be 3 65 i e 3650 per 100 000 persons and 2 94 respectively berahmat et al 2017 and that of giardiasis in india was 8 in children and 37 1 in adults laishram et al 2012 the main reason may be that transmission through recreational water is just a small part of the many routes of transmission of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis the estimated disease burden caused by cryptosporidium during swimming and playing in interactive fountains 1 23 10 6 and 1 21 10 6 dalys pppy respectively was higher than the level of acceptable risk from waterborne exposure of 1 00 10 6 dalys pppy who 2011 however the risk for people who were involved in other recreational activities would be considered acceptable table 3 in contrast the burden of diarrhea disease in china among all ages is estimated to be 305 10 6 dalys pppy 95 ci 260 355 10 6 gbd diarrhoeal diseases collaborators 2017 this means that the burden attributable to recreational water associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis may be only a small fraction of the burden of diarrheal diseases in the studied region the present study also shows that most of the burden of disease is borne by adults aged 15 years because of the high proportion of this age group in the population fig 3 however the health burden of protozoa associated diarrheal disease in children should be highlighted because children were more likely to have an individual disease burden than adults table 4 in fact at the global level the diarrhea dalys for children younger than 5 years 14 8 10 4 dalys per child per year are nearly 5 fold higher than those for all people 3 05 10 4 dalys pppy gbd diarrhoeal diseases collaborators 2017 with respect to sex alone the health risk of cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis associated with recreational water is higher for male than for female this is attributable to the fact that males tend to swallow more water than females during recreational activities dufour et al 2017 comparison of the daly results between studies is affected by the inconsistent use of disability weights and duration estimates gibney et al 2014 diarrheal diseases have three severity levels mild moderate and severe gbd diarrhoeal diseases collaborators 2017 in the present study to calculate the dalys we used different disability weights salomon et al 2012 and durations gibney et al 2014 for each level of severity of age rather than an average severity weight and duration as have been used in most previous daly studies of age chhipi shrestha et al 2017 havelaar and melse 2003 vijgen et al 2007 our dalys per 1000 cases estimate table 3 for cryptosporidiosis was higher than a previous australian estimate 2 17 vs 1 7 respectively gibney et al 2014 but lower than that estimated in the netherlands 2 17 vs 2 9 respectively havelaar et al 2012 our result for giardiasis was similar to an australian result 1 58 vs 1 6 respectively gibney et al 2014 but again lower than that of the dutch 1 58 vs 2 1 respectively havelaar et al 2012 in addition to life expectancy the differences among the cfrs used in these studies were the main contributors to these differences no cryptosporidium or giardia associated death was reported in the australian study whereas each of the diseases caused two deaths in the 16 5 million dutch populations besides the protozoan concentration c o and infectivity constant r the fraction of the population exposed f the frequency of exposure per year n the water ingestion rate and the duration of interactive fountain play were the most sensitive parameters fig 5 indicating that the behavioral characteristics of the recreational participants were the most important factors affecting the variability in the disease burdens of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis it should be noted that the fraction of the population exposed 1 96 was an average value across china and that this was lower than that reported in zhejiang province china 10 5 21 6 an et al 2011 according to our model the health burden of recreational water associated cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis would increase to 171 10 6 dalys pppy for a population fraction of 55 2 95 upper confidence limit for f and to 19 4 10 6 dalys pppy for an exposure frequency of 145 95 upper confidence limit of n fig 6 consequently controlling the proportion of people exposed and reducing the number of times of exposure would be the most cost effective intervention for reducing diarrheal disease associated with recreational water use 5 conclusions the incidence genotypes and risks of cryptosporidium and giardia were studied simultaneously in multipurpose recreational lakes for the first time our results show that 1 the protozoa were common in the lakes and that the surface runoff from a nearby zoo during heavy rainfall events might be one of the main sources of protozoan contamination 2 molecular analyses showed that all of the detected g lamblia assemblages and cryptosporidium species detected except c fragile have been reported previously in humans 3 the disease burden of cryptosporidiosis attributable to exposure by swimming or playing in interactive fountains was estimated to be slightly above the reference risk level set by who of 1 00 10 6 dalys pppy 4 controlling the proportion of people exposed and reducing the number of times they are exposed could reduce the risk of diarrheal
