13300,development and designing of heavy metal ion separation systems from wastewater play a essential role in environmental protection for this purpose in this research we modeled the synthetic wastewater samples and investigated the capabilities of nano porous silicon carbide membranes sic with fluorine nitrogen and hydroxyl atom decorated pores under hydrostatic pressures increase of applied pressure on sic with larger pore diameters had more intense effects on water flux and ion rejection it was also found that due to different electronic properties of decorated atoms in the edge of pores which played important roles in their interactions with water molecules and metal ions as well as energy barrier and permeation water flux and ion injection were improved the potential of mean force pmf calculation showed that the energy barrier for passing through functionalized pores was higher for metal ions and lower for water molecules the presence of functional groups in the edge of sic pores provided selective ion rejection property which was highest for zn2 ions pmf analysis results proved that the pmf values of metal ions were in the following comparative order sic f sic n sic oh sic it was also observed that increase in temperature significantly increased water flux and decreased ion rejection also sic membrane separation systems improved ion rejection in the presence of electric field along the opposite direction of piston movement which was more intense in functionalized membranes and results indicated that in voltage of 200 mv å had the best ion rejection of about 98 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords purification wastewater heavy metal ions sic membrane pmf 1 introduction purification and reusing of water from secondary effluents is becoming a more appealing approach to the growing problems of water shortage and deterioration of water quality 1 thus water treatment systems that are multifunctional compact flexible resilient chemical free and energy efficient are needed to address global water shortage and water pollution 2 since water is an essential part of our everyday lives effective treatment technologies are required to clean and recycle water 3 osmotic pressure driven membranes have recently attracted increased interest in water and water purification due to their lower energy consumption compared to other available methods 4 multistage flash msf multi effect distillation med and reverse osmosis ro are some of the most commonly used processes in water treatment desalination however ro is gaining greater market share 5 7 due to its lower energy consumption ro water treatment process entails applying pressure to feed water to push freshwater molecules through a permeable membrane filtering ions and other contaminants in the process while allowing freshwater to pass through 7 9 several membrane types such as thin film composite tfc materials 10 12 ceramics 13 15 nanotubes 16 17 and two dimensional 2d structures such as boron nitride bnns 18 mxene 19 mos2 20 and zeolites 21 are used in ro for drinking water purification as well as wastewater treatment and reuse these play important roles in supplying reliable and safe water mitigating adverse environmental effects and providing water availability 22 despite the advantages of nanoporous membranes in water desalination such as high water permeability and ion rejection they have a some disadvantages there are some vital elements in water that are beneficial to human health removing all ions from water is one of the disadvantages of this materials that led many scientists to use other methods to compensate for this issue among ceramic 2d membranes sic has a honeycomb structure which composed of silicon and carbon atoms 23 similar to graphene structure sic with si and c atoms use sp2 hybridization lin et al synthesized sic nanostructure experimentally 24 the double bonds between c and si are sp2 bonding type because si atoms has a high covalent radius and cannot form π bonding materials with honeycomb structure and aromatic rings have great electron density that hinders ions and molecules permeation sic has emerged as an excellent porous material for the treatment of wastewater owing to its advantages over more widely used polymeric membranes in terms of higher flux improved separation properties longer working life fouling resistance and smaller footprints 25 27 in addition to these attributes high chemical stability over the whole ph range good thermal resistance good mechanical strength high hardness feature and outstanding hydrothermal stability can be mentioned 28 30 using sic in metal ion separation applications nano pores must be created by drilling in its structure with eliminating c and si atoms the chemically functionalizing of pores in sic membrane could have a uniqe feature and different applications 31 chemical vapor deposition cvd is being used for the fabrication of sic 32 34 however there is a need for the deposition of sic at low temperatures on surfaces with high aspect ratios 35 which can be achieved using atomic layer deposition ald process 36 several methods including ion irradiation 37 chemical etching 38 electron beam 39 and helium bombardment 40 are being used for creating pores in membranes however ald can also create functionalized pores 41 in experimental works numerous methods such as adsorption ion exchange chemical precipitation and membrane filtration have been utilized to separate heavy metal ions 42 furthermore some experimental works were carried out on integrating pore into nanosheets ion bombardment is one of the methods for creating pore in nanosheets 43 to give new characteristics to materials chemical functional groups such as f n oh and etc could be introduced on materials 44 lin et al 45 created pores in bnns by using ball milling method then for functionalizing they used long alkyl chain amine which resulted in the creation of an acid base interaction between amine groups and bnns surface these functional groups could be influential in separation processes also many experimrntal studies claimed that the pores could functionalized with different atoms in membranes 46 48 moreover with functionalizing the edge of pores despite adjusting pore size the selective separation capability of the nano porous membrane could be enhanced cohen tanugi et all designed functionalized graphene for purification of salted water 49 they investigated the purification performance by considering pore size different applied reverse osmosis pressure and chemical functionalization in a study by das et al 50 on the permeability behavior of silicon carbide based membranes a membrane with porosity 48 vol and mechanical strength 31 5 mpa showed water permeability of 13 298 lm 2h 1bar 1 on the other hand chen et al 34 used chemical vapor deposition to study the effect of tuning pore size due to a combination of hydrophilic and charge interactions the formed sic deposited ultrafiltration membranes showed low fouling characteristics and slight permeance losses during oil in water emulsion filtration furthermore wit et al 51 used sic to develop a highly permeable and mechanically robust hollow fiber membrane with a very high water permeability of 50 000 l m 2 h 1 under 1 bar pressure difference however apart from high permeability the selectivity of these membranes also needed great attention in addition to pollutants heavy metal ions such as zn2 pb2 and cd2 are other forms of harmful pollutants that can easily pass through membranes used in wastewater treatment functional groups attached to the pore edges of membranes are another important factor in the water treatment process in the water treatment process hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups have different effects 52 53 thus allowing the applications of pore chemistry beyond filtration 54 pore chemistry plays an vital role in changing water flux 55 several methods have been applied in the functionalization of sic for different purposes 56 58 adding different functional groups to the edges of formed pores results in more stable and highly permeable membranes 59 60 applying electric fields is an innovative method to solve the discussed disadvantage also it can be effective in water desalination processes and water transportation recently in many studies utilized electric field for nanofluid transport through nanostructures was investigated li et al drive the water through nanotube by applying electromagnetic field in rotating manner 61 also theoretical investigation in effect of electric fields on the water flow rate in the carbon nanostructures was reported 62 in another work the significance of external electric field direction in water flow rate through nanochannel was studied 63 meanwhile as our best knowledge no similar work has been ever done in the literature to date to investigate the water desalination performance with different functionalized sic nanostructure and with different ions type under applied electric field and pressure to the best of our knowledge no experimental or theoretical study has been reported in the literature on the removal of zn2 pb2 and cd2 heavy metal ions by functionalized sics hence in the present work molecular dynamics md and density functional theory dft simulations were performed to study the effects of f n and oh functional groups on water flux and ion rejection under different hydrostatic pressures because of their important role in the interactions of water molecules and ions in addition an electric field was applied to study its effects on ion permeation furthermore we also studied water flux as functions of pore size applied hydrostatic pressure ion rejection and energy barrier using pmf overall we tried to provide an understanding of the role of functionalized group at pore of sic in the water treatment process 2 simulation methodology in this study the possibility of the elimination of cd2 pb2 and zn2 heavy metal ions using silicon carbide sic membrane with functionalized pores under reverse osmosis has been investigated through dft and molecular dynamics md simulations cd2 pb2 and zn2 have different atomic weights 112 41 207 2 and 65 38 u respectively and each metal ion was dissolved in water at the same molecular concentration 0 6 mol l 1 in many similar works heavy metal ion concentrations in aqueous solutions have been examined in the assumed range 64 67 in this research we used porous sic membranes that pores decorated with f n and oh functional groups to customize the physical and mechanical properties of membrane pores in the following section the effects of temperature and applied electric field on the efficiency of ion separation of the membranes are discussed the designed synthetic wastewater system contained a porous sic membrane above which aqueous solutions of heavy metal ions were placed and to apply reverse osmosis pressure graphene membranes were used on both sides of sic membrane which acted as pistons to keep the solutions under fixed pressure it is noted mentioning that to maintain experimental conditions the piston on the other side was exposed to atmospheric pressure of 1 bar the dimensions of the simulated system were 61 58 200 å along x y and z axis respectively the solution under the piston contained 8426 water molecules that tip3p model 68 was applied for the prediction of interactions of water molecules then 50 heavy metal ions of each cd2 pb2 and zn2 along with 300 corresponding salt ions cl 1 were randomly added and distributed into water using packmol software 69 atomic charges of the systems were considered to be neutral the overall diagram of the system is presented in fig 1 the surface area of the sic membrane was 61 å 58 å in the simulation systems the porosity concentration of sic was considered 9 5 that contained four same pores the pristine sic contained 734 atoms and to create pores 6 carbon atoms and 7 silicon atoms were eliminated and the corners of the pores were engineered by f n and oh functional groups in this study to obtain precise results resembling those obtained under laboratory conditions all porous sic membrane structures were optimized using b3lyp 6 31 g d p method 70 after designing and before md simulation then dft output structures were used in md simulation systems also partial charges of atomic structures were obtained using dft calculation results fig 2 shows different optimized structures with engineered pores that were studied in this work also table 1 summarizes the geometric and electronic properties of studied models all dft calculations were performed using gaussian 9 0 package 71 to evaluate the efficiency of the membranes in the separation of heavy metal ions as well as water permeability different pressures of 25 50 100 150 and 200 mpa were applied along z direction using graphene piston onto the solution containing section of the system and the other section was kept under 1 atm pressure then the amount of penetrated particles in the refined section was monitored throughout the simulation to prevent the movement of central sic membrane along the direction of pressure it was fixed during the simulation it is worth mentioning that graphene pistons were fixed on both sides of the system along x and y axis but could move by applying pressure along z axis the partial charge of carbon atoms in graphene pistons is considered zero all md simulations were performed using lammps package 72 73 and vmd software 74 was used for visualization of simulated systems before the simulation and in order to decrease the energy level of the simulated systems minimization was performed then in the equilibrium stage systems were equilibrated for 1 ns using nose hoover barostat and thermostat algorithm under constant canonical ensemble temperature of 298 k and pressure of 1 atm time steps were considered to be 0 1 fs and simulation duration time was 5 ns tersoff force field for c and si atoms in graphene and sic membranes were defined and functional groups were modeled using lennard jones potential in which force field parameters were obtained from reference 65 table 1 summarizes all 6 12 lennard jones parameters for atoms in the structures lorentz berthelot mixing rule 75 was applied for all pairwise l j terms between unlike particles l j interaction cutoff was considered 12 å long range electrostatic interaction were calculated using particle mesh ewald 76 periodic boundary conditions was applied along all directions nonbonded interactions among heavy metal ions and water molecules with sic and graphene membranes were expressed as 77 1 u nonbond 4 ϵ ij σ ij r ij 12 σ ij r ij 6 q i q j 4 π ε 0 r ij where ϵ ij and σ ij respectively are energy and length of lennard jones potential q i q j denotes charges on i and j atoms respectively r ij is center to center distance and ε 0 is dielectric permittivity constant all bonding and stretching interactions were modeled using harmonic potentials as 78 2 u bond 1 2 k r r r eq 2 3 u angle 1 2 k θ θ θ eq 2 non bonded cross interaction parameters of unlike pairs were determined by lorentz berthelot mixing rules the amount of applied hydrostatic pressure on solvent molecules through the application of force onto each carbon atom in graphene membrane piston was stated as 79 4 f p a n where p is the considered hydrostatic force and a and n are the surface area and the number of c atoms of graphene piston to determine the mechanism of separation through the functionalized pores of sic potential of mean force pmf 80 82 was calculated as the free energy profile of water molecules and heavy metal ions passing through pores using umbrella sampling method 83 umbrella sampling method was applied by considering water molecules or metal ions in simulation cell as probes therefore in smd simulations of the investigated samples water molecules and heavy metal ions were drawn as springs and the work of pulling was calculated as 84 5 w k υ z 0 t d t z t z 0 υ z t where k υ z and z 0 are spring constant pulling velocity and initial position of molecule respectively then pmf was calculated using free energy change g on the basis of jarzynski s equality 85 6 g β 1 ln exp βw where β k b t exp βw is ensemble average to enhance the accuracy of pmf calculation results smd simulations for each water molecule and heavy metal ion in each model were repeated 10 times under initial conditions accounting for 200 overall simulation runs for calculations then free energy of each ion was obtained through averaging the results obtained for 10 trajectories 3 result and discussion 3 1 geometrical and electronic properties after designing and preparation of the structures to optimize the geometry of the structures and obtain the partial charges of atoms in the structure dft calculations were performed using gaussian software these calculations were performed using b3lyp level of theory and 6 31g basis set which have been applied in many research works 86 88 the partial charges of optimized atoms were determined using mullekin in the range of 1 67 1 67 as given in table 1 also fig 3 shows the charge distribution and optimized pore diameters which were found to range from 4 1 to 10 3å then optimized structures were applied to conduct all simulations 3 2 water flux and ion separation performance under different applied pressures in this study water flux was equal to the number of water molecules passing through the pores along z direction in the unit of time fig 4 shows water flux in different systems containing sic membranes with pores decorated with f n and oh functional groups under different hydrostatic pressures partials charges in sic and decorated atoms on pore edges could alter resistance to the entrance of water molecules and heavy metal ions resulting in higher or lower water flux with the increase of hydrostatic pressure the mobility of water molecules and the number of contacts were increased resulting in the passage of water molecules from pores however with this change in behavior with pressure increase up to 50 mpa in functionalized pores unlike pristine ones due to smaller diameters no variation was observed in the increasing trend of flux in all systems the flux increasing trend was linearly with applying higher pressure the highest flux in pristine sic was due to higher diameters of pores compared to functionalized membranes the effect of diameter increase on flux rate and ion separation was also reported 89 92 as shown in fig 4 it could be seen that flux rate through sic n membrane followed a similar trend to that of sic oh to up to 80 mpa however at higher pressures due to stronger effect of hydrostatic pressure a similar behavior to that of sic f was observed which was indicative of similar susceptibility of the two membranes at higher pressures it is note mentioning that sic f membrane let the lowest water flux to up to 50 mpa which indicated non susceptibility to hydrostatic pressure up to this point due to the variations of water flux rate in these membranes it could be concluded that pore diameter and decorating atom type of the pore were important factors in determining the amount of permeated water molecules as can be seen from fig 4 the effect of pore chemistry on water flux was more intensive at lower pressures for example at 25 mpa although the pore diameter in sic model was about 2 5 times larger than that in sic oh model there was not much difference in the amount of water flux in systems with functionalized pores o atoms in water molecules formed hydrogen bonds with h atoms on pore edges also h atoms of ware molecules formed hydrogen bonds with f n and o atoms in this process f n and o atoms acted as electronegative atoms negatively charged atoms on pore corners such as f h and n could increase water flux since they cause the attachment of water molecules on both membrane sides acting as canals to facilitate water flux on both membrane sides therefore decorated atoms on pore corners could affect water flux rate by increasing pressure water flux difference between sic and functionalized models was increased because hydrostatic force prevailed the pore chemistry effect fig 5 shows total ion rejection percentage for different systems with sic membranes for pristine sic membranes it was witnessed that at minimum pressure of 25 mpa heavy metal ions were able to pass through pores 10 3å in diameter which indicated 95 ion rejection efficiency in comparison functionalized membranes at 25 mpa presented 100 ion rejection efficiency with the increase of pressure to up to 50 mpa a 13 decrease of ion separation in pristine sic was observed while in functionalized membranes separation trend was almost constant and still above 99 in functionalized models with the pressure increase from 50 to 200 mpa ion rejection was linearly decreased which was 47 48 and 38 reduction for sic f sic n and sic oh membranes respectively nevertheless for pristine sic membrane the linear decreasing manner in ion rejection starts from a lower pressure range from 25 to 150 mpa which was 72 reduction also at pressures above 50 mpa due to susceptibility to pressure difference in the separation trend of functionalized membranes was started as presented in the curve shown in fig 5 sic oh membrane had the highest ion separation efficiency in the elimination of heavy metal ions sic oh membrane under 100 mpa presented about 37 ion separation capability and better flux rate than other functionalized membranes consequently the total ions rejection capability of examined sic membranes for pressure higher than 75 mpa is predominantly related to the size of the pores in other words due to the high pressure the effect of the hydrostatic force in ion rejection overcomes the pore barrier chemistry furthermore to investigate the efficiency of the selective separation of different ions and influences of functionalized groups by pristine and functionalized sic membranes the system under 100 mpa pressure at 298 k temperature was adopted as the main system the bar diagram in fig 6 presents that pristine sic membrane separated all four ions almost at similar efficiency due to its low and uniform energy barrier zn2 ions was most rejected on functionalized membranes higher zn rejection on sic f and sic oh membranes is due to higher electronegativity of functional atoms f and o on pores and the intrinsic tendency of this ion to have low resistance against the energy barriers of decorated pores the separation amount of pb2 and cd2 ions in systems with sic f and sic n membranes was almost similar due to similar pore diameter while in system with sic oh membrane separation of pb2 was about 4 higher than cd2 due to lower pore diameter the effects of functional groups became more appearant this behavior indicated lower resistance of pb2 ions compared to cd2 ions against energy barrier of pores decorated with oh functional group fig 7 shows the number of filtered water molecules during 5 ns simulation time for four examined systems with different sic membranes as was seen in pristine sic membrane water molecules had passed through pores at much higher rates than functionalized pores due to larger diameters and lower energy barrier comparison of the number of permeated molecules at the end of simulation showed that flux rate was directly related to pore diameter however comparison of these data at the beginning of simulation showed that sic oh functionalized membrane despite smaller pore diameters than the pores on other models due to the presence of hydrophilic atoms in decorated oh functional group water molecules tended to permeate through pores in the absence of hydrostatic pressure in other words the presence of hydrophilic atoms on pore edges could act as a molecular bridge to facilitate the permeation of water molecules presence of f atoms on pore edges of sic f membranes due to its weaker hydrophilic nature than n atom and oh functional group presented lower tendency to the permeation of water molecules resulting in stronger dependency on the presence of hydrostatic pressure in these systems in the diagram shown in fig 7 this hypothesis was clearly observed at times above 2 5 ns where high hydrostatic pressure overcame van der waals interactions between water molecules and f atoms on the pore edges of sic f membrane 3 3 water density and velocity distribution to better understand the mechanism of the permeation of water molecules through designed pores we investigated the structure of fluids in simulation box along z axis in the range of 30 z 30 under 100 mpa pressure considering the location of pore as zero point based on the profile of concentration and velocities of water molecules the results obtained from this section were extracted from the final simulation time of 5 ns fig 8 a b shows concentration profiles of water density and velocity respectively for current systems the peaks on the right side of the figures were assigned to the chamber under high hydrostatic pressure in fig 8 a as was seen large peaks appeared in vicinity of membrane and on high pressure side due to high van der waals interactions among water molecules and sic atoms on the surface of membrane water molecules tended to accumulate at this location and form layered water structure on the other hand high pressure caused further accumulation of water molecules on high pressure side of the membrane and the difference in the sharpness of peaks compared to those on the left side low pressure are evident it is also note mentioning that water concentration at the center of pore which contained flux was the lowest fig 8 b shows sharper peaks of velocity near the point z 0 in low pressure chamber which indicated high velocity of water molecules after being released from high pressure region and passing through the pore comparison of the power of concentration peaks for recently studied models showed that the strongest peak was obtained for sic oh membrane pore and the weakest concentration peak was obtained for pristine sic pore with the largest pore diameter similar trend was also observed for velocity profile therefore it could be concluded that in models containing pores with lower diameters due to higher permeation barrier and lower flux water molecules tended to further accumulate near the membrane also the first peaks of sic n and sic oh membranes appeared at lower distances which indicated stronger van der waals interactions among water molecules and n atoms and oh functional group average concentration of water in atmospheric pressure low pressure side was found to be about 1g cm3 which seemed to be reasonable it is noteworthy that for other systems with different pressures also similar concentration and velocity profiles were obtained 3 4 radial distribution function rdf of heavy metal ions in this section the distribution and behavior of heavy metal ions as a reference and density of hydrogen atoms of water molecules in radial as a function of distance in the solution under 100 mpa pressure at 298 k have been investigated in fig 9 for each of 4 ions one sharp peak with different intensities appeared this difference showed that the ions had different hydration numbers r denotes the closest covalent distance between ion particles and hydrogen atoms of water the first peak at 2 3å was assigned to the distance of cl 1 ion from hydrogen atoms of water and was the first hydration shell which was the closest to ion in the range of water molecule the second and third peaks were related to the hydration shell of zn2 and cd 2 ions at about 2 95å and fourth peak at 3 35å belonged to pb2 ion since the charge of all metal ions was 2 a comparison of peak strengths of these 3 ions revealed that zn2 and cd2 ions had larger peaks than pb2 ion since they had stronger and more stable interactions with van der waals interactions with water molecules this phenomenon resulted in the higher accumulation of these ions especially zn2 with water molecules and therefore better ion rejection the findings of this section as shown in fig 6 also proved that zn2 ions had better ion rejection property since this analysis focused on the behavior of ions near water molecules the type of applied membrane as well as change of pressure and temperature did not affect the obtained results fig 10 shows the integration of rdf for ion and water indicating the average number of water molecules n ab in hydration shell with distance r from ion center the value of this parameter was obtained as 7 n ab 4 πρ 0 r g r r 2 dr where ρ r and g r are density radial distance and rdf respectively the value of this parameter was found to be 5 to 6 for heavy metal ions and about 8 for chlorine which indicated the number of water molecules surrounding them 3 5 potential mean force pmf calculation pmf parameter predicts the possibility of the passage of ions and water molecules by calculating energy barrier exerted onto them while passing the membrane pore higher pmf values for a particle indicate higher energy barrier exerted onto it making its passage through the pore more difficult to do so first systems were equilibrated at 298k under atmospheric pressure in the meantime metal ions and water molecules were kept at motion start point at 15å to equilibrate the surrounding water molecules then for each ion in each system the simulation process was repeated 10 times each time for 1ns and pmf energy was determined from the average of the results obtained from the ten simulations the pulling force of harmonic constraint is 10 kcal mol å was pulled to 15å along z axis to point z 0 that the position of membrane pore fig 11 represents the average value of pmf for heavy metal ions chlorine and water molecule in differently designed models the figure also shows that water molecules had the lowest pmf value of about 7 3 to 14 7 kcal mol when passing through pores in all models therefore water molecules could pass through the pores easily with the lowest resistance in pristine sic system with larger pores than functionalized membranes water molecules passed the pores with the minimum pmf value of 7 3 kcal mol in sic oh modified membranes despite smaller diameter which inevitably results in higher energy barrier for water molecules due to the existence of oh functional group the value of pmf was not much different from that of sic membranes with larger pores i e water molecules passed sic oh pores with lowest energy barrier this property is an excellent advantage of decorating sic membrane pores with oh functional group also the ease of passage of water molecules from sic f pores with pmf 10 11 kcal mol was higher than that of sic n with pmf 14 67 kcal mol this procedure was repeated for all cd2 pb2 zn2 and cl1 ions according to fig 11 pmf values of ions in functionalized pore systems were more than 2 times that of pristine pore sic membrane with pmf value of 35 kcal mol higher forces were required for the passage of ions through the pores of functionalized membranes due to stronger electrostatic and van der waals interactions among functional atoms of pore edges with different partial charges and ions also the effect of pore diameter could not be neglected ion pmf curves showed that selective ion rejection property of functionalized pores was higher than pristine sic pores for example in pores of sic f and sic n ion rejection order was zn2 cl1 cd2 pb2 which complied with the results obtained in fig 6 for selective ion rejection pmf analysis results proved that the pmf values of metal ions were in the following comparative order sic f sic n sic oh sic 3 6 effect of temperature on water flux and ion rejection in this section 5 new simulations were performed to investigate the effect of temperature variation on flux and ion rejection capabilities main simulation conditions were 100 mpa pressure and 298k temperature considering fixed pressure of 100 mpa for 5 other systems we examined the simulation at different temperatures of the systems with 20 k intervals from 278 to 378 k as shown in fig 12 by increasing temperature from 278 to 378 k due to lower water viscosity in higher temperature increase of water flux was observed for all systems such that corresponding values for sic sic f sic n and sic oh systems presented 18 17 6 17 6 and 22 respectively with deeper look at the figure it was seen that the linear increasing trend of flux for functionalized membranes was observed to up to 358 k after which it remained almost constant however in pristine membrane this increase occurred linearly to up to boiling point at 378 k the reason for this could be larger pores in such membranes the permeation barriers of which could not overcome the high mobility of water molecules when approaching boiling temperature in systems with functionalized membranes due to smaller pores and higher permeation resistance water molecules could not permeate more at temperatures higher than 358 k so increasing trend of water flux remained almost constant it can also be seen that the difference in the amount of flux for the three functionalized sic models simulated at 298 k ambient temperature was low compared to higher temperatures due to differences in pore diameter the amount of pore size expansion under the effect of temperature rising was different so it could be concluded that the effect of pore size on flux for higher temperatures was more pronounced recently a similar theory has been obtained 93 fig 13 shows ion rejection percentages of recent systems versus temperature increase similar to previous sections it was also witnessed that temperature increase significantly decreased ion rejection in all systems this decrease in separation capability for sic sic f sic n and sic oh systems was 18 8 7 1 and 6 8 respectively as could be seen the system with sic n membrane presented the weakest effect on ion separation capability almost none with temperature increase however in the system with pristine membrane temperature increase had the maximum effect on the decrease of ion rejection remaining systems containing functionalized membranes presented minor reduction in ion rejection efficiency for temperature higher than 318 c therefore it could be concluded that the ion rejection capability of functionalized membrane was almost independent of temperature increase fig 14 shows water flux variations during 5 ns of simulation for selected pristine sic system at different temperatures with a close look at the beginning of the diagram it was found that before moving the piston increase of temperature increased kinetic energy and collision of water molecules increasing the number of permeated water molecules from 343 to 645 this trend was continued until the end of simulation such that at the end of simulation increase of temperature from 278 to 378 k resulted in the passage of 18 more water molecules 3 7 effect of electric field on water flux and ion rejection in this section the effect of electric field at different voltages on water flux and ion rejection was investigated also in many studies application of electric field for increasing ion permeation through membrane pores have been employed however in this work we tested electric field application to hinder the permeation of ions through membrane pores therefore we applied voltages of 0 50 10 200 and 300 mv å along opposite direction of piston movement along z axis on contaminated water the range of applied voltage utilized in this study was similar to other experimental works in which the electric field was applied for the separation of heavy metals 94 by observing simulation trajectory we found that ions with positive charges tended to move along the direction of electric field similar results were obtained in 95 fig 15 shows water flux at all applied voltages as was seen water flux at applied voltage of 50 mv å showed different behaviors in different models in system with pristine sic flux remained constant in those with sic f and sic n membranes corresponding value was increased by 5 and 7 respectively and in the system with sic oh membrane it was decreased by about 14 the reason for this difference in water permeation was differences in partial charge and electronic properties of functional groups on pore edges of sic membrane where energy barrier was changed in the presence of electric field then by applying higher voltages than 50 mv å water flux was linearly decreased to 240 6 ns in pristine sic membrane however in systems with functionalized membranes linear decrease was continued to 200 mv å and remained constant after 123 2 ns for sic n and 101 ns for sic f and sic oh according to fig 16 one could claim that like flux application of voltage had different effect on the ion rejection of systems here also up to 50 mv å ion rejection remained constant in sic n membrane and in sic f and sic oh membranes it was decreased by about 4 and 5 respectively however the system with pristine sic membrane presented about 18 improvement in ion rejection here also increase of applied voltage to up to 300 mv å linearly improved ion rejection in pristine sic membrane by up to 93 7 however in systems with functionalized membranes maximum ion rejection improvement occurred at lower voltage of 200 mv å at which more than 98 of ions were rejected indicating 20 higher ion rejection compared to the situation with no applied voltage which is a reasonable conclusion consequently electric field had a significant effect on the control of water flux and performance of systems in the separation of heavy meatal ion in pristine and functionalized sic membranes 4 conclusion in this research md simulations were conducted using dft calculations to study the separation of heavy metal ions zn2 pb2 and cd2 in wastewater samples using porous sic membranes under reverse osmosis pressure the tests were performed on four models including pristine sic membrane as well as functionalized sic with f n and oh functional groups water molecules in all models were able to permeate pores water flux was increased with the increase of pressure which was directly related to pore diameter functionalization of sic pores increased the system s ion rejection efficiency and metal ions presented different pore permeation behavior in functionalized pores than that in pristine ones selective separation ability therefore pore edge engineering using different atoms could control their diameter flux and ion rejection concentration profiles showed that water molecules beside membrane tended to accumulate which was maximum and minimum in sic oh and pristine sic membranes respectively rdf analyses showed that zn2 and cd2 ions had strong interactions with hydrogen atoms of water molecules at the distance of 3å which resulted in more accumulation of water molecules and higher resistance when permeating through pores integration of this rdf analysis showed that 5 6 water molecules surrounded metal ions pmf calculations showed that metal ions required more than 2 times higher energy barrier to pass through functionalized pores of sic membrane maximum energy barrier was obtained for zn2 ion which presented high ion rejection on the membrane the value of pmf for water molecules was very low which indicated their simpler permeation through pores such that in sic oh systems despite smaller pore diameter it was about 2 5 times that in pristine sic membrane however both membranes had almost similar mpf values in summary the order of pmf values of metal ions for permeation was sic f sic n sic oh sic also increase of temperature increased water flux and decreased ion rejection in addition we investigated the effect of applied voltage from 50 to 300 mv å in different systems and found that increase of voltage decreased water flux and increased ion rejection which was observed for functionalized membranes to up to 200 mv å at which about 99 ion rejection was witnessed consequently based on the obtained results we concluded that electric field played an important role in designing systems for the separation of heavy metal ions finally we noted that further experimental studies are essential to advance the application of sics membranes in the practical water purification application uncited references 32 33 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

13300,development and designing of heavy metal ion separation systems from wastewater play a essential role in environmental protection for this purpose in this research we modeled the synthetic wastewater samples and investigated the capabilities of nano porous silicon carbide membranes sic with fluorine nitrogen and hydroxyl atom decorated pores under hydrostatic pressures increase of applied pressure on sic with larger pore diameters had more intense effects on water flux and ion rejection it was also found that due to different electronic properties of decorated atoms in the edge of pores which played important roles in their interactions with water molecules and metal ions as well as energy barrier and permeation water flux and ion injection were improved the potential of mean force pmf calculation showed that the energy barrier for passing through functionalized pores was higher for metal ions and lower for water molecules the presence of functional groups in the edge of sic pores provided selective ion rejection property which was highest for zn2 ions pmf analysis results proved that the pmf values of metal ions were in the following comparative order sic f sic n sic oh sic it was also observed that increase in temperature significantly increased water flux and decreased ion rejection also sic membrane separation systems improved ion rejection in the presence of electric field along the opposite direction of piston movement which was more intense in functionalized membranes and results indicated that in voltage of 200 mv å had the best ion rejection of about 98 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords purification wastewater heavy metal ions sic membrane pmf 1 introduction purification and reusing of water from secondary effluents is becoming a more appealing approach to the growing problems of water shortage and deterioration of water quality 1 thus water treatment systems that are multifunctional compact flexible resilient chemical free and energy efficient are needed to address global water shortage and water pollution 2 since water is an essential part of our everyday lives effective treatment technologies are required to clean and recycle water 3 osmotic pressure driven membranes have recently attracted increased interest in water and water purification due to their lower energy consumption compared to other available methods 4 multistage flash msf multi effect distillation med and reverse osmosis ro are some of the most commonly used processes in water treatment desalination however ro is gaining greater market share 5 7 due to its lower energy consumption ro water treatment process entails applying pressure to feed water to push freshwater molecules through a permeable membrane filtering ions and other contaminants in the process while allowing freshwater to pass through 7 9 several membrane types such as thin film composite tfc materials 10 12 ceramics 13 15 nanotubes 16 17 and two dimensional 2d structures such as boron nitride bnns 18 mxene 19 mos2 20 and zeolites 21 are used in ro for drinking water purification as well as wastewater treatment and reuse these play important roles in supplying reliable and safe water mitigating adverse environmental effects and providing water availability 22 despite the advantages of nanoporous membranes in water desalination such as high water permeability and ion rejection they have a some disadvantages there are some vital elements in water that are beneficial to human health removing all ions from water is one of the disadvantages of this materials that led many scientists to use other methods to compensate for this issue among ceramic 2d membranes sic has a honeycomb structure which composed of silicon and carbon atoms 23 similar to graphene structure sic with si and c atoms use sp2 hybridization lin et al synthesized sic nanostructure experimentally 24 the double bonds between c and si are sp2 bonding type because si atoms has a high covalent radius and cannot form π bonding materials with honeycomb structure and aromatic rings have great electron density that hinders ions and molecules permeation sic has emerged as an excellent porous material for the treatment of wastewater owing to its advantages over more widely used polymeric membranes in terms of higher flux improved separation properties longer working life fouling resistance and smaller footprints 25 27 in addition to these attributes high chemical stability over the whole ph range good thermal resistance good mechanical strength high hardness feature and outstanding hydrothermal stability can be mentioned 28 30 using sic in metal ion separation applications nano pores must be created by drilling in its structure with eliminating c and si atoms the chemically functionalizing of pores in sic membrane could have a uniqe feature and different applications 31 chemical vapor deposition cvd is being used for the fabrication of sic 32 34 however there is a need for the deposition of sic at low temperatures on surfaces with high aspect ratios 35 which can be achieved using atomic layer deposition ald process 36 several methods including ion irradiation 37 chemical etching 38 electron beam 39 and helium bombardment 40 are being used for creating pores in membranes however ald can also create functionalized pores 41 in experimental works numerous methods such as adsorption ion exchange chemical precipitation and membrane filtration have been utilized to separate heavy metal ions 42 furthermore some experimental works were carried out on integrating pore into nanosheets ion bombardment is one of the methods for creating pore in nanosheets 43 to give new characteristics to materials chemical functional groups such as f n oh and etc could be introduced on materials 44 lin et al 45 created pores in bnns by using ball milling method then for functionalizing they used long alkyl chain amine which resulted in the creation of an acid base interaction between amine groups and bnns surface these functional groups could be influential in separation processes also many experimrntal studies claimed that the pores could functionalized with different atoms in membranes 46 48 moreover with functionalizing the edge of pores despite adjusting pore size the selective separation capability of the nano porous membrane could be enhanced cohen tanugi et all designed functionalized graphene for purification of salted water 49 they investigated the purification performance by considering pore size different applied reverse osmosis pressure and chemical functionalization in a study by das et al 50 on the permeability behavior of silicon carbide based membranes a membrane with porosity 48 vol and mechanical strength 31 5 mpa showed water permeability of 13 298 lm 2h 1bar 1 on the other hand chen et al 34 used chemical vapor deposition to study the effect of tuning pore size due to a combination of hydrophilic and charge interactions the formed sic deposited ultrafiltration membranes showed low fouling characteristics and slight permeance losses during oil in water emulsion filtration furthermore wit et al 51 used sic to develop a highly permeable and mechanically robust hollow fiber membrane with a very high water permeability of 50 000 l m 2 h 1 under 1 bar pressure difference however apart from high permeability the selectivity of these membranes also needed great attention in addition to pollutants heavy metal ions such as zn2 pb2 and cd2 are other forms of harmful pollutants that can easily pass through membranes used in wastewater treatment functional groups attached to the pore edges of membranes are another important factor in the water treatment process in the water treatment process hydrophobic and hydrophilic functional groups have different effects 52 53 thus allowing the applications of pore chemistry beyond filtration 54 pore chemistry plays an vital role in changing water flux 55 several methods have been applied in the functionalization of sic for different purposes 56 58 adding different functional groups to the edges of formed pores results in more stable and highly permeable membranes 59 60 applying electric fields is an innovative method to solve the discussed disadvantage also it can be effective in water desalination processes and water transportation recently in many studies utilized electric field for nanofluid transport through nanostructures was investigated li et al drive the water through nanotube by applying electromagnetic field in rotating manner 61 also theoretical investigation in effect of electric fields on the water flow rate in the carbon nanostructures was reported 62 in another work the significance of external electric field direction in water flow rate through nanochannel was studied 63 meanwhile as our best knowledge no similar work has been ever done in the literature to date to investigate the water desalination performance with different functionalized sic nanostructure and with different ions type under applied electric field and pressure to the best of our knowledge no experimental or theoretical study has been reported in the literature on the removal of zn2 pb2 and cd2 heavy metal ions by functionalized sics hence in the present work molecular dynamics md and density functional theory dft simulations were performed to study the effects of f n and oh functional groups on water flux and ion rejection under different hydrostatic pressures because of their important role in the interactions of water molecules and ions in addition an electric field was applied to study its effects on ion permeation furthermore we also studied water flux as functions of pore size applied hydrostatic pressure ion rejection and energy barrier using pmf overall we tried to provide an understanding of the role of functionalized group at pore of sic in the water treatment process 2 simulation methodology in this study the possibility of the elimination of cd2 pb2 and zn2 heavy metal ions using silicon carbide sic membrane with functionalized pores under reverse osmosis has been investigated through dft and molecular dynamics md simulations cd2 pb2 and zn2 have different atomic weights 112 41 207 2 and 65 38 u respectively and each metal ion was dissolved in water at the same molecular concentration 0 6 mol l 1 in many similar works heavy metal ion concentrations in aqueous solutions have been examined in the assumed range 64 67 in this research we used porous sic membranes that pores decorated with f n and oh functional groups to customize the physical and mechanical properties of membrane pores in the following section the effects of temperature and applied electric field on the efficiency of ion separation of the membranes are discussed the designed synthetic wastewater system contained a porous sic membrane above which aqueous solutions of heavy metal ions were placed and to apply reverse osmosis pressure graphene membranes were used on both sides of sic membrane which acted as pistons to keep the solutions under fixed pressure it is noted mentioning that to maintain experimental conditions the piston on the other side was exposed to atmospheric pressure of 1 bar the dimensions of the simulated system were 61 58 200 å along x y and z axis respectively the solution under the piston contained 8426 water molecules that tip3p model 68 was applied for the prediction of interactions of water molecules then 50 heavy metal ions of each cd2 pb2 and zn2 along with 300 corresponding salt ions cl 1 were randomly added and distributed into water using packmol software 69 atomic charges of the systems were considered to be neutral the overall diagram of the system is presented in fig 1 the surface area of the sic membrane was 61 å 58 å in the simulation systems the porosity concentration of sic was considered 9 5 that contained four same pores the pristine sic contained 734 atoms and to create pores 6 carbon atoms and 7 silicon atoms were eliminated and the corners of the pores were engineered by f n and oh functional groups in this study to obtain precise results resembling those obtained under laboratory conditions all porous sic membrane structures were optimized using b3lyp 6 31 g d p method 70 after designing and before md simulation then dft output structures were used in md simulation systems also partial charges of atomic structures were obtained using dft calculation results fig 2 shows different optimized structures with engineered pores that were studied in this work also table 1 summarizes the geometric and electronic properties of studied models all dft calculations were performed using gaussian 9 0 package 71 to evaluate the efficiency of the membranes in the separation of heavy metal ions as well as water permeability different pressures of 25 50 100 150 and 200 mpa were applied along z direction using graphene piston onto the solution containing section of the system and the other section was kept under 1 atm pressure then the amount of penetrated particles in the refined section was monitored throughout the simulation to prevent the movement of central sic membrane along the direction of pressure it was fixed during the simulation it is worth mentioning that graphene pistons were fixed on both sides of the system along x and y axis but could move by applying pressure along z axis the partial charge of carbon atoms in graphene pistons is considered zero all md simulations were performed using lammps package 72 73 and vmd software 74 was used for visualization of simulated systems before the simulation and in order to decrease the energy level of the simulated systems minimization was performed then in the equilibrium stage systems were equilibrated for 1 ns using nose hoover barostat and thermostat algorithm under constant canonical ensemble temperature of 298 k and pressure of 1 atm time steps were considered to be 0 1 fs and simulation duration time was 5 ns tersoff force field for c and si atoms in graphene and sic membranes were defined and functional groups were modeled using lennard jones potential in which force field parameters were obtained from reference 65 table 1 summarizes all 6 12 lennard jones parameters for atoms in the structures lorentz berthelot mixing rule 75 was applied for all pairwise l j terms between unlike particles l j interaction cutoff was considered 12 å long range electrostatic interaction were calculated using particle mesh ewald 76 periodic boundary conditions was applied along all directions nonbonded interactions among heavy metal ions and water molecules with sic and graphene membranes were expressed as 77 1 u nonbond 4 ϵ ij σ ij r ij 12 σ ij r ij 6 q i q j 4 π ε 0 r ij where ϵ ij and σ ij respectively are energy and length of lennard jones potential q i q j denotes charges on i and j atoms respectively r ij is center to center distance and ε 0 is dielectric permittivity constant all bonding and stretching interactions were modeled using harmonic potentials as 78 2 u bond 1 2 k r r r eq 2 3 u angle 1 2 k θ θ θ eq 2 non bonded cross interaction parameters of unlike pairs were determined by lorentz berthelot mixing rules the amount of applied hydrostatic pressure on solvent molecules through the application of force onto each carbon atom in graphene membrane piston was stated as 79 4 f p a n where p is the considered hydrostatic force and a and n are the surface area and the number of c atoms of graphene piston to determine the mechanism of separation through the functionalized pores of sic potential of mean force pmf 80 82 was calculated as the free energy profile of water molecules and heavy metal ions passing through pores using umbrella sampling method 83 umbrella sampling method was applied by considering water molecules or metal ions in simulation cell as probes therefore in smd simulations of the investigated samples water molecules and heavy metal ions were drawn as springs and the work of pulling was calculated as 84 5 w k υ z 0 t d t z t z 0 υ z t where k υ z and z 0 are spring constant pulling velocity and initial position of molecule respectively then pmf was calculated using free energy change g on the basis of jarzynski s equality 85 6 g β 1 ln exp βw where β k b t exp βw is ensemble average to enhance the accuracy of pmf calculation results smd simulations for each water molecule and heavy metal ion in each model were repeated 10 times under initial conditions accounting for 200 overall simulation runs for calculations then free energy of each ion was obtained through averaging the results obtained for 10 trajectories 3 result and discussion 3 1 geometrical and electronic properties after designing and preparation of the structures to optimize the geometry of the structures and obtain the partial charges of atoms in the structure dft calculations were performed using gaussian software these calculations were performed using b3lyp level of theory and 6 31g basis set which have been applied in many research works 86 88 the partial charges of optimized atoms were determined using mullekin in the range of 1 67 1 67 as given in table 1 also fig 3 shows the charge distribution and optimized pore diameters which were found to range from 4 1 to 10 3å then optimized structures were applied to conduct all simulations 3 2 water flux and ion separation performance under different applied pressures in this study water flux was equal to the number of water molecules passing through the pores along z direction in the unit of time fig 4 shows water flux in different systems containing sic membranes with pores decorated with f n and oh functional groups under different hydrostatic pressures partials charges in sic and decorated atoms on pore edges could alter resistance to the entrance of water molecules and heavy metal ions resulting in higher or lower water flux with the increase of hydrostatic pressure the mobility of water molecules and the number of contacts were increased resulting in the passage of water molecules from pores however with this change in behavior with pressure increase up to 50 mpa in functionalized pores unlike pristine ones due to smaller diameters no variation was observed in the increasing trend of flux in all systems the flux increasing trend was linearly with applying higher pressure the highest flux in pristine sic was due to higher diameters of pores compared to functionalized membranes the effect of diameter increase on flux rate and ion separation was also reported 89 92 as shown in fig 4 it could be seen that flux rate through sic n membrane followed a similar trend to that of sic oh to up to 80 mpa however at higher pressures due to stronger effect of hydrostatic pressure a similar behavior to that of sic f was observed which was indicative of similar susceptibility of the two membranes at higher pressures it is note mentioning that sic f membrane let the lowest water flux to up to 50 mpa which indicated non susceptibility to hydrostatic pressure up to this point due to the variations of water flux rate in these membranes it could be concluded that pore diameter and decorating atom type of the pore were important factors in determining the amount of permeated water molecules as can be seen from fig 4 the effect of pore chemistry on water flux was more intensive at lower pressures for example at 25 mpa although the pore diameter in sic model was about 2 5 times larger than that in sic oh model there was not much difference in the amount of water flux in systems with functionalized pores o atoms in water molecules formed hydrogen bonds with h atoms on pore edges also h atoms of ware molecules formed hydrogen bonds with f n and o atoms in this process f n and o atoms acted as electronegative atoms negatively charged atoms on pore corners such as f h and n could increase water flux since they cause the attachment of water molecules on both membrane sides acting as canals to facilitate water flux on both membrane sides therefore decorated atoms on pore corners could affect water flux rate by increasing pressure water flux difference between sic and functionalized models was increased because hydrostatic force prevailed the pore chemistry effect fig 5 shows total ion rejection percentage for different systems with sic membranes for pristine sic membranes it was witnessed that at minimum pressure of 25 mpa heavy metal ions were able to pass through pores 10 3å in diameter which indicated 95 ion rejection efficiency in comparison functionalized membranes at 25 mpa presented 100 ion rejection efficiency with the increase of pressure to up to 50 mpa a 13 decrease of ion separation in pristine sic was observed while in functionalized membranes separation trend was almost constant and still above 99 in functionalized models with the pressure increase from 50 to 200 mpa ion rejection was linearly decreased which was 47 48 and 38 reduction for sic f sic n and sic oh membranes respectively nevertheless for pristine sic membrane the linear decreasing manner in ion rejection starts from a lower pressure range from 25 to 150 mpa which was 72 reduction also at pressures above 50 mpa due to susceptibility to pressure difference in the separation trend of functionalized membranes was started as presented in the curve shown in fig 5 sic oh membrane had the highest ion separation efficiency in the elimination of heavy metal ions sic oh membrane under 100 mpa presented about 37 ion separation capability and better flux rate than other functionalized membranes consequently the total ions rejection capability of examined sic membranes for pressure higher than 75 mpa is predominantly related to the size of the pores in other words due to the high pressure the effect of the hydrostatic force in ion rejection overcomes the pore barrier chemistry furthermore to investigate the efficiency of the selective separation of different ions and influences of functionalized groups by pristine and functionalized sic membranes the system under 100 mpa pressure at 298 k temperature was adopted as the main system the bar diagram in fig 6 presents that pristine sic membrane separated all four ions almost at similar efficiency due to its low and uniform energy barrier zn2 ions was most rejected on functionalized membranes higher zn rejection on sic f and sic oh membranes is due to higher electronegativity of functional atoms f and o on pores and the intrinsic tendency of this ion to have low resistance against the energy barriers of decorated pores the separation amount of pb2 and cd2 ions in systems with sic f and sic n membranes was almost similar due to similar pore diameter while in system with sic oh membrane separation of pb2 was about 4 higher than cd2 due to lower pore diameter the effects of functional groups became more appearant this behavior indicated lower resistance of pb2 ions compared to cd2 ions against energy barrier of pores decorated with oh functional group fig 7 shows the number of filtered water molecules during 5 ns simulation time for four examined systems with different sic membranes as was seen in pristine sic membrane water molecules had passed through pores at much higher rates than functionalized pores due to larger diameters and lower energy barrier comparison of the number of permeated molecules at the end of simulation showed that flux rate was directly related to pore diameter however comparison of these data at the beginning of simulation showed that sic oh functionalized membrane despite smaller pore diameters than the pores on other models due to the presence of hydrophilic atoms in decorated oh functional group water molecules tended to permeate through pores in the absence of hydrostatic pressure in other words the presence of hydrophilic atoms on pore edges could act as a molecular bridge to facilitate the permeation of water molecules presence of f atoms on pore edges of sic f membranes due to its weaker hydrophilic nature than n atom and oh functional group presented lower tendency to the permeation of water molecules resulting in stronger dependency on the presence of hydrostatic pressure in these systems in the diagram shown in fig 7 this hypothesis was clearly observed at times above 2 5 ns where high hydrostatic pressure overcame van der waals interactions between water molecules and f atoms on the pore edges of sic f membrane 3 3 water density and velocity distribution to better understand the mechanism of the permeation of water molecules through designed pores we investigated the structure of fluids in simulation box along z axis in the range of 30 z 30 under 100 mpa pressure considering the location of pore as zero point based on the profile of concentration and velocities of water molecules the results obtained from this section were extracted from the final simulation time of 5 ns fig 8 a b shows concentration profiles of water density and velocity respectively for current systems the peaks on the right side of the figures were assigned to the chamber under high hydrostatic pressure in fig 8 a as was seen large peaks appeared in vicinity of membrane and on high pressure side due to high van der waals interactions among water molecules and sic atoms on the surface of membrane water molecules tended to accumulate at this location and form layered water structure on the other hand high pressure caused further accumulation of water molecules on high pressure side of the membrane and the difference in the sharpness of peaks compared to those on the left side low pressure are evident it is also note mentioning that water concentration at the center of pore which contained flux was the lowest fig 8 b shows sharper peaks of velocity near the point z 0 in low pressure chamber which indicated high velocity of water molecules after being released from high pressure region and passing through the pore comparison of the power of concentration peaks for recently studied models showed that the strongest peak was obtained for sic oh membrane pore and the weakest concentration peak was obtained for pristine sic pore with the largest pore diameter similar trend was also observed for velocity profile therefore it could be concluded that in models containing pores with lower diameters due to higher permeation barrier and lower flux water molecules tended to further accumulate near the membrane also the first peaks of sic n and sic oh membranes appeared at lower distances which indicated stronger van der waals interactions among water molecules and n atoms and oh functional group average concentration of water in atmospheric pressure low pressure side was found to be about 1g cm3 which seemed to be reasonable it is noteworthy that for other systems with different pressures also similar concentration and velocity profiles were obtained 3 4 radial distribution function rdf of heavy metal ions in this section the distribution and behavior of heavy metal ions as a reference and density of hydrogen atoms of water molecules in radial as a function of distance in the solution under 100 mpa pressure at 298 k have been investigated in fig 9 for each of 4 ions one sharp peak with different intensities appeared this difference showed that the ions had different hydration numbers r denotes the closest covalent distance between ion particles and hydrogen atoms of water the first peak at 2 3å was assigned to the distance of cl 1 ion from hydrogen atoms of water and was the first hydration shell which was the closest to ion in the range of water molecule the second and third peaks were related to the hydration shell of zn2 and cd 2 ions at about 2 95å and fourth peak at 3 35å belonged to pb2 ion since the charge of all metal ions was 2 a comparison of peak strengths of these 3 ions revealed that zn2 and cd2 ions had larger peaks than pb2 ion since they had stronger and more stable interactions with van der waals interactions with water molecules this phenomenon resulted in the higher accumulation of these ions especially zn2 with water molecules and therefore better ion rejection the findings of this section as shown in fig 6 also proved that zn2 ions had better ion rejection property since this analysis focused on the behavior of ions near water molecules the type of applied membrane as well as change of pressure and temperature did not affect the obtained results fig 10 shows the integration of rdf for ion and water indicating the average number of water molecules n ab in hydration shell with distance r from ion center the value of this parameter was obtained as 7 n ab 4 πρ 0 r g r r 2 dr where ρ r and g r are density radial distance and rdf respectively the value of this parameter was found to be 5 to 6 for heavy metal ions and about 8 for chlorine which indicated the number of water molecules surrounding them 3 5 potential mean force pmf calculation pmf parameter predicts the possibility of the passage of ions and water molecules by calculating energy barrier exerted onto them while passing the membrane pore higher pmf values for a particle indicate higher energy barrier exerted onto it making its passage through the pore more difficult to do so first systems were equilibrated at 298k under atmospheric pressure in the meantime metal ions and water molecules were kept at motion start point at 15å to equilibrate the surrounding water molecules then for each ion in each system the simulation process was repeated 10 times each time for 1ns and pmf energy was determined from the average of the results obtained from the ten simulations the pulling force of harmonic constraint is 10 kcal mol å was pulled to 15å along z axis to point z 0 that the position of membrane pore fig 11 represents the average value of pmf for heavy metal ions chlorine and water molecule in differently designed models the figure also shows that water molecules had the lowest pmf value of about 7 3 to 14 7 kcal mol when passing through pores in all models therefore water molecules could pass through the pores easily with the lowest resistance in pristine sic system with larger pores than functionalized membranes water molecules passed the pores with the minimum pmf value of 7 3 kcal mol in sic oh modified membranes despite smaller diameter which inevitably results in higher energy barrier for water molecules due to the existence of oh functional group the value of pmf was not much different from that of sic membranes with larger pores i e water molecules passed sic oh pores with lowest energy barrier this property is an excellent advantage of decorating sic membrane pores with oh functional group also the ease of passage of water molecules from sic f pores with pmf 10 11 kcal mol was higher than that of sic n with pmf 14 67 kcal mol this procedure was repeated for all cd2 pb2 zn2 and cl1 ions according to fig 11 pmf values of ions in functionalized pore systems were more than 2 times that of pristine pore sic membrane with pmf value of 35 kcal mol higher forces were required for the passage of ions through the pores of functionalized membranes due to stronger electrostatic and van der waals interactions among functional atoms of pore edges with different partial charges and ions also the effect of pore diameter could not be neglected ion pmf curves showed that selective ion rejection property of functionalized pores was higher than pristine sic pores for example in pores of sic f and sic n ion rejection order was zn2 cl1 cd2 pb2 which complied with the results obtained in fig 6 for selective ion rejection pmf analysis results proved that the pmf values of metal ions were in the following comparative order sic f sic n sic oh sic 3 6 effect of temperature on water flux and ion rejection in this section 5 new simulations were performed to investigate the effect of temperature variation on flux and ion rejection capabilities main simulation conditions were 100 mpa pressure and 298k temperature considering fixed pressure of 100 mpa for 5 other systems we examined the simulation at different temperatures of the systems with 20 k intervals from 278 to 378 k as shown in fig 12 by increasing temperature from 278 to 378 k due to lower water viscosity in higher temperature increase of water flux was observed for all systems such that corresponding values for sic sic f sic n and sic oh systems presented 18 17 6 17 6 and 22 respectively with deeper look at the figure it was seen that the linear increasing trend of flux for functionalized membranes was observed to up to 358 k after which it remained almost constant however in pristine membrane this increase occurred linearly to up to boiling point at 378 k the reason for this could be larger pores in such membranes the permeation barriers of which could not overcome the high mobility of water molecules when approaching boiling temperature in systems with functionalized membranes due to smaller pores and higher permeation resistance water molecules could not permeate more at temperatures higher than 358 k so increasing trend of water flux remained almost constant it can also be seen that the difference in the amount of flux for the three functionalized sic models simulated at 298 k ambient temperature was low compared to higher temperatures due to differences in pore diameter the amount of pore size expansion under the effect of temperature rising was different so it could be concluded that the effect of pore size on flux for higher temperatures was more pronounced recently a similar theory has been obtained 93 fig 13 shows ion rejection percentages of recent systems versus temperature increase similar to previous sections it was also witnessed that temperature increase significantly decreased ion rejection in all systems this decrease in separation capability for sic sic f sic n and sic oh systems was 18 8 7 1 and 6 8 respectively as could be seen the system with sic n membrane presented the weakest effect on ion separation capability almost none with temperature increase however in the system with pristine membrane temperature increase had the maximum effect on the decrease of ion rejection remaining systems containing functionalized membranes presented minor reduction in ion rejection efficiency for temperature higher than 318 c therefore it could be concluded that the ion rejection capability of functionalized membrane was almost independent of temperature increase fig 14 shows water flux variations during 5 ns of simulation for selected pristine sic system at different temperatures with a close look at the beginning of the diagram it was found that before moving the piston increase of temperature increased kinetic energy and collision of water molecules increasing the number of permeated water molecules from 343 to 645 this trend was continued until the end of simulation such that at the end of simulation increase of temperature from 278 to 378 k resulted in the passage of 18 more water molecules 3 7 effect of electric field on water flux and ion rejection in this section the effect of electric field at different voltages on water flux and ion rejection was investigated also in many studies application of electric field for increasing ion permeation through membrane pores have been employed however in this work we tested electric field application to hinder the permeation of ions through membrane pores therefore we applied voltages of 0 50 10 200 and 300 mv å along opposite direction of piston movement along z axis on contaminated water the range of applied voltage utilized in this study was similar to other experimental works in which the electric field was applied for the separation of heavy metals 94 by observing simulation trajectory we found that ions with positive charges tended to move along the direction of electric field similar results were obtained in 95 fig 15 shows water flux at all applied voltages as was seen water flux at applied voltage of 50 mv å showed different behaviors in different models in system with pristine sic flux remained constant in those with sic f and sic n membranes corresponding value was increased by 5 and 7 respectively and in the system with sic oh membrane it was decreased by about 14 the reason for this difference in water permeation was differences in partial charge and electronic properties of functional groups on pore edges of sic membrane where energy barrier was changed in the presence of electric field then by applying higher voltages than 50 mv å water flux was linearly decreased to 240 6 ns in pristine sic membrane however in systems with functionalized membranes linear decrease was continued to 200 mv å and remained constant after 123 2 ns for sic n and 101 ns for sic f and sic oh according to fig 16 one could claim that like flux application of voltage had different effect on the ion rejection of systems here also up to 50 mv å ion rejection remained constant in sic n membrane and in sic f and sic oh membranes it was decreased by about 4 and 5 respectively however the system with pristine sic membrane presented about 18 improvement in ion rejection here also increase of applied voltage to up to 300 mv å linearly improved ion rejection in pristine sic membrane by up to 93 7 however in systems with functionalized membranes maximum ion rejection improvement occurred at lower voltage of 200 mv å at which more than 98 of ions were rejected indicating 20 higher ion rejection compared to the situation with no applied voltage which is a reasonable conclusion consequently electric field had a significant effect on the control of water flux and performance of systems in the separation of heavy meatal ion in pristine and functionalized sic membranes 4 conclusion in this research md simulations were conducted using dft calculations to study the separation of heavy metal ions zn2 pb2 and cd2 in wastewater samples using porous sic membranes under reverse osmosis pressure the tests were performed on four models including pristine sic membrane as well as functionalized sic with f n and oh functional groups water molecules in all models were able to permeate pores water flux was increased with the increase of pressure which was directly related to pore diameter functionalization of sic pores increased the system s ion rejection efficiency and metal ions presented different pore permeation behavior in functionalized pores than that in pristine ones selective separation ability therefore pore edge engineering using different atoms could control their diameter flux and ion rejection concentration profiles showed that water molecules beside membrane tended to accumulate which was maximum and minimum in sic oh and pristine sic membranes respectively rdf analyses showed that zn2 and cd2 ions had strong interactions with hydrogen atoms of water molecules at the distance of 3å which resulted in more accumulation of water molecules and higher resistance when permeating through pores integration of this rdf analysis showed that 5 6 water molecules surrounded metal ions pmf calculations showed that metal ions required more than 2 times higher energy barrier to pass through functionalized pores of sic membrane maximum energy barrier was obtained for zn2 ion which presented high ion rejection on the membrane the value of pmf for water molecules was very low which indicated their simpler permeation through pores such that in sic oh systems despite smaller pore diameter it was about 2 5 times that in pristine sic membrane however both membranes had almost similar mpf values in summary the order of pmf values of metal ions for permeation was sic f sic n sic oh sic also increase of temperature increased water flux and decreased ion rejection in addition we investigated the effect of applied voltage from 50 to 300 mv å in different systems and found that increase of voltage decreased water flux and increased ion rejection which was observed for functionalized membranes to up to 200 mv å at which about 99 ion rejection was witnessed consequently based on the obtained results we concluded that electric field played an important role in designing systems for the separation of heavy metal ions finally we noted that further experimental studies are essential to advance the application of

13301,disease suppression is an essential aspect of shrimp farming to control water quality a recirculating aquaculture system ras is employed in worldwide in ras water quality is achieved by nitrification biofilter treatment whereas disease prevention is achieved by the application of an oxidizing agent such as ozone o3 this study investigates the proper residual ozone concentration roc dosage for controlling pathogenic bacteria vibrio parahaemolyticus vp and minimizing mal effects on nitrifying bacteria activity in the biofilter media inside an ras juvenile pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vammanei were cultured for 4 months in a lab scale brackish ras integrated with ozonation results showed that although the system biofilter s nitrification activity was influenced by roc the 0 3 mg l 1 roc dosage provided an optimum condition which effectively eliminated vp in the biofilter but did not inhibit ammonia removal at a higher roc approximately 0 4 mg l 1 ozonation dosage the biofilter s ammonia oxidation rate significantly reduced over a 40 day shrimp rearing operational period the viable vp count in an aerated non ozonated ras gradually increased but the viable vp counts in both biofilm and water in a 0 3 mg l 1 roc treated ras significantly reduced down to undetectable levels as such the conclusion was drawn that a 0 3 mg l 1 roc ozonation treatment in the biofilter tank of a ras can effectively control vp pathogens without influencing the activity of the nitrification biofilter thus providing a balanced control between water quality and safety to the shrimp keywords residual ozone nitrification vibrio parahaemolyticus recirculating aquaculture system litopenaeus vannamei brackish water 1 introduction the recirculating aquaculture system ras has been proven to be an environmentally friendly water efficient and highly productive farming system 1 through the use of physical chemical and biological wastewater treatment units ras can improve and maintain the water quality for aquatic animal growth it also reduces water consumption and the high nutrients high organic contents of wastewaters discharged from farms to the natural water resources 2 most ras include nitrification biofilters which contain ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob attached to a biofilter media to convert highly toxic ammonia into nitrite no2 then subsequently the relatively benign nitrate no3 with proper operation of the nitrification processes nitrogen concentrations can be controlled to below 0 0125 mgn l 1 for free ammonia nh3 or 1 mgn l 1 for total ammonia nitrogen tan 3 meanwhile nitrate may accumulate up to 100 mgn l 1 without causing any harmful effects 4 other nitrifying treatment processes such as biofloc and nitrifying activated sludge nas have also been applied to large systems however the nitrification process and nitrifying microorganisms are significantly influenced by dissolved organic compounds correlated with cod a previous study has shown that lower organic loadings could enhance nitrification efficiency 5 a practical use example of ras is for shrimp rearing where a shrimp tank and water treatment unit are connected together for continuous water recirculation successful water quality control in an ras generally depends on the nitrification biofilter s treatment effectiveness unfortunately practical ras applications involve long periods of water reuse which allows for the gradual accumulation of unwanted substances such as pathogenic bacteria in the ras s biofilter media effective disease management in shrimp ras is therefore essential marine pathogenic bacteria such as vibrio parahaemolyticus vp and vibrio harveyi are responsible for the harmful vibriosis disease which affect shrimp aquacultures worldwide some bacteria can even switch from opportunistic to pathogenic with environmental changes 6 for example vp which causes early mortality syndrome ems or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease ahpnd becomes virulence when its density increases to a threshold concentration of around 104 cfu ml 1 unless the shrimp mortality is not observed 7 since pathogenic microorganisms will always naturally and unintentionally be introduced into the biofilter media s biofilm beneficial nitrifying bacteria and harmful pathogens both end up recirculating in the ras the latter of which can pose risks to aquatic animals inside the system 8 to combat pathogen transmission within the ras ozone o3 an oxidizing agent is generally introduced into the system 9 previous studies showed that ozonation effectively destroys both bacterial and viral pathogens 10 with proper ozone usage pathogen loads in shrimp larvicultures can be reduced thus benefitting shrimp survival and growth 11 unfortunately due to dissolved or gaseous ozone s high oxidative potential excessive ozonation can also lower shrimp hatching and survival rates as well as cause deformities and malformations in shrimp larvae 12 excessive ozone doses in ras can impact the system s nitrifying bacteria and aquatic animals 13 this problem can adversely affect biofiltration efficiency resulting in water quality problems within the ras as such excess ozone levels in the water should be avoided in order to maintain safe levels for the aquatic animals for example coman and sellars 14 recommended an ozone disinfection procedure of 2 ppm and a 1 min exposure period for penaeus japonicus larvae although the use of ozone with caution has been proposed as part of the ras technology development 15 most studies have only focused on the pathogen elimination aspect of ozone treatments this study will simultaneously investigate the elimination of pathogens and beneficial nitrifying bacteria in an ras s biofilter media by different concentrations of residual ozone the pathogenic bacteria investigated will be vibrio parahaemolyticus this study s application of ozonation to a biofilter unit is unique because ozone treatment could affect biofilter treatment efficiency however our literature review and preliminary experiments have revealed that nitrifying bacteria can tolerate higher ozone concentrations than some other pathogenic bacteria especially the vibrio spp thus allowing for our novel technique which permits reduced vibrio cells accumulation in the biofilter to prolong the biofilter s usage under a long period of water recirculation through this investigation it is hoped that a controlled ozonation process which optimizes vp elimination alongside effective nitrification treatment in the biofilter unit of a recirculating pacific white shrimp culture system can be established 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimatization of nitrifying biofilter the biofilter media used in this study was bcn 012 kll 2h gmbh germany made of polyethylene plastic specific surface area of the biofilter media was 859 m2 m 3 the new biofilter was initially disinfected by being soaked in chlorine solution and autoclaved before use it was then acclimated for at least 30 days in 100 l brackish water prior to experiments brackish water was prepared by diluting natural seawater to 25 practical salinity unit psu nh4cl and nahco3 both ar grade solutions were supplied daily at a total ammonia nitrogen tan of 2 mgn l 1 and alkalinity of 150 200 mg l 1 as caco3 the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled within 5 8 mg l 1 tan and nitrite were monitored daily during this acclimation period to ensure the activity of nitrifying microorganisms on the biofilter 2 2 estimation of total vibrio and culture of vibrio parahaemolyticus to estimate the number of viable vibrio spp in samples the standard plate count method was applied 16 a sample was spread on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose tcbs agar himedia india which is a selective media for vibrio spp after 24 h of incubation at 37 c the combined number of green and yellow colonies on plates were counted as cfu ml 1 for total vibrio to isolate vp species all single bluish green colonies were picked up and streaked onto chromagar vibrio cv medium chromagar france and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the number of strains which were able to develop violet colonies on cv were identified as vp for inoculation experiments stock vp culture s02 a non ahpnd strain 17 which was isolated from a shrimp pond in thailand was inoculated in tryptic soy broth tsb 1 5 nacl himedia india and incubated at 30 c for 24 h while shaken the culture media s optical density at 600 nm od600 was then measured to determine its culture concentration it was then diluted to od 0 1 using sterile tsb 1 5 nacl to achieve an approximate cell concentration of 1 104 cfu ml 1 2 3 ozonation and estimation of ozone decay in brackish water ozonation tests were carried out in a 1 5 l duran bottle ozone generated by a corona discharge ozone generator oz 1050tw ebase inc thailand was injected into 1 l of autoclaved 25 psu brackish water through an air pump and diffusor stone at 300 mgo3 hr 1 for 2 h at room temperature approximately 25 c the residual ozone concentration roc was measured every 10 min by indigo colorimetric method 18 with a microplate spectrophotometer biotek powerwave xs2 usa to determine the relation of roc and ozonation time the saturated concentration and time interval for ozonation were examined in triplicate moreover rocs in the water were further monitored for 2 h with and without aeration in order to investigate changes of residual ozone after ozonation 2 4 effects of ozonation on biofilter nitrification activity a one liter lab scale reactor was used to investigate the effects of ozonation on nitrification activity of the pre acclimated biofilter media section 2 1 sterilized 25 psu brackish water was ozonated until the roc reached 0 1 0 2 0 3 or 0 4 mg l 1 brackish water without ozonation was assigned as control 150 pieces of active nitrification biofilter media equivalent to a surface area of 0 285 m2 were placed into each batch reactor with different desired rocs water alkalinity in all test units were adjusted to 150 mg l 1 as caco3 with sodium bicarbonate to provide a sufficient inorganic carbon source for autotrophic nitrifiers as well as to maintain appropriate ph buffering capacity ammonium chloride was added to each reactor providing 2 mgn l 1 of tan continuous aeration was applied to maintain sufficient do concentrations e g higher than 6 mg l 1 to determine total ammonia nitrogen tan removal rates water samples were collected hourly for 4 h changes to tan and nitrite levels were monitored the experiment was performed in triplicate tan removal rates were calculated according to the following equation eq 1 1 tan removal rate tan i tan f ssa t where tan i is the initial tan concentration mgn l 1 tan f is the final tan concentration mgn l 1 ssa is the biofilter s specific surface area m2 and t is the experimental period day 2 5 ozone disinfection of vibrio parahaemolyticus effects of residual ozone on vp in brackish water were investigated stock culture of vp in tsb 1 5 nacl section 2 2 was inoculated into 1 l of sterilized brackish water to an od600 of 0 4 equivalent to 104 cfu ml 1 thereafter ozone was bubbled into the solution to obtain rocs of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l 1 using the same conditions as the previous experiment section 2 4 aeration without ozone was assigned as control after ozonation the vp cells in ozonated water were kept stirred using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature 27 1 c for 1 h water samples were collected every 10 min for viable vp count using spread plate technique on tcbs agar 2 6 effects of residual ozone concentration on vibrio parahaemolyticus growth in biofilter media to inoculate pre activated nitrification biofilter with vp culture 150 pieces of active biofilter media suspended in 1 l brackish water were spiked with 1 ml of 104 cfu ml 1 vp culture media section 2 2 this suspension was then incubated for 4 h at 30 c in a rotary shaker this allowed for the attachment of vp onto the biofilter media surface thereafter biofilter media with vp were transferred into 1 l of fresh brackish water ozonation was provided through a diffuser for 0 3 mg l 1 roc initial and final viable vp counts on the biofilters were examined while interim water samples were collected and analyzed for tan nitrite and nitrate concentrations every hour for 4 h the experiment was repeated in triplicate 2 7 use of ozone for vibrio control in recirculating shrimp culture tank the laboratory scale ras fig 1 consisted of a 170 l rearing tank 0 6 m width 1 0 m length 0 4 m height 130 l nitrification biofilter tank 0 4 m diameter 0 6 m height and a 50 l ozone removal tank 0 5 m diameter 0 6 m height the biofilter tank contained 10 l of pre acclimated bcn 012 nitrification biofilter media section 2 1 an aquarium submersible pump atman ph 1100 approximately 3000 l d 1 capacity was used to pump water from the shrimp tank into the biofilter tank water returned to the shrimp tank by gravity a 250 μm filter bag trapped solids which were removed weekly during water recirculation the hydraulic retention time of the nitrification and ozone removal tanks were maintained at 36 and 48 min respectively continuous aeration was provided in all tanks through air stone diffusers providing do higher than 6 mg l 1 in the rearing tank 20 juvenile pacific white shrimps litopenaeus vammanei were cultured at an initial stocking density of 0 5 kg m 3 25 psu and at room temperature 27 1 c the shrimps were fed twice a day at 9 am and 3 pm with commercial pellet feed containing 38 protein at 5 of total body weight water alkalinity was maintained between 120 and 160 mg l 1 by sodium bicarbonate adjustments the experiment was carried out for 40 days without water exchange except for freshwater additions to compensate for evaporation prior to the experiment attachment of vp on active biofilter media was induced by inoculating vp culture into the biofilter tank vp stock culture was spiked into then diluted od600 1 0 in the biofilter tank water circulation in the ras was paused for 4 h to allow vp cells to attach with the biofilter and tank surfaces ozonation in the nitrification biofilter tank was provided at 1 min on 10 min off cycles to give an average roc of 0 3 0 24 0 35 mg l 1 in the control tank aeration was provided instead of ozone the experiment was implemented in triplicate during the experiment water samples were collected daily for water quality and roc analyses a viable vp from 1 water in the shrimp tank 2 water in the biofilter tank 3 biofilm sample in the shrimp tank 4 biofilm in the biofilter media and 5 settled solids at the bottom of the rearing tank were sampled and analyzed weekly by plate count technique on tcbs agar at the end of the experiment tan removal rates were examined by randomly sampling five biofilter media and measuring nitrification activity in a volumetric flask containing 1 mg nh4cl l 1 growth parameters i e body length body weight daily weight gain and survival rate of shrimp in the ras were evaluated at the end of the experiment 2 8 water sampling and analytical methods water samples were filtered through 25 mm whatman gf c glass fiber filters and then kept at 20 c until analysis tan 19 nitrite nitrogen 20 nitrate nitrogen 16 and uv275 uv absorbance at 275 nm representing dissolved organic matters doms were measured using a microplate spectrophotometer biotek powerwave xs2 usa alkalinity was examined with aqua

standard deviations mean value differences were analyzed using one way anova followed by turkey hsd post hoc test performed in graphpad prism version 7 0 differences were considered the statistical significance at p values 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozonation in brackish water the solubility of ozone in water depends on several factors including air pressure temperature and salinity results of continuous ozonation in 25 psu brackish water for 50 min showed that the saturated roc was 0 45 0 01 mgo3 l 1 fig 2 a fundamentally ozone dissolution depends on the rate of ozone transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase which is a function of the gaseous ozone concentration the contact area and the ozone s reaction with constituents within the water 21 in this study the stability of ozone in brackish water was examined under aerated and non aerated conditions although in theory the lifetime of ozone in water is quite short 22 in our experiment only a negligible decrease of less than 0 02 mg l 1 roc was observed over 1 h with or without aeration fig 2b showing that roc is rather constant moreover there was no significant difference between the roc in aerated and non aerated water suggesting that aeration should have no effect on ozone decay in our experiments the stability of ozone may have been bolstered in this experiment by the fact that it was performed with clean water which is low in organic matter and other constituents that ozone can react with 21 as such further investigations into residual ozone stability under aquaculture conditions which contain both dissolved and solid matters is warranted 3 2 biofilter nitrification activities after exposure to ozone in batch tests results in fig 3 show that nitrification biofilters can maintain nitrification performance even under aeration control and ozonation conditions in fig 3a tan decreased with treatment in a similar fashion with or without ozonation a previous study found that ozone can directly react with ammonia nh3 but reacts quite poorly with ammonium nh4 which is the dominant form of ammonia nitrogen at ph lower than 9 15 22 25 therefore the chemical oxidation of ammonium with ozone under the experiment condition may be negligible in terms of nitrite accumulation results in fig 3b show that nitrite nitrogen accumulation continuously increased at all rocs the highest nitrite accumulation was found at 0 3 mg l 1 roc at a higher roc 0 4 mg l 1 signs of ammonia oxidation inhibition began to show this accumulation of nitrite and nitrate upholds results from schroeder et al 13 where both ammonia oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria were still active after a 1 h exposure to 0 46 0 49 mg l 1 of ozone produced oxidants moreover fig 3c shows that an increase of nitrate concentrations was in stoichiometric balance with the decrease of tan hence the formation of nitrate shows that ozonation with an roc of up to 0 3 mg l 1 does not inhibit nitrification activities calculated tan removal rates are shown in fig 4 for comparison the specific ammonia removal rate of the control 41 94 3 12 mgn m 2 day 1 was not significantly different p 0 05 with 0 1 mg l 1 roc 37 89 3 49 mgn m 2 day 1 however at 0 4 mg l 1 roc the tan removal rate 30 29 0 56 mgn m 2 day 1 did become significantly lower p 0 05 than the control these results suggest that the biofilter s nitrification performance is indeed influenced by high roc and therefore the optimum roc of 0 3 mg l 1 was chosen for further studies 3 3 effect of ozone on vibrio parahaemolyticus inactivation in batch culture the results in fig 5 show that ozonation effectively reduced the amount of viable vp in culture medium within 60 min and that the reduction of vp by ozonation depended on roc and time the highest viability reduction of 4 77 log cfu ml 1 was achieved with the highest roc of 0 4 mg l 1 on the contrary the lowest roc of 0 1 mg l 1 excluding control only achieved a reduction of 0 86 log cfu ml 1 also lowest excluding control furthermore rocs of 0 3 and 0 4 mg l 1 completely killed all viable vp within 60 and 50 min respectively these results clearly show that the inactivation of vibrio parahaemolyticus by ozone is dosage and time dependent fundamentally ozone kills bacteria by breaking their cell walls and cell membranes inhibiting genes expression and damaging genetic materials until cell death however it was previously revealed that vp can tolerate ozone concentrations less than 0 125 mgo3 l 1 with its cell membrane remaining unharmed 26 and more generally tolerance against ozone oxidation varies among bacterial species with heterotrophic bacteria possibly being able to regrow after ozone concentrations decrease 27 similarly teitge et al 28 stated that ozone applications in the range of 5 50 mg hr 1 correspond to a redox potential of 350 mv which is unable to eliminate vibrio spp especially vp in either the water or biofilm of small scale ras filter tanks housing l vannamei shrimp because ozone tolerance varies across microorganism species and their growth periods and density 29 30 the optimization of ozonation dosages and effective contact time must be evaluated and specified in order to target specific bacterial species 3 4 effects of residual ozone on vibrio parahaemolyticus and nitrification biofilter in batch tests results in fig 6 show that 0 3 mg l 1 roc dramatically reduced the viable vp count in the biofilm matrix from 3 3 106 cfu m 2 to 9 9 104 cfu m 2 after 60 min of ozonation which is statistically a highly significant difference since biofilms often protect their colonizing bacteria from harmful surrounding environments 31 the disinfection of vp inside a biofilm layer commonly requires a higher disinfectant dosage to achieve the same degree of inactivation on the other hand the results in fig 7 revealed that 0 3 mg l 1 roc slightly reduced the ammonia removal rate 48 2 mgn m 2 day 1 compared with control with or without ozonation nitrite accumulation remained quite low mean value of 0 35 mgn l 1 studies regarding ozone s effects on nitrification biofilms is limited in literature of the studies available schroeder et al 13 observed similar behavior as this current study where nitrifying bacteria were protected by biofilm to tolerate continuous ozonation of up to 0 15 mg l 1 although vibrio are also biofilm forming bacteria we did find a reduction of vibrio cells in the biofilter media after ozonation in general the advantages of using floating or moving bed plastic media in ozone biofilter treatment systems is that their movement leads to collisions that spontaneously reduce the thickness of biofilm 27 and induce the release of free vibrio cells to react with ozone in the water use of ozonation with thick heterotrophic biofilm such as fixed bed biofilter might need to be further investigated therefore our results demonstrated that applying ozone at 0 30 0 05 mg l 1 roc in shrimp rearing ras allows for effective elimination of vibrio spp contamination by the system s biofilter with only a slight disturbance in the system s nitrification process 3 5 effects of ozonation in shrimp rearing recirculating aquaculture systems 3 5 1 effects of ozonation on water quality in shrimp rearing tanks the tan nitrite and nitrate levels in the control and 0 3 mg l 1 roc treated shrimp rearing tanks during cultivation are shown in fig 8 these results revealed the long term effects of ozonation on nitrification efficiency the behaviors of tan nitrite and nitrate levels were similar for the control and ozonated rass tan levels fluctuated during the first 20 days which most likely coincided with the nitrifying bacteria s acclimatization period since the levels became stable after day 25 figs 8a and 8b despite the fluctuations tan was effectively removed and levels of it remained low at 0 13 0 01 and 0 15 0 02 mgn l 1 for the control and ozone treated rass respectively note that these tan concentrations are within the safe level for l vannamei culture less than 1 45 mgn l 1 as recommended by valencia castañeda et al 32 similarly nitrite accumulation was negligible with levels of 0 14 0 05 and 0 13 0 02 mgn l 1 for the control and ozone treated rass respectively once again these concentrations are far less than the safe level of 6 1 mgn l 1 at 15 salinity as recommended by lin and chen 33 however the most pronounced difference between the ozonated and control ras was the ozonated ras s dramatically lower dom levels as indicated by its lower uv275 absorption 34 fig 8d without ozonation dom accumulation in the control ras resulted in a 3 times higher uv275 adsorption than the ozone treated ras thus confirming the effectiveness of ozone oxidation in removing dom in general the dom in aquaculture systems is derived from the degradation of feed and fecal wastes water recirculation therefore causes an accumulation of dom in the water which is detectable by a continuous increase in uv275 adsorption during shrimp cultivation especially in control tanks the oxidation of dom such as non biodegradable yellow substances by ozone is well reported by previous studies 15 23 28 35 with this study ozonation in the treatment tanks helped to successfully maintain a low uv275 absorbance at approximately 0 06 throughout the cultivation period compared to 0 15 in the control tanks similarly park et al 36 reported a 30 reduction of dissolved organic carbon and 70 reduction in water color by ozonation therefore application of ozone in the ras not only inactivated pathogenic bacteria but also improved water quality by reducing organic matters 3 5 2 effect of ozonation on nitrification efficiency of the biofilter fig 9 shows that ozonation did not affect the biofilters nitrification ability as there was no significant difference between the tan removal rates in the aerated 45 70 0 46 mgn m 2 d 1 and ozonated 46 49 0 84 mgn m 2 d 1 systems in general consistency in nitrification efficiency is vital for ras operation and only slight variations in tan removal rates ranging between 40 and 48 mgn m 2 d 1 were observed across the experiment indicating acceptable stability of biofiltration throughout the shrimp cultivation experiment tan removal efficiency depends on several factors such as nitrogen loading stocking density 37 salinity types of biofilter media used and the identity of microorganism populations 38 39 results from this experiment revealed that an roc of 0 3 mgo3 l 1 had no obvious effect on ammonia removal which was mainly performed by nitrifying microorganisms to understand the mechanisms behind the no effects of 0 3 mgo3 l 1 roc on nitrification we recommend further investigations into the diversity of microbes responsible for nitrification activities especially aob aoa and nob while our current experiment provides evidence of no effects on nitrification rates by a moderate roc we have not concluded that the pathways or perhaps even the identity of microbes that are responsible for nitrification activities in the presence of roc have not been affected previous research has revealed that the nitrification activities of nitrosomonas marina aob and nitrospira nob immobilized in a biofilter were maintained after short term exposure to ozone concentrations of up to 0 6 mg l 1 for 1 h 13 it should be noted that if roc is causing extensive microbial death then some molecular techniques such as 16s rdna analysis might not suitable because dna from the dead microorganisms will be simultaneously detected alongside those of active cells and therefore typical techniques of detecting ammonia and nitrite removal rates must be performed alongside microbial identification in order to confirm nitrification activities 3 5 3 effects of ozonation on vibrio parahaemolyticus in the biofilter and shrimp culture tank the initial density of vp cells on the biofilter media after inoculation into the nitrification biofilter tanks was approximately 2 48 107 cfu m 2 fig 10 a then for the next 40 days of operations the viable vp count in the control biofilter continually increased while the count in both the biofilm and water of the biofilter tank ozonated with 0 3 mg l 1 roc significantly decreased in fact the vp count in the water of the ozonated biofilter tank decreased to undetectable concentrations because biofilter contaminated with vibrio may induce shrimp disease continuous ozonation was recommended to suppress the growth of this pathogenic bacteria 36 40 vp count was successfully controlled in the biofilter tank of the shrimp cultivating ras ozonated with 0 30 0 05 mg l 1 roc fig 11 shows that the viable vp counts in water and settled solids were far lower 2 4 log cfu ml 1 lower with ozone treatment while some vp accumulation was found in the ozone treated shrimp tank s biofilm the concentration was approximately 1 log cfu ml 1 lower than the control aerated tank s biofilm hence it can be concluded that proper ozonation in a nitrification unit can effectively reduce vibrio spp count without reducing the performance of the nitrification biofilter ozonation is widely used for pathogen control in ras and it is most often applied after the nitrification biofilter unit just before the water recycles back into the aquaculture tank ozonation in the rearing tank is not typically as this can create toxicity for aquatic organisms 41 because of this pathogenic bacteria like vibrio spp can contaminate all parts of the ras rearing tank in this experiment fig 11 while the vp count in the rearing tank water was around 3 log cfu ml 1 higher vp counts were found in the biofilms attached to the tank s material surfaces such as the tank walls water pipes aeration tube and stone air diffuser high vp counts were also found in the suspended solid and biofloc results in fig 11b show that without ozonation vp concentrations in the settled solid could increase to as high as approximately 3 83 105 cfu ml 1 or 5 4 log units over 40 days a previous study found that organic particles in ras can promote bacterial activity in the water by providing surfaces which the bacteria can attach to for growth 42 moreover both dissolved and particulate organic compounds in the water can act as carbon sources for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria including the pathogenic vibrio in the biofilm matrix as such the reduction of dissolved organic compounds by ozone oxidation can also be an indirect benefit of pathogenic bacteria control in the ras another study showed that there is a strong correlation between the microbiota in shrimp stomachs and the sediment 43 44 eventually as pathogenic bacteria accumulate in the suspended and settled solids inside the ras they will start causing harm to the shrimps that ingest the solids this study demonstrated that an optimum ozonation roc exists to simultaneously inactivate pathogenic vibrios from shrimp ras without influencing nitrification activities in general investigating nitrifying microorganisms in biofilters is rather complicate because several microorganisms are involved in the process for example the oxidization of ammonia to nitrite is not restricted to only conventional nitrifying bacteria but also several genera of chemoorganotrophic bacteria ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and anaerobically ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox existing techniques of analyzing microbial communities in biofilm matrices such as qpcr next generation dna sequencing or scanning electron microscopy sem are not yet applicable to investigating which microorganisms are actively involved in the nitrification process specifically most dna amplification techniques require a specific target sequence which may discriminate between different microbes responsible for nitrification activities and even the dna of inactive or dead microorganisms matching the targeted sequence can produce misleading results also while sem can reveal the morphology and aggregation of cells this technique is not suitable for species identification therefore future research is needed to properly identify the microbial communities actual responsible for nitrification in order to form a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ozonation in ras 3 5 4 effects of ozonation on shrimp there was no significant difference between the shrimp survival rates of the control 81 6 2 9 and ozone treated 80 0 0 rass shrimp growth rates were also similar at 0 036 0 006 and 0 037 0 008 g shrimp day 1 for the control and ozone treated ras respectively similar results on safety of ozonation in aquaculture systems were reported in european lobster 45 46 this revealed that low residual ozone at approximately 0 02 mgo3 l 1 data not shown in the returned water after ozone exhausting tank was safe for shrimp cultivation 3 5 5 overall effects of ozonation on recirculating aquaculture systems this study s results clearly show that 0 3 mg l 1 roc in the nitrification biofilter unit not only improves the ras s water quality but also reduces the system s dom levels in fact the reduction in dom could be distinguished visually as the color of the water in the ozonated ras was clear and transparent while the water in the control ras was pale yellow and slightly turbid the major benefit of ozonation is the control of unwanted microorganisms especially pathogens afforded by ozone s ability to kill or inactivate various bacterial fungal protozoan or viral microorganisms 26 unfortunately this means that ozonation can eliminate some beneficial microorganisms too it was previously reported that ozonation can manipulate the microbial community structure letting it become more stable or dominated by specific species 39 whether this is beneficial to shrimps reared in rass is controversial as it can affect the microbiota diversity in the intestines of shrimps reared in rass it is known that healthy shrimps in the wild population have more microbiome diversity than infectious shrimps and the loss of microbial diversity is associated with diseases 43 therefore ozonation should be used with care and more investigations into ozone applications for closed aquaculture systems are still needed 4 conclusion ozonation was successfully applied in the nitrification biofilter tank of a litopenaeus vannamei shrimp recirculating aquaculture system ras the optimum residual ozone concentration roc of 0 3 mg l 1 could inactivate the pathogenic bacteria vibrio spp in both the system s water and biofilm but did not affect the biofilter s nitrification treatment activity this roc was then applied to a 170 l shrimp ras with a 75 l moving bed biofilter tank and 50 l ozone removal tank over a 40 day experiment the pathogenic bacteria vibrio parahaemolyticus vp was found in the biofilter s biofilm and other tank components roc at 0 3 mg l 1 dramatically reduced the viable vp counts in all parts of the ras including the rearing tank just as significantly ozone treatment did not affect shrimp survival or growth in comparison to a control ras without ozone treatment declaration of

13301,disease suppression is an essential aspect of shrimp farming to control water quality a recirculating aquaculture system ras is employed in worldwide in ras water quality is achieved by nitrification biofilter treatment whereas disease prevention is achieved by the application of an oxidizing agent such as ozone o3 this study investigates the proper residual ozone concentration roc dosage for controlling pathogenic bacteria vibrio parahaemolyticus vp and minimizing mal effects on nitrifying bacteria activity in the biofilter media inside an ras juvenile pacific white shrimp litopenaeus vammanei were cultured for 4 months in a lab scale brackish ras integrated with ozonation results showed that although the system biofilter s nitrification activity was influenced by roc the 0 3 mg l 1 roc dosage provided an optimum condition which effectively eliminated vp in the biofilter but did not inhibit ammonia removal at a higher roc approximately 0 4 mg l 1 ozonation dosage the biofilter s ammonia oxidation rate significantly reduced over a 40 day shrimp rearing operational period the viable vp count in an aerated non ozonated ras gradually increased but the viable vp counts in both biofilm and water in a 0 3 mg l 1 roc treated ras significantly reduced down to undetectable levels as such the conclusion was drawn that a 0 3 mg l 1 roc ozonation treatment in the biofilter tank of a ras can effectively control vp pathogens without influencing the activity of the nitrification biofilter thus providing a balanced control between water quality and safety to the shrimp keywords residual ozone nitrification vibrio parahaemolyticus recirculating aquaculture system litopenaeus vannamei brackish water 1 introduction the recirculating aquaculture system ras has been proven to be an environmentally friendly water efficient and highly productive farming system 1 through the use of physical chemical and biological wastewater treatment units ras can improve and maintain the water quality for aquatic animal growth it also reduces water consumption and the high nutrients high organic contents of wastewaters discharged from farms to the natural water resources 2 most ras include nitrification biofilters which contain ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob attached to a biofilter media to convert highly toxic ammonia into nitrite no2 then subsequently the relatively benign nitrate no3 with proper operation of the nitrification processes nitrogen concentrations can be controlled to below 0 0125 mgn l 1 for free ammonia nh3 or 1 mgn l 1 for total ammonia nitrogen tan 3 meanwhile nitrate may accumulate up to 100 mgn l 1 without causing any harmful effects 4 other nitrifying treatment processes such as biofloc and nitrifying activated sludge nas have also been applied to large systems however the nitrification process and nitrifying microorganisms are significantly influenced by dissolved organic compounds correlated with cod a previous study has shown that lower organic loadings could enhance nitrification efficiency 5 a practical use example of ras is for shrimp rearing where a shrimp tank and water treatment unit are connected together for continuous water recirculation successful water quality control in an ras generally depends on the nitrification biofilter s treatment effectiveness unfortunately practical ras applications involve long periods of water reuse which allows for the gradual accumulation of unwanted substances such as pathogenic bacteria in the ras s biofilter media effective disease management in shrimp ras is therefore essential marine pathogenic bacteria such as vibrio parahaemolyticus vp and vibrio harveyi are responsible for the harmful vibriosis disease which affect shrimp aquacultures worldwide some bacteria can even switch from opportunistic to pathogenic with environmental changes 6 for example vp which causes early mortality syndrome ems or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease ahpnd becomes virulence when its density increases to a threshold concentration of around 104 cfu ml 1 unless the shrimp mortality is not observed 7 since pathogenic microorganisms will always naturally and unintentionally be introduced into the biofilter media s biofilm beneficial nitrifying bacteria and harmful pathogens both end up recirculating in the ras the latter of which can pose risks to aquatic animals inside the system 8 to combat pathogen transmission within the ras ozone o3 an oxidizing agent is generally introduced into the system 9 previous studies showed that ozonation effectively destroys both bacterial and viral pathogens 10 with proper ozone usage pathogen loads in shrimp larvicultures can be reduced thus benefitting shrimp survival and growth 11 unfortunately due to dissolved or gaseous ozone s high oxidative potential excessive ozonation can also lower shrimp hatching and survival rates as well as cause deformities and malformations in shrimp larvae 12 excessive ozone doses in ras can impact the system s nitrifying bacteria and aquatic animals 13 this problem can adversely affect biofiltration efficiency resulting in water quality problems within the ras as such excess ozone levels in the water should be avoided in order to maintain safe levels for the aquatic animals for example coman and sellars 14 recommended an ozone disinfection procedure of 2 ppm and a 1 min exposure period for penaeus japonicus larvae although the use of ozone with caution has been proposed as part of the ras technology development 15 most studies have only focused on the pathogen elimination aspect of ozone treatments this study will simultaneously investigate the elimination of pathogens and beneficial nitrifying bacteria in an ras s biofilter media by different concentrations of residual ozone the pathogenic bacteria investigated will be vibrio parahaemolyticus this study s application of ozonation to a biofilter unit is unique because ozone treatment could affect biofilter treatment efficiency however our literature review and preliminary experiments have revealed that nitrifying bacteria can tolerate higher ozone concentrations than some other pathogenic bacteria especially the vibrio spp thus allowing for our novel technique which permits reduced vibrio cells accumulation in the biofilter to prolong the biofilter s usage under a long period of water recirculation through this investigation it is hoped that a controlled ozonation process which optimizes vp elimination alongside effective nitrification treatment in the biofilter unit of a recirculating pacific white shrimp culture system can be established 2 materials and methods 2 1 acclimatization of nitrifying biofilter the biofilter media used in this study was bcn 012 kll 2h gmbh germany made of polyethylene plastic specific surface area of the biofilter media was 859 m2 m 3 the new biofilter was initially disinfected by being soaked in chlorine solution and autoclaved before use it was then acclimated for at least 30 days in 100 l brackish water prior to experiments brackish water was prepared by diluting natural seawater to 25 practical salinity unit psu nh4cl and nahco3 both ar grade solutions were supplied daily at a total ammonia nitrogen tan of 2 mgn l 1 and alkalinity of 150 200 mg l 1 as caco3 the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled within 5 8 mg l 1 tan and nitrite were monitored daily during this acclimation period to ensure the activity of nitrifying microorganisms on the biofilter 2 2 estimation of total vibrio and culture of vibrio parahaemolyticus to estimate the number of viable vibrio spp in samples the standard plate count method was applied 16 a sample was spread on thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose tcbs agar himedia india which is a selective media for vibrio spp after 24 h of incubation at 37 c the combined number of green and yellow colonies on plates were counted as cfu ml 1 for total vibrio to isolate vp species all single bluish green colonies were picked up and streaked onto chromagar vibrio cv medium chromagar france and incubated at 37 c for 24 h the number of strains which were able to develop violet colonies on cv were identified as vp for inoculation experiments stock vp culture s02 a non ahpnd strain 17 which was isolated from a shrimp pond in thailand was inoculated in tryptic soy broth tsb 1 5 nacl himedia india and incubated at 30 c for 24 h while shaken the culture media s optical density at 600 nm od600 was then measured to determine its culture concentration it was then diluted to od 0 1 using sterile tsb 1 5 nacl to achieve an approximate cell concentration of 1 104 cfu ml 1 2 3 ozonation and estimation of ozone decay in brackish water ozonation tests were carried out in a 1 5 l duran bottle ozone generated by a corona discharge ozone generator oz 1050tw ebase inc thailand was injected into 1 l of autoclaved 25 psu brackish water through an air pump and diffusor stone at 300 mgo3 hr 1 for 2 h at room temperature approximately 25 c the residual ozone concentration roc was measured every 10 min by indigo colorimetric method 18 with a microplate spectrophotometer biotek powerwave xs2 usa to determine the relation of roc and ozonation time the saturated concentration and time interval for ozonation were examined in triplicate moreover rocs in the water were further monitored for 2 h with and without aeration in order to investigate changes of residual ozone after ozonation 2 4 effects of ozonation on biofilter nitrification activity a one liter lab scale reactor was used to investigate the effects of ozonation on nitrification activity of the pre acclimated biofilter media section 2 1 sterilized 25 psu brackish water was ozonated until the roc reached 0 1 0 2 0 3 or 0 4 mg l 1 brackish water without ozonation was assigned as control 150 pieces of active nitrification biofilter media equivalent to a surface area of 0 285 m2 were placed into each batch reactor with different desired rocs water alkalinity in all test units were adjusted to 150 mg l 1 as caco3 with sodium bicarbonate to provide a sufficient inorganic carbon source for autotrophic nitrifiers as well as to maintain appropriate ph buffering capacity ammonium chloride was added to each reactor providing 2 mgn l 1 of tan continuous aeration was applied to maintain sufficient do concentrations e g higher than 6 mg l 1 to determine total ammonia nitrogen tan removal rates water samples were collected hourly for 4 h changes to tan and nitrite levels were monitored the experiment was performed in triplicate tan removal rates were calculated according to the following equation eq 1 1 tan removal rate tan i tan f ssa t where tan i is the initial tan concentration mgn l 1 tan f is the final tan concentration mgn l 1 ssa is the biofilter s specific surface area m2 and t is the experimental period day 2 5 ozone disinfection of vibrio parahaemolyticus effects of residual ozone on vp in brackish water were investigated stock culture of vp in tsb 1 5 nacl section 2 2 was inoculated into 1 l of sterilized brackish water to an od600 of 0 4 equivalent to 104 cfu ml 1 thereafter ozone was bubbled into the solution to obtain rocs of 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 mg l 1 using the same conditions as the previous experiment section 2 4 aeration without ozone was assigned as control after ozonation the vp cells in ozonated water were kept stirred using a magnetic stirrer at room temperature 27 1 c for 1 h water samples were collected every 10 min for viable vp count using spread plate technique on tcbs agar 2 6 effects of residual ozone concentration on vibrio parahaemolyticus growth in biofilter media to inoculate pre activated nitrification biofilter with vp culture 150 pieces of active biofilter media suspended in 1 l brackish water were spiked with 1 ml of 104 cfu ml 1 vp culture media section 2 2 this suspension was then incubated for 4 h at 30 c in a rotary shaker this allowed for the attachment of vp onto the biofilter media surface thereafter biofilter media with vp were transferred into 1 l of fresh brackish water ozonation was provided through a diffuser for 0 3 mg l 1 roc initial and final viable vp counts on the biofilters were examined while interim water samples were collected and analyzed for tan nitrite and nitrate concentrations every hour for 4 h the experiment was repeated in triplicate 2 7 use of ozone for vibrio control in recirculating shrimp culture tank the laboratory scale ras fig 1 consisted of a 170 l rearing tank 0 6 m width 1 0 m length 0 4 m height 130 l nitrification biofilter tank 0 4 m diameter 0 6 m height and a 50 l ozone removal tank 0 5 m diameter 0 6 m height the biofilter tank contained 10 l of pre acclimated bcn 012 nitrification biofilter media section 2 1 an aquarium submersible pump atman ph 1100 approximately 3000 l d 1 capacity was used to pump water from the shrimp tank into the biofilter tank water returned to the shrimp tank by gravity a 250 μm filter bag trapped solids which were removed weekly during water recirculation the hydraulic retention time of the nitrification and ozone removal tanks were maintained at 36 and 48 min respectively continuous aeration was provided in all tanks through air stone diffusers providing do higher than 6 mg l 1 in the rearing tank 20 juvenile pacific white shrimps litopenaeus vammanei were cultured at an initial stocking density of 0 5 kg m 3 25 psu and at room temperature 27 1 c the shrimps were fed twice a day at 9 am and 3 pm with commercial pellet feed containing 38 protein at 5 of total body weight water alkalinity was maintained between 120 and 160 mg l 1 by sodium bicarbonate adjustments the experiment was carried out for 40 days without water exchange except for freshwater additions to compensate for evaporation prior to the experiment attachment of vp on active biofilter media was induced by inoculating vp culture into the biofilter tank vp stock culture was spiked into then diluted od600 1 0 in the biofilter tank water circulation in the ras was paused for 4 h to allow vp cells to attach with the biofilter and tank surfaces ozonation in the nitrification biofilter tank was provided at 1 min on 10 min off cycles to give an average roc of 0 3 0 24 0 35 mg l 1 in the control tank aeration was provided instead of ozone the experiment was implemented in triplicate during the experiment water samples were collected daily for water quality and roc analyses a viable vp from 1 water in the shrimp tank 2 water in the biofilter tank 3 biofilm sample in the shrimp tank 4 biofilm in the biofilter media and 5 settled solids at the bottom of the rearing tank were sampled and analyzed weekly by plate count technique on tcbs agar at the end of the experiment tan removal rates were examined by randomly sampling five biofilter media and measuring nitrification activity in a volumetric flask containing 1 mg nh4cl l 1 growth parameters i e body length body weight daily weight gain and survival rate of shrimp in the ras were evaluated at the end of the experiment 2 8 water sampling and analytical methods water samples were filtered through 25 mm whatman gf c glass fiber filters and then kept at 20 c until analysis tan 19 nitrite nitrogen 20 nitrate nitrogen 16 and uv275 uv absorbance at 275 nm representing dissolved organic matters doms were measured using a microplate spectrophotometer biotek powerwave xs2 usa alkalinity was examined with aqua

do meter hanna hi 9147 ph meter hanna hi 9125 and salinity refractometer respectively 2 9 statistical analysis all experiments and analyses were performed in triplicates mean values were reported with standard deviations mean value differences were analyzed using one way anova followed by turkey hsd post hoc test performed in graphpad prism version 7 0 differences were considered the statistical significance at p values 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ozonation in brackish water the solubility of ozone in water depends on several factors including air pressure temperature and salinity results of continuous ozonation in 25 psu brackish water for 50 min showed that the saturated roc was 0 45 0 01 mgo3 l 1 fig 2 a fundamentally ozone dissolution depends on the rate of ozone transfer from the gaseous to the liquid phase which is a function of the gaseous ozone concentration the contact area and the ozone s reaction with constituents within the water 21 in this study the stability of ozone in brackish water was examined under aerated and non aerated conditions although in theory the lifetime of ozone in water is quite short 22 in our experiment only a negligible decrease of less than 0 02 mg l 1 roc was observed over 1 h with or without aeration fig 2b showing that roc is rather constant moreover there was no significant difference between the roc in aerated and non aerated water suggesting that aeration should have no effect on ozone decay in our experiments the stability of ozone may have been bolstered in this experiment by the fact that it was performed with clean water which is low in organic matter and other constituents that ozone can react with 21 as such further investigations into residual ozone stability under aquaculture conditions which contain both dissolved and solid matters is warranted 3 2 biofilter nitrification activities after exposure to ozone in batch tests results in fig 3 show that nitrification biofilters can maintain nitrification performance even under aeration control and ozonation conditions in fig 3a tan decreased with treatment in a similar fashion with or without ozonation a previous study found that ozone can directly react with ammonia nh3 but reacts quite poorly with ammonium nh4 which is the dominant form of ammonia nitrogen at ph lower than 9 15 22 25 therefore the chemical oxidation of ammonium with ozone under the experiment condition may be negligible in terms of nitrite accumulation results in fig 3b show that nitrite nitrogen accumulation continuously increased at all rocs the highest nitrite accumulation was found at 0 3 mg l 1 roc at a higher roc 0 4 mg l 1 signs of ammonia oxidation inhibition began to show this accumulation of nitrite and nitrate upholds results from schroeder et al 13 where both ammonia oxidizing and nitrite oxidizing bacteria were still active after a 1 h exposure to 0 46 0 49 mg l 1 of ozone produced oxidants moreover fig 3c shows that an increase of nitrate concentrations was in stoichiometric balance with the decrease of tan hence the formation of nitrate shows that ozonation with an roc of up to 0 3 mg l 1 does not inhibit nitrification activities calculated tan removal rates are shown in fig 4 for comparison the specific ammonia removal rate of the control 41 94 3 12 mgn m 2 day 1 was not significantly different p 0 05 with 0 1 mg l 1 roc 37 89 3 49 mgn m 2 day 1 however at 0 4 mg l 1 roc the tan removal rate 30 29 0 56 mgn m 2 day 1 did become significantly lower p 0 05 than the control these results suggest that the biofilter s nitrification performance is indeed influenced by high roc and therefore the optimum roc of 0 3 mg l 1 was chosen for further studies 3 3 effect of ozone on vibrio parahaemolyticus inactivation in batch culture the results in fig 5 show that ozonation effectively reduced the amount of viable vp in culture medium within 60 min and that the reduction of vp by ozonation depended on roc and time the highest viability reduction of 4 77 log cfu ml 1 was achieved with the highest roc of 0 4 mg l 1 on the contrary the lowest roc of 0 1 mg l 1 excluding control only achieved a reduction of 0 86 log cfu ml 1 also lowest excluding control furthermore rocs of 0 3 and 0 4 mg l 1 completely killed all viable vp within 60 and 50 min respectively these results clearly show that the inactivation of vibrio parahaemolyticus by ozone is dosage and time dependent fundamentally ozone kills bacteria by breaking their cell walls and cell membranes inhibiting genes expression and damaging genetic materials until cell death however it was previously revealed that vp can tolerate ozone concentrations less than 0 125 mgo3 l 1 with its cell membrane remaining unharmed 26 and more generally tolerance against ozone oxidation varies among bacterial species with heterotrophic bacteria possibly being able to regrow after ozone concentrations decrease 27 similarly teitge et al 28 stated that ozone applications in the range of 5 50 mg hr 1 correspond to a redox potential of 350 mv which is unable to eliminate vibrio spp especially vp in either the water or biofilm of small scale ras filter tanks housing l vannamei shrimp because ozone tolerance varies across microorganism species and their growth periods and density 29 30 the optimization of ozonation dosages and effective contact time must be evaluated and specified in order to target specific bacterial species 3 4 effects of residual ozone on vibrio parahaemolyticus and nitrification biofilter in batch tests results in fig 6 show that 0 3 mg l 1 roc dramatically reduced the viable vp count in the biofilm matrix from 3 3 106 cfu m 2 to 9 9 104 cfu m 2 after 60 min of ozonation which is statistically a highly significant difference since biofilms often protect their colonizing bacteria from harmful surrounding environments 31 the disinfection of vp inside a biofilm layer commonly requires a higher disinfectant dosage to achieve the same degree of inactivation on the other hand the results in fig 7 revealed that 0 3 mg l 1 roc slightly reduced the ammonia removal rate 48 2 mgn m 2 day 1 compared with control with or without ozonation nitrite accumulation remained quite low mean value of 0 35 mgn l 1 studies regarding ozone s effects on nitrification biofilms is limited in literature of the studies available schroeder et al 13 observed similar behavior as this current study where nitrifying bacteria were protected by biofilm to tolerate continuous ozonation of up to 0 15 mg l 1 although vibrio are also biofilm forming bacteria we did find a reduction of vibrio cells in the biofilter media after ozonation in general the advantages of using floating or moving bed plastic media in ozone biofilter treatment systems is that their movement leads to collisions that spontaneously reduce the thickness of biofilm 27 and induce the release of free vibrio cells to react with ozone in the water use of ozonation with thick heterotrophic biofilm such as fixed bed biofilter might need to be further investigated therefore our results demonstrated that applying ozone at 0 30 0 05 mg l 1 roc in shrimp rearing ras allows for effective elimination of vibrio spp contamination by the system s biofilter with only a slight disturbance in the system s nitrification process 3 5 effects of ozonation in shrimp rearing recirculating aquaculture systems 3 5 1 effects of ozonation on water quality in shrimp rearing tanks the tan nitrite and nitrate levels in the control and 0 3 mg l 1 roc treated shrimp rearing tanks during cultivation are shown in fig 8 these results revealed the long term effects of ozonation on nitrification efficiency the behaviors of tan nitrite and nitrate levels were similar for the control and ozonated rass tan levels fluctuated during the first 20 days which most likely coincided with the nitrifying bacteria s acclimatization period since the levels became stable after day 25 figs 8a and 8b despite the fluctuations tan was effectively removed and levels of it remained low at 0 13 0 01 and 0 15 0 02 mgn l 1 for the control and ozone treated rass respectively note that these tan concentrations are within the safe level for l vannamei culture less than 1 45 mgn l 1 as recommended by valencia castañeda et al 32 similarly nitrite accumulation was negligible with levels of 0 14 0 05 and 0 13 0 02 mgn l 1 for the control and ozone treated rass respectively once again these concentrations are far less than the safe level of 6 1 mgn l 1 at 15 salinity as recommended by lin and chen 33 however the most pronounced difference between the ozonated and control ras was the ozonated ras s dramatically lower dom levels as indicated by its lower uv275 absorption 34 fig 8d without ozonation dom accumulation in the control ras resulted in a 3 times higher uv275 adsorption than the ozone treated ras thus confirming the effectiveness of ozone oxidation in removing dom in general the dom in aquaculture systems is derived from the degradation of feed and fecal wastes water recirculation therefore causes an accumulation of dom in the water which is detectable by a continuous increase in uv275 adsorption during shrimp cultivation especially in control tanks the oxidation of dom such as non biodegradable yellow substances by ozone is well reported by previous studies 15 23 28 35 with this study ozonation in the treatment tanks helped to successfully maintain a low uv275 absorbance at approximately 0 06 throughout the cultivation period compared to 0 15 in the control tanks similarly park et al 36 reported a 30 reduction of dissolved organic carbon and 70 reduction in water color by ozonation therefore application of ozone in the ras not only inactivated pathogenic bacteria but also improved water quality by reducing organic matters 3 5 2 effect of ozonation on nitrification efficiency of the biofilter fig 9 shows that ozonation did not affect the biofilters nitrification ability as there was no significant difference between the tan removal rates in the aerated 45 70 0 46 mgn m 2 d 1 and ozonated 46 49 0 84 mgn m 2 d 1 systems in general consistency in nitrification efficiency is vital for ras operation and only slight variations in tan removal rates ranging between 40 and 48 mgn m 2 d 1 were observed across the experiment indicating acceptable stability of biofiltration throughout the shrimp cultivation experiment tan removal efficiency depends on several factors such as nitrogen loading stocking density 37 salinity types of biofilter media used and the identity of microorganism populations 38 39 results from this experiment revealed that an roc of 0 3 mgo3 l 1 had no obvious effect on ammonia removal which was mainly performed by nitrifying microorganisms to understand the mechanisms behind the no effects of 0 3 mgo3 l 1 roc on nitrification we recommend further investigations into the diversity of microbes responsible for nitrification activities especially aob aoa and nob while our current experiment provides evidence of no effects on nitrification rates by a moderate roc we have not concluded that the pathways or perhaps even the identity of microbes that are responsible for nitrification activities in the presence of roc have not been affected previous research has revealed that the nitrification activities of nitrosomonas marina aob and nitrospira nob immobilized in a biofilter were maintained after short term exposure to ozone concentrations of up to 0 6 mg l 1 for 1 h 13 it should be noted that if roc is causing extensive microbial death then some molecular techniques such as 16s rdna analysis might not suitable because dna from the dead microorganisms will be simultaneously detected alongside those of active cells and therefore typical techniques of detecting ammonia and nitrite removal rates must be performed alongside microbial identification in order to confirm nitrification activities 3 5 3 effects of ozonation on vibrio parahaemolyticus in the biofilter and shrimp culture tank the initial density of vp cells on the biofilter media after inoculation into the nitrification biofilter tanks was approximately 2 48 107 cfu m 2 fig 10 a then for the next 40 days of operations the viable vp count in the control biofilter continually increased while the count in both the biofilm and water of the biofilter tank ozonated with 0 3 mg l 1 roc significantly decreased in fact the vp count in the water of the ozonated biofilter tank decreased to undetectable concentrations because biofilter contaminated with vibrio may induce shrimp disease continuous ozonation was recommended to suppress the growth of this pathogenic bacteria 36 40 vp count was successfully controlled in the biofilter tank of the shrimp cultivating ras ozonated with 0 30 0 05 mg l 1 roc fig 11 shows that the viable vp counts in water and settled solids were far lower 2 4 log cfu ml 1 lower with ozone treatment while some vp accumulation was found in the ozone treated shrimp tank s biofilm the concentration was approximately 1 log cfu ml 1 lower than the control aerated tank s biofilm hence it can be concluded that proper ozonation in a nitrification unit can effectively reduce vibrio spp count without reducing the performance of the nitrification biofilter ozonation is widely used for pathogen control in ras and it is most often applied after the nitrification biofilter unit just before the water recycles back into the aquaculture tank ozonation in the rearing tank is not typically as this can create toxicity for aquatic organisms 41 because of this pathogenic bacteria like vibrio spp can contaminate all parts of the ras rearing tank in this experiment fig 11 while the vp count in the rearing tank water was around 3 log cfu ml 1 higher vp counts were found in the biofilms attached to the tank s material surfaces such as the tank walls water pipes aeration tube and stone air diffuser high vp counts were also found in the suspended solid and biofloc results in fig 11b show that without ozonation vp concentrations in the settled solid could increase to as high as approximately 3 83 105 cfu ml 1 or 5 4 log units over 40 days a previous study found that organic particles in ras can promote bacterial activity in the water by providing surfaces which the bacteria can attach to for growth 42 moreover both dissolved and particulate organic compounds in the water can act as carbon sources for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria including the pathogenic vibrio in the biofilm matrix as such the reduction of dissolved organic compounds by ozone oxidation can also be an indirect benefit of pathogenic bacteria control in the ras another study showed that there is a strong correlation between the microbiota in shrimp stomachs and the sediment 43 44 eventually as pathogenic bacteria accumulate in the suspended and settled solids inside the ras they will start causing harm to the shrimps that ingest the solids this study demonstrated that an optimum ozonation roc exists to simultaneously inactivate pathogenic vibrios from shrimp ras without influencing nitrification activities in general investigating nitrifying microorganisms in biofilters is rather complicate because several microorganisms are involved in the process for example the oxidization of ammonia to nitrite is not restricted to only conventional nitrifying bacteria but also several genera of chemoorganotrophic bacteria ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and anaerobically ammonia oxidizing bacteria anammox existing techniques of analyzing microbial communities in biofilm matrices such as qpcr next generation dna sequencing or scanning electron microscopy sem are not yet applicable to investigating which microorganisms are actively involved in the nitrification process specifically most dna amplification techniques require a specific target sequence which may discriminate between different microbes responsible for nitrification activities and even the dna of inactive or dead microorganisms matching the targeted sequence can produce misleading results also while sem can reveal the morphology and aggregation of cells this technique is not suitable for species identification therefore future research is needed to properly identify the microbial communities actual responsible for nitrification in order to form a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ozonation in ras 3 5 4 effects of ozonation on shrimp there was no significant difference between the shrimp survival rates of the control 81 6 2 9 and ozone treated 80 0 0 rass shrimp growth rates were also similar at 0 036 0 006 and 0 037 0 008 g shrimp day 1 for the control and ozone treated ras respectively similar results on safety of ozonation in aquaculture systems were reported in european lobster 45 46 this revealed that low residual ozone at approximately 0 02 mgo3 l 1 data not shown in the returned water after ozone exhausting tank was safe for shrimp cultivation 3 5 5 overall effects of ozonation on recirculating aquaculture systems this study s results clearly show that 0 3 mg l 1 roc in the nitrification biofilter unit not only improves the ras s water quality but also reduces the system s dom levels in fact the reduction in dom could be distinguished visually as the color of the water in the ozonated ras was clear and transparent while the water in the control ras was pale yellow and slightly turbid the major benefit of ozonation is the control of unwanted microorganisms especially pathogens afforded by ozone s ability to kill or inactivate various bacterial fungal protozoan or viral microorganisms 26 unfortunately this means that ozonation can eliminate some beneficial microorganisms too it was previously reported that ozonation can manipulate the microbial community structure letting it become more stable or dominated by specific species 39 whether this is beneficial to shrimps reared in rass is controversial as it can affect the microbiota diversity in the intestines of shrimps reared in rass it is known that healthy shrimps in the wild population have more microbiome diversity than infectious shrimps and the loss of microbial diversity is associated with diseases 43 therefore ozonation should be used with care and more investigations into ozone applications for closed aquaculture systems are still needed 4 conclusion ozonation was successfully applied in the nitrification biofilter tank of a litopenaeus vannamei shrimp recirculating aquaculture system ras the optimum residual ozone concentration roc of 0 3 mg l 1 could inactivate the pathogenic bacteria vibrio spp in both the system s water and biofilm but did not affect the biofilter s nitrification treatment activity this roc was then applied to a 170 l shrimp ras with a 75 l moving bed biofilter tank and 50 l ozone removal tank over a 40 day experiment the pathogenic bacteria vibrio parahaemolyticus vp was found in the biofilter s biofilm and other tank components roc at 0 3 mg l 1 dramatically reduced the viable vp counts in all parts of the ras including the rearing tank just as significantly ozone treatment did not affect shrimp survival or growth in comparison to a control ras without ozone treatment declaration of

removal of high as iii in the amd like system is an urgent need 1 2fes 2 s 7o 2 aq 2h 2 o 2fe 2 aq 4so 4 2 aq 4h aq 2 4fe 2 aq o 2 aq 4h aq 4fe 3 aq 2h 2 o 3 fes 2 s 14 fe 3 aq 8h 2 o 15 fe 2 aq 2so 4

arsenic from amd 16 18 the reaction process via the increase of ph with different degrees mainly involves co precipitation of as iii and or as v with fe iii oxyhydroxides or hydroxysulfates including tooeleite or scorodite precipitation the mixture of as bearing ferrihydrite akageneite and schwertmannite 19 22 al iii as one of the main components of amd in many mining areas 23 25 can also contribute to as scavenging via sorption onto al iii oxides al iii fe iii hydroxides and al sulfoxyhydroxide e g basaluminite 22 26 27 previous studies have shown that the as adsorption capacity of al iii fe iii hydroxides involving surface charge and speciation of substrate hydroxides are strongly ph and fe al molar ratio dependent 27 29 arsenic in different valence states have different maximum adsorption at different ph values 27 29 the co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxide at fe al molar ratio of 1 can adsorb 20 70 of the initially added as iii with an increase of ph from 3 to 7 whereas its adsorption capacity decreases to 50 with continuously increasing the ph to 11 27 all as v can be adsorbed on co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxide at ph 3 7 the reduced retention of both as v at ph 7 and as iii at ph 9 by co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxide or fe iii hydroxide are likely due to the increased electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged arsenic and the substrate surface 27 30 although as iii is known to exhibit higher adsorption affinity to fe iii hydroxide than as v under alkaline conditions 31 the fe al molar ratio under the same initial arsenic concentration is also important to remove as as iii retention drops to 20 30 with decreasing the fe al molar ratio from 4 to 1 and the as iii adsorption by al iii hydroxide is negligible the decrease of ferrihydrite content and the accumulating formation of crystalline aluminum hydroxides e g bayerite and gibbsite with decreasing the fe al molar ratio could be responsible for the weaker affinity for as iii 27 32 the amount of as v adsorption on al iii fe iii hydroxide at fe al molar ratios of 1 4 are simliar which is twice more than that on al iii hydroxide 27 therefore the changes of as species and solid products significantly impact the as removal efficiency in the fe iii al iii as iii v system different as species and mineral phases are commonly observed duing the abiotic oxidation of fe ii and as iii to fe iii and as v which is an important pathway during the amd treatment 20 33 34 abiotic oxidation of fe ii and as iii can be induced by reactive oxygen species ros involving fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 for 93 5 as removal efficiency within 4 h under aeration condition 20 for as rich amd containing high mn ii or flowing through karst areas almost complete abiotic oxidation of fe ii and as iii has been accomplished as of late using a combination process of fenton like and catalytic mn ii oxidation or enhanced fenton like technology with carbonate continuous dissolution 35 36 as v bearing fe iii oxyhydroxides i e six line ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and hematite are produced in 0 25 2 h contributing to 100 as immobilization 35 36 however little is known about the possible role of al iii on as removal in amd during the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii and as iii to as v thus representing an important research gap accordingly we have assessed the influence of al iii cation on scavenging of high as iii from amd at various ph values and fe al as molar ratios in the key oxygen induced oxidation process of fe ii and as iii under high temperature heating as a limiting condition is that the increase of temperature is conducive to remove more as and obtain more stable solids in fe as mn systems described previously 35 moreover the temperature of some mines in the early days from ore mining is above 50 c in the subsurface 37 the main objectives of this work are 1 to investigate the effects of the co existence of al iii on the as removal and oxidation and 2 to probe the underlying mechanism the results obtained in this work can provide mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the sequestration of as during oxygen induced treatment of as rich amd furthermore the as leaching stability of solid products dependent on the solid species obtained in this work can help to predict the risk of secondary as pollution and the fate of as in amd 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of amd the fe as al s solution in this work was used to clearly understand the influence of al iii cation on as behaviors feso4 7h2o naaso2 and al2 so4 3 18h2o were separately dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid at ph 1 for fe ii as iii and al iii stock solutions the above three solutions were mixed to simulate actual al containing as rich amd with initial fe as and al concentrations of 2 24 8 96 g l 1 1 5 g l 1 and 0 54 g l 1 which were within the known severe amd limitations of 1 20 4 g l 1 fe 0 35 12 15 g l 1 as and 0 22 6 68 g l 1 al respectively 15 19 23 24 37 38 2 2 as removal from as rich amd in the co existence of al iii the experimental set up mainly consisted of a polytetrafluoroethylene reactor 250 ml sealed by rubber stoppers provided with a heating water bath circulating device fig s1 all reactions started with the fast addition of naoh solution into the tested amd for desired ph values and each initial system was 200 ml the oxygen flow rate and temperature were separately maintained at 1 6 l min 1 and 95 c over the course of the reactions to investigate the effect of ph on as removal the ph values of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii were adjusted to 3 5 7 and 9 at a fixed fe al as molar ratio 8 1 1 for considering the effect of fe al as ratio on as removal the initial fe al as molar ratios of the tested amd were set to 0 1 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 and 8 1 1 at a fixed ph value ph 5 aliquots of produced suspensions were taken at regular time intervals 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and filtered using 0 22 μm membranes residual solids were digested via 6 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid the concentrations of as t as iii total fe fe t fe ii and al iii of all samples were measured additionally the concentration of as v was calculated by the concentration difference between as t and as iii all as removal experiments were conducted in duplicates and each sample was measured three times for parallel samples analysis q value test involving 6 sample data n 6 was used for the trade offs of doubtable value and the averages standard error was finally reported all the samples were analyzed in an accredited lab an affiliate of key laboratory of pollution ecology and environmental engineering chinese academy of sciences to focus on the role of co existent al iii cation on as behaviors the controlled trials were performed with the object of as rich amd in simple fe as s system 2 3 reference materials the species of solid products fe and or fe as phase were identified by comparison with reference materials including natrojarosite schwertannite amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate tooeleite ferric arsenate as bearing six line and two line ferrihydrite which were synthesized via the methods described previously 20 39 40 41 the al iii as v precipitate and as containing aluminum hydr oxide references used in this work included amorphous aluminum arsenate as iii bearing aluminum hydroxide and as v bearing aluminum hydroxide amorphous aluminum arsenate was synthesized following the procedure described previously 42 briefly al iii and as v solutions were prepared separately by dissolving al no3 3 9h2o and na3aso4 12h2o in di water and adjusted to ph 2 7 using 1 0 mol l 1 hno3 0 1 mol l 1 as v solution was titrated by 0 1 mol l 1 al iii solution under mechanical stirring 250 rpm and the ph value was maintained at ph 2 7 by the addition of 1 0 mol l 1 naoh solution for 1 h to form amorphous aluminum arsenate as iii bearing and as v bearing aluminum hydroxides were synthesized according to the conventional method for aluminum hydroxide 43 modified by introducing as iii and as v respectively aluminum hydroxide was prepared by neutralization of 1 0 mol l 1 al iii solution al2 so4 3 18h2o using 1 0 mol l 1 naoh to ph 7 0 under mechanical stirring the resulted aluminum hydroxide precipitate was separated by centrifugation to remove excess electrolytes and resuspended in as iii and as v solutions at al as molar ratio of 8 pre adjusted to ph 5 the mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h with mechanical stirring at ph 5 for both as iii bearing and as v bearing aluminum hydroxides 2 4 chemical analyses and solid phase characterization as iii and as t concentrations were detected by an afs 2202e hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer using different carrier solutions 0 5 mol l 1 ph 5 citrate buffer vs 5 hcl solution with the detection limit of 0 1 μg l 1 and the margins of error of 2 to determine the as t concentration the reduction of all arsenic to as iii by 5 of thiourea ascorbic acid agent occurred prior to hydride generation 43 the concentrations of fe ii fe t and al iii were analyzed via a 2550 uv vis spectrophotometer an aa240 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer and a 5100 svdv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer with the same detection limit of 0 1 mg l 1 and the margins of error of 2 respectively the ferrozine method was introduced for determination of fe ii which involved the complexation of fe ii with 1 10 phenanthroline in the presence of ammonium acetate acetic acid at 510 nm 44 solid products with the morphology elemental distribution mineralogical compositions and functional groups were obtained by a quanta 250 scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectrometer microprobe sem eds a d max 2000pc x ray diffractometer xrd and a nicolet 6700 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir respectively the sem eds images were collected under high vacuum at 30 kv with the magnification of 5000 times the test condition of x ray diffraction patterns contained the usage of cuka1 radiation in continuous scan mode within 5 80 or 10 80 2θ range with a step size of 0 02 2θ at 56 kv and 182 ma the ftir spectra were recorded by 128 co added scans in the 400 4000 cm 1 range with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 2 5 tclp test toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp us epa method 1311 as a performance indicator was employed to analyze short term stability of final solids in term of leaching concentrations of as iii and as t each solid sample was added into the acetate buffer solution the liquid solid ratio ml g of 20 1 with the agitation of 30 2 rpm at 23 2 c the extracted solution at ph 4 93 0 05 was prepared by mixing 5 7 ml of glacial acetic 64 3 ml of 1 mol l 1 naoh with 930 ml of di water after the 18 2 h reaction the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for each test sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of as the removal efficiency of as at different ph values and fe al as molar ratios during abiotic oxidation reactions of fe ii and as iii from as rich amd containing al iii was illustrated in fig 1 a c ph was very important to remove as including its equilibrium time and efficiency arsenic was rapidly removed upon contacting amd with oxygen and all the reactions finished in 6 h which was shortened to 1 h as the ph increased from 3 to 9 after 8 h reactions the removal efficiencies of as increased from 92 3 to 99 8 with the increase of ph from 3 to 7 but slightly diminished to 99 5 with increasing continuously the ph to 9 fe al as molar ratio in terms of fe concentration at constant contents of al and as played a key role in as removal efficiency there was a marked increase in removal efficiency from 95 3 to 99 6 with the increase of fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 at the end of this experiment however the reaction equilibrium time maintained in 4 h regardless of the increased initial fe concentration only 0 8 of as was removed in the al as system without fe indicating the presence of fe as the main cause for as immobilization it can be seen by comparing fig 1 a c with b d that the oxygen induced abiotic oxidation treatment of as rich amd containing and excluding al iii followed similar trends of as removal efficiency with respect to ph and fe al as molar ratio the removal efficiencies of as in the fe as systems with the levels of 92 6 99 9 were roughly equal to those in the fe al as systems this result indicated that co existent al iii in as rich amd had little influence on the removal of as over the course of abiotic oxidation reaction of fe ii and as iii in the presence of oxygen on the contrary some recent studies found that as iii adsorption maximum decreased with increasing al fe molar ratio in co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxides 27 32 this was likely due to the partial oxidation of as iii to as v and different reaction products for as fixation on the basis of available literatures more as v was loaded on al bearing ferrihydrite or fe iii al iii as v co precipitates than al free fe iii hydroxides 45 46 3 2 as oxidation and its species in aqueous and solid phases fig 2 a c showed the effect of ph and fe al as molar ratio on the percentages of as oxidized and remaining after 8 h oxygen induced abiotic oxidation of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii ph had a remarkable contribution to the oxidation of as iii to as v the percentage of as oxidized increased from 41 6 to 67 8 maximum with the increase of ph from 3 to 5 and then showed a downward trend as ph continued to increase involving that 59 7 and 40 2 of as iii were oxidized to as v at ph 7 and 9 respectively the fe al as molar ratio also had a major impact on as iii oxidation the percentage of as oxidized 0 1 67 8 generally increased as the fe al as molar ratio increased from 0 1 1 to 8 1 1 little as iii was oxidized to as v at the fe al as molar ratio of 0 1 1 because fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 could not occur for ros formation the oxidation degree of as iii reached 55 1 at the fe al as molar ratio of 2 1 1 which was slightly higher than that 51 4 at the fe al as molar ratio of 4 1 1 therefore the optimal conditions for as iii oxidation were ph 5 and fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 in this work the percentages of as oxidized and remaining as affected by ph and fe as molar ratio after the oxygen induced abiotic oxidation of as rich amd in the absence of al iii as the control trial were presented in fig 2 b d the trend of as iii oxidation in al iii free amd was similar to that in al iii bearing amd as a fuction of ph values while the percentages of as oxidized at the fe as molar ratio of 2 1 to 8 1 in aqueous fe as systems 30 2 62 9 were considerably lower than those 51 4 67 8 in aqueous fe al as systems these results indicated that the presence of al iii was in favor of as iii oxidation during abiotic oxidation reactions of as rich amd with oxygen furthermore the maximum as iii oxidation was observed at the fe as molar ratio of 8 1 in as rich amd with or without al iii by contrast to the concentrations of as iii and as v as a function of time in as rich amd with and without al iii fig s2 arsenic distribution between solutions and solids was little affected by co existent al iii after 8 h reactions only 0 1 7 7 of as t remained in solution with and without al iii under all conditions used in this work except that 99 2 of as t was retained in aqueous phases at the fe al as molar ratio of 0 1 1 aqueous arsenic still existed in the as iii form hence al iii hydr oxides showed very weak affinity for arsenite in the system without fe according to rapid hydrolysis of al iii fig s3 in the fe containing systems almost all of produced as v was immobilized by solids however the percentages of as remaining at ph 3 were higher than those at other ph values this could be attributed to insufficient fe iii or fe iii oxyhydr oxides for as immobilization at ph 3 where 25 33 of fe t still remained in the form of fe ii in aqueous phases fig s4 3 3 solid phase characterization 3 3 1 sem eds fig 3 and fig s5 exhibited the morphology of solid products at various ph values and fe al as molar ratios after 8 h oxygen induced reaction of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii together with the analyses for the fe al as molar ratios by eds all final solids existed as irregular shaped agglomerates indicating the amorphous nature this observation was in agreement with those after the same treatment of as rich amd without al iii or with mn ii reported previously 20 35 it could be that fe ii and or as iii continued to be separately oxidized to fe iii and or as v simultaneously accompanied by their different distributions between solutions and solids hence inhibiting the formation of regular shaped particles in micrometer size as indicated by sem eds the molar ratios among fe al and as in final solids under all conditions used in this work after the reactions differed from that 8 1 1 in the initial as rich amd table s1 this was also inconsistent with previously reported results in as rich amd without al iii or with mn ii that the comparable fe as or fe mn as molar ratio was observed at the beginning and the end of reactions 20 35 it was reasonably attributed to a random distribution of co precipitated al iii fe iii hydr oxides unlike iron oxy hydroxides catalytic oxidation of mn ii to mn iii iv followed by mn iii iv oxides sorption on their surfaces 35 47 at ph 3 the fe as and al as molar ratios of the final solid detected by eds were 6 and 0 7 respectively which accorded with the chemical analysis results but were both lower than the initial molar ratios it could be explained by the slow oxidation rate of fe ii to fe iii 19 20 and weak hydroysis of al iii at ph 3 48 higher fe as molar ratios 9 0 14 4 at ph 5 9 detected by eds were attributed to the al iii competition with fe iii for as v corresponding to complete hydrolysis of al iii at ph 5 and a maximum as v adsorption on al iii hydroxide at ph 4 4 5 32 49 3 3 2 xrd the xrd patterns of final solids after 8 h abiotic oxidation reactions of as rich amd containing al iii as affected by ph and fe al as molar ratio were characterized in fig 4 different features of final solids on the xrd patterns were obtained at different ph the reaction product at ph 3 displayed intense and sharp characteristic xrd peaks at the positions similar to those of natrojarosite pdf 36 0425 and some amorphous features with increasing the ph to 5 and 7 two broader xrd bands of solid products at 35 6 36 and 62 8 63 2θ better matched with those of as bearing ferrihydrite for the solid at ph 9 six bands on its xrd patterns 34 40 46 53 61 and 63 2θ were more accordant with those of as bearing six line ferrihydrite or schwertannite the xrd patterns of solid products changed markedly at various fe al as molar ratios in terms of fe content the weak bands at 35 6 36 and 62 63 2θ became broader and shifted towards that of amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate on the xrd patterns with the decrease of fe al as from 8 1 1 to 2 1 1 indicating an increased proportion of ferric arsenite or arsenate in the fe free system the characteristic xrd bands of the reaction product mainly had the features of aluminum hydroxide at 18 and 42 2θ the co existence of al iii in fe ii as iii solutions upon exposure to oxygen had a substantial influence on species of final solids through the comparison of the xrd patterns fig 4 and fig s6 the xrd patterns of the solids consisted of the diffraction peaks of well characterized six line ferrihydrite under all conditions used in this work with the exception of the fe as molar ratio of 2 1 in al iii free systems it indicated that the existence of al iii had negative influence on the crystallinity degree of ferrihydrite which was similar to the observation as previously reported 33 3 3 3 ftir the infrared spectra of reaction products after the abiotic oxidation of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii at various ph values and fe al as molar ratios were displayed in fig 5 during the 0 5 2 h reaction at ph 3 the infrared bands of the solid product at 512 620 806 983 1097 and 3207 cm 1 were located at similar positions to those of tooeleite involving lattice feoh mode ν4 so4 as iii o stretching vibration ν1 so4 ν3 so4 and oh stretching mode of absorbed h2o the ftir bands of the solid product at 466 501 625 821 1004 1089 1178 1629 and 3355 cm 1 subsequently occurred fig s7c which was reasonably ascribed to those of as v bearing natrojarosite involving ν2 so4 feo stretching vibration and ν4 so4 as v o stretching vibration ν1 so4 2ν3 so4 h2o bending and oh stretching modes 50 these results suggested the transformation from tooeleite to as v bearing natrojarosite and amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate for both as v and as iii retention as iii bearing natrojarosite could be ruled out due to its weak affinity for as iii 51 at other ph values the infrared bands of final solids at 451 567 582 701 cm 1 were located at the similar positions involving feoh mode of as v bearing ferrihydrite ν4 so4 bending mode of as iii bearing ferrihydrite and feo stretching vibration of schwertannite with the increase of ph from 5 to 9 the ν3 so4 band of the solid at 1116 cm 1 gradually disappeared and the as v o band position shifted towards as iii o stretching vibration from 808 to 796 cm 1 indicating a decrease of so4 ii content and an increase of as iii in solids additionally the infrared absorption bands of final solids at 447 489 597 605 808 826 1113 1635 and 3396 3417 cm 1 under the fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 were ascribed to lattice fe oh mode ν4 so4 mode aso stretching vibration h2o bending and oh stretching modes respectively the characteristic ν4 so4 band of reaction products shifted from 597 to 605 cm 1 and simultaneously the high frequency aso band increased from 808 to 826 cm 1 as the fe al as molar ratio decreased it indicated that the final solids could be gradually dominated by amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate rather than as iii v bearing ferrihydrite as the content of fe decreased in the fe free system at al as molar ratio of 1 the infrared spectrum of the final solid corresponded to that of aluminum hydroxide a comparison of infrared spectra of reaction products after oxygen induced abiotic oxidation of as rich amd with al iii and without al iii fig s7 clearly showed that the speciation of as in solid phases could be controlled by the presence of al iii the aso stretching vibration bands of solids containing al iii under all conditions became closer to as v o band position indicating that al iii in fe ii as iii solutions with oxygen facilitated the oxidation of as iii to as v 3 4 stability evaluation fig 6 showed the tclp test results of final solids over the abiotic oxidation course of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii at ph 5 and the fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 the leaching concentration of as t was 4 8 mg l 1 which passed the standard epa tclp test limit of 5 mg l 1 as however in other conditions as t leaching concentrations between 6 8 and 57 1 mg l 1 exceeded the regulatory as limit it was very likely due to the oxidation degree of as iii to as v in addition the lowest as iii leaching concentration occurred at ph 5 and fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 hence suggesting this condition as the optimum for the short term storage of disposed fe al as solids in the environment as iii was the main form of as in leachate under all conditions used in this work except ph 5 and 9 indicating that the as leaching stability of final solids mainly depended on the as iii containing solid products the leaching concentration of as iii 25 5 mg l 1 at ph 3 was far higher than those 1 4 5 2 mg l 1 at other ph this was consistent with the observation of amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate under the fe as molar ratio 2 at ph 3 which was more as leaching unstable than as iii bearing ferrihydrite under the fe as molar ratio of 8 at other ph values 52 the level of as iii leaching decreased from 27 4 mg l 1 to 1 4 mg l 1 with increasing the fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 this indicated that as iii fixation on ferrihydrite was stronger than that by amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate with increasing the fe al as molar ratio the reason for the higher level of as leaching in the al containing solid at ph 3 was that aluminum hydroxide had higher solubility than ferric hydroxide hence limiting as retention 53 at ph 5 the presence of al iii had little effect on the leaching stability of the final solid however compared to the al free final solids al containing solid products under other conditions had lower as leaching concentrations via the tclp test this indicated that the existence of al iii was likely to improve the leaching stability of reaction products it could be explained that produced al iii hydr oxides probably existed as coating materials decreasing the as leaching concentraitons 54 55 3 5 mechanism discussion the oxidation efficiencies of as iii as affected by ph and fe al as molar ratio depended on the content of available ros produced ros as the oxidizers including o2 h2o2 and ho for fe ii and as iii oxidation during the fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 was identified fig s8 and the reactions could be written as eqs s1 s7 which was similar to that in the fe as systems 20 the stronger characteristic uv peak of products of ros with the scavengers indicated the formation of more ros for more as iii oxidation efficiency in aqueous phases with increasing the ph from 3 to 5 and the fe al as molar ratios from 2 1 1 4 1 1 to 8 1 1 these could be due to the higher fenton like reaction rate 56 and absolutely sufficient fe supply however chemical analysis fig s4 and ftir results fig s7 suggested that the fenton like reaction at neutral to alkaline ph was very likely to occur on the surfaces of fe ii iii oxides rather than in solutions the decrease of as iii oxidized could be because a significant amount of produced ros was directly consumed during the transformation fe ii iii oxides to fe iii hydr oxides 57 70 100 of fe ii and 40 2 67 8 of as iii oxidation from as rich amd containing al iii under oxygen exposure achieved a general increase of removal efficiency of as 92 3 99 8 in 1 4 h with increasing the ph from 3 to 9 and the fe al as molar ratios from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 different oxidation degrees of fe ii to fe iii and as iii to as v for different solid products associated with different species of as at different ph and fe al as molar ratios were very important to as removal as iii removal is still significant via the co precipitation of as iii with fe iii during the reactions the solid phase characterization with thermodynamic calculations fig 4 and table s2 indicated the presence of as v bearing natrojarosite at ph 3 the disappearance of amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate at ph 9 and the formation of aluminum hydr oxide schwertannite two line and six line ferrihydrite for as immobilization in all fe containing systems however as the ph and fe al as molar ratio increased the decreased fraction of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate with the increased fraction of nanoscale ferrihydrite were responsible for an increased arsenic retention via adsorption or incorporation which were comfirmed by the decreased average particle size of solids and the increase of the bet surface area and pore volume of solids fig s9 and table s3 the increased transformation rate of fe iii as iii v co precipitate to as bearing ferrihydrite with increasing the ph and fe as molar ratio in line with those reported in the literatures 20 35 58 59 was reasonably attributed to the high solubility of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate at high ph 58 60 and or excessive fe supply zeta potential distributions of the solid products fig s10 indicated that uncharged arsenite h3aso3 adsorption was less favorable than negatively charged arsenate species h2aso4 adsorption on positively charged substrates at ph 3 and 5 whereas h3aso3 was retained more than haso4 2 and or h2aso4 by the solids with negative surface charge at ph 7 and 9 this observation corresponded to the increase of as iii as v ratio with increasing the ph from 5 to 7 resulting in 99 5 of as removal at high ph at ph 3 the relatively lower as removal efficiency could be attributed to the less formation of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate for as iii fixation corresponding to the lower fe ii oxidation and the formation of natrojarosite co existent al iii was conducive to the as iii oxidation via fenton like reaction of fe ii and o2 at ph 5 and the fe al as molar ratios of 2 8 1 1 in contrast to the fe as systems with and without al iii it could be explained that the formation of al iii hydroxide retarded 20 of as iii in association with fe iii or fe iii hydr oxides according to as iii remaining in solutions within the first 0 5 h reaction fig s2 conversely promoting as iii oxidation with produced ros in solutions additionally co existent al iii was independent of as removal by the comparison of al containing and al free fe ii as iii systems during the oxidation process of fe ii and as iii this was different from the conventional understanding that as iii was considerably less adsorbed on co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxides than fe iii hydroxides 27 61 it was very likely to due to the formation of multiple solid products contributing to the similar as immobilization however the species of solid products could be controlled by co existent al iii al iii induced formation of natrojarosite rather than ferrihydrite at ph 3 could be because that the strong binding between al iii and the oxygen donor atoms of functional oh groups of iron hydr oxides at ph 3 4 inhibited the fe iii hydrolysis for the formation of ferrihydrite 62 63 at other conditions the xrd results showed that the crystallinity of ferrihydrite decreased by the co existent al iii this was similar that the presence of al iii retarded the iron hydroxides transformation to more crystalline phases 61 being reasonably attributed to al iii partial substitution for fe iii in iron hydroxides 63 65 4 conclusions the effects of co existent al iii on the as removal and oxidation during the oxygen induced treatment of as rich amd was investigated in this study al iii had little influence on as removal but facilitated as iii oxidation in contrast to the fe as systems with and without al iii this oxidation mechanism involved the delay in the co precipitation process of fe iii or fe iii hydr oxides with 20 of as iii due to the weak affinity between al iii hydroxide and as iii promoting more aqueous as iii oxidation with ros via the fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 the sequestration of as being solid species dependent was controlled by ph and fe al as molar ratio 70 100 of fe ii and 40 2 67 8 of as iii oxidation caused 92 3 99 8 of as removal which increased with increasing the ph from 3 to 9 and fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 the mixture of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate ferric arsenate as bearing ferrihydrite and as bearing schwertannite was mainly responsible for as immobilization as the removal mechanism the condition for the safe solid storage was only at ph 5 and fe al as molar ratios of 8 1 1 this finding has achieved the ex situ as treatment of as iii al iii rich amd however there is still much work to be done on the in

13302,the effect of co existent al iii in as rich amd on as removal via oxygen induced abiotic oxidation caused concern due to weak affinity between al iii hydroxide and as iii the removal of as from as rich amd with and without al iii at various ph and fe al as molar ratios was investigated the results showed that 92 3 99 8 of as in al iii containing systems was removed by 70 100 of fe ii and 40 2 67 8 of as iii oxidation in 1 4 h at ph 3 9 and fe al as molar ratios of 2 8 1 1 arsenic removal efficiencies generally increased with increasing the ph and fe al as molar ratio arsenic oxidation efficiencies first increased from ph 3 to 5 and then decreased from ph 5 to 9 while an opposite trend occurred with increasing the fe al as molar ratio as iii oxidation was controlled by ros contents involving the fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate ferric arsenate and as bearing ferrihydrite schwertannite were the main as sinks co existent al iii promoted as iii oxidation the proposed method for aqueous as removal with the total as as t leaching solid product at ph 5 and fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 can bring the as level to the required limit as emphasized in regulatory frameworks keywords as iii rich amd fenton like reaction co existent al iii removal oxidation 1 introduction as iii is a challenging problem in acid mine drainage amd 1 2 small scale artisanal gold mining 3 4 power generation 5 extractive metallurgy of copper especially with the dirty concentrates 6 7 as well as in underground space development 8 11 amd formation starts with the exposure of sulphide minerals especially as bearing pyrite and or arsenopyrite to the air and water which subsequently conducts the oxidation of sulfide to sulfate and releases ferrous iron together with arsenic mainly as as iii eqs 1 5 12 13 as iii is much more toxic than as v and its concentration in severe amd has been reported as 0 35 12 15 g l 1 14 15 hence the efficient removal of high as iii in the amd like system is an urgent need 1 2fes 2 s 7o 2 aq 2h 2 o 2fe 2 aq 4so 4 2 aq 4h aq 2 4fe 2 aq o 2 aq 4h aq 4fe 3 aq 2h 2 o 3 fes 2 s 14 fe 3 aq 8h 2 o 15 fe 2 aq 2so 4

arsenic from amd 16 18 the reaction process via the increase of ph with different degrees mainly involves co precipitation of as iii and or as v with fe iii oxyhydroxides or hydroxysulfates including tooeleite or scorodite precipitation the mixture of as bearing ferrihydrite akageneite and schwertmannite 19 22 al iii as one of the main components of amd in many mining areas 23 25 can also contribute to as scavenging via sorption onto al iii oxides al iii fe iii hydroxides and al sulfoxyhydroxide e g basaluminite 22 26 27 previous studies have shown that the as adsorption capacity of al iii fe iii hydroxides involving surface charge and speciation of substrate hydroxides are strongly ph and fe al molar ratio dependent 27 29 arsenic in different valence states have different maximum adsorption at different ph values 27 29 the co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxide at fe al molar ratio of 1 can adsorb 20 70 of the initially added as iii with an increase of ph from 3 to 7 whereas its adsorption capacity decreases to 50 with continuously increasing the ph to 11 27 all as v can be adsorbed on co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxide at ph 3 7 the reduced retention of both as v at ph 7 and as iii at ph 9 by co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxide or fe iii hydroxide are likely due to the increased electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged arsenic and the substrate surface 27 30 although as iii is known to exhibit higher adsorption affinity to fe iii hydroxide than as v under alkaline conditions 31 the fe al molar ratio under the same initial arsenic concentration is also important to remove as as iii retention drops to 20 30 with decreasing the fe al molar ratio from 4 to 1 and the as iii adsorption by al iii hydroxide is negligible the decrease of ferrihydrite content and the accumulating formation of crystalline aluminum hydroxides e g bayerite and gibbsite with decreasing the fe al molar ratio could be responsible for the weaker affinity for as iii 27 32 the amount of as v adsorption on al iii fe iii hydroxide at fe al molar ratios of 1 4 are simliar which is twice more than that on al iii hydroxide 27 therefore the changes of as species and solid products significantly impact the as removal efficiency in the fe iii al iii as iii v system different as species and mineral phases are commonly observed duing the abiotic oxidation of fe ii and as iii to fe iii and as v which is an important pathway during the amd treatment 20 33 34 abiotic oxidation of fe ii and as iii can be induced by reactive oxygen species ros involving fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 for 93 5 as removal efficiency within 4 h under aeration condition 20 for as rich amd containing high mn ii or flowing through karst areas almost complete abiotic oxidation of fe ii and as iii has been accomplished as of late using a combination process of fenton like and catalytic mn ii oxidation or enhanced fenton like technology with carbonate continuous dissolution 35 36 as v bearing fe iii oxyhydroxides i e six line ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and hematite are produced in 0 25 2 h contributing to 100 as immobilization 35 36 however little is known about the possible role of al iii on as removal in amd during the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii and as iii to as v thus representing an important research gap accordingly we have assessed the influence of al iii cation on scavenging of high as iii from amd at various ph values and fe al as molar ratios in the key oxygen induced oxidation process of fe ii and as iii under high temperature heating as a limiting condition is that the increase of temperature is conducive to remove more as and obtain more stable solids in fe as mn systems described previously 35 moreover the temperature of some mines in the early days from ore mining is above 50 c in the subsurface 37 the main objectives of this work are 1 to investigate the effects of the co existence of al iii on the as removal and oxidation and 2 to probe the underlying mechanism the results obtained in this work can provide mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the sequestration of as during oxygen induced treatment of as rich amd furthermore the as leaching stability of solid products dependent on the solid species obtained in this work can help to predict the risk of secondary as pollution and the fate of as in amd 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of amd the fe as al s solution in this work was used to clearly understand the influence of al iii cation on as behaviors feso4 7h2o naaso2 and al2 so4 3 18h2o were separately dissolved in dilute sulfuric acid at ph 1 for fe ii as iii and al iii stock solutions the above three solutions were mixed to simulate actual al containing as rich amd with initial fe as and al concentrations of 2 24 8 96 g l 1 1 5 g l 1 and 0 54 g l 1 which were within the known severe amd limitations of 1 20 4 g l 1 fe 0 35 12 15 g l 1 as and 0 22 6 68 g l 1 al respectively 15 19 23 24 37 38 2 2 as removal from as rich amd in the co existence of al iii the experimental set up mainly consisted of a polytetrafluoroethylene reactor 250 ml sealed by rubber stoppers provided with a heating water bath circulating device fig s1 all reactions started with the fast addition of naoh solution into the tested amd for desired ph values and each initial system was 200 ml the oxygen flow rate and temperature were separately maintained at 1 6 l min 1 and 95 c over the course of the reactions to investigate the effect of ph on as removal the ph values of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii were adjusted to 3 5 7 and 9 at a fixed fe al as molar ratio 8 1 1 for considering the effect of fe al as ratio on as removal the initial fe al as molar ratios of the tested amd were set to 0 1 1 2 1 1 4 1 1 and 8 1 1 at a fixed ph value ph 5 aliquots of produced suspensions were taken at regular time intervals 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 4 h 6 h 8 h and filtered using 0 22 μm membranes residual solids were digested via 6 mol l 1 hydrochloric acid the concentrations of as t as iii total fe fe t fe ii and al iii of all samples were measured additionally the concentration of as v was calculated by the concentration difference between as t and as iii all as removal experiments were conducted in duplicates and each sample was measured three times for parallel samples analysis q value test involving 6 sample data n 6 was used for the trade offs of doubtable value and the averages standard error was finally reported all the samples were analyzed in an accredited lab an affiliate of key laboratory of pollution ecology and environmental engineering chinese academy of sciences to focus on the role of co existent al iii cation on as behaviors the controlled trials were performed with the object of as rich amd in simple fe as s system 2 3 reference materials the species of solid products fe and or fe as phase were identified by comparison with reference materials including natrojarosite schwertannite amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate tooeleite ferric arsenate as bearing six line and two line ferrihydrite which were synthesized via the methods described previously 20 39 40 41 the al iii as v precipitate and as containing aluminum hydr oxide references used in this work included amorphous aluminum arsenate as iii bearing aluminum hydroxide and as v bearing aluminum hydroxide amorphous aluminum arsenate was synthesized following the procedure described previously 42 briefly al iii and as v solutions were prepared separately by dissolving al no3 3 9h2o and na3aso4 12h2o in di water and adjusted to ph 2 7 using 1 0 mol l 1 hno3 0 1 mol l 1 as v solution was titrated by 0 1 mol l 1 al iii solution under mechanical stirring 250 rpm and the ph value was maintained at ph 2 7 by the addition of 1 0 mol l 1 naoh solution for 1 h to form amorphous aluminum arsenate as iii bearing and as v bearing aluminum hydroxides were synthesized according to the conventional method for aluminum hydroxide 43 modified by introducing as iii and as v respectively aluminum hydroxide was prepared by neutralization of 1 0 mol l 1 al iii solution al2 so4 3 18h2o using 1 0 mol l 1 naoh to ph 7 0 under mechanical stirring the resulted aluminum hydroxide precipitate was separated by centrifugation to remove excess electrolytes and resuspended in as iii and as v solutions at al as molar ratio of 8 pre adjusted to ph 5 the mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for 24 h with mechanical stirring at ph 5 for both as iii bearing and as v bearing aluminum hydroxides 2 4 chemical analyses and solid phase characterization as iii and as t concentrations were detected by an afs 2202e hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer using different carrier solutions 0 5 mol l 1 ph 5 citrate buffer vs 5 hcl solution with the detection limit of 0 1 μg l 1 and the margins of error of 2 to determine the as t concentration the reduction of all arsenic to as iii by 5 of thiourea ascorbic acid agent occurred prior to hydride generation 43 the concentrations of fe ii fe t and al iii were analyzed via a 2550 uv vis spectrophotometer an aa240 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer and a 5100 svdv inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer with the same detection limit of 0 1 mg l 1 and the margins of error of 2 respectively the ferrozine method was introduced for determination of fe ii which involved the complexation of fe ii with 1 10 phenanthroline in the presence of ammonium acetate acetic acid at 510 nm 44 solid products with the morphology elemental distribution mineralogical compositions and functional groups were obtained by a quanta 250 scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectrometer microprobe sem eds a d max 2000pc x ray diffractometer xrd and a nicolet 6700 fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir respectively the sem eds images were collected under high vacuum at 30 kv with the magnification of 5000 times the test condition of x ray diffraction patterns contained the usage of cuka1 radiation in continuous scan mode within 5 80 or 10 80 2θ range with a step size of 0 02 2θ at 56 kv and 182 ma the ftir spectra were recorded by 128 co added scans in the 400 4000 cm 1 range with a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 2 5 tclp test toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp us epa method 1311 as a performance indicator was employed to analyze short term stability of final solids in term of leaching concentrations of as iii and as t each solid sample was added into the acetate buffer solution the liquid solid ratio ml g of 20 1 with the agitation of 30 2 rpm at 23 2 c the extracted solution at ph 4 93 0 05 was prepared by mixing 5 7 ml of glacial acetic 64 3 ml of 1 mol l 1 naoh with 930 ml of di water after the 18 2 h reaction the mixture was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for each test sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of as the removal efficiency of as at different ph values and fe al as molar ratios during abiotic oxidation reactions of fe ii and as iii from as rich amd containing al iii was illustrated in fig 1 a c ph was very important to remove as including its equilibrium time and efficiency arsenic was rapidly removed upon contacting amd with oxygen and all the reactions finished in 6 h which was shortened to 1 h as the ph increased from 3 to 9 after 8 h reactions the removal efficiencies of as increased from 92 3 to 99 8 with the increase of ph from 3 to 7 but slightly diminished to 99 5 with increasing continuously the ph to 9 fe al as molar ratio in terms of fe concentration at constant contents of al and as played a key role in as removal efficiency there was a marked increase in removal efficiency from 95 3 to 99 6 with the increase of fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 at the end of this experiment however the reaction equilibrium time maintained in 4 h regardless of the increased initial fe concentration only 0 8 of as was removed in the al as system without fe indicating the presence of fe as the main cause for as immobilization it can be seen by comparing fig 1 a c with b d that the oxygen induced abiotic oxidation treatment of as rich amd containing and excluding al iii followed similar trends of as removal efficiency with respect to ph and fe al as molar ratio the removal efficiencies of as in the fe as systems with the levels of 92 6 99 9 were roughly equal to those in the fe al as systems this result indicated that co existent al iii in as rich amd had little influence on the removal of as over the course of abiotic oxidation reaction of fe ii and as iii in the presence of oxygen on the contrary some recent studies found that as iii adsorption maximum decreased with increasing al fe molar ratio in co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxides 27 32 this was likely due to the partial oxidation of as iii to as v and different reaction products for as fixation on the basis of available literatures more as v was loaded on al bearing ferrihydrite or fe iii al iii as v co precipitates than al free fe iii hydroxides 45 46 3 2 as oxidation and its species in aqueous and solid phases fig 2 a c showed the effect of ph and fe al as molar ratio on the percentages of as oxidized and remaining after 8 h oxygen induced abiotic oxidation of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii ph had a remarkable contribution to the oxidation of as iii to as v the percentage of as oxidized increased from 41 6 to 67 8 maximum with the increase of ph from 3 to 5 and then showed a downward trend as ph continued to increase involving that 59 7 and 40 2 of as iii were oxidized to as v at ph 7 and 9 respectively the fe al as molar ratio also had a major impact on as iii oxidation the percentage of as oxidized 0 1 67 8 generally increased as the fe al as molar ratio increased from 0 1 1 to 8 1 1 little as iii was oxidized to as v at the fe al as molar ratio of 0 1 1 because fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 could not occur for ros formation the oxidation degree of as iii reached 55 1 at the fe al as molar ratio of 2 1 1 which was slightly higher than that 51 4 at the fe al as molar ratio of 4 1 1 therefore the optimal conditions for as iii oxidation were ph 5 and fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 in this work the percentages of as oxidized and remaining as affected by ph and fe as molar ratio after the oxygen induced abiotic oxidation of as rich amd in the absence of al iii as the control trial were presented in fig 2 b d the trend of as iii oxidation in al iii free amd was similar to that in al iii bearing amd as a fuction of ph values while the percentages of as oxidized at the fe as molar ratio of 2 1 to 8 1 in aqueous fe as systems 30 2 62 9 were considerably lower than those 51 4 67 8 in aqueous fe al as systems these results indicated that the presence of al iii was in favor of as iii oxidation during abiotic oxidation reactions of as rich amd with oxygen furthermore the maximum as iii oxidation was observed at the fe as molar ratio of 8 1 in as rich amd with or without al iii by contrast to the concentrations of as iii and as v as a function of time in as rich amd with and without al iii fig s2 arsenic distribution between solutions and solids was little affected by co existent al iii after 8 h reactions only 0 1 7 7 of as t remained in solution with and without al iii under all conditions used in this work except that 99 2 of as t was retained in aqueous phases at the fe al as molar ratio of 0 1 1 aqueous arsenic still existed in the as iii form hence al iii hydr oxides showed very weak affinity for arsenite in the system without fe according to rapid hydrolysis of al iii fig s3 in the fe containing systems almost all of produced as v was immobilized by solids however the percentages of as remaining at ph 3 were higher than those at other ph values this could be attributed to insufficient fe iii or fe iii oxyhydr oxides for as immobilization at ph 3 where 25 33 of fe t still remained in the form of fe ii in aqueous phases fig s4 3 3 solid phase characterization 3 3 1 sem eds fig 3 and fig s5 exhibited the morphology of solid products at various ph values and fe al as molar ratios after 8 h oxygen induced reaction of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii together with the analyses for the fe al as molar ratios by eds all final solids existed as irregular shaped agglomerates indicating the amorphous nature this observation was in agreement with those after the same treatment of as rich amd without al iii or with mn ii reported previously 20 35 it could be that fe ii and or as iii continued to be separately oxidized to fe iii and or as v simultaneously accompanied by their different distributions between solutions and solids hence inhibiting the formation of regular shaped particles in micrometer size as indicated by sem eds the molar ratios among fe al and as in final solids under all conditions used in this work after the reactions differed from that 8 1 1 in the initial as rich amd table s1 this was also inconsistent with previously reported results in as rich amd without al iii or with mn ii that the comparable fe as or fe mn as molar ratio was observed at the beginning and the end of reactions 20 35 it was reasonably attributed to a random distribution of co precipitated al iii fe iii hydr oxides unlike iron oxy hydroxides catalytic oxidation of mn ii to mn iii iv followed by mn iii iv oxides sorption on their surfaces 35 47 at ph 3 the fe as and al as molar ratios of the final solid detected by eds were 6 and 0 7 respectively which accorded with the chemical analysis results but were both lower than the initial molar ratios it could be explained by the slow oxidation rate of fe ii to fe iii 19 20 and weak hydroysis of al iii at ph 3 48 higher fe as molar ratios 9 0 14 4 at ph 5 9 detected by eds were attributed to the al iii competition with fe iii for as v corresponding to complete hydrolysis of al iii at ph 5 and a maximum as v adsorption on al iii hydroxide at ph 4 4 5 32 49 3 3 2 xrd the xrd patterns of final solids after 8 h abiotic oxidation reactions of as rich amd containing al iii as affected by ph and fe al as molar ratio were characterized in fig 4 different features of final solids on the xrd patterns were obtained at different ph the reaction product at ph 3 displayed intense and sharp characteristic xrd peaks at the positions similar to those of natrojarosite pdf 36 0425 and some amorphous features with increasing the ph to 5 and 7 two broader xrd bands of solid products at 35 6 36 and 62 8 63 2θ better matched with those of as bearing ferrihydrite for the solid at ph 9 six bands on its xrd patterns 34 40 46 53 61 and 63 2θ were more accordant with those of as bearing six line ferrihydrite or schwertannite the xrd patterns of solid products changed markedly at various fe al as molar ratios in terms of fe content the weak bands at 35 6 36 and 62 63 2θ became broader and shifted towards that of amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate on the xrd patterns with the decrease of fe al as from 8 1 1 to 2 1 1 indicating an increased proportion of ferric arsenite or arsenate in the fe free system the characteristic xrd bands of the reaction product mainly had the features of aluminum hydroxide at 18 and 42 2θ the co existence of al iii in fe ii as iii solutions upon exposure to oxygen had a substantial influence on species of final solids through the comparison of the xrd patterns fig 4 and fig s6 the xrd patterns of the solids consisted of the diffraction peaks of well characterized six line ferrihydrite under all conditions used in this work with the exception of the fe as molar ratio of 2 1 in al iii free systems it indicated that the existence of al iii had negative influence on the crystallinity degree of ferrihydrite which was similar to the observation as previously reported 33 3 3 3 ftir the infrared spectra of reaction products after the abiotic oxidation of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii at various ph values and fe al as molar ratios were displayed in fig 5 during the 0 5 2 h reaction at ph 3 the infrared bands of the solid product at 512 620 806 983 1097 and 3207 cm 1 were located at similar positions to those of tooeleite involving lattice feoh mode ν4 so4 as iii o stretching vibration ν1 so4 ν3 so4 and oh stretching mode of absorbed h2o the ftir bands of the solid product at 466 501 625 821 1004 1089 1178 1629 and 3355 cm 1 subsequently occurred fig s7c which was reasonably ascribed to those of as v bearing natrojarosite involving ν2 so4 feo stretching vibration and ν4 so4 as v o stretching vibration ν1 so4 2ν3 so4 h2o bending and oh stretching modes 50 these results suggested the transformation from tooeleite to as v bearing natrojarosite and amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate for both as v and as iii retention as iii bearing natrojarosite could be ruled out due to its weak affinity for as iii 51 at other ph values the infrared bands of final solids at 451 567 582 701 cm 1 were located at the similar positions involving feoh mode of as v bearing ferrihydrite ν4 so4 bending mode of as iii bearing ferrihydrite and feo stretching vibration of schwertannite with the increase of ph from 5 to 9 the ν3 so4 band of the solid at 1116 cm 1 gradually disappeared and the as v o band position shifted towards as iii o stretching vibration from 808 to 796 cm 1 indicating a decrease of so4 ii content and an increase of as iii in solids additionally the infrared absorption bands of final solids at 447 489 597 605 808 826 1113 1635 and 3396 3417 cm 1 under the fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 were ascribed to lattice fe oh mode ν4 so4 mode aso stretching vibration h2o bending and oh stretching modes respectively the characteristic ν4 so4 band of reaction products shifted from 597 to 605 cm 1 and simultaneously the high frequency aso band increased from 808 to 826 cm 1 as the fe al as molar ratio decreased it indicated that the final solids could be gradually dominated by amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate rather than as iii v bearing ferrihydrite as the content of fe decreased in the fe free system at al as molar ratio of 1 the infrared spectrum of the final solid corresponded to that of aluminum hydroxide a comparison of infrared spectra of reaction products after oxygen induced abiotic oxidation of as rich amd with al iii and without al iii fig s7 clearly showed that the speciation of as in solid phases could be controlled by the presence of al iii the aso stretching vibration bands of solids containing al iii under all conditions became closer to as v o band position indicating that al iii in fe ii as iii solutions with oxygen facilitated the oxidation of as iii to as v 3 4 stability evaluation fig 6 showed the tclp test results of final solids over the abiotic oxidation course of as rich amd in the co existence of al iii at ph 5 and the fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 the leaching concentration of as t was 4 8 mg l 1 which passed the standard epa tclp test limit of 5 mg l 1 as however in other conditions as t leaching concentrations between 6 8 and 57 1 mg l 1 exceeded the regulatory as limit it was very likely due to the oxidation degree of as iii to as v in addition the lowest as iii leaching concentration occurred at ph 5 and fe al as molar ratio of 8 1 1 hence suggesting this condition as the optimum for the short term storage of disposed fe al as solids in the environment as iii was the main form of as in leachate under all conditions used in this work except ph 5 and 9 indicating that the as leaching stability of final solids mainly depended on the as iii containing solid products the leaching concentration of as iii 25 5 mg l 1 at ph 3 was far higher than those 1 4 5 2 mg l 1 at other ph this was consistent with the observation of amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate under the fe as molar ratio 2 at ph 3 which was more as leaching unstable than as iii bearing ferrihydrite under the fe as molar ratio of 8 at other ph values 52 the level of as iii leaching decreased from 27 4 mg l 1 to 1 4 mg l 1 with increasing the fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 this indicated that as iii fixation on ferrihydrite was stronger than that by amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate with increasing the fe al as molar ratio the reason for the higher level of as leaching in the al containing solid at ph 3 was that aluminum hydroxide had higher solubility than ferric hydroxide hence limiting as retention 53 at ph 5 the presence of al iii had little effect on the leaching stability of the final solid however compared to the al free final solids al containing solid products under other conditions had lower as leaching concentrations via the tclp test this indicated that the existence of al iii was likely to improve the leaching stability of reaction products it could be explained that produced al iii hydr oxides probably existed as coating materials decreasing the as leaching concentraitons 54 55 3 5 mechanism discussion the oxidation efficiencies of as iii as affected by ph and fe al as molar ratio depended on the content of available ros produced ros as the oxidizers including o2 h2o2 and ho for fe ii and as iii oxidation during the fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 was identified fig s8 and the reactions could be written as eqs s1 s7 which was similar to that in the fe as systems 20 the stronger characteristic uv peak of products of ros with the scavengers indicated the formation of more ros for more as iii oxidation efficiency in aqueous phases with increasing the ph from 3 to 5 and the fe al as molar ratios from 2 1 1 4 1 1 to 8 1 1 these could be due to the higher fenton like reaction rate 56 and absolutely sufficient fe supply however chemical analysis fig s4 and ftir results fig s7 suggested that the fenton like reaction at neutral to alkaline ph was very likely to occur on the surfaces of fe ii iii oxides rather than in solutions the decrease of as iii oxidized could be because a significant amount of produced ros was directly consumed during the transformation fe ii iii oxides to fe iii hydr oxides 57 70 100 of fe ii and 40 2 67 8 of as iii oxidation from as rich amd containing al iii under oxygen exposure achieved a general increase of removal efficiency of as 92 3 99 8 in 1 4 h with increasing the ph from 3 to 9 and the fe al as molar ratios from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 different oxidation degrees of fe ii to fe iii and as iii to as v for different solid products associated with different species of as at different ph and fe al as molar ratios were very important to as removal as iii removal is still significant via the co precipitation of as iii with fe iii during the reactions the solid phase characterization with thermodynamic calculations fig 4 and table s2 indicated the presence of as v bearing natrojarosite at ph 3 the disappearance of amorphous ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate at ph 9 and the formation of aluminum hydr oxide schwertannite two line and six line ferrihydrite for as immobilization in all fe containing systems however as the ph and fe al as molar ratio increased the decreased fraction of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate with the increased fraction of nanoscale ferrihydrite were responsible for an increased arsenic retention via adsorption or incorporation which were comfirmed by the decreased average particle size of solids and the increase of the bet surface area and pore volume of solids fig s9 and table s3 the increased transformation rate of fe iii as iii v co precipitate to as bearing ferrihydrite with increasing the ph and fe as molar ratio in line with those reported in the literatures 20 35 58 59 was reasonably attributed to the high solubility of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate and ferric arsenate at high ph 58 60 and or excessive fe supply zeta potential distributions of the solid products fig s10 indicated that uncharged arsenite h3aso3 adsorption was less favorable than negatively charged arsenate species h2aso4 adsorption on positively charged substrates at ph 3 and 5 whereas h3aso3 was retained more than haso4 2 and or h2aso4 by the solids with negative surface charge at ph 7 and 9 this observation corresponded to the increase of as iii as v ratio with increasing the ph from 5 to 7 resulting in 99 5 of as removal at high ph at ph 3 the relatively lower as removal efficiency could be attributed to the less formation of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate for as iii fixation corresponding to the lower fe ii oxidation and the formation of natrojarosite co existent al iii was conducive to the as iii oxidation via fenton like reaction of fe ii and o2 at ph 5 and the fe al as molar ratios of 2 8 1 1 in contrast to the fe as systems with and without al iii it could be explained that the formation of al iii hydroxide retarded 20 of as iii in association with fe iii or fe iii hydr oxides according to as iii remaining in solutions within the first 0 5 h reaction fig s2 conversely promoting as iii oxidation with produced ros in solutions additionally co existent al iii was independent of as removal by the comparison of al containing and al free fe ii as iii systems during the oxidation process of fe ii and as iii this was different from the conventional understanding that as iii was considerably less adsorbed on co precipitated al iii fe iii hydroxides than fe iii hydroxides 27 61 it was very likely to due to the formation of multiple solid products contributing to the similar as immobilization however the species of solid products could be controlled by co existent al iii al iii induced formation of natrojarosite rather than ferrihydrite at ph 3 could be because that the strong binding between al iii and the oxygen donor atoms of functional oh groups of iron hydr oxides at ph 3 4 inhibited the fe iii hydrolysis for the formation of ferrihydrite 62 63 at other conditions the xrd results showed that the crystallinity of ferrihydrite decreased by the co existent al iii this was similar that the presence of al iii retarded the iron hydroxides transformation to more crystalline phases 61 being reasonably attributed to al iii partial substitution for fe iii in iron hydroxides 63 65 4 conclusions the effects of co existent al iii on the as removal and oxidation during the oxygen induced treatment of as rich amd was investigated in this study al iii had little influence on as removal but facilitated as iii oxidation in contrast to the fe as systems with and without al iii this oxidation mechanism involved the delay in the co precipitation process of fe iii or fe iii hydr oxides with 20 of as iii due to the weak affinity between al iii hydroxide and as iii promoting more aqueous as iii oxidation with ros via the fenton like reaction between fe ii and o2 the sequestration of as being solid species dependent was controlled by ph and fe al as molar ratio 70 100 of fe ii and 40 2 67 8 of as iii oxidation caused 92 3 99 8 of as removal which increased with increasing the ph from 3 to 9 and fe al as molar ratio from 2 1 1 to 8 1 1 the mixture of ferric arsenite hydroxysulfate ferric arsenate as bearing ferrihydrite and as bearing schwertannite was mainly responsible for as immobilization as the removal mechanism the condition for the safe solid storage was only at ph 5 and fe al as molar ratios of 8 1 1 this finding has achieved the ex situ as treatment of as iii al iii rich amd however there is still much work to be done on the in situ amd remediation for the minimization of disposal costs and the understanding of environmental geochemical process of as declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no

13303,in this research visible light active perovskite photocatalyst lanthanum orthoferrite lfo and floating photocatalyst composites namely lfo expanded perlite ep and lfo modified ep mep were successfully synthesized for ammonia degradation sodium hydroxide was used to modify ep as it could transform the structure of ep into a mesoporous structure thereby increasing the surface attachment of lfo and improving contact with ammonia the characterization of ep mep lfo ep and lfo mep composites was performed using uv vis xrd bet surface area ftir sem fesem and zeta potential photocatalytic degradation of ammonia was studied and lfo mep showed the best performance the optimal operational parameters for degrading ammonia using lfo mep were the catalytic dosage of 8 g l 1 the initial ammonia concentration of 10 ppm and the ph of the reaction medium of 8 with the maximum ammonia degradation efficiency of 45 7 a reusability study of lfo mep composite on the photocatalytic degradation of ammonia was performed for 3 cycles where the composite demonstrated high stability the reaction rate constant k was 0 0079 min 1 the kinetic data was 10 08 μmol g catalyst h and the quantum yield was 6 686 10 6 molecules photon the floatable photocatalyst lfo mep composite can be an effective method for the photodegradation of ammonia the photocatalyst could be easily recovered and is reusable for several cycles of treatment the reaction occurs at ambient conditions under visible light and there is limited by product production with the nitrate and nitrite ions of 0 48 and 0 0024 ppm respectively these properties demonstrated that the proposed method is an environmentally friendly method for removing ammonia from water keywords ammonia nitrate ion nitrite ion perlite photocatalyst 1 introduction ammonia is one of the predominant indicators for the quality of water resources it is colorless and creates an unpleasant odor and taste in drinking water ammonia also reacts with chlorine to generate harmful by products during disinfection facilitates bacterial growth and biofilm formation through the reaction with nitrifying organisms and produces toxic nitrite contents in an ascending manner when nitrification is incomplete which endangers human wellness and the environment in an aqueous solution ammonia molecules nh3 exist in equilibrium with ammonium ions nh4 this equilibrium shift is based on the influence of temperature and ph value 1 chlorination and biological treatment could remove ammonia from the treated water but chlorination requires a high chlorine dosage whereas biological treatment requires cell culture and a controlled environment to perform excellently adsorption and ion exchange remove ammonia from the treated water but ammonia becomes concentrated in the waste stream 2 to conclude it is difficult to completely remove ammonia through these conventional water treatment methods in the past decades researchers have made efforts in developing fresh and novel ideas in advanced water treatment processes including ozonolysis 3 membrane filtration 4 and adsorption 5 different types of resin and zeolite were tested for their adsorption efficiency in removing ammonia from synthetic and real wastewater where acidic resins e g dowex 50wx8 50 100 and lewatit monoplus s 108h demonstrated a high affinity to ammonia and could readily adsorb 95 ammonia in 10 min whereas zeolite took a long time to entirely remove ammonia from wastewater this difference is due to the presence of cation and anion that compete with ammonia to be absorbed into the zeolite 6 biological treatment can also remove ammonia more efficiently a moving bed biofilm reactor was studied to remove ammonia at 1000 ppm where a combination of nitrifying bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrospira and nitrobacter and denitrifying bacteria e g comamonas olb8 and rhodanobacter was used in ammonia oxidation in a sequencing batch reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor and the respective removal efficiency was 94 100 and 72 100 7 the technologies described above are expensive to operate even though they are effective in removing ammonia the adsorption process requires regeneration with brine water before it can be used for the subsequent treatment 8 the biological process requires careful adjustment to the bacterial environment to perform nitrifying and denitrifying processes as this approach is very sensitive to ph nutrient and oxygen levels 9 photocatalytic technology is another recent effective method that can potentially remove ammonia the technology is easy to operate has a low energy cost and does not produce secondary solid waste like sludge 10 11 a photocatalytic reaction is a surface reaction therefore photocatalysts must receive sufficient solar radiation on the surface to achieve an optimum reaction most photocatalytic reactions are in suspension mode where a submerged light tube is required and the photocatalyst is dispersed in an aqueous medium and mixed well with the pollutant to achieve a desirable photodegradation rate 12 recent research focuses on finding photocatalyst materials and composites to degrade ammonia in suspension mode a nanosized photocatalyst znfe2o4 ac was applied for simultaneous removal of 50 ppm of nitrite and 100 ppm of ammonia under ultraviolet visible uv vis light irradiation and achieved an efficiency of 92 7 13 p25 and flame spray pyrolysis fps synthesized tio2 were studied for selective oxidation of ammonia under uv irradiation in a semi batch reactor and it was found that p25 and fps preferred to operate at ph 11 5 and 4 8 respectively although photocatalytic ammonia degradation was inefficient the method had high selectivity toward nitrogen as a product compared to nitrate and nitrite ions moreover co catalysts such as ag au pt and pd were added in the process subsequently p25 showed increased selectivity toward nitrate and nitrite ions whereas fsp with co catalysts demonstrated increased selectivity toward nitrogen gas 14 cds tnt composite synthesized using microwave hydrothermal method was found to degrade 52 3 of aqueous ammonia under uv irradiation which achieved higher efficiency compared to cds and tnt alone 15 however in the case of sunlight that shines from the top of the water surface and not from the submerged light tube the light will be refracted as it goes into the medium hence less radiation is received by the photocatalyst this condition causes an unachievable maximum photodegradation rate in addition these nanoparticles tend to agglomerate settle or suspend in the solution and are hard to separate thus the nanoparticles are wasted in the waste stream the nanoparticle sized photocatalyst needs membrane filtration for recovery purposes and involves high investment costs 11 to account for this issue floatable photocatalysts are an interesting option the immobilization of photocatalysts onto floatable support manages to maximize oxygenation and solar irradiation as the photocatalysts are localized between the interface of water and air this characteristic improves the oxidation efficiency and radical generation rate which is in line with the fundamentals of contaminant photodegradation 16 furthermore the photocatalysts are easier to separate which further increases reusability and flexibility in particular all these reasons highlight the significance of the floating photocatalyst over non floating ones a floatable photocatalyst synthesized by coating fe n tio2 on floating fly ash cenospheres supported layer by layer carbonized chitosan could degrade 93 1 of rhodamine b under visible light for 240 min 17 the floating photocatalyst b n tio2 expanded perlite ep degraded rhodamine b under uv light irradiation with a degradation efficiency of 93 8 18 meanwhile cufeo2 coated onto ep could degrade 99 0 of methylene blue within 30 min 19 lanthanum orthoferrite lfo is a type of perovskite with variable cation oxidation state lattice oxygen mobility and thermal chemical and structural stability the material is a visible light active photocatalyst with the ability to remove waste such as rhodamine b 20 methylene blue 21 diclofenac 22 and sulfamethoxazole 23 a foreign cation can substitute a and b positions which gives a way of modifying the oxidation state and oxygen vacancy of the perovskite allowing specific design properties different preparation methods of perovskite can produce different crystal structures surface morphologies and textural structures allowing one to use the proper synthesis method to achieve the desired catalytic properties 24 the lfo synthesis method is important because the photocatalyst should have a high surface area and crystallinity to have high activity lfo with high crystallinity could be achieved by calcining at temperatures higher than 700 c but this approach would increase the particle size and reduce the surface area of the photocatalyst 25 26 gel combustion is a solution based process that uses an effective complexing agent e g citric acid to produce nanoparticles with a large surface area and strong crystallinity without very high temperature calcination 27 28 ep is a white porous and lightweight mineral produced from perlite a type of volcanic rock subjected to heat treatment at the temperature between 800 and 1200 c however the high temperature heat treatment causes a large reduction of the silanol group si oh on the surface of ep 29 hence ep has a lower adsorption capacity than unexpanded perlite 30 the surface hydroxyl group is important for a material to have a good adsorption property in order to increase the adsorption strength of ep chemical modification using sodium hydroxide naoh could increase the number of surface hydroxyl groups and induce the formation of mesoporous structures 31 this modification will enhance the adsorption strength and reduce the diffusion resistance into the pores of ep 32 hence modified ep mep would be an interesting floatable material for coating with lafeo3 to produce a visible light active photocatalyst composite this research aims to synthesize lfo using the gel combustion method and mep using naoh first the floatable photocatalyst composites i e lfo ep and lfo mep were synthesized then lfo lfo ep and lfo mep were applied in photocatalytic ammonia degradation to compare their efficiency and the degradation products were analyzed the operational parameters such as catalyst dosage initial concentration of ammonia and ph of the solution were studied after that the reusability of lfo mep in photocatalytic ammonia degradation was assessed to study the effect of repeated use on the degradation efficiency of lfo mep this novel photocatalyst was studied for ammonia removal under visible light and open conditions using the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and adsorption 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials citric

subsequently calcined at 600 c for 5 h at a rate of 5 c min the lfo powder was kept in a dark glass bottle and stored in a desiccator before characterization and performance testing 2 3 synthesis of mep ep 0 03 0 15 g cm3 was first screened using mesh size with the range of 2 36 3 36 mm washed thrice to remove dust and dirt and dried at 60 c overnight prior to modification then 5 g of the washed ep was added and stirred in 200 ml of 1 m naoh solution under reflux at 80 c for 3 h to obtain mep after that the mep was filtered and washed with distilled water until the ph of the filtrate was 7 before being dried in an oven at 60 c overnight the mep sample was stored in a desiccator for further use 2 4 synthesis of lfo ep and lfo mep composites 5 mmol of each la no3 3 6h2o and fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water then 20 mmol of c6h8o7 h2o was dissolved in the solution and the ph was adjusted to 7 using nh3 solution the solution was stirred at 60 c for 1 h next the solution was continuously stirred at 90 c until the volume of the solution was reduced to about one third after that 4 g of washed ep was added into the solution under continuous stirring and heating to allow the coating process with one fourth of the volume of the solution remained the heating process was continued without stirring until as burnt lfo ep was obtained the composite was subsequently calcined at 600 c for 5 h at a rate of 5 c min the sample was kept in a dark bottle and stored in a desiccator the procedures were repeated by substituting ep with mep to obtain lfo mep composite 2 5 characterization procedures the density of the lfo lfo ep and lfo mep were determined by calculating the sample mass per the occupied volume each weighed sample was immersed in distilled water with a temperature of 26 c the crystallinity of the synthesized samples was studied using a rigaku smartlab d max 2500 diffractometer japan with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at 40 kv and 30 ma the sample was scanned for a range of 2θ from 20 to 80 at a rate of 8 2551 min 1 the functional groups of the samples were studied using a jasco ftir spectrometer model 4600 japan with a wavelength scanning range of 4000 400 cm 1 surface analysis was carried out using micromeritics tristar ii 3020 ver 3 02 usa using nitrogen adsorption at 195 8 c the zeta potential analysis over the ph range of 1 14 by titration method was determined using malvern zetasizer pan analytical version 7 11 uk the morphology and surface element composition were evaluated by imaging and energy dispersive x ray edx analyses using a hitachi tm3000 scanning electron microscope sem japan and an su8000 field emission scanning electron microscope fesem at the respective accelerating voltage of 15 kv and 40 kv under vacuum the optical properties were analyzed using perkinelmer lambda 1050 uv vis nir spectrophotometer usa in the range of 800 200 cm 1 2 6 photocatalytic experiment 10 ppm of synthetic ammonia solution was prepared by diluting ammonia solution 25 in distilled water the initial ph of the synthetic ammonia solution was adjusted to 8 using 0 1 m naoh solution then 4 g l 1 of lfo was added into 50 ml of the synthetic ammonia solution and stirred for 1 h in the dark to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium next a 50 w led lamp was switched on to allow photodegradation of ammonia for 200 min upon completion 3 ml of the mixture was collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane syringe filter every 40 min into a glass vial the initial and final concentrations of residual ammonia in the sample were then recorded the experiment was repeated using 4 g l 1 of lfo ep and lfo mep composites the photocatalyst with the highest ammonia removal efficiency was selected for the experimental parameter study by manipulating the photocatalyst dosage 4 8 and 12 g l 1 initial ammonia concentration 10 20 and 30 ppm and initial ph 6 7 and 8 of the synthetic ammonia solution the reusability of the photocatalyst was studied by repeating the photodegradation experiment at optimum experimental conditions for 3 cycles for every cycle the photocatalyst sample was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight before performance testing 2 7 analytical procedures the concentration of ammonia in the synthetic solution was determined following the salicylate method method 10 031 0 1 ml of the filtered sample was added into amver high range ammonia test n tube followed by the addition of one sachet of ammonium salicylate and one sachet of ammonium cyanurate the solution was left for 20 min for a complete reaction the initial yellowish solution turned greenish after 20 min indicating the presence of ammonia in the sample and testing reagent the concentration was analyzed using a hach dr5000 spectrophotometer usa the nitrate and nitrite ion concentrations in the synthetic ammonia solution were evaluated using a perkinelmer lambda 1050 uv vis nir spectrophotometer usa the absorbance wavelength of nitrate and nitrite ions was measured in the range of 200 220 nm 13 33 and 354 nm 34 respectively the presence of nitrate and nitrite ions in the solution was detected using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 200 and 354 nm respectively stock solutions of 1 mm of potassium nitrate solution and 1 mm of sodium nitrite solution were prepared 0 05 0 5 ppm of potassium nitrate standard solution and 0 025 0 125 ppm of sodium nitrite standard solution were prepared using their respective stock solution these ranges of concentrations were used to construct the calibration curves for nitrate and nitrite ions the obtained equations were used to find the concentration of nitrate and nitrite ions whereby y is the absorbance determined using the uv vis spectrophotometer and x is the concentration of ion the r2 values showed that the curves are reasonably accurate to determine the concentration of nitrate and nitrite ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystallinity and functional group properties fig 1 a shows the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep synthesized using the gel combustion method and calcined at 600 c the xrd patterns of all samples have the characteristic of typical miller indices of lfo db card no 00 037 1493 101 121 220 202 240 242 and 204 which were observed at 2θ 22 6 32 1 39 6 46 1 52 0 57 3 and 76 6 respectively this finding proved that lfo was successfully synthesized the xrd patterns also show high intensity peaks implying the high crystallinity of the as prepared lfo lfo ep and lfo mep 35 the resulting crystallite size of lfo 24 9 nm which was determined by the scherrer formula decreased slightly when coated onto ep and mep 23 0 nm these results indicate the insignificant changes in the crystallinity properties of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep fig 1 b presents the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep all three ftir spectra have a peak at 555 cm 1 which corresponds to feo stretching vibration implying the characteristic of feo6 octahedron in lafeo3 36 the peaks at 3680 cm 1 for lfo and 3640 cm 1 for lfo ep and lfo mep are the oh stretching of surface hydroxyl group la oh 37 the peak at 3400 cm 1 for lfo is attributed to the surface absorbed water molecule or surface hydroxyl group 20 the peak at 1014 cm 1 corresponds to the si o si symmetric stretching mode 38 meanwhile the peak at 789 cm 1 is attributed to the si o si bending mode 39 the peaks at 1450 1640 2040 and 2160 cm 1 are ch rocking and bending modes attributed to the citric acid residue present in the sample 38 the ftir results confirmed that lfo was successfully synthesized some residuals of citric acid are present on the surface of the photocatalyst the detected ftir peaks of the surface oh bond have weak intensity indicating the reduced amount of surface hydroxyl group due to the calcination of the photocatalyst for a long time 3 2 surface analysis fig 2 a c show the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of lfo lfo ep and lfp mep the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of lfo shows that it has a type iii isotherm according to iupac classification which means that lfo has poor adsorbate adsorbent interaction and is non porous or macroporous in nature 36 40 lfo has a brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of 13 6 m2 g 1 the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of lfo ep and lfo mep was identified as a type iv isotherm according to iupac classification in comparison lfo ep has a small type h4 hysteresis loop at p po of 0 8 1 0 as seen in fig 2 b and lfo mep has a small type h4 hysteresis loop at 0 7 1 0 as shown in fig 2 c suggesting that both are mesoporous materials with narrow slit pores that allow multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation to occur 41 44 lfo ep and lfo mep have bet surface areas of 7 1 and 9 6 m2 g 1 respectively thus coating lafeo3 onto mep would produce a larger surface area than unmodified ep fig 2 d presents the pore distribution of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep that enables the analysis of the available form of the porous structure of a specific photocatalyst micropores have a pore diameter below 2 nm mesopores have a pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm and macropores have a pore diameter larger than 50 nm 40 lfo lfo ep and lfo mep have pore distributions of 2 2 211 3 nm 2 1 128 8 nm and 2 0 141 7 nm respectively it could be deduced that lfo has a pore distribution that largely consists of macropores which are more than 50 nm in pore diameter lfo ep and lfo mep also have pore distribution in the macropore region but they have higher pore distribution in the mesopore region which is between 2 and 50 nm in pore diameter table 1 lists the summary of pore diameter cumulative pore surface area bjhsa ad and cumulative pore volume bjhv ad of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep the decreasing order could be written as lfo lfo mep lfo ep lfo has the highest value in all characteristics as it is in powder form even though lfo ep and lfo mep are in solid form with size in the range of 2 4 3 4 mm their characteristics are comparable to lfo as the pore diameter pore surface area and pore volume of lfo ep and lfo mep are near to lfo moreover lfo mep has a larger size surface area and volume than lfo ep indicating that mep with naoh has improved properties compared to the unmodified one it could be seen that as lfo was coated onto ep resulting in decreased cumulative surface area and cumulative volume this result is due to the accumulation of lfo particles on the wall of ep after impregnation a similar observation of reduced pore surface area and volume of composites was reported in coating lafeo3 onto sba 5 natural zeolite and montmorillonite 21 45 46 3 3 surface charge properties fig 3 presents the zeta potential of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep over a ph range from 1 to 14 the value of zeta potential could determine the surface charge of the photocatalyst at that particular ph value phiso is the ph where the photocatalyst has an isoelectric charge which is equal to 0 mv the phiso also represents the point at which the change of surface charge of the photocatalyst from positive charge to negative charge occurred as seen in fig 3 the zeta potential of lfo determined that it was not soluble in a solution and the particles were vulnerable to agglomeration due to its smaller zeta potential in suspension 28 6 mv than the norm for relatively stable particulate suspension 30 and 30 mv 47 the phiso values of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep are 1 78 4 05 and 2 96 respectively azeez et al 2018 studied the effect of surface charge of titania nanoparticles synthesized at ph 1 6 7 and 10 on the degradation of methylene blue the electrostatic surface charge assisted the adsorption of methylene blue to the surface of titania for photocatalytic reaction titania synthesized at ph 10 had a strong negative charge and achieved the highest rate of reaction whereas titania synthesized at ph 1 6 had the lowest rate of reaction due to electrostatic repulsion the surface charge of the photocatalyst is important in a surface reaction as it increases the attraction between the reactant and the photocatalyst as seen in fig 3 when the surface charge exceeded the phiso lfo lfo ep and lfo mep were negatively charged and might attract polar ammonia molecules 3 4 morphological properties fig 4 a depicts the sem image of ep at 600 magnification it can be seen that ep has a porous structure with different pore sizes fig 4 b presents the sem image of mep at 600 magnification after naoh treatment the structure of ep became more porous from fig 4 c an image taken at 20 000 magnification lfo was distributed evenly onto the surface of mep fig 4 d shows the image taken at 120 000 magnification where lfo was coated on mep in a mixture of circular and irregular forms the development of mesopores on the ep surface might be due to the agglomeration of neighboring lfo table 2 tabulates the elemental weight and atomic composition of ep showing the ratio of si and al of 6 4 1 some trace amounts of potassium and sodium ion were detected table 2 also shows the elemental weight and atomic composition of lfo mep edx analysis was performed on ep and lfo mep to detect the changes in the surface elemental composition before and after the coating of lfo the atomic percentage of la and fe was 10 83 and 10 73 representing a ratio of 1 1 which was similar to the composition of lfo 28 37 meanwhile the atomic percentage of si and al for lfo mep was lower than that of ep this element reduction implied that dealumination and desilication occurred after naoh treatment trace elements also existed in lfo mep i e sodium and potassium ions 3 5 optical properties the absorbance spectra in fig 5 a represent the absorbance of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm lfo lfo ep and lfo mep experienced absorption in the range of 400 800 nm which corresponds to the visible light wavelength region in an electromagnetic wave indicating that they could absorb visible light in terms of absorption strength the order could be arranged as lfo lfo ep and lfo mep all of them showed good absorption at 400 500 nm but the absorbance decreased from 500 to 800 nm lfo lfo ep and lfo mep could also absorb uv light to a good extent as indicated by the high absorbance at 200 400 nm 28 fig 5 b d present the plot of f r hυ n versus the energy of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep kubelka munk function as depicted in eq 1 is a function that can be used to estimate the bandgap energy eg of the photocatalyst through the relationship of f r hυ n versus energy 48 1 f r 1 r 2 2 r where r is the reflectance h is the planck constant and υ is the frequency here n is equal to 2 because lfo is a direct bandgap transition semiconductor the kubelka munk plots of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep have the bandgap energy of 2 41 ev indicating that these materials are visible light active photocatalysts 36 the results also showed that coating lfo onto ep and mep did not change their bandgap energy 3 6 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic experiment of lfo ρ 6 31 g cm3 lfo ep ρ 0 19 g cm3 and lfo mep ρ 0 12 g cm3 to degrade ammonia was conducted in an open mode where the surface of synthetic ammonia solution was directly exposed to visible light irradiation ammonia can be readily dissolved in water as ammonia can form hydrogen bonding with each other however ammonia also exists in dissolved gas and is prone to evaporate at high temperatures and agitation meanwhile in water ammonia exists in two forms in equilibrium which are nh3 and nh4 their respective concentration is sensitive to changes in ph and temperature 1 hence it is very important to have a controlled study throughout the experimental period to determine the amount of ammonia evaporated the control in this research was studied by maintaining the ammonia solution under irradiation and stirring the change in the concentration of ammonia at the end of the experiment was determined table 3 presents the concentration of ammonia in ppm before and after the experiment and the loss of ammonia concentration to the environment this would serve as a standard for the subsequent calculation 2 c nh 3 degraded c nh 3 i c nh 3 loss c nh 3 remove c nh 3 i 100 eq 2 was utilized to calculate the efficiency of photocatalytic ammonia degradation where the percentage of ammonia degraded c nh 3 degraded was calculated by dividing the change in ammonia concentration by the initial concentration of ammonia c nh 3 i times 100 the c nh 3 loss is the concentration of ammonia lost to the environment and c nh 3 remove is the concentration of ammonia removed through the photocatalytic degradation by the photocatalyst fig 6 a represents the photocatalytic degradation performance of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep as photocatalysts the experiment was conducted by fixing the dosage of photocatalyst 4 g l 1 the initial concentration of ammonia solution 10 ppm and the initial ph of the solution 8 the control experiment without photocatalyst determined that 3 3 ppm of ammonia was lost after 200 min the efficiency of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep in removing ammonia was 20 6 31 9 and 36 5 respectively it could be deduced that initially lfo had a higher removal rate compared to lfo ep and lfo mep but the removal rate reduced after 40 min the reduction might be caused by the cloudiness of the solution or particle agglomeration on the other hand lfo ep and lfo mep maintained a consistent trend in ammonia degradation throughout the experiment this finding proved that a coated floating material helped to prevent agglomeration thus more exposure to the light lfo mep recorded the highest ammonia removal efficiency and was selected for further analysis the experiment also revealed that the floating photocatalysts lfo ep and lfo mep performed better than the suspension photocatalyst lfo this is because the floating photocatalysts received more irradiation compared to suspension mode moreover in suspension mode lfo was prone to agglomeration which reduced the rate of reaction as the surface area decreased resulting in fewer surface active sites for ammonia degradation in contrast coating lfo onto ep could solve this issue by creating more surface active sites for photocatalytic reactions lfo lfo ep and lfo mep degraded 20 6 31 9 and 36 5 of ammonia respectively the results showed that lfo ep and lfo mep achieved higher degradation efficiency than pure lfo a similar phenomenon was observed in the research conducted by darkhosh et al 19 which synthesized a floatable photocatalyst by coating cufeo2 onto ep and used in degrading methylene blue under visible light the study showed that cufeo2 ep could remove 99 of methylene blue whereas pure cufeo2 could only remove 29 of methylene blue the finding proved that a floating photocatalyst offers an advantage of receiving more irradiation to be used in photocatalytic reactions than the suspension method 3 7 effects of operational parameters on photocatalytic ammonia degradation by lfo mep the experiment was conducted at room temperature using 4 g l 1 of lfo mep 10 ppm of ammonia solution and ph of 6 7 and 8 as shown in fig 6 b from the control experiment without photocatalyst the loss of ammonia at ph 6 7 and 8 was 0 63 2 8 and 3 3 ppm respectively at ph 6 the photocatalytic reaction had a negligible effect on removing ammonia this is because nh4 has a low tendency toward degradation compared to nh3 from fig 6 b lfo mep removed 6 3 21 4 and 36 5 of ammonia at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively this is because less than 10 of nh3 is present in the solution when the ph is less than 8 1 this result is similar to the report by 3 where 20 ammonia removal was achieved using la fe tio2 photocatalyst at ph 8 and the removal increased with ph the treatment at higher ph was not considered in this study as shown in table 3 at ph 9 about 7 4 ppm of ammonia evaporated into the environment therefore as lfo mep exhibited the highest degradation efficiency ph 8 was selected for further study in fig 6 c the experiment was performed at the initial ammonia concentrations of 10 20 and 30 ppm ph 8 and 4 g l 1 of lfo mep the calculated ammonia degradation efficiency for the initial ammonia concentrations of 10 20 and 30 ppm was 36 5 29 0 and 17 93 respectively in theory at a higher concentration more nh3 is available at the neighboring photocatalyst surface thus the rate of reaction will be higher however as the experiment was conducted in an open mode the evaporation rate of ammonia was much faster than the rate of photocatalytic reaction hence this condition is not practical and environmentally friendly to treat ammonia at a high concentration therefore 10 ppm of initial ammonia solution was selected for further study in order to examine the effect of photocatalyst dosage on the effectiveness of ammonia degradation the experiment was performed at ph 8 the initial ammonia concentration of 10 ppm and various dosages of lfo mep fig 6 d illustrates the change in photocatalytic ammonia degradation as the dosage of lfo mep increased from 4 to 12 g l 1 the calculated ammonia degradation efficiency for 4 8 and 12 g l 1 of lfo mep was 36 5 45 7 and 40 2 respectively it could be deduced that as the dosage of lfo mep increased the degradation efficiency also increased but up to an optimum dosage level when the photocatalyst dosage increased from 4 to 8 g l 1 more surface active sites are available on lfo mep for ammonia molecules to attach and react when the dosage of lfo mep increased further to 12 g l 1 the degradation efficiency decreased the decrease might be due to insufficient light penetration into the water due to the blockage of lfo mep or the deactivation that happened as an activated molecule collided with a ground state molecule 49 50 therefore 8 g l 1 of lfo mep with the highest ammonia degradation efficiency was selected from the experiment fig 7 shows the concentration change of ammonia nitrate and nitrite ions throughout the experiment the operational parameters used were 8 g l 1 of lfo mep ph 8 and 10 ppm of ammonia solution from the control experiment under this condition 3 3 ppm of ammonia was lost to the environment the concentration of ammonia decreased from 10 to 2 13 ppm with 4 57 ppm of ammonia being removed as shown in fig 7 nitrate ion accumulated to 0 48 ppm whereas nitrite ion accumulated to 0 024 ppm at the end of the experiment it could be concluded that 4 570 ppm of ammonia 0 480 ppm of nitrate ion and 0 024 ppm of nitrite ion were removed as the by products of ammonia degradation the small amount of nitrate and nitrite ions produced from the reaction demonstrated that lfo mep photocatalytic ammonia degradation is a promising method to remove ammonia from the solution the photocatalytic ammonia degradation follows a first order reaction and this relationship can be determined by the following in eq 3 51 3 ln c ln c 0 kt where c ppm and c 0 ppm are the initial and final ammonia concentrations respectively k s 1 is the reaction rate constant and t min is time the photocatalytic ammonia degradation follows a first order reaction thus the rate of degradation is directly proportional to the concentration of ammonia the k value calculated was 0 0079 min 1 by using the relationship shown in eq 3 fig 8 depicts 3 cycles of photocatalytic activity of lfo mep in degrading ammonia solution the operational parameters used in this experiment were the selected parameters from the previous experiment 8 g l 1 of lfo mep 10 ppm of ammonia solution and ph 8 the three experimental cycles showed that the performance of lfo mep reduced subsequently the first and second cycles recorded the ammonia degradation efficiency of 45 7 meanwhile the third cycle of ammonia degradation achieved an efficiency of 41 7 the loss of degradation efficiency is small summarizing the stability and recyclability of the photocatalyst a small drop of degradation efficiency at the third cycle might be due to the fall off of lfo from mep due to the brittleness of ep table 4 presents the summary of variables in photocatalytic ammonia degradation involving ammonia concentration degradation efficiency light power irradiation time an optical property of photocatalyst catalyst dose kinetic rate and quantum yield the quantum yield was calculated using eqs 4 8 and the kinetic rate was determined using eq 9 as follows 52 4 e photon h

avogadro number and mlfo mep is the catalyst dose the calculated kinetic rate was 10 08 μmol g catalyst h and the quantum yield of photocatalytic ammonia degradation was 6 686 10 6 molecules photon the results showed that the photocatalytic degradation of ammonia by lfo mep occurred at a slow rate under the designed condition 3 8 performance comparison table 5 lists the comparison of the photocatalyst optimum operating parameters performance and degradation product several components of the photocatalysts were compared including the floating or suspension type of photocatalyst

large differences between the size of the floating photocatalyst and the suspended photocatalyst the nanoparticle sized photocatalyst can be coated onto a floatable material like tio2 55 coated on light expanded clay aggregate leca with the size of 4 8 mm zno coated on oak charcoal with the size of 6 mm 4 mm 2 mm and lafeo3 coated on ep lfo mep with the size of 2 36 3 36 mm meanwhile suspended photocatalysts have the size of 10 60 nm for cu zno rgo 56 and 5 12 nm for tio2 xnx pdo 57 nanosized photocatalysts used in suspension will have separation problems because the photocatalysts can only be recovered through membrane filtration or centrifugation after water treatment 11 on the other hand floating photocatalysts can be recovered easily due to their large size and floating on the water surface table 5 shows that both floatable and suspended photocatalysts have comparable ammonia degradation efficiency theoretically a suspended photocatalyst would have a higher photocatalytic reaction because the photocatalyst has better mixing and contact area with the pollutant in the water as stated in table 5 tio2 leca 55 zno oak charcoal 58 and wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite 59 are floatable photocatalysts with high degradation efficiencies of 75 80 and 88 respectively cu zno rgo 56 tio2 xnx pdo 57 and la fe tio2 60 are suspended photocatalysts that could remove a high amount of ammonia with an efficiency of 83 1 research has shown that the drawbacks of using a nanosized suspended photocatalyst include the separation problem uneconomic process and high operating costs 11 a floatable photocatalyst could be easily removed from the solution after the reaction has been completed and its efficiency is comparable to a suspended photocatalyst the floatable photocatalyst composite synthesized in this research is lfo mep lafeo3 has the size of 23 nm and could be coated evenly onto mep this photocatalyst could remove 45 7 of 10 ppm ammonia solution at ph 8 whereas the photocatalysts in table 5 have to operate in a highly alkaline solution to achieve the desired rate by comparing energy consumption zno oak charcoal has the lowest consumption whereas lfo mep has the highest consumption this finding could be deduced from the quantum yield of respective photocatalysts where zno oak charcoal could degrade a high amount of ammonia with the low input of photoenergy compared to lfo mep that could degrade a very low amount of ammonia with the input of photoenergy it should also be noted that zno oak charcoal uses uv light which possesses higher energy than visible light in this study lfo mep used low power led light 50 w explaining the low degradation of ammonia the figure of merit calculation considers several parameters such as ammonia degraded photocatalyst dose reaction time and energy consumption involved in the system the figure of merit is a type of performance evaluation that indicates how well a system is compared to another system zno oak charcoal showed the best performance among the photocatalysts from the perspective of ammonia degraded photocatalyst dose reaction time and energy consumption tio2 leca wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite cu zno rgo tio2 xnx pdo and la fe tio2 showed much lower performance than zno oak charcoal furthermore lfo mep has the lowest performance based on the figure of merit the low value indicates that the system could be further improved by modifying other parameters however when focusing on the generation of by products from ammonia degradation lfo mep only generated 0 48 ppm of nitrate ion and 0 024 ppm of nitrite ion as by products although zno oak and wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite could remove high concentrations of ammonia these photocatalysts generated high concentrations of nitrate and nitrite ions as by products which could be dangerous to the environment zno oak produced 30 ppm of nitrate ion and 50 ppm of nitrite ion as by products while wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite produced 30 ppm of nitrate ion and 15 ppm of nitrite ion as by products the nitrate and nitrite ion levels from the photocatalytic ammonia degradation using lfo mep are comparable to effective photocatalysts that generate low concentrations of nitrate and nitrite ions such as tio2 leca cu zno rgo la fe tio2 and tio2 xnx pdo table 6 lists all the advantages and disadvantages of lfo mep in this research the suggested reaction mechanism in photocatalytic ammonia degradation is also stated where ammonia will be degraded into nitrogen gas and also nitrate and nitrite ions 14 56 in conclusion lfo mep can remove ammonia at a slow rate but it only produces insignificant levels of nitrate and nitrite ions as by products highlighting its ability in avoiding toxicity to the environment and high reusability the photocatalyst can also be recovered easily from the solution after water treatment the performance of lfo mep could be further increased when using a higher intensity of visible light which would increase ammonia degradation efficiency significantly the research also examines the possibility of treating ammonia in open conditions which also provides a reference for future research on this novel material therefore the novel synthesized lfo mep is an environmentally friendly material to treat ammonia using visible light 4 conclusion this research successfully synthesized lfo lfo ep and lfo mep photocatalysts using the gel combustion method the fabricated photocatalysts possessed high crystallinity and the crystal structure of lafeo3 was detected the research identified the optimum operational parameters for lfo mep in photocatalytic ammonia degradation 8 g l 1 of lfo mep dosage 10 ppm of initial ammonia concentration and the ph of the solution of 8 the highest ammonia degradation efficiency was 45 7 the research concluded that for this method to be practical and environmentally friendly the initial ammonia concentration of wastewater should not exceed 10 ppm as the evaporation rate of ammonia would be faster than the photocatalytic degradation rate lfo mep showed high reusability within 3 cycles with only 4 reduction in performance however prolonged use of lfo mep in degrading ammonia will subsequently decrease its performance due to the falling off of lfo into the solution due to the brittleness of ep declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13303,in this research visible light active perovskite photocatalyst lanthanum orthoferrite lfo and floating photocatalyst composites namely lfo expanded perlite ep and lfo modified ep mep were successfully synthesized for ammonia degradation sodium hydroxide was used to modify ep as it could transform the structure of ep into a mesoporous structure thereby increasing the surface attachment of lfo and improving contact with ammonia the characterization of ep mep lfo ep and lfo mep composites was performed using uv vis xrd bet surface area ftir sem fesem and zeta potential photocatalytic degradation of ammonia was studied and lfo mep showed the best performance the optimal operational parameters for degrading ammonia using lfo mep were the catalytic dosage of 8 g l 1 the initial ammonia concentration of 10 ppm and the ph of the reaction medium of 8 with the maximum ammonia degradation efficiency of 45 7 a reusability study of lfo mep composite on the photocatalytic degradation of ammonia was performed for 3 cycles where the composite demonstrated high stability the reaction rate constant k was 0 0079 min 1 the kinetic data was 10 08 μmol g catalyst h and the quantum yield was 6 686 10 6 molecules photon the floatable photocatalyst lfo mep composite can be an effective method for the photodegradation of ammonia the photocatalyst could be easily recovered and is reusable for several cycles of treatment the reaction occurs at ambient conditions under visible light and there is limited by product production with the nitrate and nitrite ions of 0 48 and 0 0024 ppm respectively these properties demonstrated that the proposed method is an environmentally friendly method for removing ammonia from water keywords ammonia nitrate ion nitrite ion perlite photocatalyst 1 introduction ammonia is one of the predominant indicators for the quality of water resources it is colorless and creates an unpleasant odor and taste in drinking water ammonia also reacts with chlorine to generate harmful by products during disinfection facilitates bacterial growth and biofilm formation through the reaction with nitrifying organisms and produces toxic nitrite contents in an ascending manner when nitrification is incomplete which endangers human wellness and the environment in an aqueous solution ammonia molecules nh3 exist in equilibrium with ammonium ions nh4 this equilibrium shift is based on the influence of temperature and ph value 1 chlorination and biological treatment could remove ammonia from the treated water but chlorination requires a high chlorine dosage whereas biological treatment requires cell culture and a controlled environment to perform excellently adsorption and ion exchange remove ammonia from the treated water but ammonia becomes concentrated in the waste stream 2 to conclude it is difficult to completely remove ammonia through these conventional water treatment methods in the past decades researchers have made efforts in developing fresh and novel ideas in advanced water treatment processes including ozonolysis 3 membrane filtration 4 and adsorption 5 different types of resin and zeolite were tested for their adsorption efficiency in removing ammonia from synthetic and real wastewater where acidic resins e g dowex 50wx8 50 100 and lewatit monoplus s 108h demonstrated a high affinity to ammonia and could readily adsorb 95 ammonia in 10 min whereas zeolite took a long time to entirely remove ammonia from wastewater this difference is due to the presence of cation and anion that compete with ammonia to be absorbed into the zeolite 6 biological treatment can also remove ammonia more efficiently a moving bed biofilm reactor was studied to remove ammonia at 1000 ppm where a combination of nitrifying bacteria e g nitrosomonas nitrospira and nitrobacter and denitrifying bacteria e g comamonas olb8 and rhodanobacter was used in ammonia oxidation in a sequencing batch reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor and the respective removal efficiency was 94 100 and 72 100 7 the technologies described above are expensive to operate even though they are effective in removing ammonia the adsorption process requires regeneration with brine water before it can be used for the subsequent treatment 8 the biological process requires careful adjustment to the bacterial environment to perform nitrifying and denitrifying processes as this approach is very sensitive to ph nutrient and oxygen levels 9 photocatalytic technology is another recent effective method that can potentially remove ammonia the technology is easy to operate has a low energy cost and does not produce secondary solid waste like sludge 10 11 a photocatalytic reaction is a surface reaction therefore photocatalysts must receive sufficient solar radiation on the surface to achieve an optimum reaction most photocatalytic reactions are in suspension mode where a submerged light tube is required and the photocatalyst is dispersed in an aqueous medium and mixed well with the pollutant to achieve a desirable photodegradation rate 12 recent research focuses on finding photocatalyst materials and composites to degrade ammonia in suspension mode a nanosized photocatalyst znfe2o4 ac was applied for simultaneous removal of 50 ppm of nitrite and 100 ppm of ammonia under ultraviolet visible uv vis light irradiation and achieved an efficiency of 92 7 13 p25 and flame spray pyrolysis fps synthesized tio2 were studied for selective oxidation of ammonia under uv irradiation in a semi batch reactor and it was found that p25 and fps preferred to operate at ph 11 5 and 4 8 respectively although photocatalytic ammonia degradation was inefficient the method had high selectivity toward nitrogen as a product compared to nitrate and nitrite ions moreover co catalysts such as ag au pt and pd were added in the process subsequently p25 showed increased selectivity toward nitrate and nitrite ions whereas fsp with co catalysts demonstrated increased selectivity toward nitrogen gas 14 cds tnt composite synthesized using microwave hydrothermal method was found to degrade 52 3 of aqueous ammonia under uv irradiation which achieved higher efficiency compared to cds and tnt alone 15 however in the case of sunlight that shines from the top of the water surface and not from the submerged light tube the light will be refracted as it goes into the medium hence less radiation is received by the photocatalyst this condition causes an unachievable maximum photodegradation rate in addition these nanoparticles tend to agglomerate settle or suspend in the solution and are hard to separate thus the nanoparticles are wasted in the waste stream the nanoparticle sized photocatalyst needs membrane filtration for recovery purposes and involves high investment costs 11 to account for this issue floatable photocatalysts are an interesting option the immobilization of photocatalysts onto floatable support manages to maximize oxygenation and solar irradiation as the photocatalysts are localized between the interface of water and air this characteristic improves the oxidation efficiency and radical generation rate which is in line with the fundamentals of contaminant photodegradation 16 furthermore the photocatalysts are easier to separate which further increases reusability and flexibility in particular all these reasons highlight the significance of the floating photocatalyst over non floating ones a floatable photocatalyst synthesized by coating fe n tio2 on floating fly ash cenospheres supported layer by layer carbonized chitosan could degrade 93 1 of rhodamine b under visible light for 240 min 17 the floating photocatalyst b n tio2 expanded perlite ep degraded rhodamine b under uv light irradiation with a degradation efficiency of 93 8 18 meanwhile cufeo2 coated onto ep could degrade 99 0 of methylene blue within 30 min 19 lanthanum orthoferrite lfo is a type of perovskite with variable cation oxidation state lattice oxygen mobility and thermal chemical and structural stability the material is a visible light active photocatalyst with the ability to remove waste such as rhodamine b 20 methylene blue 21 diclofenac 22 and sulfamethoxazole 23 a foreign cation can substitute a and b positions which gives a way of modifying the oxidation state and oxygen vacancy of the perovskite allowing specific design properties different preparation methods of perovskite can produce different crystal structures surface morphologies and textural structures allowing one to use the proper synthesis method to achieve the desired catalytic properties 24 the lfo synthesis method is important because the photocatalyst should have a high surface area and crystallinity to have high activity lfo with high crystallinity could be achieved by calcining at temperatures higher than 700 c but this approach would increase the particle size and reduce the surface area of the photocatalyst 25 26 gel combustion is a solution based process that uses an effective complexing agent e g citric acid to produce nanoparticles with a large surface area and strong crystallinity without very high temperature calcination 27 28 ep is a white porous and lightweight mineral produced from perlite a type of volcanic rock subjected to heat treatment at the temperature between 800 and 1200 c however the high temperature heat treatment causes a large reduction of the silanol group si oh on the surface of ep 29 hence ep has a lower adsorption capacity than unexpanded perlite 30 the surface hydroxyl group is important for a material to have a good adsorption property in order to increase the adsorption strength of ep chemical modification using sodium hydroxide naoh could increase the number of surface hydroxyl groups and induce the formation of mesoporous structures 31 this modification will enhance the adsorption strength and reduce the diffusion resistance into the pores of ep 32 hence modified ep mep would be an interesting floatable material for coating with lafeo3 to produce a visible light active photocatalyst composite this research aims to synthesize lfo using the gel combustion method and mep using naoh first the floatable photocatalyst composites i e lfo ep and lfo mep were synthesized then lfo lfo ep and lfo mep were applied in photocatalytic ammonia degradation to compare their efficiency and the degradation products were analyzed the operational parameters such as catalyst dosage initial concentration of ammonia and ph of the solution were studied after that the reusability of lfo mep in photocatalytic ammonia degradation was assessed to study the effect of repeated use on the degradation efficiency of lfo mep this novel photocatalyst was studied for ammonia removal under visible light and open conditions using the synergistic effect of photocatalysis and adsorption 2 experimental methods 2 1 materials citric

subsequently calcined at 600 c for 5 h at a rate of 5 c min the lfo powder was kept in a dark glass bottle and stored in a desiccator before characterization and performance testing 2 3 synthesis of mep ep 0 03 0 15 g cm3 was first screened using mesh size with the range of 2 36 3 36 mm washed thrice to remove dust and dirt and dried at 60 c overnight prior to modification then 5 g of the washed ep was added and stirred in 200 ml of 1 m naoh solution under reflux at 80 c for 3 h to obtain mep after that the mep was filtered and washed with distilled water until the ph of the filtrate was 7 before being dried in an oven at 60 c overnight the mep sample was stored in a desiccator for further use 2 4 synthesis of lfo ep and lfo mep composites 5 mmol of each la no3 3 6h2o and fe no3 3 9h2o were dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water then 20 mmol of c6h8o7 h2o was dissolved in the solution and the ph was adjusted to 7 using nh3 solution the solution was stirred at 60 c for 1 h next the solution was continuously stirred at 90 c until the volume of the solution was reduced to about one third after that 4 g of washed ep was added into the solution under continuous stirring and heating to allow the coating process with one fourth of the volume of the solution remained the heating process was continued without stirring until as burnt lfo ep was obtained the composite was subsequently calcined at 600 c for 5 h at a rate of 5 c min the sample was kept in a dark bottle and stored in a desiccator the procedures were repeated by substituting ep with mep to obtain lfo mep composite 2 5 characterization procedures the density of the lfo lfo ep and lfo mep were determined by calculating the sample mass per the occupied volume each weighed sample was immersed in distilled water with a temperature of 26 c the crystallinity of the synthesized samples was studied using a rigaku smartlab d max 2500 diffractometer japan with cu kα radiation λ 1 5406 å at 40 kv and 30 ma the sample was scanned for a range of 2θ from 20 to 80 at a rate of 8 2551 min 1 the functional groups of the samples were studied using a jasco ftir spectrometer model 4600 japan with a wavelength scanning range of 4000 400 cm 1 surface analysis was carried out using micromeritics tristar ii 3020 ver 3 02 usa using nitrogen adsorption at 195 8 c the zeta potential analysis over the ph range of 1 14 by titration method was determined using malvern zetasizer pan analytical version 7 11 uk the morphology and surface element composition were evaluated by imaging and energy dispersive x ray edx analyses using a hitachi tm3000 scanning electron microscope sem japan and an su8000 field emission scanning electron microscope fesem at the respective accelerating voltage of 15 kv and 40 kv under vacuum the optical properties were analyzed using perkinelmer lambda 1050 uv vis nir spectrophotometer usa in the range of 800 200 cm 1 2 6 photocatalytic experiment 10 ppm of synthetic ammonia solution was prepared by diluting ammonia solution 25 in distilled water the initial ph of the synthetic ammonia solution was adjusted to 8 using 0 1 m naoh solution then 4 g l 1 of lfo was added into 50 ml of the synthetic ammonia solution and stirred for 1 h in the dark to achieve adsorption desorption equilibrium next a 50 w led lamp was switched on to allow photodegradation of ammonia for 200 min upon completion 3 ml of the mixture was collected and filtered through a 0 45 μm nylon membrane syringe filter every 40 min into a glass vial the initial and final concentrations of residual ammonia in the sample were then recorded the experiment was repeated using 4 g l 1 of lfo ep and lfo mep composites the photocatalyst with the highest ammonia removal efficiency was selected for the experimental parameter study by manipulating the photocatalyst dosage 4 8 and 12 g l 1 initial ammonia concentration 10 20 and 30 ppm and initial ph 6 7 and 8 of the synthetic ammonia solution the reusability of the photocatalyst was studied by repeating the photodegradation experiment at optimum experimental conditions for 3 cycles for every cycle the photocatalyst sample was washed with distilled water and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight before performance testing 2 7 analytical procedures the concentration of ammonia in the synthetic solution was determined following the salicylate method method 10 031 0 1 ml of the filtered sample was added into amver high range ammonia test n tube followed by the addition of one sachet of ammonium salicylate and one sachet of ammonium cyanurate the solution was left for 20 min for a complete reaction the initial yellowish solution turned greenish after 20 min indicating the presence of ammonia in the sample and testing reagent the concentration was analyzed using a hach dr5000 spectrophotometer usa the nitrate and nitrite ion concentrations in the synthetic ammonia solution were evaluated using a perkinelmer lambda 1050 uv vis nir spectrophotometer usa the absorbance wavelength of nitrate and nitrite ions was measured in the range of 200 220 nm 13 33 and 354 nm 34 respectively the presence of nitrate and nitrite ions in the solution was detected using a uv vis spectrophotometer at 200 and 354 nm respectively stock solutions of 1 mm of potassium nitrate solution and 1 mm of sodium nitrite solution were prepared 0 05 0 5 ppm of potassium nitrate standard solution and 0 025 0 125 ppm of sodium nitrite standard solution were prepared using their respective stock solution these ranges of concentrations were used to construct the calibration curves for nitrate and nitrite ions the obtained equations were used to find the concentration of nitrate and nitrite ions whereby y is the absorbance determined using the uv vis spectrophotometer and x is the concentration of ion the r2 values showed that the curves are reasonably accurate to determine the concentration of nitrate and nitrite ions 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystallinity and functional group properties fig 1 a shows the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep synthesized using the gel combustion method and calcined at 600 c the xrd patterns of all samples have the characteristic of typical miller indices of lfo db card no 00 037 1493 101 121 220 202 240 242 and 204 which were observed at 2θ 22 6 32 1 39 6 46 1 52 0 57 3 and 76 6 respectively this finding proved that lfo was successfully synthesized the xrd patterns also show high intensity peaks implying the high crystallinity of the as prepared lfo lfo ep and lfo mep 35 the resulting crystallite size of lfo 24 9 nm which was determined by the scherrer formula decreased slightly when coated onto ep and mep 23 0 nm these results indicate the insignificant changes in the crystallinity properties of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep fig 1 b presents the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep all three ftir spectra have a peak at 555 cm 1 which corresponds to feo stretching vibration implying the characteristic of feo6 octahedron in lafeo3 36 the peaks at 3680 cm 1 for lfo and 3640 cm 1 for lfo ep and lfo mep are the oh stretching of surface hydroxyl group la oh 37 the peak at 3400 cm 1 for lfo is attributed to the surface absorbed water molecule or surface hydroxyl group 20 the peak at 1014 cm 1 corresponds to the si o si symmetric stretching mode 38 meanwhile the peak at 789 cm 1 is attributed to the si o si bending mode 39 the peaks at 1450 1640 2040 and 2160 cm 1 are ch rocking and bending modes attributed to the citric acid residue present in the sample 38 the ftir results confirmed that lfo was successfully synthesized some residuals of citric acid are present on the surface of the photocatalyst the detected ftir peaks of the surface oh bond have weak intensity indicating the reduced amount of surface hydroxyl group due to the calcination of the photocatalyst for a long time 3 2 surface analysis fig 2 a c show the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of lfo lfo ep and lfp mep the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of lfo shows that it has a type iii isotherm according to iupac classification which means that lfo has poor adsorbate adsorbent interaction and is non porous or macroporous in nature 36 40 lfo has a brunauer emmett teller bet surface area of 13 6 m2 g 1 the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of lfo ep and lfo mep was identified as a type iv isotherm according to iupac classification in comparison lfo ep has a small type h4 hysteresis loop at p po of 0 8 1 0 as seen in fig 2 b and lfo mep has a small type h4 hysteresis loop at 0 7 1 0 as shown in fig 2 c suggesting that both are mesoporous materials with narrow slit pores that allow multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation to occur 41 44 lfo ep and lfo mep have bet surface areas of 7 1 and 9 6 m2 g 1 respectively thus coating lafeo3 onto mep would produce a larger surface area than unmodified ep fig 2 d presents the pore distribution of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep that enables the analysis of the available form of the porous structure of a specific photocatalyst micropores have a pore diameter below 2 nm mesopores have a pore diameter between 2 and 50 nm and macropores have a pore diameter larger than 50 nm 40 lfo lfo ep and lfo mep have pore distributions of 2 2 211 3 nm 2 1 128 8 nm and 2 0 141 7 nm respectively it could be deduced that lfo has a pore distribution that largely consists of macropores which are more than 50 nm in pore diameter lfo ep and lfo mep also have pore distribution in the macropore region but they have higher pore distribution in the mesopore region which is between 2 and 50 nm in pore diameter table 1 lists the summary of pore diameter cumulative pore surface area bjhsa ad and cumulative pore volume bjhv ad of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep the decreasing order could be written as lfo lfo mep lfo ep lfo has the highest value in all characteristics as it is in powder form even though lfo ep and lfo mep are in solid form with size in the range of 2 4 3 4 mm their characteristics are comparable to lfo as the pore diameter pore surface area and pore volume of lfo ep and lfo mep are near to lfo moreover lfo mep has a larger size surface area and volume than lfo ep indicating that mep with naoh has improved properties compared to the unmodified one it could be seen that as lfo was coated onto ep resulting in decreased cumulative surface area and cumulative volume this result is due to the accumulation of lfo particles on the wall of ep after impregnation a similar observation of reduced pore surface area and volume of composites was reported in coating lafeo3 onto sba 5 natural zeolite and montmorillonite 21 45 46 3 3 surface charge properties fig 3 presents the zeta potential of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep over a ph range from 1 to 14 the value of zeta potential could determine the surface charge of the photocatalyst at that particular ph value phiso is the ph where the photocatalyst has an isoelectric charge which is equal to 0 mv the phiso also represents the point at which the change of surface charge of the photocatalyst from positive charge to negative charge occurred as seen in fig 3 the zeta potential of lfo determined that it was not soluble in a solution and the particles were vulnerable to agglomeration due to its smaller zeta potential in suspension 28 6 mv than the norm for relatively stable particulate suspension 30 and 30 mv 47 the phiso values of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep are 1 78 4 05 and 2 96 respectively azeez et al 2018 studied the effect of surface charge of titania nanoparticles synthesized at ph 1 6 7 and 10 on the degradation of methylene blue the electrostatic surface charge assisted the adsorption of methylene blue to the surface of titania for photocatalytic reaction titania synthesized at ph 10 had a strong negative charge and achieved the highest rate of reaction whereas titania synthesized at ph 1 6 had the lowest rate of reaction due to electrostatic repulsion the surface charge of the photocatalyst is important in a surface reaction as it increases the attraction between the reactant and the photocatalyst as seen in fig 3 when the surface charge exceeded the phiso lfo lfo ep and lfo mep were negatively charged and might attract polar ammonia molecules 3 4 morphological properties fig 4 a depicts the sem image of ep at 600 magnification it can be seen that ep has a porous structure with different pore sizes fig 4 b presents the sem image of mep at 600 magnification after naoh treatment the structure of ep became more porous from fig 4 c an image taken at 20 000 magnification lfo was distributed evenly onto the surface of mep fig 4 d shows the image taken at 120 000 magnification where lfo was coated on mep in a mixture of circular and irregular forms the development of mesopores on the ep surface might be due to the agglomeration of neighboring lfo table 2 tabulates the elemental weight and atomic composition of ep showing the ratio of si and al of 6 4 1 some trace amounts of potassium and sodium ion were detected table 2 also shows the elemental weight and atomic composition of lfo mep edx analysis was performed on ep and lfo mep to detect the changes in the surface elemental composition before and after the coating of lfo the atomic percentage of la and fe was 10 83 and 10 73 representing a ratio of 1 1 which was similar to the composition of lfo 28 37 meanwhile the atomic percentage of si and al for lfo mep was lower than that of ep this element reduction implied that dealumination and desilication occurred after naoh treatment trace elements also existed in lfo mep i e sodium and potassium ions 3 5 optical properties the absorbance spectra in fig 5 a represent the absorbance of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep in the wavelength range of 200 800 nm lfo lfo ep and lfo mep experienced absorption in the range of 400 800 nm which corresponds to the visible light wavelength region in an electromagnetic wave indicating that they could absorb visible light in terms of absorption strength the order could be arranged as lfo lfo ep and lfo mep all of them showed good absorption at 400 500 nm but the absorbance decreased from 500 to 800 nm lfo lfo ep and lfo mep could also absorb uv light to a good extent as indicated by the high absorbance at 200 400 nm 28 fig 5 b d present the plot of f r hυ n versus the energy of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep kubelka munk function as depicted in eq 1 is a function that can be used to estimate the bandgap energy eg of the photocatalyst through the relationship of f r hυ n versus energy 48 1 f r 1 r 2 2 r where r is the reflectance h is the planck constant and υ is the frequency here n is equal to 2 because lfo is a direct bandgap transition semiconductor the kubelka munk plots of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep have the bandgap energy of 2 41 ev indicating that these materials are visible light active photocatalysts 36 the results also showed that coating lfo onto ep and mep did not change their bandgap energy 3 6 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic experiment of lfo ρ 6 31 g cm3 lfo ep ρ 0 19 g cm3 and lfo mep ρ 0 12 g cm3 to degrade ammonia was conducted in an open mode where the surface of synthetic ammonia solution was directly exposed to visible light irradiation ammonia can be readily dissolved in water as ammonia can form hydrogen bonding with each other however ammonia also exists in dissolved gas and is prone to evaporate at high temperatures and agitation meanwhile in water ammonia exists in two forms in equilibrium which are nh3 and nh4 their respective concentration is sensitive to changes in ph and temperature 1 hence it is very important to have a controlled study throughout the experimental period to determine the amount of ammonia evaporated the control in this research was studied by maintaining the ammonia solution under irradiation and stirring the change in the concentration of ammonia at the end of the experiment was determined table 3 presents the concentration of ammonia in ppm before and after the experiment and the loss of ammonia concentration to the environment this would serve as a standard for the subsequent calculation 2 c nh 3 degraded c nh 3 i c nh 3 loss c nh 3 remove c nh 3 i 100 eq 2 was utilized to calculate the efficiency of photocatalytic ammonia degradation where the percentage of ammonia degraded c nh 3 degraded was calculated by dividing the change in ammonia concentration by the initial concentration of ammonia c nh 3 i times 100 the c nh 3 loss is the concentration of ammonia lost to the environment and c nh 3 remove is the concentration of ammonia removed through the photocatalytic degradation by the photocatalyst fig 6 a represents the photocatalytic degradation performance of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep as photocatalysts the experiment was conducted by fixing the dosage of photocatalyst 4 g l 1 the initial concentration of ammonia solution 10 ppm and the initial ph of the solution 8 the control experiment without photocatalyst determined that 3 3 ppm of ammonia was lost after 200 min the efficiency of lfo lfo ep and lfo mep in removing ammonia was 20 6 31 9 and 36 5 respectively it could be deduced that initially lfo had a higher removal rate compared to lfo ep and lfo mep but the removal rate reduced after 40 min the reduction might be caused by the cloudiness of the solution or particle agglomeration on the other hand lfo ep and lfo mep maintained a consistent trend in ammonia degradation throughout the experiment this finding proved that a coated floating material helped to prevent agglomeration thus more exposure to the light lfo mep recorded the highest ammonia removal efficiency and was selected for further analysis the experiment also revealed that the floating photocatalysts lfo ep and lfo mep performed better than the suspension photocatalyst lfo this is because the floating photocatalysts received more irradiation compared to suspension mode moreover in suspension mode lfo was prone to agglomeration which reduced the rate of reaction as the surface area decreased resulting in fewer surface active sites for ammonia degradation in contrast coating lfo onto ep could solve this issue by creating more surface active sites for photocatalytic reactions lfo lfo ep and lfo mep degraded 20 6 31 9 and 36 5 of ammonia respectively the results showed that lfo ep and lfo mep achieved higher degradation efficiency than pure lfo a similar phenomenon was observed in the research conducted by darkhosh et al 19 which synthesized a floatable photocatalyst by coating cufeo2 onto ep and used in degrading methylene blue under visible light the study showed that cufeo2 ep could remove 99 of methylene blue whereas pure cufeo2 could only remove 29 of methylene blue the finding proved that a floating photocatalyst offers an advantage of receiving more irradiation to be used in photocatalytic reactions than the suspension method 3 7 effects of operational parameters on photocatalytic ammonia degradation by lfo mep the experiment was conducted at room temperature using 4 g l 1 of lfo mep 10 ppm of ammonia solution and ph of 6 7 and 8 as shown in fig 6 b from the control experiment without photocatalyst the loss of ammonia at ph 6 7 and 8 was 0 63 2 8 and 3 3 ppm respectively at ph 6 the photocatalytic reaction had a negligible effect on removing ammonia this is because nh4 has a low tendency toward degradation compared to nh3 from fig 6 b lfo mep removed 6 3 21 4 and 36 5 of ammonia at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively this is because less than 10 of nh3 is present in the solution when the ph is less than 8 1 this result is similar to the report by 3 where 20 ammonia removal was achieved using la fe tio2 photocatalyst at ph 8 and the removal increased with ph the treatment at higher ph was not considered in this study as shown in table 3 at ph 9 about 7 4 ppm of ammonia evaporated into the environment therefore as lfo mep exhibited the highest degradation efficiency ph 8 was selected for further study in fig 6 c the experiment was performed at the initial ammonia concentrations of 10 20 and 30 ppm ph 8 and 4 g l 1 of lfo mep the calculated ammonia degradation efficiency for the initial ammonia concentrations of 10 20 and 30 ppm was 36 5 29 0 and 17 93 respectively in theory at a higher concentration more nh3 is available at the neighboring photocatalyst surface thus the rate of reaction will be higher however as the experiment was conducted in an open mode the evaporation rate of ammonia was much faster than the rate of photocatalytic reaction hence this condition is not practical and environmentally friendly to treat ammonia at a high concentration therefore 10 ppm of initial ammonia solution was selected for further study in order to examine the effect of photocatalyst dosage on the effectiveness of ammonia degradation the experiment was performed at ph 8 the initial ammonia concentration of 10 ppm and various dosages of lfo mep fig 6 d illustrates the change in photocatalytic ammonia degradation as the dosage of lfo mep increased from 4 to 12 g l 1 the calculated ammonia degradation efficiency for 4 8 and 12 g l 1 of lfo mep was 36 5 45 7 and 40 2 respectively it could be deduced that as the dosage of lfo mep increased the degradation efficiency also increased but up to an optimum dosage level when the photocatalyst dosage increased from 4 to 8 g l 1 more surface active sites are available on lfo mep for ammonia molecules to attach and react when the dosage of lfo mep increased further to 12 g l 1 the degradation efficiency decreased the decrease might be due to insufficient light penetration into the water due to the blockage of lfo mep or the deactivation that happened as an activated molecule collided with a ground state molecule 49 50 therefore 8 g l 1 of lfo mep with the highest ammonia degradation efficiency was selected from the experiment fig 7 shows the concentration change of ammonia nitrate and nitrite ions throughout the experiment the operational parameters used were 8 g l 1 of lfo mep ph 8 and 10 ppm of ammonia solution from the control experiment under this condition 3 3 ppm of ammonia was lost to the environment the concentration of ammonia decreased from 10 to 2 13 ppm with 4 57 ppm of ammonia being removed as shown in fig 7 nitrate ion accumulated to 0 48 ppm whereas nitrite ion accumulated to 0 024 ppm at the end of the experiment it could be concluded that 4 570 ppm of ammonia 0 480 ppm of nitrate ion and 0 024 ppm of nitrite ion were removed as the by products of ammonia degradation the small amount of nitrate and nitrite ions produced from the reaction demonstrated that lfo mep photocatalytic ammonia degradation is a promising method to remove ammonia from the solution the photocatalytic ammonia degradation follows a first order reaction and this relationship can be determined by the following in eq 3 51 3 ln c ln c 0 kt where c ppm and c 0 ppm are the initial and final ammonia concentrations respectively k s 1 is the reaction rate constant and t min is time the photocatalytic ammonia degradation follows a first order reaction thus the rate of degradation is directly proportional to the concentration of ammonia the k value calculated was 0 0079 min 1 by using the relationship shown in eq 3 fig 8 depicts 3 cycles of photocatalytic activity of lfo mep in degrading ammonia solution the operational parameters used in this experiment were the selected parameters from the previous experiment 8 g l 1 of lfo mep 10 ppm of ammonia solution and ph 8 the three experimental cycles showed that the performance of lfo mep reduced subsequently the first and second cycles recorded the ammonia degradation efficiency of 45 7 meanwhile the third cycle of ammonia degradation achieved an efficiency of 41 7 the loss of degradation efficiency is small summarizing the stability and recyclability of the photocatalyst a small drop of degradation efficiency at the third cycle might be due to the fall off of lfo from mep due to the brittleness of ep table 4 presents the summary of variables in photocatalytic ammonia degradation involving ammonia concentration degradation efficiency light power irradiation time an optical property of photocatalyst catalyst dose kinetic rate and quantum yield the quantum yield was calculated using eqs 4 8 and the kinetic rate was determined using eq 9 as follows 52 4 e photon h

avogadro number and mlfo mep is the catalyst dose the calculated kinetic rate was 10 08 μmol g catalyst h and the quantum yield of photocatalytic ammonia degradation was 6 686 10 6 molecules photon the results showed that the photocatalytic degradation of ammonia by lfo mep occurred at a slow rate under the designed condition 3 8 performance comparison table 5 lists the comparison of the photocatalyst optimum operating parameters performance and degradation product several components of the photocatalysts were compared including the floating or suspension type of photocatalyst

large differences between the size of the floating photocatalyst and the suspended photocatalyst the nanoparticle sized photocatalyst can be coated onto a floatable material like tio2 55 coated on light expanded clay aggregate leca with the size of 4 8 mm zno coated on oak charcoal with the size of 6 mm 4 mm 2 mm and lafeo3 coated on ep lfo mep with the size of 2 36 3 36 mm meanwhile suspended photocatalysts have the size of 10 60 nm for cu zno rgo 56 and 5 12 nm for tio2 xnx pdo 57 nanosized photocatalysts used in suspension will have separation problems because the photocatalysts can only be recovered through membrane filtration or centrifugation after water treatment 11 on the other hand floating photocatalysts can be recovered easily due to their large size and floating on the water surface table 5 shows that both floatable and suspended photocatalysts have comparable ammonia degradation efficiency theoretically a suspended photocatalyst would have a higher photocatalytic reaction because the photocatalyst has better mixing and contact area with the pollutant in the water as stated in table 5 tio2 leca 55 zno oak charcoal 58 and wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite 59 are floatable photocatalysts with high degradation efficiencies of 75 80 and 88 respectively cu zno rgo 56 tio2 xnx pdo 57 and la fe tio2 60 are suspended photocatalysts that could remove a high amount of ammonia with an efficiency of 83 1 research has shown that the drawbacks of using a nanosized suspended photocatalyst include the separation problem uneconomic process and high operating costs 11 a floatable photocatalyst could be easily removed from the solution after the reaction has been completed and its efficiency is comparable to a suspended photocatalyst the floatable photocatalyst composite synthesized in this research is lfo mep lafeo3 has the size of 23 nm and could be coated evenly onto mep this photocatalyst could remove 45 7 of 10 ppm ammonia solution at ph 8 whereas the photocatalysts in table 5 have to operate in a highly alkaline solution to achieve the desired rate by comparing energy consumption zno oak charcoal has the lowest consumption whereas lfo mep has the highest consumption this finding could be deduced from the quantum yield of respective photocatalysts where zno oak charcoal could degrade a high amount of ammonia with the low input of photoenergy compared to lfo mep that could degrade a very low amount of ammonia with the input of photoenergy it should also be noted that zno oak charcoal uses uv light which possesses higher energy than visible light in this study lfo mep used low power led light 50 w explaining the low degradation of ammonia the figure of merit calculation considers several parameters such as ammonia degraded photocatalyst dose reaction time and energy consumption involved in the system the figure of merit is a type of performance evaluation that indicates how well a system is compared to another system zno oak charcoal showed the best performance among the photocatalysts from the perspective of ammonia degraded photocatalyst dose reaction time and energy consumption tio2 leca wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite cu zno rgo tio2 xnx pdo and la fe tio2 showed much lower performance than zno oak charcoal furthermore lfo mep has the lowest performance based on the figure of merit the low value indicates that the system could be further improved by modifying other parameters however when focusing on the generation of by products from ammonia degradation lfo mep only generated 0 48 ppm of nitrate ion and 0 024 ppm of nitrite ion as by products although zno oak and wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite could remove high concentrations of ammonia these photocatalysts generated high concentrations of nitrate and nitrite ions as by products which could be dangerous to the environment zno oak produced 30 ppm of nitrate ion and 50 ppm of nitrite ion as by products while wo3 ag3po4 zno perlite produced 30 ppm of nitrate ion and 15 ppm of nitrite ion as by products the nitrate and nitrite ion levels from the photocatalytic ammonia degradation using lfo mep are comparable to effective photocatalysts that generate low concentrations of nitrate and nitrite ions such as tio2 leca cu zno rgo la fe tio2 and tio2 xnx pdo table 6 lists all the advantages and disadvantages of lfo mep in this research the suggested reaction mechanism in photocatalytic ammonia degradation is also stated where ammonia will be degraded into nitrogen gas and also nitrate and nitrite ions 14 56 in conclusion lfo mep can remove ammonia at a slow rate but it only produces insignificant levels of nitrate and nitrite ions as by products highlighting its ability in avoiding toxicity to the environment and high reusability the photocatalyst can also be recovered easily from the solution after water treatment the performance of lfo mep could be further increased when using a higher intensity of visible light which would increase ammonia degradation efficiency significantly the research also examines the possibility of treating ammonia in open conditions which also provides a reference for future research on this novel material therefore the novel synthesized lfo mep is an environmentally friendly material to treat ammonia using visible light 4 conclusion this research successfully synthesized lfo lfo ep and lfo mep photocatalysts using the gel combustion method the fabricated photocatalysts possessed high crystallinity and the crystal structure of lafeo3 was detected the research identified the optimum operational parameters for lfo mep in photocatalytic ammonia degradation 8 g l 1 of lfo mep dosage 10 ppm of initial ammonia concentration and the ph of the solution of 8 the highest ammonia degradation efficiency was 45 7 the research concluded that for this method to be practical and environmentally friendly the initial ammonia concentration of wastewater should not exceed 10 ppm as the evaporation rate of ammonia would be faster than the photocatalytic degradation rate lfo mep showed high reusability within 3 cycles with only 4 reduction in performance however prolonged use of lfo mep in degrading ammonia will subsequently decrease its performance due to the falling off of lfo into the solution due to the brittleness of ep declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13304,implementation of photosynthetic microorganism like thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 is considered as an eco friendly strategy for carbon dioxide fixation and nutrient utilization in wastewater however high level of ammoniacal nitrogen carries out toxicity to tcl 1 cell and adsorption can be applied as a pre treatment stage this study observed application of iron silicate on ammoniacal nitrogen adsorption in non sterilized and undiluted swine wastewater as pre treatment for tcl 1 cultivation for co2 fixation nh4 n degradation and phycobiliprotein generation the utilization of 100 g

was implemented as tcl 1 growth medium under the 1000 μe m2 s light intensity for 12 h the tcl 1 biomass growth co2 fixation and nh4 n removal rate during cultivation period reached to 31 67 1 25 57 54 6 09 and 6 05 0 20 mg l h respectively phycobiliprotein as a byproduct was generated with the productivity of 13 9 mg g h thus coupling iron silicate for pre treatment step of tcl 1 cultivation in swine wastewater is eco friendly strategy to reduce water demand for dilution ignite phycobiliprotein accumulation during the co2 fixation and nutrient utilization process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption swine wastewater thermosynechococcus co2 fixation phycocyanin 1 introduction recent carbon dioxide co2 concentration elevated to 417 1 ppm per may 2020 noaa global monitoring laboratory leads to global warming issue common carbon capture storage strategies the physiochemical process require high energy and cost during the operation maintenance or transportation 1 photosynthetic microorganism and terrestrial plant have the ability to consume co2 and apply it as the carbon source in calvin cycle thus the application of biological fixation especially photosynthetic microorganism is considered as the efficient strategy to eliminate the atmospheric co2 concentration 2 other environmental issue is produced by the high volume of ammonium nh4 n discharge from the swine wastewater due to the global pork demand rising taiwan as one of the global pork meat supplier provides around 5 4 million heads of swine 3 4 china as the supplier of 47 8 global pork meat demand annually discharged swine wastewater with the ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp weight of 0 29 1 39 and 0 23 million tons respectively in 2014 3 commonly the swine wastewater contains 3000 15 000 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod 400 1400 mg n l of nh4 n 600 1200 mg n l of tn 100 250 mg l of tp and high concentration of fecal coliform 5 several conventional methods such as chemical and implementation of biological nitrogen removal like anammox or autotrophic nitrogen microbes were commonly applied to eliminate nh4 n and tn content in wastewater 6 7 however the high cost of chemical nh4 n uptake method and the slow growing rate or cod sensitive characteristic of autotrophic nitrogen microbes such as ammonia oxidizer nitrite oxidizer and anammox bacteria are considered as the disadvantages of those strategy implementation 8 9 symbiotic of microalgae chlorella with the bacteria consortium in anaerobic digestate including proteobacteria arcobacter cryaerophillus and nitrosomonas eutropha bacteriodetes aequorivita cryomorphaceae or firmicutes has been examined on its nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment during 9 days experimental period 10 algae bacteria symbiosis which chlorella sp and coelastrella sp were the inserted microalgae while bacteriodetes euryarchaeota firmicutes and proteobacteria were in the bacteria communities improved the nh4 removal during 8 day cultivation period 11 thus heterotrophic and mixothropic cyanobacteria which offer fast growing rate is considered as good method to decrease nitrogenous compounds in wastewater various microalgae and cyanobacteria as the photosynthetic microorganism have been applied for the wastewater degradation and combined with the strategy of co2 fixation to provide their energy 2 thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 an isolated cyanobacterium from a hot spring in eastern taiwan has been acknowledged for its performance in co2 fixation estrogen degradation and byproducts production tcl 1 originally grows at high temperature of 62 c and alkaline ph condition of 9 3 12 but has been developed to the temperature of 45 55 c and ph of 7 0 10 5 13 moreover tcl 1 is adaptable to high light intensity of 250 2000 μe m2 s high endurance to utilize the nutrient in swine wastewater and generates various bio materials simultaneously 14 15 according to the previous study of narindri rara winayu tung lai 14 tcl 1 has the ability to produce several pigment contents including phycobiliprotein groups pigment phycobiliprotein in the cyanobacteria cells was used as the light harvesting protein pigment that located on the outer surface of thylakoid membrane phycobiliprotein groups are divided into three big groups c phycocyanin allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin based on the different protein structure 16 phycobiliprotein is the pigment group that has been widely used in food and drugs industries due to the therapeutic characteristic 17 therefore tcl 1 implementation is recommended as the eco friendly method in degrading wastewater pollutants resulting in high rate of microbial growth and nutrients elimination 1 3 however the high nutrient content in wastewater that can carry out toxicity into biomass cell is become the limitation in direct cultivation of microorganisms 18 efficient methods are required to control the nutrient content of wastewater before the cultivation process numerous studies choose dilution process using various type of water or wastewater as the simple strategy to achieve the required concentration range of nutrient in the wastewater for microorganism growth chlorella vulgaris jsc 6 has been cultivated in the diluted 5 20 folds swine wastewater while chlorella zofingiensis and tribonema sp have been cultivated in the swine wastewater diluted with fishery wastewater 19 20 nevertheless the dilution process will increase the water requirement reduce wastewater degradation efficiency and rises required cost during the cultivation period therefore other strategies including adsorption or membrane utilization are considered as the efficient pre treatment method for wastewater before the cultivation silicate sio2 is the common applied material to provide oh surface group for the metal particle deposition for various functions moreover sio2 shell has the prevention ability towards agglomeration and oxidation while simultaneously support the mass transfer between metal particle like fe and contaminants 21 dispersion of iron based material in matrixes like ceramic and sio2 for various application 22 due to the high potency and selectivity 23 in this study iron silicate adsorbent was focused on the nh4 n adsorption as the swine wastewater pre treatment strategy before the tcl 1 cultivation experiment pre treated swine wastewater will be used as nutrient supply in tcl 1 cultivation using flat panel photobioreactors to reduce nutrient and produce phycobiliprotein pigments as valuable byproducts the combination of adsorption and tcl 1 cultivation is a potential strategy to reduce process cost and reaches the sustainability in wastewater utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 iron silicate adsorbent and swine wastewater iron silicate adsorbent was made by the department of chemistry national cheng kung university according to the modification from previous study of zhang et al 24 sodium silicate 25 was mixed with di water in the ratio of 12 75 w w before added by 52 5 g of 2 m naoh and 3 75 g of γ al2o3 sodium silicate mixture was then stirred with the

the temperature of 105 c overnight applied swine wastewater in the study was taken from anoxic tank of taiwan sugar company s pig farm wastewater treatment plant in tainan taiwan table 1 summarizes the swine wastewater properties during the study no sterilization method was applied for swine wastewater moreover no filtration or centrifugation method was carried out for the suspended solid separation in swine wastewater throughout the study 2 2 iron silicate adsorption to reduce swine wastewater nh4 n concentration experimental study on the adsorption performance was conducted triplicate using a serum bottle with the small working volume of 50 ml wastewater various amounts of iron silicate in the concentration range of 50 150 g l wastewater were examined for its efficiency on removal of nh4 n content in swine wastewater serum bottle was placed on the 100 rpm shaker at room temperature of 25 c for 5 h adequate liquid sample was taken every 30 min to observe the adsorption process of nh4 n into iron silicate adsorbent along with the transformation of other inorganic nitrogen species no3 n and no2 n optimum adsorption result will be applied in the further 1 l

chemical scrubber of industrial flue gas all prepared media were sterilized using an autoclave tomin tm 328 for 20 min at temperature of 121 c in the beginning of pre cultivation stages cultivation

wastewater moreover other type of nitrogen may transform during the process therefore fig 1 displays the transformation of various inorganic nitrogen types in adsorption process for all cases of applied adsorbent dosage swine wastewater ph value increased from 7 1 to 7 8 iron silicate adsorbent was synthesized under an alkaline solution thus some hydroxide ions oh chelated on the fe3 sites in the iron silicate structure supplementary a when adding to the nh3 nh4 solution at ph higher than 7 0 the ammonia molecule with lone pair electron have a lager chelating strength than that of the oh or h2o which can replace the oh or h2o because of the release of the alkaline oh ions the ph value of the solution slightly raised after nh3 adsorption application of higher dosage of adsorbent caused the faster decline in nh4 n concentration for all cases of applied dosage iron silicate adsorption process reached equilibrium in short period around 120 min after the first contact of adsorbent and with the highest reduction carried out by the dosage of 150 g l however similar elimination rate was achieved by the implementation of 100 and 150 g l iron silicate adsorbent with the slope of 0 0069 and 0 0097 respectively during first 60 min of adsorption period further adsorption period resulting in the stable nh4 n concentration which indicated the equilibrium state of adsorption process no3 n content in swine wastewater increased at the first 30 min of adsorption period and become stable until the end of the process this elevation might occur due to the no3 n release from the adsorbent material and confirmed by infra red ir spectrum of iron silicate in supplementary a during the doping process in adsorbent production excess fe no3 3 was applied the presence of a vibration band at 1385 cm 1 in the ir spectrum indicates the residual nitrate ions in the iron silicate adsorbent the remaining no3 in the adsorbent material could be released during the adsorption process thus a higher amount of no3 n content was accumulated in the implementation of higher adsorbent dosages for all implemented adsorbent dosages the no2 n concentration reduced during the first 30 min but with the lower capacity compared to the other types of inorganic nitrogen reduction of no2 n was carried out by iron silicate adsorbent with the range of 0 2 0 3 mg n l further adsorption process caused slight variation of no2 n content in swine wastewater with the range of 0 001 0 29 mg n l low difference results of no2 n and no3 n content during adsorption process proved that the iron silicate adsorption was selectively focused on nh4 n content therefore further study on adsorption kinetics will be focused on nh4 n content adsorption kinetics to observe adsorption rate and mechanism can be conducted using pseudo first order and second order kinetic model which are displayed in fig 2 compared to pseudo second order higher r2 result was achieved by the calculation of pseudo first order equation with application of 100 g l iron silicate adsorbent dosage r2 0 993 these results indicated the well fitted adsorption process to pseudo first order kinetic model due to the high similarity between calculated qe and experimental results moreover the value of k1 increased from 0 01 to 0 0097 with the application of higher adsorbent dosage due to the lower competition between nh4 n content to the iron silicate adsorbent surface site according to the results in nh4 n adsorption capacity and reduction rate the dosage of 100 g l iron silicate adsorbent was chosen for the further adsorption process as pre treatment method before tcl 1 cultivation table 1 presents the swine wastewater properties before and after the adsorption as pre treatment before cultivation process furthermore short extended study was carried out to observe the possibility of adsorbent reuse however the results were not the part of this study adsorbent reuse still presented nh4 n reduction in the range of 50 55 however the focus of this study was not in the adsorbent reuse performance therefore the results were not included as the main topic furthermore compared to several other types of adsorbent for nh4 n iron silicate carried out higher adsorption capacity 4 05 mg g natural bentonite and the modified bentonite with chitin had the ammonium adsorption capacity of 0 75 and 1 04 mg g respectively when applied for the wastewater 30 experiment on ammonia solution for the adsorption using vermiculite gravel paddy soil red soil and ceramsite presented the adsorption capacity of 3 3 0 77 0 59 0 55 and 0 11 mg g respectively 31 however various factors like adsorbent properties adsorption condition and wastewater composition will determine the adsorption mechanism and efficiency 3 2 tcl 1 biomass growth performance tcl 1 growth rate is another important parameter for the performance like nh4 n degradation co2 fixation and byproducts generation fig 3 shows the variation of ph value and biomass concentration during the cultivation period implementation of mf medium resulting the highest tcl 1 growth which probably due the cell adaptation since mf medium also applied in the pre cultivation step compared to the growth in the control mediums mf medium and dsww lower biomass productivity was achieved by the cultivation with swine wastewater after the adsorption pretreatment nevertheless higher growth occurred within 4 h compared to the cultivation using mf medium or diluted swine wastewater however the growth in further cultivation period was entering stationary phase and reached the final biomass productivity of 31 67 1 25 mg l h by the end of cultivation period compared to other microorganism the performance of tcl 1 was still high even though the growth result in the application of swine wastewater after adsorption pre treatment was lower than mf medium as control this result indicates the efficient nutrient consumption and transformation into energy atp and cell development by tcl 1 several important factors including ph temperature turbulences and light intensity are considered critical to microorganism growth 32 33 nevertheless cyanobacteria are known to have high endurance towards extreme environments such as temperature up to 70 c 34 high salinity of 70 g l nacl 35 and low water content 36 since ph value also is included in the important factors for microorganism growth the ph variation during cultivation are presented in fig 3 slight elevation with the implementation of swine wastewater was the effect of lower tcl 1 growth compared to the mf medium which had final ph value of 11 8 this result may also have occurred due to the carbonate ion content in the swine wastewater improved the buffer capacity in the system ph value change is also become the effect of co2 fixation process implementation of high light intensity in the tcl 1 cultivation system is important for photosynthetic process and calvin cycle especially in the regulation of involved enzymes common light intensity for the application of photosynthetic microorganisms were lower than in the tcl 1 cultivation system which used 1000 μe m 2 s 1 light intensity 37 38 however compared to previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 39 the growth result in the dsww application was lower which probably due to lower nitrogenous source in swine wastewater used in this study under the significant carbon source applied in both experiments 3 3 nitrogen transformation in the tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater nitrogen is the crucial nutrient for the growth of cyanobacteria which have the ability to utilize nh4 n no2 n no3 n among the nitrogen types that can be used nh4 n is the first option for nutrient source since direct uptake for cell synthesis will be applied by cyanobacteria while no2 n and no3 n will be indirectly used through assimilation route 32 36 fig 4 displays the result of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration variation during the cultivation period moreover in the swine wastewater nh4 n is the major nitrogen source for tcl 1 diluted swine wastewater had around 20 mg n l lower nh4 n concentration compared to the swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption the similar reduction trend was achieved by both types of applied swine wastewater nevertheless with the diluted swine wastewater rapid nh4 n concentration decrease occurred at the 8th hour while for the swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption nh4 n was fully diminished at the 10th h the applied high temperature and ph value can transform nh4 n into free nh3 however according to the previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 39 which applied similar cultivation condition only 40 transformation was occurred and indicated that biodegradation efficiency is higher moreover cyanobacteria which have the ability to live in alkaline condition can grow better in the toxic environment 32 tcl 1 carried out higher nitrogen uptake compared to cultivation of chlorella vulgaris mbfjnu 1 in undiluted swine slurry 38 slightly higher no3 n content was carried out by the swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption pretreatment but similar consumption trend was achieved by the cultivation with all type of applied swine wastewater the trend of nano3 consumption as the nitrogen source in mf medium was related with the trend of tcl 1 growth drastic reduction of no3 n concentration occurred until the 10th hour then stopped until the 12th hour and no significant nh4 n variation was detected in the mf medium the no3 n uptake rate of tcl 1 was higher than that of synechococcus sp strain pcc7942 with 0 7 mg n l h 40 for the case of no2 n low concentration in the range of 0 02 0 2 mg n l was observed in the application of swine wastewater during 12 h during the cultivation using mf medium no2 n was accumulated by the tcl 1 due to the consumption of no3 n in the form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din under the mechanism as reported in previous study of kadir et al 41 this result is also similar with the previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 39 which also presented the slight increment of no2 n content during the tcl 1 cultivation using mf medium however no2 n is an unstable species of nitrogen and easily influenced by the presence of other elements such as oxygen therefore its amount varied nevertheless the amount of no2 n was the least during the cultivation period and the variation was small 3 4 tcl 1 co2 fixation performance two important enzymes carbonic anhydrase and ribulose 1 5 biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco are responsible for the co2 fixation process in cyanobacteria cell especially for the regulation of atmospheric co2 or carbonate interaction calvin cycle and ph value balance 32 cyanobacteria have the ability to increase the affinity between dissolved co2 concentration and rubisco enzyme 18 which in tcl 1 will specifically regulated by the sbta gene 42 in this study the efficiency of tcl 1 co2 fixation performance was achieved by the calculation of carbon content change due to the consumption of additional 113 2 mm dic in the growth medium to simulate the supply of sufficient dissolved co2 the results of carbon content change and co2 fixation rate are displayed in table 2 similar results of tcl 1 co2 fixation rate were achieved by the cultivation in mf medium and 5 dilution swine wastewater which reached 123 91 3 66 and 138 96 23 91 mg l h respectively on the other hand cultivation with swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption carried out lower co2 fixation rate was occurred cultivation of chlorella vulgaris mbfjnu 1 presented lower co2 fixation rate 18 9 mg l h 38 than tcl 1 after adsorption pretreatment in this study 57 5 mg l h this result was occurred due to the fast biomass growth and efficient dic consumption of tcl 1 biomass therefore tcl 1 cultivation is considered as the potential strategy to be applied in the co2 fixation process 3 5 tcl 1 phycobiliprotein production the ability of cyanobacteria to produce various bio products during the cultivation including tcl 1 that has been known to be efficient producer for carbohydrate lipid and pigments phycobiliprotein and carotenoid this study is focused on the production of phycobiliprotein from the tcl 1 cultivation containing cp apc and pe which are illustrated in fig 5 among phycobiliprotein types cpc is the major production from tcl 1 using various growth medium cpc plays an important role in the light energy harvesting process for tcl 1 in the application of mf medium as the control of synthetic medium growth slight increment trend was achieved compared to the swine wastewater which remained stable until the final cultivation hour the produced cpc by tcl 1 were in the range of 7 3 9 4 of dry weight cell after 12 h cultivation different production trends were shown by apc and pe with the implementation of mf medium and swine wastewater mf medium cultivation generated lower apc and pe content cultivation using diluted swine wastewater or the swine wastewater after iron silicate pre treatment generated 1 5 3 times higher apc and pe content with the implementation of swine wastewater apc and pe contents in tcl 1 dry weight cell after 12 h cultivation were in the range of 6 0 7 3 and 0 9 0 6 respectively decreasing growth rate might influence the photosynthetic activity in the cell and cause the stressful environment and initiate the protective system such as phenolic compound or antioxidant pigments like phycobiliprotein however further prolong harmful environment like high ph will be able to cease the function of those protection system 17 the high ph value during tcl 1 cultivation in this study may affect the produced phycobiliprotein content this result is similar with previous study of ismaiel el ayouty 17 that presented 2 6 times lower c phycocyanin content from a platensis when the ph reach to 10 5 compared to the ph of 9 0 several other factors also influence the cyanobacteria phycobiliprotein production content and composition of cyanobacteria including types of microorganism metal content 43 light colour light intensity and light source 44 besides the content different trends were also appeared in the purity index of produced pycobiliprotein which are displayed in table 3 phycobiliprotein purity index could be defined as the ratio between the active pigment substance to the total protein impurities 16 under the cultivation using swine wastewater tcl 1 generated phycobiliprotein with higher purity index than in mf medium the extraction method to harvest phycobiliprotein content in the cell will influence the value of purity index physical extraction method will gain lower purity index due to the presence of broken cell organelles which contains protein release moreover the permeabilisation method using enzyme such as lysozyme will enhance the purity index value 45 purity index with the value of 0 7 is considered as the food grade 16 moreover the produced phycobiliprotein purity index in this study was in the range of 0 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 0 3 0 6 for cpc apc and pe respectively slightly lower purity index value was detected at the final cultivation hour which indicated the increasing of protein impurities may be due to the deceased cell organelles release however this purity index result was still higher than the a platensis which generated the phycobiliprotein complex with the purity index value of 0 4 0 6 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 3 for cpc apc and pe respectively 16 moreover even though the higher phycobiliprotein content was produced by previous study of khatoon kok leong 44 please see table 3 its purity index was lower 0 84 compared to the result in this study 4 conclusion implementation of iron silicate adsorption for nh4 n removal in swine wastewater has been observed as the pre treatment strategy of tcl 1 cultivation iron silicate adsorption process with the dosage of 100 g l carried out the efficient adsorption process to reduce nh4 n therefore the common dilution process can be eliminated wastewater after iron silicate adsorption was directly applied as the nutrient source for tcl 1 cultivation under the light intensity of 1000 μe m2 s in flat panel photobioreactor fpbr to degrade inorganic nitrogen and co2 in the form of inorganic carbon the performance of cultivation with swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption pre treatment was lower than mf medium or diluted swine wastewater however these results were still higher than the application of other microalgae with the biomass growth rate value of 31 67 mg l h and nitrogen uptake of 2 55 mg n g biomass h and no dilution process was needed efficient dic consumption led to high co2 fixation rate of 57 54 6 09 mg l h higher phycobiliprotein content was generated by the cultivation with swine wastewater than mf medium this study provided a good strategy for efficient nh4 n removal to reduce water demand along with the high performance of co2 fixation and nutrient degradation in real swine wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

13304,implementation of photosynthetic microorganism like thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 is considered as an eco friendly strategy for carbon dioxide fixation and nutrient utilization in wastewater however high level of ammoniacal nitrogen carries out toxicity to tcl 1 cell and adsorption can be applied as a pre treatment stage this study observed application of iron silicate on ammoniacal nitrogen adsorption in non sterilized and undiluted swine wastewater as pre treatment for tcl 1 cultivation for co2 fixation nh4 n degradation and phycobiliprotein generation the utilization of 100 g l iron silicate performed efficient adsorption with the quantity of 4 05 mg n g fe si and fitted the pseudo first order adsorption with r2 value of 0 993 the adsorption pre treated swine wastewater was implemented as tcl 1 growth medium under the 1000 μe m2 s light intensity for 12 h the tcl 1 biomass growth co2 fixation and nh4 n removal rate during cultivation period reached to 31 67 1 25 57 54 6 09 and 6 05 0 20 mg l h respectively phycobiliprotein as a byproduct was generated with the productivity of 13 9 mg g h thus coupling iron silicate for pre treatment step of tcl 1 cultivation in swine wastewater is eco friendly strategy to reduce water demand for dilution ignite phycobiliprotein accumulation during the co2 fixation and nutrient utilization process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption swine wastewater thermosynechococcus co2 fixation phycocyanin 1 introduction recent carbon dioxide co2 concentration elevated to 417 1 ppm per may 2020 noaa global monitoring laboratory leads to global warming issue common carbon capture storage strategies the physiochemical process require high energy and cost during the operation maintenance or transportation 1 photosynthetic microorganism and terrestrial plant have the ability to consume co2 and apply it as the carbon source in calvin cycle thus the application of biological fixation especially photosynthetic microorganism is considered as the efficient strategy to eliminate the atmospheric co2 concentration 2 other environmental issue is produced by the high volume of ammonium nh4 n discharge from the swine wastewater due to the global pork demand rising taiwan as one of the global pork meat supplier provides around 5 4 million heads of swine 3 4 china as the supplier of 47 8 global pork meat demand annually discharged swine wastewater with the ammonium nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp weight of 0 29 1 39 and 0 23 million tons respectively in 2014 3 commonly the swine wastewater contains 3000 15 000 mg l of chemical oxygen demand cod 400 1400 mg n l of nh4 n 600 1200 mg n l of tn 100 250 mg l of tp and high concentration of fecal coliform 5 several conventional methods such as chemical and implementation of biological nitrogen removal like anammox or autotrophic nitrogen microbes were commonly applied to eliminate nh4 n and tn content in wastewater 6 7 however the high cost of chemical nh4 n uptake method and the slow growing rate or cod sensitive characteristic of autotrophic nitrogen microbes such as ammonia oxidizer nitrite oxidizer and anammox bacteria are considered as the disadvantages of those strategy implementation 8 9 symbiotic of microalgae chlorella with the bacteria consortium in anaerobic digestate including proteobacteria arcobacter cryaerophillus and nitrosomonas eutropha bacteriodetes aequorivita cryomorphaceae or firmicutes has been examined on its nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment during 9 days experimental period 10 algae bacteria symbiosis which chlorella sp and coelastrella sp were the inserted microalgae while bacteriodetes euryarchaeota firmicutes and proteobacteria were in the bacteria communities improved the nh4 removal during 8 day cultivation period 11 thus heterotrophic and mixothropic cyanobacteria which offer fast growing rate is considered as good method to decrease nitrogenous compounds in wastewater various microalgae and cyanobacteria as the photosynthetic microorganism have been applied for the wastewater degradation and combined with the strategy of co2 fixation to provide their energy 2 thermosynechococcus sp cl 1 tcl 1 an isolated cyanobacterium from a hot spring in eastern taiwan has been acknowledged for its performance in co2 fixation estrogen degradation and byproducts production tcl 1 originally grows at high temperature of 62 c and alkaline ph condition of 9 3 12 but has been developed to the temperature of 45 55 c and ph of 7 0 10 5 13 moreover tcl 1 is adaptable to high light intensity of 250 2000 μe m2 s high endurance to utilize the nutrient in swine wastewater and generates various bio materials simultaneously 14 15 according to the previous study of narindri rara winayu tung lai 14 tcl 1 has the ability to produce several pigment contents including phycobiliprotein groups pigment phycobiliprotein in the cyanobacteria cells was used as the light harvesting protein pigment that located on the outer surface of thylakoid membrane phycobiliprotein groups are divided into three big groups c phycocyanin allophycocyanin and phycoerythrin based on the different protein structure 16 phycobiliprotein is the pigment group that has been widely used in food and drugs industries due to the therapeutic characteristic 17 therefore tcl 1 implementation is recommended as the eco friendly method in degrading wastewater pollutants resulting in high rate of microbial growth and nutrients elimination 1 3 however the high nutrient content in wastewater that can carry out toxicity into biomass cell is become the limitation in direct cultivation of microorganisms 18 efficient methods are required to control the nutrient content of wastewater before the cultivation process numerous studies choose dilution process using various type of water or wastewater as the simple strategy to achieve the required concentration range of nutrient in the wastewater for microorganism growth chlorella vulgaris jsc 6 has been cultivated in the diluted 5 20 folds swine wastewater while chlorella zofingiensis and tribonema sp have been cultivated in the swine wastewater diluted with fishery wastewater 19 20 nevertheless the dilution process will increase the water requirement reduce wastewater degradation efficiency and rises required cost during the cultivation period therefore other strategies including adsorption or membrane utilization are considered as the efficient pre treatment method for wastewater before the cultivation silicate sio2 is the common applied material to provide oh surface group for the metal particle deposition for various functions moreover sio2 shell has the prevention ability towards agglomeration and oxidation while simultaneously support the mass transfer between metal particle like fe and contaminants 21 dispersion of iron based material in matrixes like ceramic and sio2 for various application 22 due to the high potency and selectivity 23 in this study iron silicate adsorbent was focused on the nh4 n adsorption as the swine wastewater pre treatment strategy before the tcl 1 cultivation experiment pre treated swine wastewater will be used as nutrient supply in tcl 1 cultivation using flat panel photobioreactors to reduce nutrient and produce phycobiliprotein pigments as valuable byproducts the combination of adsorption and tcl 1 cultivation is a potential strategy to reduce process cost and reaches the sustainability in wastewater utilization 2 materials and methods 2 1 iron silicate adsorbent and swine wastewater iron silicate adsorbent was made by the department of chemistry national cheng kung university according to the modification from previous

water and 6 67 g sodium alginate and stirred for 24 h the homogenous mixture was then dropped into 2 cacl2 solution to form the granule droplets was then washed with di water and dried in an oven with the temperature of 105 c overnight applied swine wastewater in the study was taken from anoxic tank of taiwan sugar company s pig farm wastewater treatment plant in tainan taiwan table 1 summarizes the swine wastewater properties during the study no sterilization method was applied for swine wastewater moreover no filtration or centrifugation method was carried out for the suspended solid separation in swine wastewater throughout the study 2 2 iron silicate adsorption to reduce swine wastewater nh4 n concentration experimental study on the adsorption performance was conducted triplicate using a serum bottle with the small working volume of 50 ml wastewater various amounts of iron silicate in the concentration range of 50 150 g l wastewater were examined for its efficiency on removal of nh4 n content in swine wastewater serum bottle was placed on the 100 rpm shaker at room temperature of 25 c for 5 h adequate liquid sample was taken every 30 min to observe the adsorption process of nh4 n into iron silicate adsorbent along with the transformation of other inorganic nitrogen species no3 n and no2 n optimum adsorption result will be applied in the further 1 l

dissolved inorganic carbon dic the additional dic in the medium was given as the combination of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate and simulated the concentration of almost saturated co2 in the chemical scrubber of industrial flue gas all prepared media were sterilized using an autoclave tomin tm 328 for 20 min at temperature of 121 c in the beginning of pre cultivation stages cultivation was conducted using 1 l serum bottle reactor with 1 fold mf medium and incubation in the 50 c incubator equipped with 200 μe m2 s light source and 0 5 vvm aeration eventually the biomass will be moved to various working volume of acrylic flat panel photobioreactors fpbr under the same cultivation condition but supplied with 3 folds mf medium in the final pre cultivation stage the 30 l fpbr was applied and the liquid was taken out for the biomass harvesting process every 3 days the taken volume was replaced by the new 3 fold mf medium for the growth maintenance 2 4 experimental cultivation condition two types of other additional medium were used as the experimental control in this study to compare the growth in synthetic medium 5 folds mf medium supplemented with g solution and 29 2 mm

pretreated swine wastewater after the separation from iron silicate adsorbent to separate harvested biomass from the 30 l fpbr in pre cultivation stage centrifugation kubota 5930 with 3430 g for 10 min was applied solid part from the centrifugation with the concentration of 2 g l was then mixed with various prepared growth medium mf medium 5 folds diluted swine wastewater dsww and swine wastewater pre treated with iron silicate adsorbent fe si sww experimental study was conducted in 1 l fpbr according to the previous study design of chu narindri under the application of 1000 μe m2 s light intensity temperature of 50 c and 0 5 vvm air aeration for 12 h in an incubator according to the optimum condition achieved in the previous study of narindri rara winayu tung lai 14 every 2 h sufficient volume of tcl 1 sample was taken from the reactor for further analysis 2 5 analytical method to observe the indicators of iron silicate adsorption the nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were measured 30

wastewater moreover other type of nitrogen may transform during the process therefore fig 1 displays the transformation of various inorganic nitrogen types in adsorption process for all cases of applied adsorbent dosage swine wastewater ph value increased from 7 1 to 7 8 iron silicate adsorbent was synthesized under an alkaline solution thus some hydroxide ions oh chelated on the fe3 sites in the iron silicate structure supplementary a when adding to the nh3 nh4 solution at ph higher than 7 0 the ammonia molecule with lone pair electron have a lager chelating strength than that of the oh or h2o which can replace the oh or h2o because of the release of the alkaline oh ions the ph value of the solution slightly raised after nh3 adsorption application of higher dosage of adsorbent caused the faster decline in nh4 n concentration for all cases of applied dosage iron silicate adsorption process reached equilibrium in short period around 120 min after the first contact of adsorbent and with the highest reduction carried out by the dosage of 150 g l however similar elimination rate was achieved by the implementation of 100 and 150 g l iron silicate adsorbent with the slope of 0 0069 and 0 0097 respectively during first 60 min of adsorption period further adsorption period resulting in the stable nh4 n concentration which indicated the equilibrium state of adsorption process no3 n content in swine wastewater increased at the first 30 min of adsorption period and become stable until the end of the process this elevation might occur due to the no3 n release from the adsorbent material and confirmed by infra red ir spectrum of iron silicate in supplementary a during the doping process in adsorbent production excess fe no3 3 was applied the presence of a vibration band at 1385 cm 1 in the ir spectrum indicates the residual nitrate ions in the iron silicate adsorbent the remaining no3 in the adsorbent material could be released during the adsorption process thus a higher amount of no3 n content was accumulated in the implementation of higher adsorbent dosages for all implemented adsorbent dosages the no2 n concentration reduced during the first 30 min but with the lower capacity compared to the other types of inorganic nitrogen reduction of no2 n was carried out by iron silicate adsorbent with the range of 0 2 0 3 mg n l further adsorption process caused slight variation of no2 n content in swine wastewater with the range of 0 001 0 29 mg n l low difference results of no2 n and no3 n content during adsorption process proved that the iron silicate adsorption was selectively focused on nh4 n content therefore further study on adsorption kinetics will be focused on nh4 n content adsorption kinetics to observe adsorption rate and mechanism can be conducted using pseudo first order and second order kinetic model which are displayed in fig 2 compared to pseudo second order higher r2 result was achieved by the calculation of pseudo first order equation with application of 100 g l iron silicate adsorbent dosage r2 0 993 these results indicated the well fitted adsorption process to pseudo first order kinetic model due to the high similarity between calculated qe and experimental results moreover the value of k1 increased from 0 01 to 0 0097 with the application of higher adsorbent dosage due to the lower competition between nh4 n content to the iron silicate adsorbent surface site according to the results in nh4 n adsorption capacity and reduction rate the dosage of 100 g l iron silicate adsorbent was chosen for the further adsorption process as pre treatment method before tcl 1 cultivation table 1 presents the swine wastewater properties before and after the adsorption as pre treatment before cultivation process furthermore short extended study was carried out to observe the possibility of adsorbent reuse however the results were not the part of this study adsorbent reuse still presented nh4 n reduction in the range of 50 55 however the focus of this study was not in the adsorbent reuse performance therefore the results were not included as the main topic furthermore compared to several other types of adsorbent for nh4 n iron silicate carried out higher adsorption capacity 4 05 mg g natural bentonite and the modified bentonite with chitin had the ammonium adsorption capacity of 0 75 and 1 04 mg g respectively when applied for the wastewater 30 experiment on ammonia solution for the adsorption using vermiculite gravel paddy soil red soil and ceramsite presented the adsorption capacity of 3 3 0 77 0 59 0 55 and 0 11 mg g respectively 31 however various factors like adsorbent properties adsorption condition and wastewater composition will determine the adsorption mechanism and efficiency 3 2 tcl 1 biomass growth performance tcl 1 growth rate is another important parameter for the performance like nh4 n degradation co2 fixation and byproducts generation fig 3 shows the variation of ph value and biomass concentration during the cultivation period implementation of mf medium resulting the highest tcl 1 growth which probably due the cell adaptation since mf medium also applied in the pre cultivation step compared to the growth in the control mediums mf medium and dsww lower biomass productivity was achieved by the cultivation with swine wastewater after the adsorption pretreatment nevertheless higher growth occurred within 4 h compared to the cultivation using mf medium or diluted swine wastewater however the growth in further cultivation period was entering stationary phase and reached the final biomass productivity of 31 67 1 25 mg l h by the end of cultivation period compared to other microorganism the performance of tcl 1 was still high even though the growth result in the application of swine wastewater after adsorption pre treatment was lower than mf medium as control this result indicates the efficient nutrient consumption and transformation into energy atp and cell development by tcl 1 several important factors including ph temperature turbulences and light intensity are considered critical to microorganism growth 32 33 nevertheless cyanobacteria are known to have high endurance towards extreme environments such as temperature up to 70 c 34 high salinity of 70 g l nacl 35 and low water content 36 since ph value also is included in the important factors for microorganism growth the ph variation during cultivation are presented in fig 3 slight elevation with the implementation of swine wastewater was the effect of lower tcl 1 growth compared to the mf medium which had final ph value of 11 8 this result may also have occurred due to the carbonate ion content in the swine wastewater improved the buffer capacity in the system ph value change is also become the effect of co2 fixation process implementation of high light intensity in the tcl 1 cultivation system is important for photosynthetic process and calvin cycle especially in the regulation of involved enzymes common light intensity for the application of photosynthetic microorganisms were lower than in the tcl 1 cultivation system which used 1000 μe m 2 s 1 light intensity 37 38 however compared to previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 39 the growth result in the dsww application was lower which probably due to lower nitrogenous source in swine wastewater used in this study under the significant carbon source applied in both experiments 3 3 nitrogen transformation in the tcl 1 cultivation using swine wastewater nitrogen is the crucial nutrient for the growth of cyanobacteria which have the ability to utilize nh4 n no2 n no3 n among the nitrogen types that can be used nh4 n is the first option for nutrient source since direct uptake for cell synthesis will be applied by cyanobacteria while no2 n and no3 n will be indirectly used through assimilation route 32 36 fig 4 displays the result of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n concentration variation during the cultivation period moreover in the swine wastewater nh4 n is the major nitrogen source for tcl 1 diluted swine wastewater had around 20 mg n l lower nh4 n concentration compared to the swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption the similar reduction trend was achieved by both types of applied swine wastewater nevertheless with the diluted swine wastewater rapid nh4 n concentration decrease occurred at the 8th hour while for the swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption nh4 n was fully diminished at the 10th h the applied high temperature and ph value can transform nh4 n into free nh3 however according to the previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 39 which applied similar cultivation condition only 40 transformation was occurred and indicated that biodegradation efficiency is higher moreover cyanobacteria which have the ability to live in alkaline condition can grow better in the toxic environment 32 tcl 1 carried out higher nitrogen uptake compared to cultivation of chlorella vulgaris mbfjnu 1 in undiluted swine slurry 38 slightly higher no3 n content was carried out by the swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption pretreatment but similar consumption trend was achieved by the cultivation with all type of applied swine wastewater the trend of nano3 consumption as the nitrogen source in mf medium was related with the trend of tcl 1 growth drastic reduction of no3 n concentration occurred until the 10th hour then stopped until the 12th hour and no significant nh4 n variation was detected in the mf medium the no3 n uptake rate of tcl 1 was higher than that of synechococcus sp strain pcc7942 with 0 7 mg n l h 40 for the case of no2 n low concentration in the range of 0 02 0 2 mg n l was observed in the application of swine wastewater during 12 h during the cultivation using mf medium no2 n was accumulated by the tcl 1 due to the consumption of no3 n in the form of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din under the mechanism as reported in previous study of kadir et al 41 this result is also similar with the previous study of narindri rara winayu et al 39 which also presented the slight increment of no2 n content during the tcl 1 cultivation using mf medium however no2 n is an unstable species of nitrogen and easily influenced by the presence of other elements such as oxygen therefore its amount varied nevertheless the amount of no2 n was the least during the cultivation period and the variation was small 3 4 tcl 1 co2 fixation performance two important enzymes carbonic anhydrase and ribulose 1 5 biphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco are responsible for the co2 fixation process in cyanobacteria cell especially for the regulation of atmospheric co2 or carbonate interaction calvin cycle and ph value balance 32 cyanobacteria have the ability to increase the affinity between dissolved co2 concentration and rubisco enzyme 18 which in tcl 1 will specifically regulated by the sbta gene 42 in this study the efficiency of tcl 1 co2 fixation performance was achieved by the calculation of carbon content change due to the consumption of additional 113 2 mm dic in the growth medium to simulate the supply of sufficient dissolved co2 the results of carbon content change and co2 fixation rate are displayed in table 2 similar results of tcl 1 co2 fixation rate were achieved by the cultivation in mf medium and 5 dilution swine wastewater which reached 123 91 3 66 and 138 96 23 91 mg l h respectively on the other hand cultivation with swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption carried out lower co2 fixation rate was occurred cultivation of chlorella vulgaris mbfjnu 1 presented lower co2 fixation rate 18 9 mg l h 38 than tcl 1 after adsorption pretreatment in this study 57 5 mg l h this result was occurred due to the fast biomass growth and efficient dic consumption of tcl 1 biomass therefore tcl 1 cultivation is considered as the potential strategy to be applied in the co2 fixation process 3 5 tcl 1 phycobiliprotein production the ability of cyanobacteria to produce various bio products during the cultivation including tcl 1 that has been known to be efficient producer for carbohydrate lipid and pigments phycobiliprotein and carotenoid this study is focused on the production of phycobiliprotein from the tcl 1 cultivation containing cp apc and pe which are illustrated in fig 5 among phycobiliprotein types cpc is the major production from tcl 1 using various growth medium cpc plays an important role in the light energy harvesting process for tcl 1 in the application of mf medium as the control of synthetic medium growth slight increment trend was achieved compared to the swine wastewater which remained stable until the final cultivation hour the produced cpc by tcl 1 were in the range of 7 3 9 4 of dry weight cell after 12 h cultivation different production trends were shown by apc and pe with the implementation of mf medium and swine wastewater mf medium cultivation generated lower apc and pe content cultivation using diluted swine wastewater or the swine wastewater after iron silicate pre treatment generated 1 5 3 times higher apc and pe content with the implementation of swine wastewater apc and pe contents in tcl 1 dry weight cell after 12 h cultivation were in the range of 6 0 7 3 and 0 9 0 6 respectively decreasing growth rate might influence the photosynthetic activity in the cell and cause the stressful environment and initiate the protective system such as phenolic compound or antioxidant pigments like phycobiliprotein however further prolong harmful environment like high ph will be able to cease the function of those protection system 17 the high ph value during tcl 1 cultivation in this study may affect the produced phycobiliprotein content this result is similar with previous study of ismaiel el ayouty 17 that presented 2 6 times lower c phycocyanin content from a platensis when the ph reach to 10 5 compared to the ph of 9 0 several other factors also influence the cyanobacteria phycobiliprotein production content and composition of cyanobacteria including types of microorganism metal content 43 light colour light intensity and light source 44 besides the content different trends were also appeared in the purity index of produced pycobiliprotein which are displayed in table 3 phycobiliprotein purity index could be defined as the ratio between the active pigment substance to the total protein impurities 16 under the cultivation using swine wastewater tcl 1 generated phycobiliprotein with higher purity index than in mf medium the extraction method to harvest phycobiliprotein content in the cell will influence the value of purity index physical extraction method will gain lower purity index due to the presence of broken cell organelles which contains protein release moreover the permeabilisation method using enzyme such as lysozyme will enhance the purity index value 45 purity index with the value of 0 7 is considered as the food grade 16 moreover the produced phycobiliprotein purity index in this study was in the range of 0 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 0 3 0 6 for cpc apc and pe respectively slightly lower purity index value was detected at the final cultivation hour which indicated the increasing of protein impurities may be due to the deceased cell organelles release however this purity index result was still higher than the a platensis which generated the phycobiliprotein complex with the purity index value of 0 4 0 6 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 3 for cpc apc and pe respectively 16 moreover even though the higher phycobiliprotein content was produced by previous study of khatoon kok leong 44 please see table 3 its purity index was lower 0 84 compared to the result in this study 4 conclusion implementation of iron silicate adsorption for nh4 n removal in swine wastewater has been observed as the pre treatment strategy of tcl 1 cultivation iron silicate adsorption process with the dosage of 100 g l carried out the efficient adsorption process to reduce nh4 n therefore the common dilution process can be eliminated wastewater after iron silicate adsorption was directly applied as the nutrient source for tcl 1 cultivation under the light intensity of 1000 μe m2 s in flat panel photobioreactor fpbr to degrade inorganic nitrogen and co2 in the form of inorganic carbon the performance of cultivation with swine wastewater after iron silicate adsorption pre treatment was lower than mf medium or diluted swine wastewater however these results were still higher than the application of other microalgae with the biomass growth rate value of 31 67 mg l h and nitrogen uptake of 2 55 mg n g biomass h and no dilution process was needed efficient dic consumption led to high co2 fixation rate of 57 54 6 09 mg l h higher phycobiliprotein content was generated by the cultivation with swine wastewater than mf medium this study provided a good strategy for efficient nh4 n removal to reduce water demand along with the high performance of co2 fixation and nutrient degradation in real swine wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
