7305,the hydrological regime of a lake is largely dependent on its bathymetry a dramatic water level reduction has occurred in poyang lake in recent years coinciding with significant bed erosion few studies have focused on the influence of bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in such a complex river lake floodplain system this study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes 1998 2010 on the water level spatiotemporal distribution in poyang lake based on a dry year 2006 a wet year 2010 and an average year 2000 2010 the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 the bed erosion of the northern outlet channel averaged 3 m resulting in a decrease in the water level by 1 2 2 m in the northern channels the most significantly influenced areas and approximately 0 3 m in the central lake areas during low level periods the water levels below 16 m and 14 m were significantly affected during the rising period and recession period respectively the water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels 2 the water surface profiles adjusted and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased by 0 5 3 1 cm d at the lake outlet the bathymetric influence extended across the entire lake due to the emptying effect resulting in a change in the water level distribution the average annual outflow increased by 6 8 3 the bathymetric changes contributed approximately 14 4 to the extreme low water level in autumn 2006 and enhanced the drought in the dry season this study quantified the impact of the bathymetric changes on the lake water levels thereby providing a better understanding of the potential effects of continued sand mining operations and providing scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of poyang lake moreover this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes keywords bathymetric changes hydrodynamic model low water level spatiotemporal distribution poyang lake 1 introduction hydrological and hydrodynamic processes are strongly dependent on the bathymetry especially in shallow systems characterized by extensive floodplains baugh et al 2013 french 2008 the bathymetry of coastal or lake areas may be altered by external forcing such as river discharge oceanic tides and sea level rise as well as sediment transfer erosion and deposition mitchell and uncles 2013 prandle 2004 xu et al 2006 hurricane and tsunami events radically change bathymetry goto et al 2011 ranasinghe et al 2013 bathymetric changes can also be directly initiated by anthropogenic interventions such as sand mining maa et al 2004 channel deepening and dredging de jonge et al 2014 van maren et al 2015 and gold rushes foxgrover et al 2004 bathymetric changes affect wave and sediment transport patterns

resulting variations in the hydrodynamics and sediment transport process disturb the natural erosion and sedimentation patterns jonge 1983 further enhancing the bathymetric changes a floodplain environment varies continuously in both space and time the bathymetric changes in a floodplain lake result in changes in the inundation processes affecting the water level inundation extent and timing hardy et al 1999 malhadas et al 2009 marks et al 2000 which further influence the biogeochemical processes occurring in the floodplains as important components of river floodplain systems floodplain channels play a key role in hydrodynamic exchange and sediment transport for example deeper channels provide preferential flow paths across the floodplain trigg et al 2012 filling of the floodplain channels within the atchafalaya river basin over the last 100 years has resulted in decreased flow velocities diverted channels and reduced suspended sediment concentrations kroes and kraemer 2013 poyang lake is the largest floodplain lake in china and is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river it is a highly valued water resource with a particularly complex hydrological regime and topography poyang lake has experienced floods and droughts at a much higher frequency over the past 50 years due to naturally occurring climate variability coinciding with increased human activities gemmer et al 2008 nakayama and shankman 2013 shankman et al 2006 ye et al 2011 as an internationally important wetland and the largest bird conservation area for migratory birds worldwide poyang lake has important ecological functions hui et al 2008 the lake receives catchment runoff from five tributary rivers and subsequently discharges into the yangtze river through the hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake during the flood season of the local catchment from april to june poyang lake has the largest outflow to the yangtze river exerting a strong pressure guo et al 2011 the yangtze river affects poyang lake by creating an outflow blocking effect and reversing water flow when the blocking pressure is sufficiently large hu et al 2007 the blocking and potential reverse flow from the yangtze river to poyang lake is strongest during the peak discharge of the yangtze river from july to september guo et al 2011 the spatiotemporal patterns of these two different hydrological processes indicate a considerable variation in the water level and surface area within and between years spatiotemporal heterogeneity in floodplain systems due to river lake interactions makes understanding the highly dynamic hydrological regime more challenging poyang lake has experienced new and more severe dry conditions since 2000 zhang et al 2014 compared to the lake water levels reported in previous decades the lake water levels dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded during 2001 2010 zhang et al 2014 resulting in significant decreases in the lake area feng et al 2012a the higher frequency of extremely low water levels in recent years has affected not only the agriculture transportation and urban water supplies but also wetland and aquatic habitats liu et al 2015 a number of studies of this low water level analysed the effects of climate change rainfall runoff river lake interactions and other factors feng et al 2012b liu et al 2013 yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the scientific consensus that was reached suggested that the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river was the primary cause for the decreased lake level in autumn in recent years the dramatic decrease in the poyang lake level during the dry seasons has coincided with significant bathymetric changes in the past 50 years many processes have resulted in bathymetric changes in poyang lake from 1960 to 1998 over 850 km2 of lake area was reclaimed ye et al 2012 resulting in a decrease in the lake volume of approximately 15 min 2000 after 1998 the reclaimed land was restored intensive sand mining in poyang lake initiated in 2000 the volume of mined sand was approximately 1 29 109 m3 during 2000 2010 almost 6 5 times the volume of natural sediment that accumulated during 1955 2010 jiang et al 2015 due to the widespread sand mining in this area the bed elevation of the north hukou outflow channel decreased by approximately 5 9 m during the past decade de leeuw et al 2010 feng et al 2011 used modis 250 m resolution data to derive the bottom topography of poyang lake and observed high inter annual variability from 2000 to 2009 zhang et al 2016 used medium resolution satellite images to construct annual and quasi annual topographic maps of poyang lake from 2000 to 2010 and found that the average elevation of the lakebed relative to the sea level decreased by 14 4 cm yr from 2000 to 2010 lai et al 2014 used surveyed and remote sensing data to examine the impact of sand mining on the low water level they showed that the discharge ability of poyang lake into the yangtze river at low water levels during the dry season has increased 1 5 2 times due to sand mining these studies indicated that bathymetric change could be one of the important factors triggering the decrease in the water level of poyang lake during the dry season however the previous studies did not demonstrate the spatiotemporal impacts of the bathymetric changes on the low water level in poyang lake elucidating the causes of the low water levels and additional variation in the hydrological regime in this complex floodplain lake is scientifically important on the basis of typical hydrological years for poyang lake this study explores the spatiotemporal impacts of the bathymetric changes on the water level using a hydrodynamic model combined with long term hydrological observations the objective of this paper is to characterize and quantify the spatiotemporal influences of the bathymetric changes in the lake level the aim of this study is to quantify the impact of the bathymetric changes on the frequent low water level events to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts of continued sand mining and provide scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of poyang lake moreover this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river at latitudes between 28 24 and 29 46 n and longitudes between 115 49 and 116 46 e fig 1 a the catchment area of poyang lake is 1 62 105 km2 the catchment has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1654 mm an average temperature of 17 6 c and an annual potential evapotranspiration of 1049 mm year zhang et al 2014 poyang lake spans 170 km from north to south and as much as 74 km from east to west lai et al 2014 shaped by a combination of lacustrine and riverine morphological processes the lake is characterized by a complex topography including narrow channels islands and large areas of floodplain the elevation of the lake bottom is lower than 2 m in the northern channels and higher than 14 m in the southern deltas wusong datum which is also the water surface elevation system used in this study generally decreasing from south upstream to north downstream fig 1b poyang lake receives water from five rivers in the catchment the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers fig 1a poyang lake exchanges water with the yangtze river via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1a fig 2 a shows the average variation in the discharge to poyang lake from the catchment the yangtze river discharge at hankou station and the lake water level at the xingzi gauging station which is located at the northern end of the lake and approximately 39 km from the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 the catchment inflows vary considerably throughout the year ranging between 1 4 103 m3 s and 12 0 103 m3 s based on the annual average variation from 1953 to 2010 the yangtze river discharge also has an evident seasonal variation with a mean annual variation between 8 1 103 m3 s and 44 4 103 m3 s from 1960 to 2010 however a time lag exists in the peak discharge of the yangtze river relative to the maximum catchment inflow generally the peak discharge of the catchment inflows occurs between april and june and therefore precedes the peak discharge of the yangtze river between july and september guo et al 2012 spatial variations in the bathymetry and seasonal variations in the catchment inflows and yangtze river flow complicate the fluctuations in the lake level and area the annual average fluctuations in the water level vary by 8 18 m fig 2a the water level decreases from kangshan upstream to hukou downstream according to the variation in the bed elevation fig 2b the water level gradient between the upstream and downstream increases with the decrease in the water level the hydrological regime of poyang lake includes four periods a water level rising period march june a high water level period july august a water level recession period september october and a low water level period november february the lake fluctuates from inundated floodplains at high water levels to little more than a river at low water levels with the lake area varying from more than 3000 km2 to less than 1000 km2 respectively feng et al 2012a z zhang et al 2015 during the water level rising period march june the water level of poyang lake is mainly controlled by seasonal variations in the catchment inflows hu et al 2007 shankman et al 2006 the lake catchment plays a primary role in determining the lake water level especially during severe flooding events hu et al 2007 however during the high water level and recession periods the changes in the flow regime of the yangtze river strongly influence the blocking force of the river on the outflow from poyang lake hu et al 2007 this influence affects the lake level water storage and associated seasonal variations in poyang lake guo et al 2012 during the low water level period november february the water level of poyang lake is dominated by the lake catchment and the effect of the yangtze river is insignificant 2 2 data availability seven downstream gauging stations qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng fig 1 a were used to represent the catchment inflows from the five major rivers the observed daily streamflows at these seven gauging stations were obtained from 1953 to 2010 the daily water levels of five of the gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan from downstream to upstream as shown in fig 1b from 1960 to 2010 were used to represent the water levels in the downstream central and upstream areas of poyang lake digital elevation models dems of poyang lake from 1 10 000 maps surveyed in 1998 and 2010 were used to describe the bathymetric changes the two dems were compared at five cross sections to analyse the local bathymetric changes the locations of the cross sections are identified as cs1 the location of a planned water control structure cs2 near xingzi cs3 near duchang cs4 in the central lake area and cs5 in the southern lake area fig 1b all the data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china 2 3 hydrodynamic model poyang lake is shallow and wide therefore vertical stratification in the water column can be neglected li and yao 2015 hence a 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was implemented using the mike 21 flow model mike 21 was developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi to simulate water environments in lakes estuaries bays coastal areas and seas dhi 2009a this model solves the vertically averaged and reynolds averaged equations representing the conservation of mass and momentum by using a finite volume approach on an unstructured mesh dhi 2009a the mike model has already been successfully applied to coastal oceans xing et al 2012 xu et al 2016 gulfs babu et al 2005 patgaonkar et al 2012 lagoons chubarenko and tchepikova 2001 and lakes schoen et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2009 in the hydrodynamic model the grid has 176 465 nodes and 347 709 triangular elements the minimum and maximum element side lengths are approximately 37 m and 467 m respectively differentiating the lake topography at different scales the runoff from the ungauged area was calculated by a simple linear extrapolation of the gauged runoff zhang et al 2014 the daily catchment inflows from the five major rivers were combined with the runoff from the ungauged catchment area and specified as upstream boundary conditions at the outlets of the five subcatchments fig 1b the daily observed water levels at hukou were used to define the downstream boundary condition the time step was set to 1 5 s the initial conditions were obtained by interpolating the observed water surface elevations at the hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations fig 1b spatially varying manning s roughness coefficients were used for the friction coefficient from 0 018 s m1 3 in the channels to 0 028 s m1 3 in the marshland the horizontal eddy viscosity was determined by the smagorinsky formulation considering the seasonal drying and flooding of the poyang lake floodplains the flooding and drying application in mike 21 was included in the calculation when the water depths are small the problem is reformulated and when the depths are very small the elements are removed from the calculation this reformulation is performed by setting the momentum fluxes to zero and only considering the mass fluxes dhi 2009b in this study a drying depth of 0 005 m a flooding depth of 0 05 m and a wetting depth of 0 1 m were selected the water depths at the element faces are compared to these benchmark depths to determine whether a grid cell should be inactivated reactivated or only used to calculate the mass fluxes zhang and werner 2015 the same mesh and configurations were used in the 1998 and 2010 models to distinguish the impact of the bathymetric changes 2 4 typical hydrological years to compare the impacts of the bathymetric changes on different hydrological regimes a dry year a wet year and an average year were simulated with the 1998 and 2010 bathymetry the differences in the simulated factors in the same hydrological year such as the water level and its distribution and outflow reflected the impact of the bathymetric changes the bathymetric changes have mainly occurred since 2000 therefore the typical hydrological years were selected from the 2000 s fig 3 highlights the variations in the water level during the 2000 s clearly 2006 was a typical dry year and 2010 was a typical wet year in previous studies on poyang lake and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river 2006 was frequently analysed as a typical dry year dai et al 2008 yao et al 2016 and 2010 was frequently analysed as a relatively wet year during the recent period of water level recession feng et al 2012a therefore 2006 2010 and an annual averaged variation from 2000 to 2010 were chosen to represent the typical dry wet and average cases respectively 3 results 3 1 hydrological regime changes fig 4 highlights the annual average water levels near the centre of the lake duchang and lake outlet hukou from 1960 to 2014 showing clear inter annual variations a significant increasing trend in the water level is apparent from the 1960s to the 1990s and a decreasing trend is observed after 2000 additionally the water head difference between duchang and hukou varied slightly from 1960 to 2007 and decreased dramatically after 2007 this change in the water head coincided with the timing of the shift in the sand mining area from the hukou waterway to the central lake jiang et al 2015 fig 5 shows the decadal outflow variation through the hukou waterway under different duchang water levels during the dry season from 1960 to 2010 during low water level periods the effect of the yangtze river is insignificant and poyang lake was in a riverine stage therefore the change in the stage discharge relation is considered to be caused by the bathymetric changes during the 1960s to the 1990s the relationship between the outflow and water level during the dry season remained approximately unchanged indicating an insignificant impact of the bathymetric changes due to the distribution along the lakeshore of the reclaimed and restored areas min 2000 the bathymetric changes during the 1960s to the 1990s had a negligible effect on the channel areas resulting in a relatively stable stage discharge relationship in the riverine stage after widespread sand mining 2000s outflow into the yangtze river increased dramatically for a given water level at duchang when the duchang water level was 11 m the hukou outflow was generally less than 2000 m3 s before 2000 but reached 3000 4000 m3 s after 2000 1 5 2 times the outflow before 2000 3 2 bathymetric changes to analyse the bathymetric changes the 1998 and 2010 bathymetries were determined and are presented in fig 6 significant bathymetric changes occurred in the northern outlet channels to the yangtze river where the elevation of the lake bottom decreased by 3 m on average with a maximum lowering of more than 15 m a comparison of the 1998 and 2010 bathymetries along the five cross sections locations shown in fig 1b showed a dramatic increase in the northern channel cross sectional area fig 7 the decreases in the average bed elevation at cs1 cs2 and cs3 were approximately 3 6 m 6 6 m and 4 3 m respectively these decreases are consistent with a previous assessment lai et al 2014 at locations similar to cs1 and cs2 which experienced bed lowering of 3 m and 7 m respectively from 1998 to 2013 the lowest bed elevation in the northern profiles also dropped significantly at cs1 the lowest elevation dropped by 12 m at cs2 and cs3 these changes were 17 7 m and 17 6 m respectively in addition to the bed elevation of the lower channel a significant widening of the channels at low water levels also occurred at cs1 cs2 and cs3 for example at cs3 the channel width increased from approximately 700 m to approximately 1500 m after 1998 when the water level was 10 m accordingly the discharge cross sectional area increased by 9600 m2 changes in the bed elevation were not significant at cs4 and cs5 3 3 calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model in 2010 dem was calibrated against various field observations from january to december in 2010 including the lake water level records of the four gauging stations and outflow at hukou figs 8 and 9 the observations at the same stations from march 1997 to march 1998 were used to validate the model in 1998 dem figs 10 and 11 these results show the model producing an overall good fit statistical quantification of the goodness of fit was assessed by using the relative error re determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e ns the r 2 and e ns formulas were described in a previous study li et al 2015 table 1 shows the results of the statistical parameters at the gauging stations for the water levels r 2 and e ns vary from 0 97 to 0 99 in calibration and 0 96 0 99 in validation and re varies from 0 2 to 1 9 in calibration and from 0 1 to 1 4 in validation the match of the outflow is generally poorer than that of the water levels nonetheless the r 2 of the outflow is as high as 0 92 in calibration and 0 93 in validation these results indicate that the models using the 2010 dem and the 1998 dem are reasonably accurate in describing the variation in the water level and flow in poyang lake and have similar precisions 3 4 influence of the bathymetric changes on the water levels 3 4 1 changes in the water levels at four stations the water levels at four stations xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan decreased to different extents due to the drop in the bottom elevation in different hydrological years fig 12 the water levels were most affected by the bathymetric changes during the dry year 2006 followed by that in the average case and the wet year 2010 the water level change was most significant at duchang and xingzi the water level change varied insignificantly throughout the year at kangshan in 2006 the mean water levels at xingzi and duchang decreased by 1 4 m and 2 m respectively during the low water level period and by 0 7 m and 1 2 m respectively during the rising and receding water level periods in 2010 the mean water levels at xingzi and duchang decreased by 1 2 m and 1 8 m respectively during the low water level period and by 0 4 m and 0 5 m respectively during the rising and receding water level periods the corresponding water level reductions during the average year were between those of the wet and dry years the water level decreased by approximately 0 3 m at tangyin and less than 0 3 m at kangshan for all periods in all years the water level reduction at all the stations was less than 0 4 m during high water level periods the difference between the maximum and minimum water level variations reached 5 m at xingzi and duchang but was uniform at tangyin and kangshan 3 4 2 changes in the water level rising and receding fig 12 also indicates that the affected critical water levels were different in the rising and recession periods the effect of the bathymetric changes was insignificant when the water level rose above 16 m but significant when the water level receded below 14 m therefore the differences in the responses to the bathymetric changes during the rising and recession periods were assessed fig 13 shows the relationship between the water level at hukou and the water level changes due to the bathymetric changes at xingzi and duchang during the rising and recession periods the water level reduction increases when the water level at hukou decreases however the relationship between these water levels is nonlinear especially at xingzi table 2 shows the water level reductions due to the bathymetric changes for different water levels at hukou when the water level at hukou was 12 m the water level reduction at xingzi reached 0 73 m during the rising period and only 0 28 m during the recession period fig 13 and table 2 therefore at the same hukou water level the water level reduction due to the bathymetric changes was more prominent during the rising period than during the recession period in addition the xingzi and duchang locations responded differently to the bathymetric changes for example when the water level at hukou was 11 m during the rising period the water level reduction at xingzi was less than 1 m while the water level reduction at duchang was greater than 1 m the same pattern was observed during the recession period therefore the water level at duchang was more sensitive than that at xingzi to bathymetric changes table 3 shows the rising and recession rates of the water at xingzi and duchang the same periods corresponding to water level changes between 16 m and a relatively stable low level were chosen to calculate the rising and recession rates for the same hydrologic year with different bathymetries due to the lower low water levels and unchanged high water levels the rising and recession rates of the water level at xingzi and duchang increased by 0 5 cm d to 3 1 cm d table 3 during the wet year 2010 the range of the variation in the water level was large resulting in a remarkable change in the water level rising and recession rates during the dry year 2006 the changes in these rates were slightly less 3 4 3 changes in the water surface profiles water surface profiles from kangshan to hukou were analysed during rising 15 april high 20 july recession 20 august and low 15 december water level periods with different bathymetries fig 14 the water surface slope of poyang lake varies significantly among the different periods the water level from upstream to downstream is approximately the same during the high water level period and the slope increases when the water level rises or recedes the water surface slope is greatest during the low water level period accordingly the responses of the water surface slope to the bathymetric changes during the four periods were different the water surface profiles with the 2010 bathymetry were generally lower than those with the 1998 bathymetry the change was most significant during the low water level period for example during the low water level period in the dry year 2006 the average water level profile decreased by 0 8 m from xingzi to hukou 1 6 m from duchang to xingzi and 1 2 m from tangyin to duchang fig 14a the average reduction in the water level profile was lower than 0 3 m from kangshan to tangyin the difference in the water head decreased as much as 2 m from duchang to hukou and was constant from kangshan to hukou the changes in the water surface profiles during the wet year 2010 and the average year followed a similar pattern in general the water surface profile from tangyin to xingzi was most affected by the bathymetric changes 3 5 influence of the bathymetric changes on the outflow to the yangtze river the bathymetric changes led to variations in the channel morphology thereby changing the outflow discharge to the yangtze river the discharge variations at hukou showed that the outflow was greater with the 2010 bathymetry than with the 1998 bathymetry fig 15 these discharge variations were more significant during the rising recession and high water level periods the total increased outflow of the entire year was 95 2 108 m3 representing approximately 6 4 of the total outflow in 2006 the corresponding values were approximately 8 7 and 6 8 in 2010 and in the average year respectively the increased outflow was larger during the wet year than that during the dry year 3 6 influence of the bathymetric changes on the distribution of the water level a further study was performed on the influence of the bathymetric changes on the spatial distributions of the water levels during the rising high water level recession and low water level periods taking 2006 as an example fig 16 as the water level rose the area with water levels between 13 m and 16 m changed significantly with the bathymetric changes from 1998 to 2010 the area with water levels between 13 m and 15 m expanded from the north to the south and the area with water levels between 15 m and 16 m shrank significantly fig 16a and e two thirds of the lake area was influenced during the high water level period only a small area of the northern outlet waterway was affected when the water levels were between 15 m and 16 m as the water level receded in the centre and northern parts of the lake the area with water levels between 13 m and 14 m decreased and the area with water levels between 12 m and 13 m increased due to the bathymetric changes from 1998 to 2010 the recession rate of the water was significantly increased during the low water level period the channel regions in northern tangyin with water levels lower than 12 m were most affected additionally the water surface areas of some sublakes also varied when they became disconnected from the main lake during the recession and low water level periods in the lake delta regions of ganjiang in the middle and southern tributaries the area with water levels greater than 16 m was larger with the 2010 bathymetry than with the 1998 bathymetry fig 16c and g comparing the topographies of the two years fig 6 the area of delta regions with elevations higher than 16 m was larger in 2010 than in 1998 these approximately isolated highlands stored some water when the water level receded from a high water level 4 discussion lai et al 2014 demonstrated the influence of extensive sand mining on the decline in poyang lake levels during the dry season using surveyed and remote sensing data the work presented here further develops this previous study by quantifying the contribution of the bathymetric changes to low water levels and the hydrological regime using a physically based hydrodynamic model the findings of this work agreed with those of lai et al 2014 who suggested that the lowering of the poyang lake bottom elevation allows the lake to drain quickly and reach a lower water level the study of lai et al 2014 focused on the dry season and suggested that the abnormal lowering of water levels during the dry season was controlled by the morphological changes more than the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river their conclusion is corroborated by this work here all the periods of water level variation in poyang lake were assessed to determine the responses to the bathymetric changes regarding the interest in the frequently low water levels in autumn during the dry year 2006 the average water level from august to october at xingzi was 4 58 m lower than the annual mean water level of the corresponding period yao et al 2016 based on the calculations conducted in this study the average water level at xingzi during this period decreased by 0 66 m due to the bathymetric changes therefore the bathymetric changes accounted for approximately 14 4 of the low water levels in autumn of 2006 the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river remained the primary cause of the low water levels in autumn as suggested by previous studies yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 however the bathymetric changes further decreased the low water levels these results reflect the seasonal variations in the hydrological regimes and forces in this river lake floodplain system based on the variations in the water levels and surface profiles the duchang area was most affected by the bathymetric changes followed by xingzi the bathymetric changes mainly occurred in the northern outlet channels in this area the region from southern xingzi to duchang was most significant compared with studies of gauging station data lai et al 2014 our study more accurately captures the spatial variations in the lake from a hydrodynamic perspective the most affected area was the northern channel occupying only a small part of the total lake area however due to the topography the emptying effect spread and changed the water surface profiles and distributions the rising and recession rates of the water level and the outflow to the yangtze river increased the influence of the bathymetric changes spread across the whole lake area the water levels were significantly affected by the bathymetric changes only when the water level was below 16 m during the rising period and below 14 m during the recession period fig 12 and the influence increased with decreasing water level compared to the recession period the rising period was more greatly affected by the bathymetric changes the observational data indicated that the critical transition point from a riverine stage to a lacustrine stage was 16 m during the rising period and that the critical transition point from a lacustrine stage to a riverine stage was 14 m during the recession period fig 2b the effect of the bathymetric changes was only significant during the riverine stage and was insignificant during the lacustrine stage the volume of the bathymetric changes represented a large proportion of the river water during the riverine stage but only a small proportion of the whole lake body during the lacustrine stage the asymmetry of these two periods might result from the hydrological hysteresis of poyang lake due to the complex floodplain bathymetry and the time lag between the peaks of the catchment inflow and yangtze river discharge zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 furthermore the bathymetric changes may influence the degree of hysteresis based on the more scattered distribution of the stage discharge data in the 2000s than in other periods fig 5 the hysteretic effect is dominant after 2000 suggesting that the bathymetric changes in the channel areas enhanced the hysteretic effect compared with existing models for poyang lake li et al 2014 qi et al 2016 wang et al 2015 p zhang et al 2015 the hydrodynamic model of this study has a finer mesh with the total number of 347 709 elements and the resolution of 37 467 m this model can effectively capture the terrain differences and bathymetric changes furthermore the model adopts the advantages of the existing models in the configuration of a local refined mesh li et al 2014 spatially varying manning s roughness coefficients li et al 2016 and calculation of runoff from the ungauged catchment area zhang et al 2014 while fully considering the topography and hydrological characteristics in poyang lake some assumptions in the model configuration limited the model the water levels of the whole lake area even at hukou in the most northern part of the lake were affected due to the bathymetric changes however as the northern outlet of the lake hukou was largely influenced by the connecting yangtze river a previous study showed that the water level at hukou was basically proportional to the yangtze river discharge z zhang et al 2015 the decrease in the water level at hukou due to the bathymetric changes might be small if the yangtze river discharge remained unchanged throughout the hydrological year as the downstream boundary condition the water levels at hukou were assumed to be the same for the different bathymetries evaluated possibly slightly underestimating the water level reduction however the spatial response of the lake water level to the bathymetric changes was reflected and is credible compared with the natural state of slight deposition the sand mining disrupted the near equilibrium between erosion and deposition within poyang lake and converted the lake into an erosional system after 2000 gao et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 shankman et al 2009 furthermore the mining area is moving to the southern area of the lake jiang et al 2015 the bathymetry will continue to change due to continued sand mining and changes in erosion and deposition additionally the bathymetry of the middle reaches of the yangtze river has also changed significantly since the construction of the three gorges dam lai et al 2017 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 bed erosion in the yangtze river enhances the emptying effect and partially contributes to the water level decrease in poyang lake wang et al 2013 quantifying the impact of the bathymetric changes in the yangtze river separately and jointly with the bathymetric changes in the lake is of great importance for fully identifying the causes of the hydrological regime changes in poyang lake therefore further work needs to be undertaken to elucidate the influence of the continued bathymetric changes on the yangtze river poyang lake system 5 conclusion this study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in poyang lake the lake bed of the northern channel to the yangtze river was deepened by 3 m on average resulting in a decrease in the water level of 1 2 2 m in the northern channels the most significantly influenced areas and approximately 0 3 m in the central channel areas during low level periods water levels below 16 m during the rising period and below 14 m during the recession period were significantly affected by the bathymetric changes while the high water levels were nearly unaffected the water level during the dry year was more sensitive to the bathymetric changes than that during the wet and average years the water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels but this relationship was nonlinear although the maximum influence of the bathymetric changes occurred in the northern outlet waterway the influence extended to the entire lake due to the emptying effect on the water level distribution accordingly the water surface profiles adjusted and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased additionally the outflow increased via deepened and widened channels the total increased annual outflow reached 6 8 during the average year regarding the frequent low level events in autumn in poyang lake the bathymetric changes contributed 14 4 of the lower water level in autumn of 2006 therefore the bathymetric changes further reduced the low water levels overall this study highlights the spatiotemporal effects of the bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime of poyang lake and provides a better understanding of the potential impacts of further anthropogenic activities in the yangtze river and poyang lake this system of large rivers and directly connected natural lakes is characterized by a complex hydrologic regime the hydrodynamic method presented is a powerful tool for identifying continuous spatiotemporal changes in river lake systems this study provides a reference that can be extended to similar river lake floodplain systems to quantify the effects of the bathymetry and other factors and examine the causes of changes in the hydrological regime acknowledgements this work was supported by the national basic research

7305,the hydrological regime of a lake is largely dependent on its bathymetry a dramatic water level reduction has occurred in poyang lake in recent years coinciding with significant bed erosion few studies have focused on the influence of bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in such a complex river lake floodplain system this study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes 1998 2010 on the water level spatiotemporal distribution in poyang lake based on a dry year 2006 a wet year 2010 and an average year 2000 2010 the following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study 1 the bed erosion of the northern outlet channel averaged 3 m resulting in a decrease in the water level by 1 2 2 m in the northern channels the most significantly influenced areas and approximately 0 3 m in the central lake areas during low level periods the water levels below 16 m and 14 m were significantly affected during the rising period and recession period respectively the water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels 2 the water surface profiles adjusted and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased by 0 5 3 1 cm d at the lake outlet the bathymetric influence extended across the entire lake due to the emptying effect resulting in a change in the water level distribution the average annual outflow increased by 6 8 3 the bathymetric changes contributed approximately 14 4 to the extreme low water level in autumn 2006 and enhanced the drought in the dry season this study quantified the impact of the bathymetric changes on the lake water levels thereby providing a better understanding of the potential effects of continued sand mining operations and providing scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of poyang lake moreover this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes keywords bathymetric changes hydrodynamic model low water level spatiotemporal distribution poyang lake 1 introduction hydrological and hydrodynamic processes are strongly dependent on the bathymetry especially in shallow systems characterized by extensive floodplains baugh et al 2013 french 2008 the bathymetry of coastal or lake areas may be altered by external forcing such as river discharge oceanic tides and sea level rise as well as sediment transfer erosion and deposition mitchell and uncles 2013 prandle 2004 xu et al 2006 hurricane and tsunami events radically change bathymetry goto et al 2011 ranasinghe et al 2013 bathymetric changes can also be directly initiated by anthropogenic interventions such as sand mining maa et al 2004 channel deepening and dredging de jonge et al 2014 van maren et al 2015 and gold rushes foxgrover et al 2004 bathymetric changes affect wave and sediment transport patterns

resulting variations in the hydrodynamics and sediment transport process disturb the natural erosion and sedimentation patterns jonge 1983 further enhancing the bathymetric changes a floodplain environment varies continuously in both space and time the bathymetric changes in a floodplain lake result in changes in the inundation processes affecting the water level inundation extent and timing hardy et al 1999 malhadas et al 2009 marks et al 2000 which further influence the biogeochemical processes occurring in the floodplains as important components of river floodplain systems floodplain channels play a key role in hydrodynamic exchange and sediment transport for example deeper channels provide preferential flow paths across the floodplain trigg et al 2012 filling of the floodplain channels within the atchafalaya river basin over the last 100 years has resulted in decreased flow velocities diverted channels and reduced suspended sediment concentrations kroes and kraemer 2013 poyang lake is the largest floodplain lake in china and is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river it is a highly valued water resource with a particularly complex hydrological regime and topography poyang lake has experienced floods and droughts at a much higher frequency over the past 50 years due to naturally occurring climate variability coinciding with increased human activities gemmer et al 2008 nakayama and shankman 2013 shankman et al 2006 ye et al 2011 as an internationally important wetland and the largest bird conservation area for migratory birds worldwide poyang lake has important ecological functions hui et al 2008 the lake receives catchment runoff from five tributary rivers and subsequently discharges into the yangtze river through the hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake during the flood season of the local catchment from april to june poyang lake has the largest outflow to the yangtze river exerting a strong pressure guo et al 2011 the yangtze river affects poyang lake by creating an outflow blocking effect and reversing water flow when the blocking pressure is sufficiently large hu et al 2007 the blocking and potential reverse flow from the yangtze river to poyang lake is strongest during the peak discharge of the yangtze river from july to september guo et al 2011 the spatiotemporal patterns of these two different hydrological processes indicate a considerable variation in the water level and surface area within and between years spatiotemporal heterogeneity in floodplain systems due to river lake interactions makes understanding the highly dynamic hydrological regime more challenging poyang lake has experienced new and more severe dry conditions since 2000 zhang et al 2014 compared to the lake water levels reported in previous decades the lake water levels dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded during 2001 2010 zhang et al 2014 resulting in significant decreases in the lake area feng et al 2012a the higher frequency of extremely low water levels in recent years has affected not only the agriculture transportation and urban water supplies but also wetland and aquatic habitats liu et al 2015 a number of studies of this low water level analysed the effects of climate change rainfall runoff river lake interactions and other factors feng et al 2012b liu et al 2013 yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 the scientific consensus that was reached suggested that the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river was the primary cause for the decreased lake level in autumn in recent years the dramatic decrease in the poyang lake level during the dry seasons has coincided with significant bathymetric changes in the past 50 years many processes have resulted in bathymetric changes in poyang lake from 1960 to 1998 over 850 km2 of lake area was reclaimed ye et al 2012 resulting in a decrease in the lake volume of approximately 15 min 2000 after 1998 the reclaimed land was restored intensive sand mining in poyang lake initiated in 2000 the volume of mined sand was approximately 1 29 109 m3 during 2000 2010 almost 6 5 times the volume of natural sediment that accumulated during 1955 2010 jiang et al 2015 due to the widespread sand mining in this area the bed elevation of the north hukou outflow channel decreased by approximately 5 9 m during the past decade de leeuw et al 2010 feng et al 2011 used modis 250 m resolution data to derive the bottom topography of poyang lake and observed high inter annual variability from 2000 to 2009 zhang et al 2016 used medium resolution satellite images to construct annual and quasi annual topographic maps of poyang lake from 2000 to 2010 and found that the average elevation of the lakebed relative to the sea level decreased by 14 4 cm yr from 2000 to 2010 lai et al 2014 used surveyed and remote sensing data to examine the impact of sand mining on the low water level they showed that the discharge ability of poyang lake into the yangtze river at low water levels during the dry season has increased 1 5 2 times due to sand mining these studies indicated that bathymetric change could be one of the important factors triggering the decrease in the water level of poyang lake during the dry season however the previous studies did not demonstrate the spatiotemporal impacts of the bathymetric changes on the low water level in poyang lake elucidating the causes of the low water levels and additional variation in the hydrological regime in this complex floodplain lake is scientifically important on the basis of typical hydrological years for poyang lake this study explores the spatiotemporal impacts of the bathymetric changes on the water level using a hydrodynamic model combined with long term hydrological observations the objective of this paper is to characterize and quantify the spatiotemporal influences of the bathymetric changes in the lake level the aim of this study is to quantify the impact of the bathymetric changes on the frequent low water level events to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts of continued sand mining and provide scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of poyang lake moreover this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river at latitudes between 28 24 and 29 46 n and longitudes between 115 49 and 116 46 e fig 1 a the catchment area of poyang lake is 1 62 105 km2 the catchment has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1654 mm an average temperature of 17 6 c and an annual potential evapotranspiration of 1049 mm year zhang et al 2014 poyang lake spans 170 km from north to south and as much as 74 km from east to west lai et al 2014 shaped by a combination of lacustrine and riverine morphological processes the lake is characterized by a complex topography including narrow channels islands and large areas of floodplain the elevation of the lake bottom is lower than 2 m in the northern channels and higher than 14 m in the southern deltas wusong datum which is also the water surface elevation system used in this study generally decreasing from south upstream to north downstream fig 1b poyang lake receives water from five rivers in the catchment the ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe and xiushui rivers fig 1a poyang lake exchanges water with the yangtze river via a narrow channel hukou outlet at the northern end of the lake fig 1a fig 2 a shows the average variation in the discharge to poyang lake from the catchment the yangtze river discharge at hankou station and the lake water level at the xingzi gauging station which is located at the northern end of the lake and approximately 39 km from the yangtze river zhang et al 2014 the catchment inflows vary considerably throughout the year ranging between 1 4 103 m3 s and 12 0 103 m3 s based on the annual average variation from 1953 to 2010 the yangtze river discharge also has an evident seasonal variation with a mean annual variation between 8 1 103 m3 s and 44 4 103 m3 s from 1960 to 2010 however a time lag exists in the peak discharge of the yangtze river relative to the maximum catchment inflow generally the peak discharge of the catchment inflows occurs between april and june and therefore precedes the peak discharge of the yangtze river between july and september guo et al 2012 spatial variations in the bathymetry and seasonal variations in the catchment inflows and yangtze river flow complicate the fluctuations in the lake level and area the annual average fluctuations in the water level vary by 8 18 m fig 2a the water level decreases from kangshan upstream to hukou downstream according to the variation in the bed elevation fig 2b the water level gradient between the upstream and downstream increases with the decrease in the water level the hydrological regime of poyang lake includes four periods a water level rising period march june a high water level period july august a water level recession period september october and a low water level period november february the lake fluctuates from inundated floodplains at high water levels to little more than a river at low water levels with the lake area varying from more than 3000 km2 to less than 1000 km2 respectively feng et al 2012a z zhang et al 2015 during the water level rising period march june the water level of poyang lake is mainly controlled by seasonal variations in the catchment inflows hu et al 2007 shankman et al 2006 the lake catchment plays a primary role in determining the lake water level especially during severe flooding events hu et al 2007 however during the high water level and recession periods the changes in the flow regime of the yangtze river strongly influence the blocking force of the river on the outflow from poyang lake hu et al 2007 this influence affects the lake level water storage and associated seasonal variations in poyang lake guo et al 2012 during the low water level period november february the water level of poyang lake is dominated by the lake catchment and the effect of the yangtze river is insignificant 2 2 data availability seven downstream gauging stations qiujin wanjiabu waizhou lijiadu meigang hushan and dufengkeng fig 1 a were used to represent the catchment inflows from the five major rivers the observed daily streamflows at these seven gauging stations were obtained from 1953 to 2010 the daily water levels of five of the gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan from downstream to upstream as shown in fig 1b from 1960 to 2010 were used to represent the water levels in the downstream central and upstream areas of poyang lake digital elevation models dems of poyang lake from 1 10 000 maps surveyed in 1998 and 2010 were used to describe the bathymetric changes the two dems were compared at five cross sections to analyse the local bathymetric changes the locations of the cross sections are identified as cs1 the location of a planned water control structure cs2 near xingzi cs3 near duchang cs4 in the central lake area and cs5 in the southern lake area fig 1b all the data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province and the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china 2 3 hydrodynamic model poyang lake is shallow and wide therefore vertical stratification in the water column can be neglected li and yao 2015 hence a 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model of poyang lake was implemented using the mike 21 flow model mike 21 was developed by the danish hydraulic institute dhi to simulate water environments in lakes estuaries bays coastal areas and seas dhi 2009a this model solves the vertically averaged and reynolds averaged equations representing the conservation of mass and momentum by using a finite volume approach on an unstructured mesh dhi 2009a the mike model has already been successfully applied to coastal oceans xing et al 2012 xu et al 2016 gulfs babu et al 2005 patgaonkar et al 2012 lagoons chubarenko and tchepikova 2001 and lakes schoen et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2009 in the hydrodynamic model the grid has 176 465 nodes and 347 709 triangular elements the minimum and maximum element side lengths are approximately 37 m and 467 m respectively differentiating the lake topography at different scales the runoff from the ungauged area was calculated by a simple linear extrapolation of the gauged runoff zhang et al 2014 the daily catchment inflows from the five major rivers were combined with the runoff from the ungauged catchment area and specified as upstream boundary conditions at the outlets of the five subcatchments fig 1b the daily observed water levels at hukou were used to define the downstream boundary condition the time step was set to 1 5 s the initial conditions were obtained by interpolating the observed water surface elevations at the hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan gauging stations fig 1b spatially varying manning s roughness coefficients were used for the friction coefficient from 0 018 s m1 3 in the channels to 0 028 s m1 3 in the marshland the horizontal eddy viscosity was determined by the smagorinsky formulation considering the seasonal drying and flooding of the poyang lake floodplains the flooding and drying application in mike 21 was included in the calculation when the water depths are small the problem is reformulated and when the depths are very small the elements are removed from the calculation this reformulation is performed by setting the momentum fluxes to zero and only considering the mass fluxes dhi 2009b in this study a drying depth of 0 005 m a flooding depth of 0 05 m and a wetting depth of 0 1 m were selected the water depths at the element faces are compared to these benchmark depths to determine whether a grid cell should be inactivated reactivated or only used to calculate the mass fluxes zhang and werner 2015 the same mesh and configurations were used in the 1998 and 2010 models to distinguish the impact of the bathymetric changes 2 4 typical hydrological years to compare the impacts of the bathymetric changes on different hydrological regimes a dry year a wet year and an average year were simulated with the 1998 and 2010 bathymetry the differences in the simulated factors in the same hydrological year such as the water level and its distribution and outflow reflected the impact of the bathymetric changes the bathymetric changes have mainly occurred since 2000 therefore the typical hydrological years were selected from the 2000 s fig 3 highlights the variations in the water level during the 2000 s clearly 2006 was a typical dry year and 2010 was a typical wet year in previous studies on poyang lake and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river 2006 was frequently analysed as a typical dry year dai et al 2008 yao et al 2016 and 2010 was frequently analysed as a relatively wet year during the recent period of water level recession feng et al 2012a therefore 2006 2010 and an annual averaged variation from 2000 to 2010 were chosen to represent the typical dry wet and average cases respectively 3 results 3 1 hydrological regime changes fig 4 highlights the annual average water levels near the centre of the lake duchang and lake outlet hukou from 1960 to 2014 showing clear inter annual variations a significant increasing trend in the water level is apparent from the 1960s to the 1990s and a decreasing trend is observed after 2000 additionally the water head difference between duchang and hukou varied slightly from 1960 to 2007 and decreased dramatically after 2007 this change in the water head coincided with the timing of the shift in the sand mining area from the hukou waterway to the central lake jiang et al 2015 fig 5 shows the decadal outflow variation through the hukou waterway under different duchang water levels during the dry season from 1960 to 2010 during low water level periods the effect of the yangtze river is insignificant and poyang lake was in a riverine stage therefore the change in the stage discharge relation is considered to be caused by the bathymetric changes during the 1960s to the 1990s the relationship between the outflow and water level during the dry season remained approximately unchanged indicating an insignificant impact of the bathymetric changes due to the distribution along the lakeshore of the reclaimed and restored areas min 2000 the bathymetric changes during the 1960s to the 1990s had a negligible effect on the channel areas resulting in a relatively stable stage discharge relationship in the riverine stage after widespread sand mining 2000s outflow into the yangtze river increased dramatically for a given water level at duchang when the duchang water level was 11 m the hukou outflow was generally less than 2000 m3 s before 2000 but reached 3000 4000 m3 s after 2000 1 5 2 times the outflow before 2000 3 2 bathymetric changes to analyse the bathymetric changes the 1998 and 2010 bathymetries were determined and are presented in fig 6 significant bathymetric changes occurred in the northern outlet channels to the yangtze river where the elevation of the lake bottom decreased by 3 m on average with a maximum lowering of more than 15 m a comparison of the 1998 and 2010 bathymetries along the five cross sections locations shown in fig 1b showed a dramatic increase in the northern channel cross sectional area fig 7 the decreases in the average bed elevation at cs1 cs2 and cs3 were approximately 3 6 m 6 6 m and 4 3 m respectively these decreases are consistent with a previous assessment lai et al 2014 at locations similar to cs1 and cs2 which experienced bed lowering of 3 m and 7 m respectively from 1998 to 2013 the lowest bed elevation in the northern profiles also dropped significantly at cs1 the lowest elevation dropped by 12 m at cs2 and cs3 these changes were 17 7 m and 17 6 m respectively in addition to the bed elevation of the lower channel a significant widening of the channels at low water levels also occurred at cs1 cs2 and cs3 for example at cs3 the channel width increased from approximately 700 m to approximately 1500 m after 1998 when the water level was 10 m accordingly the discharge cross sectional area increased by 9600 m2 changes in the bed elevation were not significant at cs4 and cs5 3 3 calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model in 2010 dem was calibrated against various field observations from january to december in 2010 including the lake water level records of the four gauging stations and outflow at hukou figs 8 and 9 the observations at the same stations from march 1997 to march 1998 were used to validate the model in 1998 dem figs 10 and 11 these results show the model producing an overall good fit statistical quantification of the goodness of fit was assessed by using the relative error re determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e ns the r 2 and e ns formulas were described in a previous study li et al 2015 table 1 shows the results of the statistical parameters at the gauging stations for the water levels r 2 and e ns vary from 0 97 to 0 99 in calibration and 0 96 0 99 in validation and re varies from 0 2 to 1 9 in calibration and from 0 1 to 1 4 in validation the match of the outflow is generally poorer than that of the water levels nonetheless the r 2 of the outflow is as high as 0 92 in calibration and 0 93 in validation these results indicate that the models using the 2010 dem and the 1998 dem are reasonably accurate in describing the variation in the water level and flow in poyang lake and have similar precisions 3 4 influence of the bathymetric changes on the water levels 3 4 1 changes in the water levels at four stations the water levels at four stations xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan decreased to different extents due to the drop in the bottom elevation in different hydrological years fig 12 the water levels were most affected by the bathymetric changes during the dry year 2006 followed by that in the average case and the wet year 2010 the water level change was most significant at duchang and xingzi the water level change varied insignificantly throughout the year at kangshan in 2006 the mean water levels at xingzi and duchang decreased by 1 4 m and 2 m respectively during the low water level period and by 0 7 m and 1 2 m respectively during the rising and receding water level periods in 2010 the mean water levels at xingzi and duchang decreased by 1 2 m and 1 8 m respectively during the low water level period and by 0 4 m and 0 5 m respectively during the rising and receding water level periods the corresponding water level reductions during the average year were between those of the wet and dry years the water level decreased by approximately 0 3 m at tangyin and less than 0 3 m at kangshan for all periods in all years the water level reduction at all the stations was less than 0 4 m during high water level periods the difference between the maximum and minimum water level variations reached 5 m at xingzi and duchang but was uniform at tangyin and kangshan 3 4 2 changes in the water level rising and receding fig 12 also indicates that the affected critical water levels were different in the rising and recession periods the effect of the bathymetric changes was insignificant when the water level rose above 16 m but significant when the water level receded below 14 m therefore the differences in the responses to the bathymetric changes during the rising and recession periods were assessed fig 13 shows the relationship between the water level at hukou and the water level changes due to the bathymetric changes at xingzi and duchang during the rising and recession periods the water level reduction increases when the water level at hukou decreases however the relationship between these water levels is nonlinear especially at xingzi table 2 shows the water level reductions due to the bathymetric changes for different water levels at hukou when the water level at hukou was 12 m the water level reduction at xingzi reached 0 73 m during the rising period and only 0 28 m during the recession period fig 13 and table 2 therefore at the same hukou water level the water level reduction due to the bathymetric changes was more prominent during the rising period than during the recession period in addition the xingzi and duchang locations responded differently to the bathymetric changes for example when the water level at hukou was 11 m during the rising period the water level reduction at xingzi was less than 1 m while the water level reduction at duchang was greater than 1 m the same pattern was observed during the recession period therefore the water level at duchang was more sensitive than that at xingzi to bathymetric changes table 3 shows the rising and recession rates of the water at xingzi and duchang the same periods corresponding to water level changes between 16 m and a relatively stable low level were chosen to calculate the rising and recession rates for the same hydrologic year with different bathymetries due to the lower low water levels and unchanged high water levels the rising and recession rates of the water level at xingzi and duchang increased by 0 5 cm d to 3 1 cm d table 3 during the wet year 2010 the range of the variation in the water level was large resulting in a remarkable change in the water level rising and recession rates during the dry year 2006 the changes in these rates were slightly less 3 4 3 changes in the water surface profiles water surface profiles from kangshan to hukou were analysed during rising 15 april high 20 july recession 20 august and low 15 december water level periods with different bathymetries fig 14 the water surface slope of poyang lake varies significantly among the different periods the water level from upstream to downstream is approximately the same during the high water level period and the slope increases when the water level rises or recedes the water surface slope is greatest during the low water level period accordingly the responses of the water surface slope to the bathymetric changes during the four periods were different the water surface profiles with the 2010 bathymetry were generally lower than those with the 1998 bathymetry the change was most significant during the low water level period for example during the low water level period in the dry year 2006 the average water level profile decreased by 0 8 m from xingzi to hukou 1 6 m from duchang to xingzi and 1 2 m from tangyin to duchang fig 14a the average reduction in the water level profile was lower than 0 3 m from kangshan to tangyin the difference in the water head decreased as much as 2 m from duchang to hukou and was constant from kangshan to hukou the changes in the water surface profiles during the wet year 2010 and the average year followed a similar pattern in general the water surface profile from tangyin to xingzi was most affected by the bathymetric changes 3 5 influence of the bathymetric changes on the outflow to the yangtze river the bathymetric changes led to variations in the channel morphology thereby changing the outflow discharge to the yangtze river the discharge variations at hukou showed that the outflow was greater with the 2010 bathymetry than with the 1998 bathymetry fig 15 these discharge variations were more significant during the rising recession and high water level periods the total increased outflow of the entire year was 95 2 108 m3 representing approximately 6 4 of the total outflow in 2006 the corresponding values were approximately 8 7 and 6 8 in 2010 and in the average year respectively the increased outflow was larger during the wet year than that during the dry year 3 6 influence of the bathymetric changes on the distribution of the water level a further study was performed on the influence of the bathymetric changes on the spatial distributions of the water levels during the rising high water level recession and low water level periods taking 2006 as an example fig 16 as the water level rose the area with water levels between 13 m and 16 m changed significantly with the bathymetric changes from 1998 to 2010 the area with water levels between 13 m and 15 m expanded from the north to the south and the area with water levels between 15 m and 16 m shrank significantly fig 16a and e two thirds of the lake area was influenced during the high water level period only a small area of the northern outlet waterway was affected when the water levels were between 15 m and 16 m as the water level receded in the centre and northern parts of the lake the area with water levels between 13 m and 14 m decreased and the area with water levels between 12 m and 13 m increased due to the bathymetric changes from 1998 to 2010 the recession rate of the water was significantly increased during the low water level period the channel regions in northern tangyin with water levels lower than 12 m were most affected additionally the water surface areas of some sublakes also varied when they became disconnected from the main lake during the recession and low water level periods in the lake delta regions of ganjiang in the middle and southern tributaries the area with water levels greater than 16 m was larger with the 2010 bathymetry than with the 1998 bathymetry fig 16c and g comparing the topographies of the two years fig 6 the area of delta regions with elevations higher than 16 m was larger in 2010 than in 1998 these approximately isolated highlands stored some water when the water level receded from a high water level 4 discussion lai et al 2014 demonstrated the influence of extensive sand mining on the decline in poyang lake levels during the dry season using surveyed and remote sensing data the work presented here further develops this previous study by quantifying the contribution of the bathymetric changes to low water levels and the hydrological regime using a physically based hydrodynamic model the findings of this work agreed with those of lai et al 2014 who suggested that the lowering of the poyang lake bottom elevation allows the lake to drain quickly and reach a lower water level the study of lai et al 2014 focused on the dry season and suggested that the abnormal lowering of water levels during the dry season was controlled by the morphological changes more than the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river their conclusion is corroborated by this work here all the periods of water level variation in poyang lake were assessed to determine the responses to the bathymetric changes regarding the interest in the frequently low water levels in autumn during the dry year 2006 the average water level from august to october at xingzi was 4 58 m lower than the annual mean water level of the corresponding period yao et al 2016 based on the calculations conducted in this study the average water level at xingzi during this period decreased by 0 66 m due to the bathymetric changes therefore the bathymetric changes accounted for approximately 14 4 of the low water levels in autumn of 2006 the weakened blocking effect of the yangtze river remained the primary cause of the low water levels in autumn as suggested by previous studies yao et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 however the bathymetric changes further decreased the low water levels these results reflect the seasonal variations in the hydrological regimes and forces in this river lake floodplain system based on the variations in the water levels and surface profiles the duchang area was most affected by the bathymetric changes followed by xingzi the bathymetric changes mainly occurred in the northern outlet channels in this area the region from southern xingzi to duchang was most significant compared with studies of gauging station data lai et al 2014 our study more accurately captures the spatial variations in the lake from a hydrodynamic perspective the most affected area was the northern channel occupying only a small part of the total lake area however due to the topography the emptying effect spread and changed the water surface profiles and distributions the rising and recession rates of the water level and the outflow to the yangtze river increased the influence of the bathymetric changes spread across the whole lake area the water levels were significantly affected by the bathymetric changes only when the water level was below 16 m during the rising period and below 14 m during the recession period fig 12 and the influence increased with decreasing water level compared to the recession period the rising period was more greatly affected by the bathymetric changes the observational data indicated that the critical transition point from a riverine stage to a lacustrine stage was 16 m during the rising period and that the critical transition point from a lacustrine stage to a riverine stage was 14 m during the recession period fig 2b the effect of the bathymetric changes was only significant during the riverine stage and was insignificant during the lacustrine stage the volume of the bathymetric changes represented a large proportion of the river water during the riverine stage but only a small proportion of the whole lake body during the lacustrine stage the asymmetry of these two periods might result from the hydrological hysteresis of poyang lake due to the complex floodplain bathymetry and the time lag between the peaks of the catchment inflow and yangtze river discharge zhang and werner 2015 zhang et al 2017 furthermore the bathymetric changes may influence the degree of hysteresis based on the more scattered distribution of the stage discharge data in the 2000s than in other periods fig 5 the hysteretic effect is dominant after 2000 suggesting that the bathymetric changes in the channel areas enhanced the hysteretic effect compared with existing models for poyang lake li et al 2014 qi et al 2016 wang et al 2015 p zhang et al 2015 the hydrodynamic model of this study has a finer mesh with the total number of 347 709 elements and the resolution of 37 467 m this model can effectively capture the terrain differences and bathymetric changes furthermore the model adopts the advantages of the existing models in the configuration of a local refined mesh li et al 2014 spatially varying manning s roughness coefficients li et al 2016 and calculation of runoff from the ungauged catchment area zhang et al 2014 while fully considering the topography and hydrological characteristics in poyang lake some assumptions in the model configuration limited the model the water levels of the whole lake area even at hukou in the most northern part of the lake were affected due to the bathymetric changes however as the northern outlet of the lake hukou was largely influenced by the connecting yangtze river a previous study showed that the water level at hukou was basically proportional to the yangtze river discharge z zhang et al 2015 the decrease in the water level at hukou due to the bathymetric changes might be small if the yangtze river discharge remained unchanged throughout the hydrological year as the downstream boundary condition the water levels at hukou were assumed to be the same for the different bathymetries evaluated possibly slightly underestimating the water level reduction however the spatial response of the lake water level to the bathymetric changes was reflected and is credible compared with the natural state of slight deposition the sand mining disrupted the near equilibrium between erosion and deposition within poyang lake and converted the lake into an erosional system after 2000 gao et al 2014 jiang et al 2015 shankman et al 2009 furthermore the mining area is moving to the southern area of the lake jiang et al 2015 the bathymetry will continue to change due to continued sand mining and changes in erosion and deposition additionally the bathymetry of the middle reaches of the yangtze river has also changed significantly since the construction of the three gorges dam lai et al 2017 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 bed erosion in the yangtze river enhances the emptying effect and partially contributes to the water level decrease in poyang lake wang et al 2013 quantifying the impact of the bathymetric changes in the yangtze river separately and jointly with the bathymetric changes in the lake is of great importance for fully identifying the causes of the hydrological regime changes in poyang lake therefore further work needs to be undertaken to elucidate the influence of the continued bathymetric changes on the yangtze river poyang lake system 5 conclusion this study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in poyang lake the lake bed of the northern channel to the yangtze river was deepened by 3 m on average resulting in a decrease in the water level of 1 2 2 m in the northern channels the most significantly influenced areas and approximately 0 3 m in the central channel areas during low level periods water levels below 16 m during the rising period and below 14 m during the recession period were significantly affected by the bathymetric changes while the high water levels were nearly unaffected the water level during the dry year was more sensitive to the bathymetric changes than that during the wet and average years the water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels but this relationship was nonlinear although the maximum influence of the bathymetric changes occurred in the northern outlet waterway the influence extended to the entire lake due to the emptying effect on the water level distribution accordingly the water surface profiles adjusted and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased additionally the outflow increased via deepened and widened channels the total increased annual outflow reached 6 8 during the average year regarding the frequent low level events in autumn in poyang lake the bathymetric changes contributed 14 4 of the lower water level in autumn of 2006 therefore the bathymetric changes further reduced the low water levels overall this study highlights the spatiotemporal effects of the bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime of poyang lake and provides a better understanding of the potential impacts of further anthropogenic activities in the yangtze river and poyang lake this system of large rivers and directly connected natural lakes is characterized by a complex hydrologic regime the hydrodynamic method presented is a powerful tool for identifying continuous spatiotemporal changes in river lake systems this study provides a reference that can be extended to similar river lake floodplain systems to quantify the effects of the bathymetry and other factors and examine the causes of changes in the hydrological regime acknowledgements this work was supported by the national basic research

7306,freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities however the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale this study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities considering various sites from around the world the groundwater conditions in twenty seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored the investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels and offshore salinity knowledge in combination with analytical modelling to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling we consider both present day and pre development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability the results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre development and present day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre development data are available estimates of the associated steady state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines both present day and pre development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist this suggests that paleo freshwater and or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent present day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion swi will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty seven sites while passive swi is expected onshore in an additional ten regions albeit the number of field sites is limited there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use thus offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal water balances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input rather than as a new potential freshwater resource keywords offshore fresh groundwater coastal aquifer saltwater intrusion analytical modelling 1 introduction elevated population densities in many coastal regions are thought to place significant pressures on their underlying fresh groundwater resources post 2005 some of which are already subject to excessive rates of abstraction and exhibit signs of seawater intrusion swi i e the landward movement of seawater within an aquifer swi is driven by pumping land use changes and climate change including sea level rise which are predicted to increasingly threaten the reliability of coastal aquifer freshwater resources ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013a b coastal fresh groundwater is primarily evaluated in the onshore sections of coastal aquifers despite that freshwater can exist in the submarine extensions of confined and semi confined coastal aquifers referred to collectively as semi confined in the remainder of this article kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 as a result conceptual and numerical models are often truncated at or near the shoreline sanford and buapeng 1996 uscoe 1998 delinom 2008 lubis et al 2008 bresciani et al 2015 knowling et al 2015 neglecting potentially strong linkages between onshore and offshore systems michael et al 2017 offshore fresh groundwater ofg has been recognised as a potential water resource for many coastal communities cohen et al 2010 bakken et al 2012 post et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 ofg bodies are separated from seawater by a dispersive mixing zone and are characterised by salinities that typically freshen towards the coastline groen et al 2000 cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 in this study freshwater is considered to have a salinity in terms of total dissolved solids tds of 1 g l approximately 3 of seawater consistent with the definitions of cohen et al 2010 and post et al 2013 we also consider salinities equal to 50 of seawater concentration i e tds 17 5 g l for comparison to the location of sharp interface representations of the freshwater seawater mixing zone obtained from analytical methods recent work suggests that ofg i e tds 1 g l is more common than previously thought with both cohen et al 2010 and post et al 2013 estimating that there is 3 105 km3 contained globally within passive continental margins brackish water tds 10 g l is estimated to total 5 105 km3 post et al 2013 these estimates have large uncertainties due to the scarcity of offshore data the current status of ofg globally requires distinction between the present day and pre development conditions of coastal aquifers given that anthropogenic impacts on coastal aquifers are pervasive michael et al 2017 post and werner 2017 in this study we use the term modern to refer collectively to both present day and pre development conditions i e under current sea levels present day conditions refer to the most recent head measurements these were available for a range of times covering the period 1999 2017 pre development conditions are represented by the water level that existed prior to significant onshore drawdowns due to human development this is commonly challenging to determine and hence where pre development water levels were not defined in previous articles we extrapolated head records back to 1960 the year 1960 was selected as the earliest available year where backwards extrapolation in time was supported by field data from the same decade in at least a few cases two primary sources of ofg have been identified 1 entrapped paleo freshwater e g meisler et al 1984 essaid 1990 groen et al 2000 and 2 modern freshwater discharge i e the flow from onshore aquifers to subsea aquifers under current sea level conditions kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 michael et al 2016 ofg may be a mixture of both origins cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 paleo freshwater is thought to have been emplaced during historic glacial maxima when lower sea levels increased continental shelf exposure and elevated recharge in some regions led to bodies of fresh and brackish water extending significant offshore distances from present day coastlines groen et al 2000 cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 the last glacial maximum occurred approximately 19 000 years before present yokoyama et al 2000 as seas rose to their current levels coastal migration rates exceeded the landward movement of the freshwater seawater interface resulting in seawater overtopping aquifers containing freshwater kooi and groen 2001 post et al 2013 for ofg to persist despite transgression an overlying aquitard is required to inhibit vertical mixing of freshwater and seawater which is otherwise driven by buoyancy forces due to the unstable water density configuration laattoe et al 2013 this paleo water is thought to be slowly salinizing through the diffusion of salt from adjacent strata and the gradual landward movement of the freshwater seawater interface groen et al 2000 post et al 2013 modern contributions to ofg bodies occur within offshore semi confined aquifers where recharge exceeds onshore discharge in continental aquifers leading to offshore groundwater flow kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 referred to as ofg inflow in what follows ofg inflow differs to submarine fresh groundwater discharge sfgd in that the latter is usually recognised as groundwater discharge into the sea rather than into aquifers below the sea this is an important distinction because ofg inflows are inputs to offshore aquifers whereas sfgd is an output whether or not ofg inflow occurs at the same rate as sfgd from offshore aquifers determines whether the offshore aquifer is losing or gaining freshwater notwithstanding salinization due to dispersion the offshore distance that sfgd and the ofg that derives from modern ofg inflows referred to as modern ofg in what follows extend is dependent on numerous factors for example modern ofg inflows can penetrate further where the overlying aquitard has a lower hydraulic conductivity k and or larger thickness the semi confined aquifer has a higher k and or the groundwater head gradient driving freshwater offshore is steeper kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 in addition to these factors michael et al 2016 found that well connected heterogeneities in the subsea geology may lead to ofg occurring at more extensive offshore distances than would be expected in homogeneous aquifers previous investigations of ofg primarily focus on the occurrence characteristics and extent of freshwater however where pumping lowers the onshore heads of aquifers connected to ofg bodies drawdown may extend beyond the shoreline potentially causing the ofg volume to reduce in this way ofg may partly support the total onshore extraction of fresh groundwater post et al 2013 morgan and werner 2015 beebe et al 2006 only a handful of localised studies have considered the interactions between ofg and onshore hydrogeological conditions for example regional sharp interface modelling by mcauley et al 2001 and pope 2006 concluded that under current pumping regimes the freshwater saltwater interface will reach the new jersey usa shoreline within the atlantic city 800 foot sand aquifer in 710 years preliminary studies of ofg bodies proximal to perth australia morgan et al 2016 and palmahim israel amir et al 2013 have also been undertaken however it is presently unknown from a global perspective whether and for which aquifers ofg is critical for the onshore management of coastal fresh groundwater and the degree to which onshore pumping is drawing on ofg this study aims to develop conceptual models of coastal aquifers known to host significant ofg and where onshore pumping occurs thereby providing initial conclusions about links between onshore and offshore conditions we compare freshwater saltwater distributions predicted through rudimentary analytical modelling of modern conditions i e both present day and pre development heads to observed onshore and offshore salinity data from this we draw initial interpretations of a whether ofg influences onshore salinities at each study site and b whether the known extent of ofg is attributable to modern ofg inflow assuming homogeneous aquifer properties or whether other factors dominate the ofg extent we also investigate a number of regions where onshore data are used to infer the presence of ofg this facilitates a preliminary assessment of the potential onshore influence of ofg in data poor areas 2 methods the direction of groundwater flow at the shoreline of coastal aquifers can be inferred by comparing the onshore piezometric head hb to the equivalent freshwater head hf imposed by the sea werner 2017 this assumes that the coastal aquifer is exposed to the sea at some location at which point the offshore groundwater head reflects the head of the ocean the value of hf adopted in this study is applicable only to aquifers with onshore extents that exhibit semi confined rather than unconfined conditions because these aquifers are most likely to host significant ofg the coastal aquifer arrangement that is adopted in this study for the purposes of applying available analytical solutions to ofg extent arising from ofg inflow is illustrated in fig 1 ofg inflows are expected to occur where hb hf otherwise the onshore aquifer is likely to be actively drawing water from its subsea part the value of hf is determined by werner 2017 1 h f ρ s ρ f ρ f z 0 h where ρf and ρs are the respective densities of freshwater and seawater m l3 other variables are defined in fig 1 hydraulic gradients indicating groundwater flow in the onshore direction i e hb hf are associated with active swi whereby the landward movement of seawater is in the same direction as groundwater flow werner 2017 active swi is expected to eventually cause relatively rapid salinization of the near shore aquifer morgan and werner 2015 werner 2017 this contrasts to passive swi whereby seawater moves landwards despite freshwater flowing towards the coast resulting in the partial salinization of the onshore aquifer passive swi in offshore aquifers may occur due to a reduction in ofg inflow without eliminating it altogether in a sharp interface conceptualisation passive swi is characterised by a landward movement of the interface toe i e where the freshwater saltwater interface intercepts the base of the aquifer and in some cases the interface tip i e where the freshwater saltwater interface intercepts the top of the aquifer the toe may eventually come to rest in the onshore or offshore regions of the aquifer whereas the tip remains offshore due to the persistence of ofg inflow under passive swi scenarios in coastal aquifers with significant ofg swi may take place over considerable timeframes without salinization of onshore wells because the loss of freshwater occurs in the offshore part of the aquifer thus some knowledge of offshore salinities is critical to understanding the potential for salinization of onshore aquifers from which pumping occurs a preliminary estimate of the steady state extent of modern ofg is possible for coastal aquifers where hb hf through application of an analytical solution developed concurrently by werner and robinson 2018 werner and robinson 2018 modify the solutions of bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 who assumed that the offshore aquitard contains seawater to allow for alternative aquitard salinities the modification by werner and robinson 2018 responds to the findings of another concurrent investigation by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who show that where sfgd occurs the offshore aquitard is more likely to contain freshwater thereby changing significantly the prediction of ofg otherwise obtained from the bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 solutions while bakker 2006 adopted a prescribed flux representation of the inland boundary condition bakker et al 2017 and werner and robinson 2018 allow for a prescribed head condition to be implemented the available analytical solutions for ofg apply to idealised aquifer geometries consistent with fig 1 they are based on a number of assumptions including that 1 the zone of mixing between freshwater and seawater can be represented by a line of pressure equilibrium i e a sharp interface 2 the offshore aquifer is in equilibrium with onshore heads i e steady state conditions 3 the aquifer and the overlying aquitard in the offshore region are isotropic and homogeneous and 4 freshwater flow in the aquifer is horizontal flow in the aquitard is vertical and seawater is stagnant a minimal number of input parameters are required which is commensurate with the limited available data for almost all of the aquifers considered in this study coastal aquifer parameters required for the werner and robinson 2018 solution are obtained from existing literature and are available at several sites around the world as given in table 1 the interface tip xtip and toe xtoe positions were calculated for each region the parameters required are the aquifer hydraulic conductivity ka l t aquitard vertical hydraulic conductivity kl l t h d z 0 hb xb and ls see fig 1 due to limitations in the available data a single set of base case aquifer properties was adopted for each site despite that spatial variability in most parameters is likely the distance to the edge of the continental shelf was used in areas where ls is undefined in existing literature the termination of the continental shelf was obtained from global bathymetry data ncei 2017 in some cases two land masses abut the offshore region and hence it is not possible to define a distance to the edge of the continental shelf in these instances ls was taken arbitrarily as the distance to the shoreline of the neighbouring land mass the coastal aquifers of kent england are an example of this whereby the submerged continental shelf connects to france without exceeding a bathymetric depth of 55 m to capture some of the known spatial variability in hb maximum hbmax and minimum hbmin values were obtained where available from either well data or potentiometric contours to allow for investigations of the impact of onshore development on ofg extent pre development heads hb were obtained where historical head information was available where pre development heads varied spatially within a single aquifer the maximum head within the near coastal zone was adopted the maximum head was selected because the available measurements probably under estimate if anything the true pre development head levels given that human impacts are likely to have been occurring well before 1960 in many cases this also allowed for the identification of aquifers where paleo ofg and or aquifer heterogeneities are required to explain observed ofg extents extracted from offshore measurements 3 review of coastal aquifers with significant ofg 3 1 identification of aquifers with significant ofg we considered three conditions that are indicative of the presence of significant ofg in the selection of regions for further analysis firstly we selected regions with offshore groundwater salinities below tds 17 5 g l approximately 50 seawater salinity as interpreted from offshore well observations and or resistivity surveys secondly we included semi confined coastal aquifers where hb hf as this is indicative of ofg inflow thirdly we identified regions where onshore freshwater is observed close to the shoreline in semi confined aquifers despite hb hf these regions are thought to indicate the occurrence of ofg because active swi conditions would otherwise be expected to have caused extensive groundwater salinization in the onshore aquifer at least where onshore groundwater levels have been lowered for extended periods the identification of regions with significant ofg was initially guided by the previous investigation of post et al 2013 ten of the fourteen regions identified by post et al 2013 that satisfied the selection criteria had sufficient data to allow for the application of the werner and robinson 2018 solution and were included in the analysis in addition to the regions identified by post et al 2013 this study includes three regions where the presence of ofg is indicated by resistivity surveys or by freshwater measurements in offshore wells a further fourteen regions were identified where ofg can be inferred from hb hf and or onshore salinities fig 2 shows the location of the twenty seven regions analysed in this study plus the four regions mentioned by post et al 2013 that were omitted from the current analysis due to data constraints there may be other regions where ofg can be implied that were not included in this study due to either data limitations or the highly channelized nature of the recorded ofg body requiring investigative methods beyond the scope of this study e g krantz et al 2004 danskin 2012 3 2 identification of regions at risk of active swi the driving head hb hf i e the difference between the onshore head and the equivalent freshwater head at the top of the offshore aquifer of the sea was assessed for each region to identify aquifers where present day groundwater levels are insufficient to prevent active swi this was undertaken by applying eq 1 to the parameters in table 1 including both hbmin and hbmax negative values indicate that active swi is likely occurring table 2 lists the driving heads for each region analysed in this study the regions are listed in order of ascending minimum driving heads hbmin hf it is important to distinguish whether active swi occurs at considerable distance offshore or within onshore aquifers because this dictates the timeframe for onshore aquifer salinization and the vulnerability of wells to salinity impacts more generally the regions where saltwater has been observed in onshore aquifers are identified in table 2 which also describes any published interpretations of the sources of saltwater for example relic is assigned to regions where saltwater is found in the onshore aquifer and thought to have been emplaced in the aquifer prior to modern conditions e g under prehistoric sea levels and climates relic saltwater may also include non marine sources in onshore aquifers e g mineral dissolution although marine and non marine salinization sources are typically not differentiated in the studies that we reviewed in situations involving relic saltwater movement aquifer salinization may not reflect the classic conceptualisation of swi where seawater movements are linked to variations in groundwater heads relative to sea levels in table 2 swi recorded is used to indicate that aquifer salinization has been observed that is a decline in the onshore head under modern conditions is thought to have caused the movement of the freshwater seawater interface into and or landward in the onshore aquifer in addition undefined source is prescribed to sites where saltwater has been noted onshore but no information is available on its origins regions where there is a reasonable level of onshore investigation i e at least five salinity monitoring sites in the near shore 5 km region and yet no seawater has been identified in the onshore semi confined aquifer are given a none observed classification in table 2 lastly regions where the data are inadequate to reasonably ascertain the occurrence or otherwise of saltwater in the aquifer are designated nd fourteen of the twenty seven regions had sufficient data to define both hbmin and hbmax otherwise only a single value for hb has been used commensurate with the limited degree of published investigation in six regions both hbmin and hbmax indicate active swi within the semi confined aquifer based on eq 1 in five regions significant variations between hbmin and hbmax result in hbmin signifying active swi while hbmax indicates ofg inflows in three regions both hbmin and hbmax indicate ofg inflow a comparison can be made between driving heads and the associated implications for the freshwater seawater relationship and whether or not seawater is observed in the near shore zones of coastal aquifers where the near shore groundwater remains fresh despite the presence of negative driving heads indicating landward flow table 2 the most likely explanation is that onshore salinity data are yet to identify the presence of swi occurring seaward of pumping wells we associate this situation to the occurrence of ofg that is delaying the onset of near shore onshore swi conversely significant modern ofg is less likely to be present in regions where swi is observed and the driving head is negative because these factors indicate that the buffering effect of ofg and the hydraulic conditions associated with ofg inflows are lacking in four cases the analytical solution predicts seawater within the onshore aquifer but none has been found thereby indicating potential ofg reserves three regions show evidence of swi in field measurements and exhibit negative driving heads and therefore the likelihood of modern ofg in those offshore aquifers is probably low 3 3 calculated ofg extents and comparisons to offshore observations for the regions where ofg inflows are predicted under present day conditions xtip and xtoe were calculated using available present day head data and through application of the werner and robinson 2018 steady state solution the results are presented in table 3 positive values of xtip and xtoe indicate an offshore position and negative values an onshore position in addition to xtip and xtoe table 3 also includes the cases where the driving head indicates active swi where offshore salinity data are available table 3 records the distances from the shoreline to offshore wells containing groundwater with salinities 50 of seawater tds 17 5 g l or ofg extents interpreted from resistivity studies we adopt the distances presented by post et al 2013 for the location of the offshore wells while the ofg extents estimated from resistivity surveys were obtained from various references as listed in table 1 regions in table 3 are ordered by ascending xtoe values obtained from application of hbmax to the analytical solution the calculated steady state ofg extents table 3 that correspond with present day heads are used here in developing coastal aquifer conceptual models these allow for the identification of regions where no onshore seawater is expected i e positive xtip and xtoe under steady state conditions and regions where seawater is predicted to eventually reach the onshore aquifer i e negative xtoe as mentioned above active swi is likely occurring in six regions based on both hbmin and hbmax in two regions hbmin indicates active swi while hbmax indicates a positive xtip and a negative xtoe in three regions hbmin is consistent with the occurrence of active swi while hbmax indicates that the interface is entirely offshore of the thirteen regions with only a single hb value the driving heads of three are commensurate with active swi eight with an onshore xtoe and two with entirely offshore freshwater seawater interfaces in algarve the gambier embayment and eckernförde bay xtip from the analytical solution reaches ls indicating that present day ofg inflows generated from hbmax are sufficient to drive freshwater to the termination of the semi confined aquifer given sufficient time where onshore salinity data are available table 2 the salinity data indicate that the observed interface does not approximate the predicted present day steady state interface with the exception of carnarvon more specifically in the fourteen regions with offshore salinity data the value of xtip arising from hbmax is significantly landwards of known offshore groundwater with tds 17 5 g l this provides initial evidence that a component of offshore groundwater is likely sourced from either pre development ofg inflows paleo freshwater and or the effects of aquifer heterogeneity 3 4 calculated ofg extents from pre development conditions to investigate the possible contribution of pre development conditions to ofg development the werner and robinson 2018 solution was applied to obtain the steady state interface location from hb which was available for fifteen of the regions included in this study the calculated pre development tip xtip and toe xtoe are given in table 4 the pre development driving heads and the difference in the predicted steady state tip δxtip and toe δxtoe position between pre development i e hb and present day i e hbmax conditions are also presented table 4 is ordered by the pre development driving head hb hf in eight of the fifteen regions listed in table 4 the extents calculated from hb place the entire interface offshore active swi is predicted in two regions while an onshore interface toe is predicted in five regions in three regions there is no change in xtip from pre development to present day conditions as both hb and hbmax are sufficient to drive freshwater to the offshore termination of the aquitard except for carnarvon present day water levels are lower than their pre development counterparts causing a potential loss in stored freshwater due to human activities large seasonal water level fluctuations at carnarvon mask any longer term trends and therefore the head drop from 1960 to 2016 extrapolated from metered records covering the period 1974 2009 is presumed negligible in five regions head declines pre development to present day result in a reversal of flow at the coastline whereby ofg inflows are calculated from the estimated value of hb and active swi arises from the value of hbmax in three regions the decline in hb causes the steady state interface toe to move onshore resulting in a prediction of onshore passive swi in regions where hbmax predicts either active swi or an onshore interface toe yet pre development heads indicate an entirely offshore interface it is likely that onshore freshwater extractions have historically relied at least partly on ofg emplaced under pre development conditions some reliance on ofg is also expected albeit to a lesser degree in semi confined coastal aquifers where the toe is predicted to have moved landward between pre development and present day conditions in all regions listed in table 4 xtip is significantly landwards of where offshore groundwater with tds 17 5 g l is observed table 3 this suggests that for the regions included in this study paleo freshwater and or aquifer heterogeneity likely contribute to the observed offshore salinities the contribution of paleo freshwater proposed in this study is in agreeance with previous regional studies that also propose paleo freshwater contributions to ofg e g in suriname groen et al 2000 nantucket island marksamer et al 2007 south florida morrissey et al 2010 and southern dobruja soulet et al 2010 in both perth and shanghai hb is not sufficient to generate ofg inflows thereby indicating the occurrence of active swi even under pre development conditions this suggests that the onshore aquifer may have been drawing on ofg prior to 1960 e g due to pre 1960 groundwater development and or disequilibrium over geological timescales and that in these regions onshore reliance on ofg may have been occurring for considerable periods 3 5 known limitations of analytical methods for calculating ofg extents the simplifications of real world aquifers required to resolve the werner and robinson 2018 analytical solution impart significant uncertainties in the resulting estimates of ofg extent for example most coastal aquifers considered in the current study slope downwards in the offshore direction whereas werner and robinson 2018 assume that the aquifer is horizontal consistent with earlier conceptual models by bakker 2006 and others the extent of freshwater in sloping aquifers is likely to be less than that predicted by the werner and robinson 2018 solution because downward sloping aquifers are subjected to increasingly higher heads imposed by the sea in the offshore direction due to the higher equivalent freshwater heads of the sea with increasing depth also seaward slopes tend to restrict landward seawater movement because the heavier seawater must overcome the gravity forces that accompany the aquifer slope e g koussis et al 2012 our analysis also suffers from the usual challenges of finding reliable aquifer properties the offshore environment is often poorly characterised post et al 2013 some aquifers do not have clearly defined locations offshore where they connect to the sea due to highly heterogeneous overlying aquitards complex geologies and or the paucity of offshore geological information for example in the northern portion of the upper floridian aquifer foyle et al 2002 identify several discrete zones where either aquitard thinning or incision by paleo channels results in locally increased fluid exchange between the semi confined aquifer and the overlying seawater column despite this prior analytical modelling of this system by bakker 2006 adopted the edge of the continental shelf as the aquifer ocean connection in general where aquitards are heterogeneous and or discontinuous analytical solutions that presume uniform aquitard properties likely over predict the steady state ofg extent thus it is noteworthy that our analytical results underestimate the known offshore freshwater extents while the werner and robinson 2018 solution treats the coastal aquifer as homogenous offshore aquifers often contain significant heterogeneities e g michael et al 2016 using numerical modelling michael et al 2016 show that where heterogeneity results in well connected preferential flow pathways freshwater can penetrate further offshore than in equivalent homogeneous k models they conclude that the assumption of homogeneity could result in an under estimation of the extent of ofg generated by ofg inflows however the coastal aquifer arrangement adopted by werner and robinson 2018 differs to that used by michael et al 2016 in their homogenous k models werner and robinson 2018 separate the offshore extent vertically into an aquifer and an aquitard hence deviating from the single hydrostratigraphic unit used by michael et al 2016 to compare homogeneous and heterogeneous realisations it is unknown if the impacts of heterogeneity obtained by michael et al 2016 are of the same magnitude as would be obtained for the layered aquifer aquitard arrangement adopted by werner and robinson 2018 another limitation of the current approach is the reliance on predicted interface locations that are in steady state coastal aquifers are slow to respond to changes in hydraulic conditions post et al 2013 and therefore the long periods required to approach steady state salinity distributions may exceed the time scales of marine regression transgression sequences thus steady state conditions may not be realistic and only representative of the potential for the interface to move to a new alignment that is the predicted interface positions may only inform the potential for interface movement thereby reflecting the current knowledge of coastal aquifer conditions and the associated human induced head changes over time the limitations mentioned above result in varying albeit unknown uncertainties associated with the calculated steady state tip and toe positions the inferred uncertainty likely increases with distance offshore given that aquifer parameters obtained from nearshore measurements are increasingly less likely to be representative of subsea aquifer properties in the offshore direction 3 6 conceptual models for coastal aquifers with ofg we propose several alternative conceptual models of onshore offshore groundwater systems founded on available case studies and on the interpretations of interface conditions derived from tables 2 and 3 the conceptual models shown in fig 3 while not exhaustive present important relationships between onshore extractions and ofg and its sources observed in the regions included in this study along with other critical elements of the offshore hydrogeology that are fundamental to management decision making regarding coastal fresh groundwater the first three conceptual models fig 3a c represent steady state interface situations whereby any ofg is attributable only to stable long term continental discharge i e the assumption of bakker 2006 and others in the first conceptual model fig 3a the interface is entirely offshore in fig 3b the toe is onshore and the tip is offshore the well shown in fig 3b may or may not have caused the onshore i e rather than offshore position of the toe fig 3c shows the final anticipated situation arising from active swi causing salinization of onshore wells the four models shown in fig 3d g incorporate paleo freshwater and or freshwater emplaced by pre development inflows whereby present day ofg inflows are only responsible for a portion of ofg the presence of paleo freshwater and or freshwater emplaced by pre development ofg inflows results in freshwater occurring seaward of the steady state interface location that corresponds with present day water levels bodies of offshore paleo freshwater can be considered as unstable because they are likely being reduced by the diffusion of seawater vertical leakage and or from hydraulic conditions that tend to draw the interface onshore at least in aquifers where groundwater is flowing this assumes that paleo freshwater no longer has a modern day source we consider the conceptual models shown in fig 3a c to be the steady state equivalents of fig 3d f whereby freshwater from paleo and or pre development sources are eventually exhausted leading to the realisation of interface locations that correspond with present day hydraulic conditions fig 3d f represent aquifers with decreasing ofg inflows such that fig 3d is the result of the highest ofg inflows in fig 3d the predicted present day steady state interface is entirely offshore however due to the presence of pre development and or paleo freshwater the actual freshwater saltwater interface occurs seaward of the steady state interface predicted for present day conditions in fig 3e seawater is entirely offshore although under steady state conditions seawater is expected to cross the shoreline due to passive swi see fig 3b the persistence of ofg inflows ensures that part of the onshore aquifer remains fresh despite passive swi predicted onshore in fig 3f hb is lower than hf this causes both the downwards advection of seawater through the offshore aquitard and landward movement of the interface in the form of active swi in this conceptual model the persistence of freshwater between the pumping well and the shoreline is completely reliant on the presence of ofg and in particular paleo freshwater fig 3g represents one of many possibilities for deviations from the idealised conceptual model adopted in the analytical solutions applied in this investigation here we show an aquitard that contains a zone of thinning which causes localised salinization of the underlying aquifer while fig 3g displays a conceptualisation of downward leakage we acknowledge numerous other conceptual models involving a wide range of aquifer salinization mechanisms including the influence of aquifer and aquitard heterogeneity the upward leakage of saltwater through underlying aquitards the movement of paleo saltwater and salinization from other e g non marine sources other situations may include temporary or three dimensional processes that are difficult to illustrate in cross section such as up coning and variability in the long shore direction causing seawater to move firstly landward and then towards wells from directions not necessarily perpendicular to the shoreline the naming of conceptual models in the remainder is consistent with the sub figure labelling in fig 3 e g fig 3a shows model a the likelihood that ofg has an influence on onshore salinities can be inferred for models d f in model d the predicted steady state interface is entirely offshore meaning that it is unlikely that ofg contributes to present day onshore salinities in model e ofg serves to delay the appearance of seawater in the onshore aquifer although well salinization is not anticipated pre development and or paleo freshwater stored in the aquifer may be removed through pumping leakage through the overlying aquitard and or diffusion driven salinization for model f pumping is at least partly maintained by the landward movement of ofg from offshore and the future availability of fresh groundwater is closely related to the pre development and or paleo ofg extent as model g represents many alternative complex situations there is a wide variety of possible levels of onshore use of ofg arising from this model 3 7 global assessment of the potential onshore influence of ofg using the available data i e related to onshore and offshore salinity and the predicted present day steady state interface position each of the twenty seven regions considered in this study are assigned one or more of the conceptual models developed in section 3 6 the results are given in table 5 which also includes the estimated likelihood that onshore salinities are influenced significantly by ofg the assigned likelihoods shown in table 5 are largely subjective being based on the available data and analytical solution results presented above for example regions consistent with model d are assumed to have only a low likelihood of ofg influencing the onshore salinity in regions similar to model e ofg is assumed to have a moderate influence on the onshore salinity in regions consistent with model f there is a high inferred likelihood that ofg significantly influences the onshore salinity in several regions variations in hbmin and hbmax require the assignment of one or more conceptual models to encompass the observed and predicted conditions where multiple conceptual models are assigned a range of inferred levels of ofg influence is also given sixteen of the regions shown in table 5 could be described using a single conceptual model and were assigned a single likelihood of ofg influencing their onshore salinities in nine and seven regions it is inferred that there are high and moderate likelihoods respectively that onshore salinities are influenced by ofg in four regions carnarvon kent algarve and howard springs the available salinity data are insufficient to allow for comparison with the steady state estimates of the interface position in these four regions it was not possible to differentiate between the steady state models a c and their transient equivalents d f in kent algarve and howard springs the steady state interface predicted for present day conditions is entirely offshore as a result it is inferred that there is a low likelihood that ofg influences onshore salinities in these three regions while swi is recorded onshore in carnarvon the available onshore salinity data are insufficient to determine the position of the interface in addition no offshore salinity data are available for comparison to the predicted ofg extent as a result no inference can be made as to whether the approximate steady state salinity distribution has been achieved and hence the possible onshore influence of ofg remains unknown in seven regions spatial variations in hb result in multiple conceptual models being required to encompass the predicted and observed conditions accordingly there is spatially variability in the likelihood that onshore salinities are influenced by ofg large differences between hbmin and hbmax in northern florida canterbury and aveiro create conditions whereby model d best represents the conditions associated with hbmax whereas models f and or g are consistent with the conditions predicted for hbmin the occurrence of conceptual models involving ofg inflows models d and e and active swi model f in a single region indicates that freshwater recirculation may be occurring within the offshore aquifer that is freshwater may discharge to the submarine aquifer in one area and then flow alongshore within the offshore aquifer before being drawn back onshore by pumping however significant offshore groundwater flow parallel to the coastline has not been identified in previous publications rather ofg distributions are typically studied using transects perpendicular to the shoreline and thus the effect of this transverse movement in the offshore aquifer on ofg distributions is presently unknown the importance of alongshore flow particular in relation to the use of cross sectional analysis requires further investigation previous work in canterbury and bangkok identify that the vertical movement of seawater from overlying strata is at least partly responsible for the swi observed in the onshore aquifer as a result conceptual model g was used to describe the coastal aquifer in these two regions in canterbury historical swi was linked to the downwards migration of seawater from an overlying estuary resulting in localised swi scott and wilson 2012 in bangkok regional salinization of the semi confined aquifer is thought to be at least partially driven by downwards leakance of saltwater from overlying salinized aquifers buapeng and wattayakorn 2008 onodera et al 2009 in table 5 swi or saltwater from an undefined source is noted in eight regions including canterbury and bangkok with the exception of canterbury and bangkok previous studies propose that swi is primarily a result of the interface moving horizontally landward in these regions the inferred likelihoods given in table 5 are shown in fig 4 the propensity of a region to be classified as having a high moderate or low likelihood of ofg influencing the onshore salinity appears to be largely independent of its spatial location perhaps regions in europe have a slightly lower tendency to be classed as having a high likelihood that ofg influences onshore salinities than elsewhere however anthropogenic factors such as population density and the high variability and scantness of ofg data make it difficult to detect the influence of climate recharge and geology thereby obscuring any spatially controlled global scale relationships ofg is possibly assisting in the maintenance of coastal water qualities in 70 of the regions included in this study however only three of these regions have investigations into their onshore offshore freshwater interactions pope 2006 depaul and rosman 2015 amir et al 2013 morgan et al 2016 the scarcity of studies into the onshore use of ofg suggests that much of this use is either inadvertent or at least is not informed by knowledge of the contributions to freshwater availability of ofg emplaced under paleo and or pre development conditions in regions where it is highly or moderately likely that ofg influences the onshore salinities regional investigations that incorporate ofg into water management decision making are vital for understanding the long term viability of groundwater pumping from the onshore aquifer 4 conclusions in this study we present seven simplified conceptual models that characterise onshore offshore freshwater interactions the proposed models describe for the first time the main predicted and observed onshore offshore freshwater interactions in semi confined coastal aquifers that extend offshore they show how ofg generated from paleo or pre development conditions can delay the onset of swi in the onshore portion of coastal aquifers assisting in the persistence of freshwater supply from onshore coastal wells a first pass evaluation of the likely onshore influence of ofg was undertaken in twenty seven coastal aquifers through the application of a recently developed analytical solution in conjunction with available onshore and offshore salinity data the findings of this investigation suggest that ofg has a moderate to high influence on onshore salinities in twenty three of the studied regions included in these twenty three regions are fourteen regions where water of tds 17 5 g l has been found offshore these findings indicate that all of the known ofg bodies with onshore linkages are likely already being mined either passively or actively through onshore extractions and as such should be assessed in regional water balances so that future freshwater availability is well understood estimates of the onshore groundwater conditions prior to contemporary groundwater development indicate that ofg was being generated through discharge to offshore aquifers in thirteen of the fifteen regions for which pre development data are available onshore heads were found to decline between pre development and present day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions with pre development data this decline results in a landward movement of the predicted steady state freshwater saltwater interface and a reduction of ofg the steady state freshwater saltwater interface positions obtained through the application of the analytical solution for both present day and pre development conditions were unable to explain the available offshore salinity data in all regions investigated as a result either aquifer heterogeneity or paleo ofg are required to explain observed offshore salinity data for the regions considered in this study while analytical methods provide a useful tool in screening sites for further investigation transient numerical approaches that include paleo freshwater are likely required for the realistic estimation of ofg volume and extent at present the contribution of ofg to onshore water supply is poorly recognised in the existing literature the potentially widespread influence of ofg on onshore groundwater identified in this paper suggests that there is a need for further work investigating both the vulnerability of ofg to onshore drawdowns and the transient behaviour of ofg under both passive and active swi conditions if coastal freshwater resources are to be managed responsibly acknowledgements the author andrew knight is supported by a research training program scholarship adrian werner is

7306,freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities however the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale this study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities considering various sites from around the world the groundwater conditions in twenty seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored the investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels and offshore salinity knowledge in combination with analytical modelling to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling we consider both present day and pre development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability the results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre development and present day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre development data are available estimates of the associated steady state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines both present day and pre development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist this suggests that paleo freshwater and or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent present day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion swi will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty seven sites while passive swi is expected onshore in an additional ten regions albeit the number of field sites is limited there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use thus offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal water balances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input rather than as a new potential freshwater resource keywords offshore fresh groundwater coastal aquifer saltwater intrusion analytical modelling 1 introduction elevated population densities in many coastal regions are thought to place significant pressures on their underlying fresh groundwater resources post 2005 some of which are already subject to excessive rates of abstraction and exhibit signs of seawater intrusion swi i e the landward movement of seawater within an aquifer swi is driven by pumping land use changes and climate change including sea level rise which are predicted to increasingly threaten the reliability of coastal aquifer freshwater resources ferguson and gleeson 2012 werner et al 2013a b coastal fresh groundwater is primarily evaluated in the onshore sections of coastal aquifers despite that freshwater can exist in the submarine extensions of confined and semi confined coastal aquifers referred to collectively as semi confined in the remainder of this article kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 as a result conceptual and numerical models are often truncated at or near the shoreline sanford and buapeng 1996 uscoe 1998 delinom 2008 lubis et al 2008 bresciani et al 2015 knowling et al 2015 neglecting potentially strong linkages between onshore and offshore systems michael et al 2017 offshore fresh groundwater ofg has been recognised as a potential water resource for many coastal communities cohen et al 2010 bakken et al 2012 post et al 2013 jiao et al 2015 ofg bodies are separated from seawater by a dispersive mixing zone and are characterised by salinities that typically freshen towards the coastline groen et al 2000 cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 in this study freshwater is considered to have a salinity in terms of total dissolved solids tds of 1 g l approximately 3 of seawater consistent with the definitions of cohen et al 2010 and post et al 2013 we also consider salinities equal to 50 of seawater concentration i e tds 17 5 g l for comparison to the location of sharp interface representations of the freshwater seawater mixing zone obtained from analytical methods recent work suggests that ofg i e tds 1 g l is more common than previously thought with both cohen et al 2010 and post et al 2013 estimating that there is 3 105 km3 contained globally within passive continental margins brackish water tds 10 g l is estimated to total 5 105 km3 post et al 2013 these estimates have large uncertainties due to the scarcity of offshore data the current status of ofg globally requires distinction between the present day and pre development conditions of coastal aquifers given that anthropogenic impacts on coastal aquifers are pervasive michael et al 2017 post and werner 2017 in this study we use the term modern to refer collectively to both present day and pre development conditions i e under current sea levels present day conditions refer to the most recent head measurements these were available for a range of times covering the period 1999 2017 pre development conditions are represented by the water level that existed prior to significant onshore drawdowns due to human development this is commonly challenging to determine and hence where pre development water levels were not defined in previous articles we extrapolated head records back to 1960 the year 1960 was selected as the earliest available year where backwards extrapolation in time was supported by field data from the same decade in at least a few cases two primary sources of ofg have been identified 1 entrapped paleo freshwater e g meisler et al 1984 essaid 1990 groen et al 2000 and 2 modern freshwater discharge i e the flow from onshore aquifers to subsea aquifers under current sea level conditions kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 michael et al 2016 ofg may be a mixture of both origins cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 paleo freshwater is thought to have been emplaced during historic glacial maxima when lower sea levels increased continental shelf exposure and elevated recharge in some regions led to bodies of fresh and brackish water extending significant offshore distances from present day coastlines groen et al 2000 cohen et al 2010 post et al 2013 siegel et al 2014 the last glacial maximum occurred approximately 19 000 years before present yokoyama et al 2000 as seas rose to their current levels coastal migration rates exceeded the landward movement of the freshwater seawater interface resulting in seawater overtopping aquifers containing freshwater kooi and groen 2001 post et al 2013 for ofg to persist despite transgression an overlying aquitard is required to inhibit vertical mixing of freshwater and seawater which is otherwise driven by buoyancy forces due to the unstable water density configuration laattoe et al 2013 this paleo water is thought to be slowly salinizing through the diffusion of salt from adjacent strata and the gradual landward movement of the freshwater seawater interface groen et al 2000 post et al 2013 modern contributions to ofg bodies occur within offshore semi confined aquifers where recharge exceeds onshore discharge in continental aquifers leading to offshore groundwater flow kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 referred to as ofg inflow in what follows ofg inflow differs to submarine fresh groundwater discharge sfgd in that the latter is usually recognised as groundwater discharge into the sea rather than into aquifers below the sea this is an important distinction because ofg inflows are inputs to offshore aquifers whereas sfgd is an output whether or not ofg inflow occurs at the same rate as sfgd from offshore aquifers determines whether the offshore aquifer is losing or gaining freshwater notwithstanding salinization due to dispersion the offshore distance that sfgd and the ofg that derives from modern ofg inflows referred to as modern ofg in what follows extend is dependent on numerous factors for example modern ofg inflows can penetrate further where the overlying aquitard has a lower hydraulic conductivity k and or larger thickness the semi confined aquifer has a higher k and or the groundwater head gradient driving freshwater offshore is steeper kooi and groen 2001 bakker 2006 in addition to these factors michael et al 2016 found that well connected heterogeneities in the subsea geology may lead to ofg occurring at more extensive offshore distances than would be expected in homogeneous aquifers previous investigations of ofg primarily focus on the occurrence characteristics and extent of freshwater however where pumping lowers the onshore heads of aquifers connected to ofg bodies drawdown may extend beyond the shoreline potentially causing the ofg volume to reduce in this way ofg may partly support the total onshore extraction of fresh groundwater post et al 2013 morgan and werner 2015 beebe et al 2006 only a handful of localised studies have considered the interactions between ofg and onshore hydrogeological conditions for example regional sharp interface modelling by mcauley et al 2001 and pope 2006 concluded that under current pumping regimes the freshwater saltwater interface will reach the new jersey usa shoreline within the atlantic city 800 foot sand aquifer in 710 years preliminary studies of ofg bodies proximal to perth australia morgan et al 2016 and palmahim israel amir et al 2013 have also been undertaken however it is presently unknown from a global perspective whether and for which aquifers ofg is critical for the onshore management of coastal fresh groundwater and the degree to which onshore pumping is drawing on ofg this study aims to develop conceptual models of coastal aquifers known to host significant ofg and where onshore pumping occurs thereby providing initial conclusions about links between onshore and offshore conditions we compare freshwater saltwater distributions predicted through rudimentary analytical modelling of modern conditions i e both present day and pre development heads to observed onshore and offshore salinity data from this we draw initial interpretations of a whether ofg influences onshore salinities at each study site and b whether the known extent of ofg is attributable to modern ofg inflow assuming homogeneous aquifer properties or whether other factors dominate the ofg extent we also investigate a number of regions where onshore data are used to infer the presence of ofg this facilitates a preliminary assessment of the potential onshore influence of ofg in data poor areas 2 methods the direction of groundwater flow at the shoreline of coastal aquifers can be inferred by comparing the onshore piezometric head hb to the equivalent freshwater head hf imposed by the sea werner 2017 this assumes that the coastal aquifer is exposed to the sea at some location at which point the offshore groundwater head reflects the head of the ocean the value of hf adopted in this study is applicable only to aquifers with onshore extents that exhibit semi confined rather than unconfined conditions because these aquifers are most likely to host significant ofg the coastal aquifer arrangement that is adopted in this study for the purposes of applying available analytical solutions to ofg extent arising from ofg inflow is illustrated in fig 1 ofg inflows are expected to occur where hb hf otherwise the onshore aquifer is likely to be actively drawing water from its subsea part the value of hf is determined by werner 2017 1 h f ρ s ρ f ρ f z 0 h where ρf and ρs are the respective densities of freshwater and seawater m l3 other variables are defined in fig 1 hydraulic gradients indicating groundwater flow in the onshore direction i e hb hf are associated with active swi whereby the landward movement of seawater is in the same direction as groundwater flow werner 2017 active swi is expected to eventually cause relatively rapid salinization of the near shore aquifer morgan and werner 2015 werner 2017 this contrasts to passive swi whereby seawater moves landwards despite freshwater flowing towards the coast resulting in the partial salinization of the onshore aquifer passive swi in offshore aquifers may occur due to a reduction in ofg inflow without eliminating it altogether in a sharp interface conceptualisation passive swi is characterised by a landward movement of the interface toe i e where the freshwater saltwater interface intercepts the base of the aquifer and in some cases the interface tip i e where the freshwater saltwater interface intercepts the top of the aquifer the toe may eventually come to rest in the onshore or offshore regions of the aquifer whereas the tip remains offshore due to the persistence of ofg inflow under passive swi scenarios in coastal aquifers with significant ofg swi may take place over considerable timeframes without salinization of onshore wells because the loss of freshwater occurs in the offshore part of the aquifer thus some knowledge of offshore salinities is critical to understanding the potential for salinization of onshore aquifers from which pumping occurs a preliminary estimate of the steady state extent of modern ofg is possible for coastal aquifers where hb hf through application of an analytical solution developed concurrently by werner and robinson 2018 werner and robinson 2018 modify the solutions of bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 who assumed that the offshore aquitard contains seawater to allow for alternative aquitard salinities the modification by werner and robinson 2018 responds to the findings of another concurrent investigation by solórzano rivas and werner 2018 who show that where sfgd occurs the offshore aquitard is more likely to contain freshwater thereby changing significantly the prediction of ofg otherwise obtained from the bakker 2006 and bakker et al 2017 solutions while bakker 2006 adopted a prescribed flux representation of the inland boundary condition bakker et al 2017 and werner and robinson 2018 allow for a prescribed head condition to be implemented the available analytical solutions for ofg apply to idealised aquifer geometries consistent with fig 1 they are based on a number of assumptions including that 1 the zone of mixing between freshwater and seawater can be represented by a line of pressure equilibrium i e a sharp interface 2 the offshore aquifer is in equilibrium with onshore heads i e steady state conditions 3 the aquifer and the overlying aquitard in the offshore region are isotropic and homogeneous and 4 freshwater flow in the aquifer is horizontal flow in the aquitard is vertical and seawater is stagnant a minimal number of input parameters are required which is commensurate with the limited available data for almost all of the aquifers considered in this study coastal aquifer parameters required for the werner and robinson 2018 solution are obtained from existing literature and are available at several sites around the world as given in table 1 the interface tip xtip and toe xtoe positions were calculated for each region the parameters required are the aquifer hydraulic conductivity ka l t aquitard vertical hydraulic conductivity kl l t h d z 0 hb xb and ls see fig 1 due to limitations in the available data a single set of base case aquifer properties was adopted for each site despite that spatial variability in most parameters is likely the distance to the edge of the continental shelf was used in areas where ls is undefined in existing literature the termination of the continental shelf was obtained from global bathymetry data ncei 2017 in some cases two land masses abut the offshore region and hence it is not possible to define a distance to the edge of the continental shelf in these instances ls was taken arbitrarily as the distance to the shoreline of the neighbouring land mass the coastal aquifers of kent england are an example of this whereby the submerged continental shelf connects to france without exceeding a bathymetric depth of 55 m to capture some of the known spatial variability in hb maximum hbmax and minimum hbmin values were obtained where available from either well data or potentiometric contours to allow for investigations of the impact of onshore development on ofg extent pre development heads hb were obtained where historical head information was available where pre development heads varied spatially within a single aquifer the maximum head within the near coastal zone was adopted the maximum head was selected because the available measurements probably under estimate if anything the true pre development head levels given that human impacts are likely to have been occurring well before 1960 in many cases this also allowed for the identification of aquifers where paleo ofg and or aquifer heterogeneities are required to explain observed ofg extents extracted from offshore measurements 3 review of coastal aquifers with significant ofg 3 1 identification of aquifers with significant ofg we considered three conditions that are indicative of the presence of significant ofg in the selection of regions for further analysis firstly we selected regions with offshore groundwater salinities below tds 17 5 g l approximately 50 seawater salinity as interpreted from offshore well observations and or resistivity surveys secondly we included semi confined coastal aquifers where hb hf as this is indicative of ofg inflow thirdly we identified regions where onshore freshwater is observed close to the shoreline in semi confined aquifers despite hb hf these regions are thought to indicate the occurrence of ofg because active swi conditions would otherwise be expected to have caused extensive groundwater salinization in the onshore aquifer at least where onshore groundwater levels have been lowered for extended periods the identification of regions with significant ofg was initially guided by the previous investigation of post et al 2013 ten of the fourteen regions identified by post et al 2013 that satisfied the selection criteria had sufficient data to allow for the application of the werner and robinson 2018 solution and were included in the analysis in addition to the regions identified by post et al 2013 this study includes three regions where the presence of ofg is indicated by resistivity surveys or by freshwater measurements in offshore wells a further fourteen regions were identified where ofg can be inferred from hb hf and or onshore salinities fig 2 shows the location of the twenty seven regions analysed in this study plus the four regions mentioned by post et al 2013 that were omitted from the current analysis due to data constraints there may be other regions where ofg can be implied that were not included in this study due to either data limitations or the highly channelized nature of the recorded ofg body requiring investigative methods beyond the scope of this study e g krantz et al 2004 danskin 2012 3 2 identification of regions at risk of active swi the driving head hb hf i e the difference between the onshore head and the equivalent freshwater head at the top of the offshore aquifer of the sea was assessed for each region to identify aquifers where present day groundwater levels are insufficient to prevent active swi this was undertaken by applying eq 1 to the parameters in table 1 including both hbmin and hbmax negative values indicate that active swi is likely occurring table 2 lists the driving heads for each region analysed in this study the regions are listed in order of ascending minimum driving heads hbmin hf it is important to distinguish whether active swi occurs at considerable distance offshore or within onshore aquifers because this dictates the timeframe for onshore aquifer salinization and the vulnerability of wells to salinity impacts more generally the regions where saltwater has been observed in onshore aquifers are identified in table 2 which also describes any published interpretations of the sources of saltwater for example relic is assigned to regions where saltwater is found in the onshore aquifer and thought to have been emplaced in the aquifer prior to modern conditions e g under prehistoric sea levels and climates relic saltwater may also include non marine sources in onshore aquifers e g mineral dissolution although marine and non marine salinization sources are typically not differentiated in the studies that we reviewed in situations involving relic saltwater movement aquifer salinization may not reflect the classic conceptualisation of swi where seawater movements are linked to variations in groundwater heads relative to sea levels in table 2 swi recorded is used to indicate that aquifer salinization has been observed that is a decline in the onshore head under modern conditions is thought to have caused the movement of the freshwater seawater interface into and or landward in the onshore aquifer in addition undefined source is prescribed to sites where saltwater has been noted onshore but no information is available on its origins regions where there is a reasonable level of onshore investigation i e at least five salinity monitoring sites in the near shore 5 km region and yet no seawater has been identified in the onshore semi confined aquifer are given a none observed classification in table 2 lastly regions where the data are inadequate to reasonably ascertain the occurrence or otherwise of saltwater in the aquifer are designated nd fourteen of the twenty seven regions had sufficient data to define both hbmin and hbmax otherwise only a single value for hb has been used commensurate with the limited degree of published investigation in six regions both hbmin and hbmax indicate active swi within the semi confined aquifer based on eq 1 in five regions significant variations between hbmin and hbmax result in hbmin signifying active swi while hbmax indicates ofg inflows in three regions both hbmin and hbmax indicate ofg inflow a comparison can be made between driving heads and the associated implications for the freshwater seawater relationship and whether or not seawater is observed in the near shore zones of coastal aquifers where the near shore groundwater remains fresh despite the presence of negative driving heads indicating landward flow table 2 the most likely explanation is that onshore salinity data are yet to identify the presence of swi occurring seaward of pumping wells we associate this situation to the occurrence of ofg that is delaying the onset of near shore onshore swi conversely significant modern ofg is less likely to be present in regions where swi is observed and the driving head is negative because these factors indicate that the buffering effect of ofg and the hydraulic conditions associated with ofg inflows are lacking in four cases the analytical solution predicts seawater within the onshore aquifer but none has been found thereby indicating potential ofg reserves three regions show evidence of swi in field measurements and exhibit negative driving heads and therefore the likelihood of modern ofg in those offshore aquifers is probably low 3 3 calculated ofg extents and comparisons to offshore observations for the regions where ofg inflows are predicted under present day conditions xtip and xtoe were calculated using available present day head data and through application of the werner and robinson 2018 steady state solution the results are presented in table 3 positive values of xtip and xtoe indicate an offshore position and negative values an onshore position in addition to xtip and xtoe table 3 also includes the cases where the driving head indicates active swi where offshore salinity data are available table 3 records the distances from the shoreline to offshore wells containing groundwater with salinities 50 of seawater tds 17 5 g l or ofg extents interpreted from resistivity studies we adopt the distances presented by post et al 2013 for the location of the offshore wells while the ofg extents estimated from resistivity surveys were obtained from various references as listed in table 1 regions in table 3 are ordered by ascending xtoe values obtained from application of hbmax to the analytical solution the calculated steady state ofg extents table 3 that correspond with present day heads are used here in developing coastal aquifer conceptual models these allow for the identification of regions where no onshore seawater is expected i e positive xtip and xtoe under steady state conditions and regions where seawater is predicted to eventually reach the onshore aquifer i e negative xtoe as mentioned above active swi is likely occurring in six regions based on both hbmin and hbmax in two regions hbmin indicates active swi while hbmax indicates a positive xtip and a negative xtoe in three regions hbmin is consistent with the occurrence of active swi while hbmax indicates that the interface is entirely offshore of the thirteen regions with only a single hb value the driving heads of three are commensurate with active swi eight with an onshore xtoe and two with entirely offshore freshwater seawater interfaces in algarve the gambier embayment and eckernförde bay xtip from the analytical solution reaches ls indicating that present day ofg inflows generated from hbmax are sufficient to drive freshwater to the termination of the semi confined aquifer given sufficient time where onshore salinity data are available table 2 the salinity data indicate that the observed interface does not approximate the predicted present day steady state interface with the exception of carnarvon more specifically in the fourteen regions with offshore salinity data the value of xtip arising from hbmax is significantly landwards of known offshore groundwater with tds 17 5 g l this provides initial evidence that a component of offshore groundwater is likely sourced from either pre development ofg inflows paleo freshwater and or the effects of aquifer heterogeneity 3 4 calculated ofg extents from pre development conditions to investigate the possible contribution of pre development conditions to ofg development the werner and robinson 2018 solution was applied to obtain the steady state interface location from hb which was available for fifteen of the regions included in this study the calculated pre development tip xtip and toe xtoe are given in table 4 the pre development driving heads and the difference in the predicted steady state tip δxtip and toe δxtoe position between pre development i e hb and present day i e hbmax conditions are also presented table 4 is ordered by the pre development driving head hb hf in eight of the fifteen regions listed in table 4 the extents calculated from hb place the entire interface offshore active swi is predicted in two regions while an onshore interface toe is predicted in five regions in three regions there is no change in xtip from pre development to present day conditions as both hb and hbmax are sufficient to drive freshwater to the offshore termination of the aquitard except for carnarvon present day water levels are lower than their pre development counterparts causing a potential loss in stored freshwater due to human activities large seasonal water level fluctuations at carnarvon mask any longer term trends and therefore the head drop from 1960 to 2016 extrapolated from metered records covering the period 1974 2009 is presumed negligible in five regions head declines pre development to present day result in a reversal of flow at the coastline whereby ofg inflows are calculated from the estimated value of hb and active swi arises from the value of hbmax in three regions the decline in hb causes the steady state interface toe to move onshore resulting in a prediction of onshore passive swi in regions where hbmax predicts either active swi or an onshore interface toe yet pre development heads indicate an entirely offshore interface it is likely that onshore freshwater extractions have historically relied at least partly on ofg emplaced under pre development conditions some reliance on ofg is also expected albeit to a lesser degree in semi confined coastal aquifers where the toe is predicted to have moved landward between pre development and present day conditions in all regions listed in table 4 xtip is significantly landwards of where offshore groundwater with tds 17 5 g l is observed table 3 this suggests that for the regions included in this study paleo freshwater and or aquifer heterogeneity likely contribute to the observed offshore salinities the contribution of paleo freshwater proposed in this study is in agreeance with previous regional studies that also propose paleo freshwater contributions to ofg e g in suriname groen et al 2000 nantucket island marksamer et al 2007 south florida morrissey et al 2010 and southern dobruja soulet et al 2010 in both perth and shanghai hb is not sufficient to generate ofg inflows thereby indicating the occurrence of active swi even under pre development conditions this suggests that the onshore aquifer may have been drawing on ofg prior to 1960 e g due to pre 1960 groundwater development and or disequilibrium over geological timescales and that in these regions onshore reliance on ofg may have been occurring for considerable periods 3 5 known limitations of analytical methods for calculating ofg extents the simplifications of real world aquifers required to resolve the werner and robinson 2018 analytical solution impart significant uncertainties in the resulting estimates of ofg extent for example most coastal aquifers considered in the current study slope downwards in the offshore direction whereas werner and robinson 2018 assume that the aquifer is horizontal consistent with earlier conceptual models by bakker 2006 and others the extent of freshwater in sloping aquifers is likely to be less than that predicted by the werner and robinson 2018 solution because downward sloping aquifers are subjected to increasingly higher heads imposed by the sea in the offshore direction due to the higher equivalent freshwater heads of the sea with increasing depth also seaward slopes tend to restrict landward seawater movement because the heavier seawater must overcome the gravity forces that accompany the aquifer slope e g koussis et al 2012 our analysis also suffers from the usual challenges of finding reliable aquifer properties the offshore environment is often poorly characterised post et al 2013 some aquifers do not have clearly defined locations offshore where they connect to the sea due to highly heterogeneous overlying aquitards complex geologies and or the paucity of offshore geological information for example in the northern portion of the upper floridian aquifer foyle et al 2002 identify several discrete zones where either aquitard thinning or incision by paleo channels results in locally increased fluid exchange between the semi confined aquifer and the overlying seawater column despite this prior analytical modelling of this system by bakker 2006 adopted the edge of the continental shelf as the aquifer ocean connection in general where aquitards are heterogeneous and or discontinuous analytical solutions that presume uniform aquitard properties likely over predict the steady state ofg extent thus it is noteworthy that our analytical results underestimate the known offshore freshwater extents while the werner and robinson 2018 solution treats the coastal aquifer as homogenous offshore aquifers often contain significant heterogeneities e g michael et al 2016 using numerical modelling michael et al 2016 show that where heterogeneity results in well connected preferential flow pathways freshwater can penetrate further offshore than in equivalent homogeneous k models they conclude that the assumption of homogeneity could result in an under estimation of the extent of ofg generated by ofg inflows however the coastal aquifer arrangement adopted by werner and robinson 2018 differs to that used by michael et al 2016 in their homogenous k models werner and robinson 2018 separate the offshore extent vertically into an aquifer and an aquitard hence deviating from the single hydrostratigraphic unit used by michael et al 2016 to compare homogeneous and heterogeneous realisations it is unknown if the impacts of heterogeneity obtained by michael et al 2016 are of the same magnitude as would be obtained for the layered aquifer aquitard arrangement adopted by werner and robinson 2018 another limitation of the current approach is the reliance on predicted interface locations that are in steady state coastal aquifers are slow to respond to changes in hydraulic conditions post et al 2013 and therefore the long periods required to approach steady state salinity distributions may exceed the time scales of marine regression transgression sequences thus steady state conditions may not be realistic and only representative of the potential for the interface to move to a new alignment that is the predicted interface positions may only inform the potential for interface movement thereby reflecting the current knowledge of coastal aquifer conditions and the associated human induced head changes over time the limitations mentioned above result in varying albeit unknown uncertainties associated with the calculated steady state tip and toe positions the inferred uncertainty likely increases with distance offshore given that aquifer parameters obtained from nearshore measurements are increasingly less likely to be representative of subsea aquifer properties in the offshore direction 3 6 conceptual models for coastal aquifers with ofg we propose several alternative conceptual models of onshore offshore groundwater systems founded on available case studies and on the interpretations of interface conditions derived from tables 2 and 3 the conceptual models shown in fig 3 while not exhaustive present important relationships between onshore extractions and ofg and its sources observed in the regions included in this study along with other critical elements of the offshore hydrogeology that are fundamental to management decision making regarding coastal fresh groundwater the first three conceptual models fig 3a c represent steady state interface situations whereby any ofg is attributable only to stable long term continental discharge i e the assumption of bakker 2006 and others in the first conceptual model fig 3a the interface is entirely offshore in fig 3b the toe is onshore and the tip is offshore the well shown in fig 3b may or may not have caused the onshore i e rather than offshore position of the toe fig 3c shows the final anticipated situation arising from active swi causing salinization of onshore wells the four models shown in fig 3d g incorporate paleo freshwater and or freshwater emplaced by pre development inflows whereby present day ofg inflows are only responsible for a portion of ofg the presence of paleo freshwater and or freshwater emplaced by pre development ofg inflows results in freshwater occurring seaward of the steady state interface location that corresponds with present day water levels bodies of offshore paleo freshwater can be considered as unstable because they are likely being reduced by the diffusion of seawater vertical leakage and or from hydraulic conditions that tend to draw the interface onshore at least in aquifers where groundwater is flowing this assumes that paleo freshwater no longer has a modern day source we consider the conceptual models shown in fig 3a c to be the steady state equivalents of fig 3d f whereby freshwater from paleo and or pre development sources are eventually exhausted leading to the realisation of interface locations that correspond with present day hydraulic conditions fig 3d f represent aquifers with decreasing ofg inflows such that fig 3d is the result of the highest ofg inflows in fig 3d the predicted present day steady state interface is entirely offshore however due to the presence of pre development and or paleo freshwater the actual freshwater saltwater interface occurs seaward of the steady state interface predicted for present day conditions in fig 3e seawater is entirely offshore although under steady state conditions seawater is expected to cross the shoreline due to passive swi see fig 3b the persistence of ofg inflows ensures that part of the onshore aquifer remains fresh despite passive swi predicted onshore in fig 3f hb is lower than hf this causes both the downwards advection of seawater through the offshore aquitard and landward movement of the interface in the form of active swi in this conceptual model the persistence of freshwater between the pumping well and the shoreline is completely reliant on the presence of ofg and in particular paleo freshwater fig 3g represents one of many possibilities for deviations from the idealised conceptual model adopted in the analytical solutions applied in this investigation here we show an aquitard that contains a zone of thinning which causes localised salinization of the underlying aquifer while fig 3g displays a conceptualisation of downward leakage we acknowledge numerous other conceptual models involving a wide range of aquifer salinization mechanisms including the influence of aquifer and aquitard heterogeneity the upward leakage of saltwater through underlying aquitards the movement of paleo saltwater and salinization from other e g non marine sources other situations may include temporary or three dimensional processes that are difficult to illustrate in cross section such as up coning and variability in the long shore direction causing seawater to move firstly landward and then towards wells from directions not necessarily perpendicular to the shoreline the naming of conceptual models in the remainder is consistent with the sub figure labelling in fig 3 e g fig 3a shows model a the likelihood that ofg has an influence on onshore salinities can be inferred for models d f in model d the predicted steady state interface is entirely offshore meaning that it is unlikely that ofg contributes to present day onshore salinities in model e ofg serves to delay the appearance of seawater in the onshore aquifer although well salinization is not anticipated pre development and or paleo freshwater stored in the aquifer may be removed through pumping leakage through the overlying aquitard and or diffusion driven salinization for model f pumping is at least partly maintained by the landward movement of ofg from offshore and the future availability of fresh groundwater is closely related to the pre development and or paleo ofg extent as model g represents many alternative complex situations there is a wide variety of possible levels of onshore use of ofg arising from this model 3 7 global assessment of the potential onshore influence of ofg using the available data i e related to onshore and offshore salinity and the predicted present day steady state interface position each of the twenty seven regions considered in this study are assigned one or more of the conceptual models developed in section 3 6 the results are given in table 5 which also includes the estimated likelihood that onshore salinities are influenced significantly by ofg the assigned likelihoods shown in table 5 are largely subjective being based on the available data and analytical solution results presented above for example regions consistent with model d are assumed to have only a low likelihood of ofg influencing the onshore salinity in regions similar to model e ofg is assumed to have a moderate influence on the onshore salinity in regions consistent with model f there is a high inferred likelihood that ofg significantly influences the onshore salinity in several regions variations in hbmin and hbmax require the assignment of one or more conceptual models to encompass the observed and predicted conditions where multiple conceptual models are assigned a range of inferred levels of ofg influence is also given sixteen of the regions shown in table 5 could be described using a single conceptual model and were assigned a single likelihood of ofg influencing their onshore salinities in nine and seven regions it is inferred that there are high and moderate likelihoods respectively that onshore salinities are influenced by ofg in four regions carnarvon kent algarve and howard springs the available salinity data are insufficient to allow for comparison with the steady state estimates of the interface position in these four regions it was not possible to differentiate between the steady state models a c and their transient equivalents d f in kent algarve and howard springs the steady state interface predicted for present day conditions is entirely offshore as a result it is inferred that there is a low likelihood that ofg influences onshore salinities in these three regions while swi is recorded onshore in carnarvon the available onshore salinity data are insufficient to determine the position of the interface in addition no offshore salinity data are available for comparison to the predicted ofg extent as a result no inference can be made as to whether the approximate steady state salinity distribution has been achieved and hence the possible onshore influence of ofg remains unknown in seven regions spatial variations in hb result in multiple conceptual models being required to encompass the predicted and observed conditions accordingly there is spatially variability in the likelihood that onshore salinities are influenced by ofg large differences between hbmin and hbmax in northern florida canterbury and aveiro create conditions whereby model d best represents the conditions associated with hbmax whereas models f and or g are consistent with the conditions predicted for hbmin the occurrence of conceptual models involving ofg inflows models d and e and active swi model f in a single region indicates that freshwater recirculation may be occurring within the offshore aquifer that is freshwater may discharge to the submarine aquifer in one area and then flow alongshore within the offshore aquifer before being drawn back onshore by pumping however significant offshore groundwater flow parallel to the coastline has not been identified in previous publications rather ofg distributions are typically studied using transects perpendicular to the shoreline and thus the effect of this transverse movement in the offshore aquifer on ofg distributions is presently unknown the importance of alongshore flow particular in relation to the use of cross sectional analysis requires further investigation previous work in canterbury and bangkok identify that the vertical movement of seawater from overlying strata is at least partly responsible for the swi observed in the onshore aquifer as a result conceptual model g was used to describe the coastal aquifer in these two regions in canterbury historical swi was linked to the downwards migration of seawater from an overlying estuary resulting in localised swi scott and wilson 2012 in bangkok regional salinization of the semi confined aquifer is thought to be at least partially driven by downwards leakance of saltwater from overlying salinized aquifers buapeng and wattayakorn 2008 onodera et al 2009 in table 5 swi or saltwater from an undefined source is noted in eight regions including canterbury and bangkok with the exception of canterbury and bangkok previous studies propose that swi is primarily a result of the interface moving horizontally landward in these regions the inferred likelihoods given in table 5 are shown in fig 4 the propensity of a region to be classified as having a high moderate or low likelihood of ofg influencing the onshore salinity appears to be largely independent of its spatial location perhaps regions in europe have a slightly lower tendency to be classed as having a high likelihood that ofg influences onshore salinities than elsewhere however anthropogenic factors such as population density and the high variability and scantness of ofg data make it difficult to detect the influence of climate recharge and geology thereby obscuring any spatially controlled global scale relationships ofg is possibly assisting in the maintenance of coastal water qualities in 70 of the regions included in this study however only three of these regions have investigations into their onshore offshore freshwater interactions pope 2006 depaul and rosman 2015 amir et al 2013 morgan et al 2016 the scarcity of studies into the onshore use of ofg suggests that much of this use is either inadvertent or at least is not informed by knowledge of the contributions to freshwater availability of ofg emplaced under paleo and or pre development conditions in regions where it is highly or moderately likely that ofg influences the onshore salinities regional investigations that incorporate ofg into water management decision making are vital for understanding the long term viability of groundwater pumping from the onshore aquifer 4 conclusions in this study we present seven simplified conceptual models that characterise onshore offshore freshwater interactions the proposed models describe for the first time the main predicted and observed onshore offshore freshwater interactions in semi confined coastal aquifers that extend offshore they show how ofg generated from paleo or pre development conditions can delay the onset of swi in the onshore portion of coastal aquifers assisting in the persistence of freshwater supply from onshore coastal wells a first pass evaluation of the likely onshore influence of ofg was undertaken in twenty seven coastal aquifers through the application of a recently developed analytical solution in conjunction with available onshore and offshore salinity data the findings of this investigation suggest that ofg has a moderate to high influence on onshore salinities in twenty three of the studied regions included in these twenty three regions are fourteen regions where water of tds 17 5 g l has been found offshore these findings indicate that all of the known ofg bodies with onshore linkages are likely already being mined either passively or actively through onshore extractions and as such should be assessed in regional water balances so that future freshwater availability is well understood estimates of the onshore groundwater conditions prior to contemporary groundwater development indicate that ofg was being generated through discharge to offshore aquifers in thirteen of the fifteen regions for which pre development data are available onshore heads were found to decline between pre development and present day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions with pre development data this decline results in a landward movement of the predicted steady state freshwater saltwater interface and a reduction of ofg the steady state freshwater saltwater interface positions obtained through the application of the analytical solution for both present day and pre development conditions were unable to explain the available offshore salinity data in all regions investigated as a result either aquifer heterogeneity or paleo ofg are required to explain observed offshore salinity data for the regions considered in this study while analytical methods provide a useful tool in screening sites for further investigation transient numerical approaches that include paleo freshwater are likely required for the realistic estimation of ofg volume and extent at present the contribution of ofg to onshore water supply is poorly recognised in the existing literature the potentially widespread influence of ofg on onshore groundwater identified in this paper suggests that there is a need for further work investigating both the vulnerability of ofg to onshore drawdowns and the transient behaviour of ofg under both passive and active swi conditions if coastal freshwater resources are to be managed responsibly acknowledgements the author andrew knight is supported by a research training program scholarship adrian werner is

7307,among different reference evapotranspiration eto modeling approaches mass transfer based methods have been less studied these approaches utilize temperature and wind speed records on the other hand the empirical equations proposed in this context generally produce weak simulations except when a local calibration is used for improving their performance this might be a crucial drawback for those equations in case of local data scarcity for calibration procedure so application of heuristic methods can be considered as a substitute for improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based approaches however given that the wind speed records have usually higher variation magnitudes than the other meteorological parameters application of a wavelet transform for coupling with heuristic models would be necessary in the present paper a coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology was proposed for the first time to improve the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based eto estimation approaches using cross validation data management scenarios in both local and cross station scales the obtained results revealed that the new coupled wrf model with the minimum scatter index values of 0 150 and 0 192 for local and external applications respectively improved the performance accuracy of the single rf models as well as the empirical equations to great extent keywords cross validation eto neuro fuzzy random forest wavelet decomposition 1 introduction the reference evapotranspiration eto represents the evapotranspiration from a hypothesized reference crop height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m and albedo of 0 23 as introduced by allen et al 1998 eto estimation is needed for computation of irrigation water requirements water resources management hydrology environmental issues assessing agricultural systems and determination of the water budget especially in arid regions different meteorological parameters e g air temperature humidity radiation and wind speed affect eto the accessibility to those data is very difficult in most cases especially in developing regions therefore lots of attempts have been carried out so far to derive some mathematical regression based relationships between the eto and meteorological parameters the universal standard fao56 pm model is a combination based model that has been approved to be applicable in different climatic conditions without need to a local calibration allen et al 1998 however this model has its own shortcoming due to requiring lots of meteorological parameters which are not easily measured factors given a specific climatic condition some empirical temperature based radiation based and mass transfer based models can be applied for calculating eto using different meteorological parameters however a crucial drawback of such equations would be the need for a local calibration against lysimetric or standard eto values at different regions moreover solar radiation data have low quality with numerous missing data at some stations worldwide the mass transfer based models are generally based on the dalton s law and employ the principles of eddy motion transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere singh and xu 1997 these models use the temperature and wind speed records for simulating the eto values although these models can produce accurate results in some regions xu and singh 2002 tabari et al 2013 the low aerodynamic effects might reduce the performance accuracy of these models as discussed by kiafar et al 2017 these models give satisfactory results in many cases thornthwaite and holzman 1939 jensen 1973 however wind speed and air temperature have been measured at inconsistent heights resulting in a large number of equations with similar or identical structure so application of the data from one location and or height to another as well as application of a model developed in a specified region in another location will be difficult to do with certainty helfrich et al 1982 the wide ranging inconsistency in meteorological data collection procedures and standards has given rise to over 100 evaporation formulae and has made it impossible for a comparative study panu and nguyen 1994 singh and xu 1997 alike to the other empirical eto models the need to local calibration is a major downside of these models on the other hand various heuristic data driven approaches have been applied by researchers to estimate eto using meteorological parameters worldwide nonetheless the wavelet transform has been applied in time series analysis of the hydrological processes by utilizing a wavelet transform a signal can be locally well represented in both the time and frequency domains and more detailed information might be achieved about the behavior of the simulated physical process wang and ding 2003 partal and kisi 2007 kisi and shiri 2012 numerous applications of wavelet transform in hydrology

network and wavelet neuro fuzzy hybrid models for estimating daily eto values using three years daily records of a single station in australia and found that the wavelet neural networks models gave better results than the wavelet neuro fuzzy models patil and deka 2015 evaluated the capability of the wavelet neural networks and wavelet neuro fuzzy models in estimating daily eto values in arid regions of india using four years daily meteorological variables of a single station and confirmed the good performances of both the applied models gocic et al 2015 compared different soft computing approaches for modeling eto and introduced the wavelet support vector machine model as the best among the applied methodologies feng et al 2017 compared rf with ann for modeling daily eto using data from two weather stations in china comprising a period of 6 years through local and external k fold testing procedures and found that rf slightly surpassed the ann karbasi 2017 introduced a wavelet gaussian process regression model for forecasting multi step ahead eto values of a single weather station with 10 years data in iran with a minor exception the reviewed studies have used generally a short data period a single weather station and a simple data management scenario where the data has been divided to train and test blocks chronologically so the models have been trained using a part of the available patterns and then tested using the remain patterns however some limited studies have tried to generalize the heuristic models using more stations and different data management scenarios e g kisi et al 2012 pour ali baba et al 2013 shiri et al 2014a wang et al 2014 karimi et al 2017 adamala et al 2017 and landeras et al 2017 nevertheless the mass transfer based eto models are less evaluated models in the literature the current paper proposes a new coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology for improving the performance accuracy of mass transfer based eto models such models are less evaluated models in literature nonetheless solar radiation and wind speed data are only available at synoptic stations of iran whose spatial density and temporal coverage are not sufficient in southern iran so improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based models is necessary in such regions utilizing wavelet transform provides more detailed information about the studied phenomenon which can help us to increase the models performance accuracy the developed models are assessed using local and cross station scenarios and compared with the corresponding mass transfer based equations evaluated through the same data management scenarios using these scenarios the developed models are assessed in both local chronological and external spatial scales that allow a more reliable and sound evaluation of the developed models to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first time application of the random forest technique and coupling it with wavelet transform for estimating eto as well as improving the accuracy of the mass transfer based models in literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 data analysis daily meteorological inputs e g air temperature

classification ia presented by the unep 1992 the stations were classified as arid locations the annual precipitation magnitudes in the studied locations were less than 250 mm all the applied

surface when air is calm the mean and the coefficient of variations cv values of each variable showed that all the studied stations had similar eto except omidiah which showed a slight difference in terms of the cv values for all utilized variables among the meteorological variables wind speed showed the greatest cv and skewness coefficient not presented here values in all stations which could make the extrapolations using this variable difficult analyzing the correlation values between eto and the applied meteorological variables showed that solar radiation and temperature presented the highest correlation values followed by the wind speed which had considerable correlations with eto in all stations 0 451 0 362 0 399 0 382 and 0 593 in bandar e abbas bushehr chabahar jask and omidiah respectively however it should be noted that the variations in wind speed might affect the models performance accuracy in different locations fig 1 illustrates the effect of wind speed on eto in the studied stations 1 212 0 422 0 595 0 277 and 1 618 increasing effect of u 2 on eto for the same stations the most dominant effect was corresponded to the bandar e abbas with the highest u 2 values and omidiah with the highest altitude fig 2 presents the time series variations of the monthly eto and u 2 magnitudes the highest eto amounts were observed between june september for all locations when compared to the wind speed variations eto values showed higher variations for different months with some exceptions for omidiah and chabahar which showed some similarities in variations of these variables the tendency of variations is different in all locations which might affect the performance accuracy of the eto models that have been relied on wind speed records 2 2 models inputs the eto

might be identified by compressing and expanding ψ t 5 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a b r a r a 0 in which ψ a b t is the successive wavelet a and b denote the scale and time factors respectively and r shows the real numbers domain if ψ a b t satisfies eq 5 for the time series f t l 2 r successive wavelet transform of f t will be written as 6 w ψ f a b a 1 2 r f t ψ t b a dt in this equation ψ t represents the complex conjugate functions of ψ t it is clear from this equation that the wavelet transform is the decomposition of f t under different resolution scales the successive wavelet is frequently discrete in real applications assume a a 0 j b kb 0 a 0 j a 0 1 b 0 r k j are integer numbers discrete wavelet transform dwt of f t might be considered as 7 w ψ f j k a 0 j 2 r f t ψ a 0 j

of the original time series in frequency a or j and time domain b or k at the same time are presented by w ψ f a b or w ψ f j k for a discrete time series f t where occurs at different time t i e here integer time steps are used the dwt would be considered as 9 w ψ f j k 2 j 2 t 0 n 1 f t ψ 2 j t k where w ψ f j k denotes the wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet of scale a 2j b 2jk dwt operates two sets of functions e g high pass and low pass filters the original time series are passed through these filters and separated at different levels the time series is decomposed into one comprising its trend which is the outcome of the low pass filter high scale and low frequency wavelets the approximation and one comprising the high frequencies low scale and the fast events the detail mallat 1989 in this research the detail coefficients and approximation a sub time series were computed through eq 9 2 3 3 wavelet random forest wrf the wrf models in this study were acquired by coupling two techniques e g dwt and rf here the daubechies dbn wavelet was utilized as mother wavelet dbn wavelets are one of the wavelets that have been extensively applied in this type of studies kisi and shiri 2012 successful applications of the dbn for hydrologic data decomposition have also been reported in literature e g kisi 2008 nourani et al 2009 the wrf is a rf model that utilizes the sub time series components which have been computed through dwt on original patterns attribute of each of these sub components are different and they provide useful information on various resolution levels kim and valdes 2003a b thus inclusion of these detailed information as the inputs for rf model improves its simulation accuracy in order to make the input matrix of the wrf models the original time series of the minimum maximum and dew point temperature as well as the wind speed records were decomposed into a certain number of sub time series components ds using the algorithm proposed by mallat 1989 the wrf mode was then built in which the ds of original time series of these variables are as input vectors of the rf the number of decomposition level was selected using log n formula where n indicates the number of patterns wang and ding 2003 kisi 2008 as the total patterns of each station belonged to a 10 years period 4 decomposition levels log 3653 3 56 were employed in dwt applications in local scenario so one approximation a and three details d1 d2 and d3 were obtained for each input parameter similarly given that there are 5 stations with 10 years daily data total 18 265 patterns in the external application a decomposition level of 4 log 18265 4 21 was utilized there these subcomponents were used as inputs of the applied models the selection of effective details and a subcomponents was made based on correlation analysis fig 3 provides a schematic representation of the wrf model 2 4 neuro fuzzy system nf as a combination of an adaptive neural network and a fuzzy inference system fis nf admits a set of parameters by a hybrid learning procedure mergering back propagation and a least squared error approach the nf method employed here accomplishes the sugeno s fuzzy approach takagi and sugeno 1985 for deriving the values for the target parameter using input parameters the grid partitioning identification approach of the sugeno models was used in this study for simulating the relationships among the input target parameters this method supplies independent blocks of each antecedent variable through defining the membership functions mfs of all antecedent variables based on trial and error 2 3 or 4 numbers of triangular mfs were found to be appropriate in the present study which is a commonly used mf in practical issues russel and campbell 1996 the output mf was also selected as linear since it gave more accurate results than the constant mf 2 5 data management scenarios a cross validation approach was adopted here to assess the proposed methodology based on the k fold testing scenario in both local at station and external cross station scales in the local scale data from one year were set as test patterns each time and the model was trained using the patterns of the remaining 9 years the process was repeated till all the available patterns were involved in train test phases given that there are 5 weather stations with 10 years data total 450 5 stations 10 folds 3 input combinations 3 models rf wrf nf train test phases were conducted in local k fold testing in the external assessing of the models the whole patterns of one station were held out as test data and the models were trained using the all data from remaining 4 stations the procedure was repeated for all stations so 45 train test stages were evaluated in the external application 5 stations 3 input combinations 3 models a similar procedure was carried out for assessing the empirical models the applied mass transfer based models were calibrated using the following regression based equation 10 et o fao 56 pm a et o model at first a traditional calibration procedure was adopted per station where the training and testing data are the same then the k fold testing was used for evaluation of the calibrated models so a total 450 local 9 models 5 stations 10 folds and 45 external 9 models 5 stations calibration testing stages were established in this case therefore total of 990 modeling processes were carried out in this study fig 4 shows the general flowchart of the study 2 6 models evaluation the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe

the rmse because any developed model should explain most of the trends in the observed patterns of the target parameter here eto values calculated by fao56 pm so a good model should have higher rmseu

values further a relative error based index namely the si ratio of calibrated eto models to the non calibrated versions r si was computed for relative comparison of the performance accuracy of the calibrated and non calibrated models landeras et al 2008 18 r si 1 si calibrated model si noncalibrated model 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of the mass transfer based empirical models the performances of the empirical mass transfer based eto models are presented in table 3 among the applied models trabert and wmo models presented the highest and lowest performance accuracies in all stations from the tables it is seen that the overall performance accuracy of the empirical models was weak in all studied locations so they should be calibrated against the standard fao56 pm model for improving their performance using the eq 10 the corresponding error statistics of the traditional calibration procedure have been reported in table 3 it is seen that the overall performances accuracy of the calibrated models were weak in all locations high si and mae values although the calibration procedure improved the performance accuracy of the models in all studied locations this showed that the calibration procedure couldn t increase the models accuracy which might be attributed to the shortcoming of mass transfer based models as well as linear calibration procedure as argued by shiri et al 2014b the maximum performance improvement belonged to wmo model in all stations analyzing the linear calibration regression equations not presented here revealed that dalton meyer trabert rohwer and penman models overestimated the eto values when compared to the standard model the values of the linear calibration equation a in eq 10 are lower than unity while albrecht brockamp and wenner wmo and mahringer models showed underestimation this might be explained through the mathematical structures of these models in dalton meyer rohwer and penman models an increase in wind speed as 1 m s 1 would affect the computed eto values by 0 437 0 425 1 27 and 1 526 mm day 1 respectively while the same wind speed variation will increase the eto values by 0 397 and 0 223 mm day 1 for albrecht and wmo models respectively such differences in the quantitative influence of wind speed values variations might affect the models response and produce over underestimations in case of the albrecht and mahringer models the effect of wind speed is included in a squared manner and finally a power function is used to consider the u 2 effect in brockamp wenner model despite the weak performance of the calibrated models the results obtained through the traditional calibration procedure would be partially valid since the same patterns have been utilized for calibrating and testing the models as discussed by shiri et al 2014b therefore the robust k fold testing cross validation process was adopted here to assess the calibration procedure as stated before fig 5 illustrates the si variations of the locally calibrated equations among the test years it is seen from the figure that the si values fluctuated among the test years for all locations although similar si values have been obtained for some test years for instance 2005 2006 and 2010 for penman model in badar e abbas or 2007 2008 for mahringer in chabahar there were considerable oscillations for its values among the test years this could be anticipated since the train test patters were different in each stage of local and external k fold testing fig 6 shows the r si per station values of the calibrated equations assessed through local and external k fold testing the figure shows that the calibration of the empirical models generally improved their performance although their overall performances are weak as can be seen from high si values in fig 5 dalton trabert meyer rohwer albrecht and wmo models showed better performance for the external calibration in all studied locations except omidiah where the external calibration gave weak performance with respect to the local calibration it can be linked to the slightly different characteristics of this station among others analyzing the climatic characteristics of the stations in table 1 showed that omidiah presents the highest mean eto value as well as its coefficient of variation among others moreover the lowest mean air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation are belonged to this station while the recorded meteorological variables of this location presented the highest coefficient of variation standard deviation such slight differences can difficult the extrapolation of the eto values using externally calibrated models which should be tested using local data on the other hand penman brockamp wenner and mahringer models gave the better performance for the locally calibrated cases in some cases the external calibration showed adverse effect on the performance accuracy of these models the different trends of the mass transfer based empirical models with respect to the local and external calibrations might be due to the way of including the effect of wind speed in the eto models while the wind speed has an inverse effect on eto in penman models it has been included with a direct relation to the eto in the rest this can explain the weak performance of the penman model and its calibrated versions in the studied locations as the variations of wind speed records showed direct relation with eto oscillations fig 2 nonetheless in the brockamp wenner and mahringer models the wind speed inclusion is somewhat different from the manner applied in the other empirical models as stated before this might affect the model performance when compared against the standard fao56 pm model which considers both the aerodynamic and energy balance components fully physics based for eto calculation nevertheless this may be a clear weakness of these models for computing eto in arid regions as discussed by kiafar et al 2017 3 2 evaluating the rf and wrf models fig 7 presents the statistical indicators of the considered approaches averaging the results of the five stations expectedly the heuristic models relied on input combination 3 i e considering more variables gave the most accurate results among others followed by input combination 1 temperature based models so it is seen that the temperature based models based on input combination 1 gave better results than the wind speed based models models that use input combination 2 apart from the direct effect of wind speed on eto in the studied locations fig 2 this might be attributed to the higher variations of wind speed in terms of cv in table 1 with respect to eto variations which make it difficult to produce a direct mapping between these parameters such variations in wind speed values can be smoothen using the wavelet transform analyzing the statistics presented in fig 7 revealed that coupling the dwt with rf has improved the performance accuracy of the models moreover the local approaches lrf wlrf lnf produced the most accurate simulations as they utilized the data from the same station for both training and testing stages nevertheless their abilities are restricted to the conditions similar to those of the training location as discussed by shiri et al 2014a comparing the calibrated empirical mass transfer based equations with the corresponding heuristic models it was observed that the heuristic models generally produced better simulations than the empirical models except input combination 2 e g erf 2 enf2 external models however it should be noted that the per station performance of the calibrated empirical models are generally weak in bandar e abbas chabahar and jask which make the application of these equations limited the results also clearly showed that the rf and wrf models surpassed the nf models in both evaluated scenarios a breakdown of the detailed comparison between these models is given in the next sections regarding the input combination 1 models relied on temperature records the external rf model erf 1 and the calibrated local and external dalton trabert mayer rohwer and penman models showed similar performance accuracy si around 0 300 while ewrf 1 showed si around 0 233 this is an important outcome as external models do not require local patterns for developing the models so these models can be applied for simulating eto in the locations with limited meteorological records as could be anticipated the locally trained models e g lrf 1 lwrf 1 models showed great improvement in the performance accuracy si values around 0 181 versus 0 310 for empirical models as these models were fed with the patterns of a specific location for both training and testing stages on the other hand special care should be achieved when using the external models as the train test locations should be similar to get accurate estimations noting to the models relied on input combination 2 e g wind speed as unique input parameter the performance accuracy is lower than those of the previous case temperature based models while the si value of erf 2 model is around 0 380 the ewrf 2 improves the simulation accuracy by si value of 0 319 16 si reduction which is comparable with the statistics obtained by the calibrated dalton trabert mayer rohwer and penman models further the improvement in performance accuracy of the temporal local approach with respect to the external approach is also visible as for the previous input combination a reason behind this might be the inclusion of wind speed records of different locations which provides a global matrix of wind speed values with different statistical characteristics this can facilitate eto mapping using these data to some extent nonetheless inclusion of wavelet coefficients in terms of the both details and approximations as input parameters for the rf model improved the estimations provided by the single input external models e g input combination 1 analysis of the performance of the models relying on the third input combination showed their superiority over the other applied models again rf and wrf models surpassed the calibrated empirical models in terms of both the si and mae indicators nonetheless the difference between the si values of the local and external wavelet based models was minimum for this input combination 0 042 while the single input input 2 based models showed the lowest mae difference 0 032 such discrepancy might be attributed to the inclusion of the parameters in definition of these indices where si comprises the mean values of targets for all studied locations with different magnitudes of average eto which can affect the global indices derived for all the locations while mae includes only the target simulations pairs in its equation anyway differences between the local and external approaches might be considered as the lowest for the second and third input combinations which can highlight the temperature differences that can be partly affected by wind speed too in the studied regions summarizing it might be stated that when relied on suitable input parameters the external wavelet based rf models might be good alternatives for local models in estimating eto magnitudes next the comparison of the rf and wavelet based rf models showed considerable improvement in the performance accuracy by using wrf models the highest improvement was observed for the local single input models input combination 2 with 34 1 and 17 2 reduction in si and mae values respectively followed by the external single input models with 30 1 and 27 8 reduction in the values of the same indicators this outcome confirms that using wavelet transform to wind speed records which showed high variations table 1 could reduce the adverse effect of data variance on model ability to simulate eto values using both local and external data management scenarios for local models the first input combination showed better improvement than the third combination by using wavelet transform while for the external case the third combination has had better improvement than the first combination such discrepancy might be explained by taking into consideration the amalgamation of the wavelet coefficients of the studied stations in external case which can facilitate the extrapolation of eto values using exogenous data fig 8 shows the si and ns values of the rf and wrf models in the studied locations it is clear that there are obvious variations in the si and ns values of the models among the considered locations the local models presented the best simulations in bandar e abbas chabahar and omidiah or the input combinations 1 2 and 3 respectively similar trend could be also detected for the external models in case of the first input combination temperature based the external models gave the worst outcomes in omidiah which might be attributed to the differences between the temperature records variations as well as their mean values in omidiah and other studied locations table 1 in the second input combination however erf models presented similar error statistics for all stations except chabahar which showed the best simulations for both erf and ewrf models finally for the input combination 3 omidiah presented the most accurate results followed by bandar e abbas again it is seen that the third input combinations presented the best results in all studied locations with respect to the first and second input combinations which could be linked to the simultaneous inclusion of the wind speed and temperature values in simulation process fig 9 shows the rmseu rmses ratios of the rf and wrf models per studied location from the figure two general statements can be achieved first there were fewer variations among studied stations for the values of this ratio in case of the second input combination when compared to the other applied combinations second the maximum improvement in simulation performance of the models through using wavelet transform was observed for the second input combination in all stations comparing figs 8 9 it is seen that the general trend of the models performance accuracy was similar when assessed through weighted rmse si and rmse portions for instance the lowest si values of the rf1 and wrf1 models were observed in bandar e abbas fig 8 and at the same time the highest rmseu rmses ratio was belonged to this station for the same input combination similar statements could be also given for other input combinations and locations summarizing it can be concluded that the wavelet random forest methodology is able in mapping the nonlinear relationships between the temperature wind speed parameters and eto in both local and cross station scales this is very important as wind speed shows usually high variations in its time series which make it difficult to simulate the eto values using this parameter the outcomes of the present study regarding the assessment of the models in local and cross station scales confirmed the conclusions obtained by previous literature e g shiri et al 2014a 4 conclusions among the different eto modeling categories mass transfer based models have been less studied so far those models utilize air temperature and wind speed records for calculating the eto values apart from limitation of wind speed measurement to the synoptic stations the situations e g altitude etc of the stations that record these parameters might be different for various locations therefore great variety of mass transfer based models have been suggested that might be applicable for some specific regions only the conditions they have been developed for on the other hand data scarcity especially in developing regions is a common problem that affects the accuracy of eto estimations in such locations due to the mentioned problems this study proposed a new coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology for improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based eto models in arid locations data from five stations were used to feed the models and then the developed models were assessed with the local and cross station data management scenarios using the robust k fold testing approach further some commonly used mass transfer based eto equations were evaluated in the studied locations using the same data management scenarios a comparison was also made between the wrf and neuro fuzzy nf method it was found that the outcomes of the external calibration of the empirical equations were comparable to the local calibration results the obtained results demonstrated the superiority of wrf model over the single rf nf and empirical mass transfer based models in all studied cases this is very important in areas with limited meteorological records because the externally established models can be easily applied in the locations with missing or limited necessary parameters although the data from arid sites were used here to test the approach the proposed methodology and data management scenario will not be limited to arid conditions but can be translated to other regions with different climatological contexts acknowledgments author would like to thank dr gorka landeras whose comments helped to improve the quality of paper 
7307,among different reference evapotranspiration eto modeling approaches mass transfer based methods have been less studied these approaches utilize temperature and wind speed records on the other hand the empirical equations proposed in this context generally produce weak simulations except when a local calibration is used for improving their performance this might be a crucial drawback for those equations in case of local data scarcity for calibration procedure so application of heuristic methods can be considered as a substitute for improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based approaches however given that the wind speed records have usually higher variation magnitudes than the other meteorological parameters application of a wavelet transform for coupling with heuristic models would be necessary in the present paper a coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology was proposed for the first time to improve the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based eto estimation approaches using cross validation data management scenarios in both local and cross station scales the obtained results revealed that the new coupled wrf model with the minimum scatter index values of 0 150 and 0 192 for local and external applications respectively improved the performance accuracy of the single rf models as well as the empirical equations to great extent keywords cross validation eto neuro fuzzy random forest wavelet decomposition 1 introduction the reference evapotranspiration eto represents the evapotranspiration from a hypothesized reference crop height of 0 12 m surface resistance of 70 s m and albedo of 0 23 as introduced by allen et al 1998 eto estimation is needed for computation of irrigation water requirements water resources management hydrology environmental issues assessing agricultural systems and determination of the water budget especially in arid regions different meteorological parameters e g air temperature humidity radiation and wind speed affect eto the accessibility to those data is very difficult in most cases especially in developing regions therefore lots of attempts have been carried out so far to derive some mathematical regression based relationships between the eto and meteorological parameters the universal standard fao56 pm model is a combination based model that has been approved to be applicable in different climatic conditions without need to a local calibration allen et al 1998 however this model has its own shortcoming due to requiring lots of meteorological parameters which are not easily measured factors given a specific climatic condition some empirical temperature based radiation based and mass transfer based models can be applied for calculating eto using different meteorological parameters however a crucial drawback of such equations would be the need for a local calibration against lysimetric or standard eto values at different regions moreover solar radiation data have low quality with numerous missing data at some stations worldwide the mass transfer based models are generally based on the dalton s law and employ the principles of eddy motion transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere singh and xu 1997 these models use the temperature and wind speed records for simulating the eto values although these models can produce accurate results in some regions xu and singh 2002 tabari et al 2013 the low aerodynamic effects might reduce the performance accuracy of these models as discussed by kiafar et al 2017 these models give satisfactory results in many cases thornthwaite and holzman 1939 jensen 1973 however wind speed and air temperature have been measured at inconsistent heights resulting in a large number of equations with similar or identical structure so application of the data from one location and or height to another as well as application of a model developed in a specified region in another location will be difficult to do with certainty helfrich et al 1982 the wide ranging inconsistency in meteorological data collection procedures and standards has given rise to over 100 evaporation formulae and has made it impossible for a comparative study panu and nguyen 1994 singh and xu 1997 alike to the other empirical eto models the need to local calibration is a major downside of these models on the other hand various heuristic data driven approaches have been applied by researchers to estimate eto using meteorological parameters worldwide nonetheless the wavelet transform has been applied in time series analysis of the hydrological processes by utilizing a wavelet transform a signal can be locally well represented in both the time and frequency domains and more detailed information might be achieved about the behavior of the simulated physical process wang and ding 2003 partal and kisi 2007 kisi and shiri 2012 numerous applications of wavelet transform in hydrology

context of eto modeling however there are limited studies about wavelet transform application partal 2009 developed a wavelet neural network hybrid model for simulating daily eto using five years data from two weathers stations of usa the performance of the developed model was then compared with the neural network and temperature based empirical models which demonstrated the good capability of the new hybrid model in estimating eto kisi 2011 introduced a wavelet regression model to estimate daily eto values using data from three weather stations with a ten years period in california and compared the results with those of the temperature based and radiation based empirical eto models the obtained results confirmed the superiority of the wavelet regression model to the applied traditional regression models and the empirical equations cobaner 2013 applied wavelet regression method in estimating eto based on class a pan evaporation falamarzi et al 2014 applied wavelet neural network and wavelet neuro fuzzy hybrid models for estimating daily eto values using three years daily records of a single station in australia and found that the wavelet neural networks models gave better results than the wavelet neuro fuzzy models patil and deka 2015 evaluated the capability of the wavelet neural networks and wavelet neuro fuzzy models in estimating daily eto values in arid regions of india using four years daily meteorological variables of a single station and confirmed the good performances of both the applied models gocic et al 2015 compared different soft computing approaches for modeling eto and introduced the wavelet support vector machine model as the best among the applied methodologies feng et al 2017 compared rf with ann for modeling daily eto using data from two weather stations in china comprising a period of 6 years through local and external k fold testing procedures and found that rf slightly surpassed the ann karbasi 2017 introduced a wavelet gaussian process regression model for forecasting multi step ahead eto values of a single weather station with 10 years data in iran with a minor exception the reviewed studies have used generally a short data period a single weather station and a simple data management scenario where the data has been divided to train and test blocks chronologically so the models have been trained using a part of the available patterns and then tested using the remain patterns however some limited studies have tried to generalize the heuristic models using more stations and different data management scenarios e g kisi et al 2012 pour ali baba et al 2013 shiri et al 2014a wang et al 2014 karimi et al 2017 adamala et al 2017 and landeras et al 2017 nevertheless the mass transfer based eto models are less evaluated models in the literature the current paper proposes a new coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology for improving the performance accuracy of mass transfer based eto models such models are less evaluated models in literature nonetheless solar radiation and wind speed data are only available at synoptic stations of iran whose spatial density and temporal coverage are not sufficient in southern iran so improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based models is necessary in such regions utilizing wavelet transform provides more detailed information about the studied phenomenon which can help us to increase the models performance accuracy the developed models are assessed using local and cross station scenarios and compared with the corresponding mass transfer based equations evaluated through the same data management scenarios using these scenarios the developed models are assessed in both local chronological and external spatial scales that allow a more reliable and sound evaluation of the developed models to the best of the author s knowledge this is the first time application of the random forest technique and coupling it with wavelet transform for estimating eto as well as improving the accuracy of the mass transfer based models in literature 2 materials and methods 2 1 data analysis daily meteorological inputs e g air temperature

proposed methodology table 1 the studied stations had the same climatologic context as can be seen from the aridity index ia and continentality index icu values in the table based on the classification ia presented by the unep 1992 the stations were classified as arid locations the annual precipitation magnitudes in the studied locations were less than 250 mm all the applied meteorological records were carefully analyzed and screened for possible inconsistencies the missing values of the variables were estimated using the best methods compared by shiri 2017 wind speed records lower than 0 5 m s 1 were replaced by the 0 5 m s 1 constrain allen et al 1998 to imply the influences of boundary layer variability and buoyancy of air in developing exchange of vapor at the surface when air is calm the mean and the coefficient of variations cv values of each variable showed that all the studied stations had similar eto except omidiah which showed a slight difference in terms of the cv values for all utilized variables among the meteorological variables wind speed showed the greatest cv and skewness coefficient not presented here values in all stations which could make the extrapolations using this variable difficult analyzing the correlation values between eto and the applied meteorological variables showed that solar radiation and temperature presented the highest correlation values followed by the wind speed which had considerable correlations with eto in all stations 0 451 0 362 0 399 0 382 and 0 593 in bandar e abbas bushehr chabahar jask and omidiah respectively however it should be noted that the variations in wind speed might affect the models performance accuracy in different locations fig 1 illustrates the effect of wind speed on eto in the studied stations 1 212 0 422 0 595 0 277 and 1 618 increasing effect of u 2 on eto for the same stations the most dominant effect was corresponded to the bandar e abbas with the highest u 2 values and omidiah with the highest altitude fig 2 presents the time series variations of the monthly eto and u 2 magnitudes the highest eto amounts were observed between june september for all locations when compared to the wind speed variations eto values showed higher variations for different months with some exceptions for omidiah and chabahar which showed some similarities in variations of these variables the tendency of variations is different in all locations which might affect the performance accuracy of the eto models that have been relied on wind speed records 2 2 models inputs the eto

of the applied mass transfer based models are maximum and minimum air temperature tmax and tmin respectively dew point temperature tdew and wind speed u 2 hence a subject matter expertise was used and the proposed wavelet random forest wrf models were constructed based on the following input combinations 1 tmax tmin tdew 2 u 2 3 tmax tmin tdew u 2 2 3 methods 2 3 1 random forest rf random forests rf is a group learning algorithm which manages high dimension regression problems it is a tree based group approach where all trees are dependent on a collection of random variables and the forest is grown from many regression trees put together and from a group breiman 2001 chen et al 2017 karimi et al 2018 the final decision is resulted via averaging the output after fitting single trees in ensemble bagging procedure the bias of the bagged trees is the same as that of the single trees while the variance is reduced by reduction in the correlation between trees hastie et al 2009 rfs for

might be identified by compressing and expanding ψ t 5 ψ a b t a 1 2 ψ t b a b r a r a 0 in which ψ a b t is the successive wavelet a and b denote the scale and time factors respectively and r shows the real numbers domain if ψ a b t satisfies eq 5 for the time series f t l 2 r successive wavelet transform of f t will be written as 6 w ψ f a b a 1 2 r f t ψ t b a dt in this equation ψ t represents the complex conjugate functions of ψ t it is clear from this equation that the wavelet transform is the decomposition of f t under different resolution scales the successive wavelet is frequently discrete in real applications assume a a 0 j b kb 0 a 0 j a 0 1 b 0 r k j are integer numbers discrete wavelet transform dwt of f t might be considered as 7 w ψ f j k a 0 j 2 r f t ψ a 0 j

of the original time series in frequency a or j and time domain b or k at the same time are presented by w ψ f a b or w ψ f j k for a discrete time series f t where occurs at different time t i e here integer time steps are used the dwt would be considered as 9 w ψ f j k 2 j 2 t 0 n 1 f t ψ 2 j t k where w ψ f j k denotes the wavelet coefficient for the discrete wavelet of scale a 2j b 2jk dwt operates two sets of functions e g high pass and low pass filters the original time series are passed through these filters and separated at different levels the time series is decomposed into one comprising its trend which is the outcome of the low pass filter high scale and low frequency wavelets the approximation and one comprising the high frequencies low scale and the fast events the detail mallat 1989 in this research the detail coefficients and approximation a sub time series were computed through eq 9 2 3 3 wavelet random forest wrf the wrf models in this study were acquired by coupling two techniques e g dwt and rf here the daubechies dbn wavelet was utilized as mother wavelet dbn wavelets are one of the wavelets that have been extensively applied in this type of studies kisi and shiri 2012 successful applications of the dbn for hydrologic data decomposition have also been reported in literature e g kisi 2008 nourani et al 2009 the wrf is a rf model that utilizes the sub time series components which have been computed through dwt on original patterns attribute of each of these sub components are different and they provide useful information on various resolution levels kim and valdes 2003a b thus inclusion of these detailed information as the inputs for rf model improves its simulation accuracy in order to make the input matrix of the wrf models the original time series of the minimum maximum and dew point temperature as well as the wind speed records were decomposed into a certain number of sub time series components ds using the algorithm proposed by mallat 1989 the wrf mode was then built in which the ds of original time series of these variables are as input vectors of the rf the number of decomposition level was selected using log n formula where n indicates the number of patterns wang and ding 2003 kisi 2008 as the total patterns of each station belonged to a 10 years period 4 decomposition levels log 3653 3 56 were employed in dwt applications in local scenario so one approximation a and three details d1 d2 and d3 were obtained for each input parameter similarly given that there are 5 stations with 10 years daily data total 18 265 patterns in the external application a decomposition level of 4 log 18265 4 21 was utilized there these subcomponents were used as inputs of the applied models the selection of effective details and a subcomponents was made based on correlation analysis fig 3 provides a schematic representation of the wrf model 2 4 neuro fuzzy system nf as a combination of an adaptive neural network and a fuzzy inference system fis nf admits a set of parameters by a hybrid learning procedure mergering back propagation and a least squared error approach the nf method employed here accomplishes the sugeno s fuzzy approach takagi and sugeno 1985 for deriving the values for the target parameter using input parameters the grid partitioning identification approach of the sugeno models was used in this study for simulating the relationships among the input target parameters this method supplies independent blocks of each antecedent variable through defining the membership functions mfs of all antecedent variables based on trial and error 2 3 or 4 numbers of triangular mfs were found to be appropriate in the present study which is a commonly used mf in practical issues russel and campbell 1996 the output mf was also selected as linear since it gave more accurate results than the constant mf 2 5 data management scenarios a cross validation approach was adopted here to assess the proposed methodology based on the k fold testing scenario in both local at station and external cross station scales in the local scale data from one year were set as test patterns each time and the model was trained using the patterns of the remaining 9 years the process was repeated till all the available patterns were involved in train test phases given that there are 5 weather stations with 10 years data total 450 5 stations 10 folds 3 input combinations 3 models rf wrf nf train test phases were conducted in local k fold testing in the external assessing of the models the whole patterns of one station were held out as test data and the models were trained using the all data from remaining 4 stations the procedure was repeated for all stations so 45 train test stages were evaluated in the external application 5 stations 3 input combinations 3 models a similar procedure was carried out for assessing the empirical models the applied mass transfer based models were calibrated using the following regression based equation 10 et o fao 56 pm a et o model at first a traditional calibration procedure was adopted per station where the training and testing data are the same then the k fold testing was used for evaluation of the calibrated models so a total 450 local 9 models 5 stations 10 folds and 45 external 9 models 5 stations calibration testing stages were established in this case therefore total of 990 modeling processes were carried out in this study fig 4 shows the general flowchart of the study 2 6 models evaluation the mean absolute error mae the nash sutcliffe

the rmse because any developed model should explain most of the trends in the observed patterns of the target parameter here eto values calculated by fao56 pm so a good model should have higher rmseu

values further a relative error based index namely the si ratio of calibrated eto models to the non calibrated versions r si was computed for relative comparison of the performance accuracy of the calibrated and non calibrated models landeras et al 2008 18 r si 1 si calibrated model si noncalibrated model 3 results and discussions 3 1 evaluation of the mass transfer based empirical models the performances of the empirical mass transfer based eto models are presented in table 3 among the applied models trabert and wmo models presented the highest and lowest performance accuracies in all stations from the tables it is seen that the overall performance accuracy of the empirical models was weak in all studied locations so they should be calibrated against the standard fao56 pm model for improving their performance using the eq 10 the corresponding error statistics of the traditional calibration procedure have been reported in table 3 it is seen that the overall performances accuracy of the calibrated models were weak in all locations high si and mae values although the calibration procedure improved the performance accuracy of the models in all studied locations this showed that the calibration procedure couldn t increase the models accuracy which might be attributed to the shortcoming of mass transfer based models as well as linear calibration procedure as argued by shiri et al 2014b the maximum performance improvement belonged to wmo model in all stations analyzing the linear calibration regression equations not presented here revealed that dalton meyer trabert rohwer and penman models overestimated the eto values when compared to the standard model the values of the linear calibration equation a in eq 10 are lower than unity while albrecht brockamp and wenner wmo and mahringer models showed underestimation this might be explained through the mathematical structures of these models in dalton meyer rohwer and penman models an increase in wind speed as 1 m s 1 would affect the computed eto values by 0 437 0 425 1 27 and 1 526 mm day 1 respectively while the same wind speed variation will increase the eto values by 0 397 and 0 223 mm day 1 for albrecht and wmo models respectively such differences in the quantitative influence of wind speed values variations might affect the models response and produce over underestimations in case of the albrecht and mahringer models the effect of wind speed is included in a squared manner and finally a power function is used to consider the u 2 effect in brockamp wenner model despite the weak performance of the calibrated models the results obtained through the traditional calibration procedure would be partially valid since the same patterns have been utilized for calibrating and testing the models as discussed by shiri et al 2014b therefore the robust k fold testing cross validation process was adopted here to assess the calibration procedure as stated before fig 5 illustrates the si variations of the locally calibrated equations among the test years it is seen from the figure that the si values fluctuated among the test years for all locations although similar si values have been obtained for some test years for instance 2005 2006 and 2010 for penman model in badar e abbas or 2007 2008 for mahringer in chabahar there were considerable oscillations for its values among the test years this could be anticipated since the train test patters were different in each stage of local and external k fold testing fig 6 shows the r si per station values of the calibrated equations assessed through local and external k fold testing the figure shows that the calibration of the empirical models generally improved their performance although their overall performances are weak as can be seen from high si values in fig 5 dalton trabert meyer rohwer albrecht and wmo models showed better performance for the external calibration in all studied locations except omidiah where the external calibration gave weak performance with respect to the local calibration it can be linked to the slightly different characteristics of this station among others analyzing the climatic characteristics of the stations in table 1 showed that omidiah presents the highest mean eto value as well as its coefficient of variation among others moreover the lowest mean air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation are belonged to this station while the recorded meteorological variables of this location presented the highest coefficient of variation standard deviation such slight differences can difficult the extrapolation of the eto values using externally calibrated models which should be tested using local data on the other hand penman brockamp wenner and mahringer models gave the better performance for the locally calibrated cases in some cases the external calibration showed adverse effect on the performance accuracy of these models the different trends of the mass transfer based empirical models with respect to the local and external calibrations might be due to the way of including the effect of wind speed in the eto models while the wind speed has an inverse effect on eto in penman models it has been included with a direct relation to the eto in the rest this can explain the weak performance of the penman model and its calibrated versions in the studied locations as the variations of wind speed records showed direct relation with eto oscillations fig 2 nonetheless in the brockamp wenner and mahringer models the wind speed inclusion is somewhat different from the manner applied in the other empirical models as stated before this might affect the model performance when compared against the standard fao56 pm model which considers both the aerodynamic and energy balance components fully physics based for eto calculation nevertheless this may be a clear weakness of these models for computing eto in arid regions as discussed by kiafar et al 2017 3 2 evaluating the rf and wrf models fig 7 presents the statistical indicators of the considered approaches averaging the results of the five stations expectedly the heuristic models relied on input combination 3 i e considering more variables gave the most accurate results among others followed by input combination 1 temperature based models so it is seen that the temperature based models based on input combination 1 gave better results than the wind speed based models models that use input combination 2 apart from the direct effect of wind speed on eto in the studied locations fig 2 this might be attributed to the higher variations of wind speed in terms of cv in table 1 with respect to eto variations which make it difficult to produce a direct mapping between these parameters such variations in wind speed values can be smoothen using the wavelet transform analyzing the statistics presented in fig 7 revealed that coupling the dwt with rf has improved the performance accuracy of the models moreover the local approaches lrf wlrf lnf produced the most accurate simulations as they utilized the data from the same station for both training and testing stages nevertheless their abilities are restricted to the conditions similar to those of the training location as discussed by shiri et al 2014a comparing the calibrated empirical mass transfer based equations with the corresponding heuristic models it was observed that the heuristic models generally produced better simulations than the empirical models except input combination 2 e g erf 2 enf2 external models however it should be noted that the per station performance of the calibrated empirical models are generally weak in bandar e abbas chabahar and jask which make the application of these equations limited the results also clearly showed that the rf and wrf models surpassed the nf models in both evaluated scenarios a breakdown of the detailed comparison between these models is given in the next sections regarding the input combination 1 models relied on temperature records the external rf model erf 1 and the calibrated local and external dalton trabert mayer rohwer and penman models showed similar performance accuracy si around 0 300 while ewrf 1 showed si around 0 233 this is an important outcome as external models do not require local patterns for developing the models so these models can be applied for simulating eto in the locations with limited meteorological records as could be anticipated the locally trained models e g lrf 1 lwrf 1 models showed great improvement in the performance accuracy si values around 0 181 versus 0 310 for empirical models as these models were fed with the patterns of a specific location for both training and testing stages on the other hand special care should be achieved when using the external models as the train test locations should be similar to get accurate estimations noting to the models relied on input combination 2 e g wind speed as unique input parameter the performance accuracy is lower than those of the previous case temperature based models while the si value of erf 2 model is around 0 380 the ewrf 2 improves the simulation accuracy by si value of 0 319 16 si reduction which is comparable with the statistics obtained by the calibrated dalton trabert mayer rohwer and penman models further the improvement in performance accuracy of the temporal local approach with respect to the external approach is also visible as for the previous input combination a reason behind this might be the inclusion of wind speed records of different locations which provides a global matrix of wind speed values with different statistical characteristics this can facilitate eto mapping using these data to some extent nonetheless inclusion of wavelet coefficients in terms of the both details and approximations as input parameters for the rf model improved the estimations provided by the single input external models e g input combination 1 analysis of the performance of the models relying on the third input combination showed their superiority over the other applied models again rf and wrf models surpassed the calibrated empirical models in terms of both the si and mae indicators nonetheless the difference between the si values of the local and external wavelet based models was minimum for this input combination 0 042 while the single input input 2 based models showed the lowest mae difference 0 032 such discrepancy might be attributed to the inclusion of the parameters in definition of these indices where si comprises the mean values of targets for all studied locations with different magnitudes of average eto which can affect the global indices derived for all the locations while mae includes only the target simulations pairs in its equation anyway differences between the local and external approaches might be considered as the lowest for the second and third input combinations which can highlight the temperature differences that can be partly affected by wind speed too in the studied regions summarizing it might be stated that when relied on suitable input parameters the external wavelet based rf models might be good alternatives for local models in estimating eto magnitudes next the comparison of the rf and wavelet based rf models showed considerable improvement in the performance accuracy by using wrf models the highest improvement was observed for the local single input models input combination 2 with 34 1 and 17 2 reduction in si and mae values respectively followed by the external single input models with 30 1 and 27 8 reduction in the values of the same indicators this outcome confirms that using wavelet transform to wind speed records which showed high variations table 1 could reduce the adverse effect of data variance on model ability to simulate eto values using both local and external data management scenarios for local models the first input combination showed better improvement than the third combination by using wavelet transform while for the external case the third combination has had better improvement than the first combination such discrepancy might be explained by taking into consideration the amalgamation of the wavelet coefficients of the studied stations in external case which can facilitate the extrapolation of eto values using exogenous data fig 8 shows the si and ns values of the rf and wrf models in the studied locations it is clear that there are obvious variations in the si and ns values of the models among the considered locations the local models presented the best simulations in bandar e abbas chabahar and omidiah or the input combinations 1 2 and 3 respectively similar trend could be also detected for the external models in case of the first input combination temperature based the external models gave the worst outcomes in omidiah which might be attributed to the differences between the temperature records variations as well as their mean values in omidiah and other studied locations table 1 in the second input combination however erf models presented similar error statistics for all stations except chabahar which showed the best simulations for both erf and ewrf models finally for the input combination 3 omidiah presented the most accurate results followed by bandar e abbas again it is seen that the third input combinations presented the best results in all studied locations with respect to the first and second input combinations which could be linked to the simultaneous inclusion of the wind speed and temperature values in simulation process fig 9 shows the rmseu rmses ratios of the rf and wrf models per studied location from the figure two general statements can be achieved first there were fewer variations among studied stations for the values of this ratio in case of the second input combination when compared to the other applied combinations second the maximum improvement in simulation performance of the models through using wavelet transform was observed for the second input combination in all stations comparing figs 8 9 it is seen that the general trend of the models performance accuracy was similar when assessed through weighted rmse si and rmse portions for instance the lowest si values of the rf1 and wrf1 models were observed in bandar e abbas fig 8 and at the same time the highest rmseu rmses ratio was belonged to this station for the same input combination similar statements could be also given for other input combinations and locations summarizing it can be concluded that the wavelet random forest methodology is able in mapping the nonlinear relationships between the temperature wind speed parameters and eto in both local and cross station scales this is very important as wind speed shows usually high variations in its time series which make it difficult to simulate the eto values using this parameter the outcomes of the present study regarding the assessment of the models in local and cross station scales confirmed the conclusions obtained by previous literature e g shiri et al 2014a 4 conclusions among the different eto modeling categories mass transfer based models have been less studied so far those models utilize air temperature and wind speed records for calculating the eto values apart from limitation of wind speed measurement to the synoptic stations the situations e g altitude etc of the stations that record these parameters might be different for various locations therefore great variety of mass transfer based models have been suggested that might be applicable for some specific regions only the conditions they have been developed for on the other hand data scarcity especially in developing regions is a common problem that affects the accuracy of eto estimations in such locations due to the mentioned problems this study proposed a new coupled wavelet random forest wrf methodology for improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer based eto models in arid locations data from five stations were used to feed the models and then the developed models were assessed with the local and cross station data management scenarios using the robust k fold testing approach further some commonly used mass transfer based eto equations were evaluated in the studied locations using the same data management scenarios a comparison was also made between the wrf and neuro fuzzy nf method it was found that the outcomes of the external calibration of the empirical equations were comparable to the local calibration results the obtained results demonstrated the superiority of wrf model over the single rf nf and empirical mass transfer based models in all studied cases this is very important in areas with limited meteorological records because the externally established models can be easily applied in the locations with missing or limited necessary parameters although the data from arid sites were used here to test the approach the proposed methodology and data management scenario will not be limited to arid conditions but can be translated to other regions with different climatological contexts acknowledgments author would like to thank dr gorka landeras whose comments helped to improve the quality of paper 
7308,quantitative understanding of controls on thaw layer thickness tlt dynamics in the arctic peninsula is essential for predictive understanding of permafrost degradation feedbacks to global warming and hydrobiochemical processes this study jointly interprets electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements and hydro thermal numerical simulation results to assess spatiotemporal variations of tlt and to determine its controlling factors in barrow alaska time lapse ert measurements along a 35 m transect were autonomously collected from 2013 to 2015 and inverted to obtain soil electrical resistivity based on several probe based tlt measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds associated with the boundary between the thaw layer and permafrost using a grid search optimization algorithm then we used the obtained thresholds to derive the tlt from all soil electrical resistivity images the spatiotemporal analysis of the ert derived tlt shows that the tlt at high centered polygons hcps is smaller than that at low centered polygons lcps and that both thawing and freezing occur earlier at the hcps compared to the lcps in order to provide a physical explanation for dynamics in the thaw layer we performed 1 d hydro thermal simulations using the community land model clm simulation results showed that air temperature and precipitation jointly govern the temporal variations of tlt while the topsoil organic content soc and polygon morphology are responsible for its spatial variations when the topsoil soc and its thickness increase tlt decreases meanwhile at lcps a thicker snow layer and saturated soil contribute to a thicker tlt and extend the time needed for tlt to freeze and thaw this research highlights the importance of combination of measurements and numerical modeling to improve our understanding spatiotemporal variations and key controls of tlt in cold regions keywords electrical resistivity permafrost thaw layer thickness land community model arctic spatiotemporal variation 1 introduction thaw layer dynamics and its feedbacks to climate change in permafrost regions are a focus of intensive investigations e g schuur et al 2009 thaw layer dynamics may influence the decomposition of the enormous carbon pool contained in the subsurface releasing co2 and ch4 to the atmosphere and therefore potentially increasing global warming thaw layer thickness tlt also influences the groundwater direction surface topography and ecological landscape in the permafrost regions e g turetsky et al 2002 hinzman et al 2005 as well as the groundwater storage capacity in turn the changes in topography and landscape affect the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and infiltration e g kane et al 2008 as a result it is crucial to quantitatively characterize the thaw layer and its controlling factors to increase our predictive understanding of permafrost system behavior thaw layer dynamics can be explored using numerical simulations or field investigations numerical approach considers near surface atmospheric forcing e g air temperature precipitation radiation wind speed humidity and air pressure vegetation characteristics and soil properties e g porosity water retention curve hydraulic conductivity thermal conductivity and heat capacity to simulate the surface subsurface hydro thermal processes and thaw layer spatiotemporal variability often in high resolution development of these models is often challenging due to the complexity of hydro thermal processes that need to be included such as radiation exchange evapotranspiration root water uptake and snowmelt as well as water phase transition and its associated landscape deformation painter et al 2013 in addition the common lack of model input data e g vegetation soil properties and bedrock location and system states e g liquid ice content soil temperature and groundwater table inhibits calibration and validation of these models combining hydro thermal modeling with multi scale observations can lead to improved understanding of the thaw layer dynamics and its drivers thaw layer dynamics can be characterized using a range of field based techniques traditional techniques include mechanical probing vertical soil temperature measurements and visual observations e g brown et al 2000 while these traditional techniques provide the relatively accurate measurements of tlt they are labor intensive and often do not provide dense spatiotemporal information several noninvasive geophysical techniques have demonstrated utility for tlt estimation for example arcone et al 1998 hinkel et al 2001 jørgensen and andreasen 2007 and léger et al 2017 employed ground penetrating radar gpr to characterize the thaw layer schaefer et al 2015 used interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar to estimate the thaw depth at barrow you et al 2013 employed electrical resistivity tomography ert ground temperature monitoring frost table probing and coring to detect the permafrost depth hubbard et al 2013 combined lidar data with multiple geophysical ert gpr electromagnetic and point measurements to characterize the thaw layer and permafrost variability over a large area however the time span of most of these studies were limited taking place from few measurements to one growing season there is a lack of data tracking the spatiotemporal variations of tlt over the course of a year or many years there have been only few studies that cover several years for example hilbich et al 2008 used ert and temperature observations in seven years to explore the long term and short term variations of the freezing thawing process in alpine permafrost and its links to the atmospheric temperature dafflon et al 2017 used one year multiple datasets obtained from autonomous above and below ground measurements including ert to monitor the annual cycle of freezing thaw dynamics winter growing season freezing and its link to surface processes besides monitoring tlt identifying the factors that control tlt dynamics is important as well hubbard et al 2013 found that tlt co varied with several parameters including vegetation soil physical properties soil water content polygon morphology and seasonal temperature hinzman et al 1991 and tran et al 2017 identified soil organic carbon soc as a main factor that governs the hydro thermal and thaw layer dynamics in the alaskan arctic nelson et al 1998 stated that topography via near surface hydrology is closely linked to the variations of tlt wright et al 2009 reported that the spatial pattern of tlt strongly correlates with the soil moisture distribution and found that its temporal variations are influenced by air temperature and precipitation hinkel and nelson 2003 analyzed data collected at seven circumpolar active layer monitoring calm sites in northern alaska during the 1995 2000 period and found that the annual maximum thaw depth is controlled by air temperature meanwhile its spatial variations depend on vegetation substrate properties snow cover and soil surface topography blok et al 2010 observed that the shrub expansion in the arctic region may increase soil temperature and tlt mcclymont et al 2013 showed that soil temperature in winter in the peat plateau is considerably lower than that in the bog dafflon et al 2017 showed that subsurface soil moisture and thaw depth in the arctic tundra exhibit a strong correlation with the vegetation greenness using numerical simulations nicolsky et al 2007 showed that inclusion of surface soc in the land surface model could improve the tlt estimation in a study at barrow alaska atchley et al 2016 performed a sensitivity analysis and found that tlt is the most sensitive to top organic layer thickness and snow depth but relatively insensitive to water saturation the above studies indicate the need to simultaneously investigate the spatiotemporal variations of tlt and identify the factors that control these variations in permafrost regions our study addressed this requirement using the following model data integration approach we first estimated tlt variations in time and space using time lapse subsurface electrical resistivity images which were obtained by inversion of ert measurements in an ice wedge polygon dominated tundra in barrow alaska secondly we used the probe based tlt measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity to determine the electrical resistivity thresholds that separate the thaw layer from the permafrost layer using the grid search optimization algorithm then these thresholds were used to derive tlt from soil electrical resistivity images over a period from 2013 to 2015 next we analyzed the annual and multiannual variations of the soil electrical resistivity and tlt finally we performed numerical hydro thermal simulations to explore tlt dynamics and to investigate the factors that govern these dynamics including soil properties morphology and atmospheric forcing compared to previous studies this study advances the knowledge of how to use long term measurements to provide a more comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal variability of tlt and its controlling factors in addition the joint interpretation of measurements and numerical modeling provides new insights and decreased uncertainty about the controls of tlt dynamics 2 description of study site and data availability our study site is associated with the department of energy s next generation ecosystem experiment ngee arctic project and is situated at the barrow environmental observatory in alaska fig 1 the ngee site is characterized by ice wedge polygons which include low centered polygon lcp flat centered polygon fcp and high centered polygon hcp morphologic features hubbard et al 2013 the polygon morphology largely controls the spatial distribution of snow thickness wainwright et al 2017 and tlt e g gangodagamage et al 2014 in the summer season while the centers of the lcps are usually fully filled with water the hcps are relatively dry and unsaturated sedges grasses mosses and dwarf shrubs are main vegetation types at this site the mean annual air temperature is around 12 c and that in summer june to august is 3 3 c the annual precipitation is 173 mm in which summer rain contributes up to 42 liljedahl et al 2011 thawing occurs during the growing season from june to october and the maximum tlt ranges from 25 to 65 cm shiklomanov et al 2010 we established a 35 m intensive transect at this site which traverses a hcp a fcp and a lcp an above and below ground autonomous measurement system which included ert and other measurements was installed fig 1 probe based tlt snow depth tdr and gpr data were also occasionally manually acquired soil samples were collected during the summer of 2014 at the thaw layer of five locations along the transect in this study we utilized the time lapse ert probe based tlt data and physical soil properties estimated from the soil samples the ert data were acquired along the transect using wenner schlumberger configuration with a 0 5 m electrode spacing the time lapse ert measurements were autonomously acquired daily over a long time period from 08 15 2013 to 07 07 2016 however because the last measurements in 2016 were collected at the beginning of the summer season we only used data from 2013 to 2015 for our spatiotemporal analysis details of the acquisition were provided by dafflon et al 2017 the time lapse images of soil electrical resistivity along the transect were obtained by inversion of ert measurements using the boundless electrical resistivity tomography bert model developed by rücker et al 2006 the unstructured mesh was internally generated by bert and kept the same for all the inversions the grid cell size which is controlled by the model increases from the surface to the bottom layer in this study we set the maximum area of a grid cell at 0 5 m2 the maximum cell width at the surface layer was set at 25 of the electrode spacing 0 5 m for inversion we used both electrical resistance and phase data contained in ert measurements with a relative measurement error of 5 the probe based tlt data were measured at all locations of ert electrodes 71 locations on seven days during the 2013 2016 period fig 2 based on these measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity images collected on the nearest days we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds that separate the thaw layer and permafrost layer at each electrode location as described in section 3 2 then these thresholds were used to specify tlt from all electrical resistivity images in the period from 08 15 2013 to 12 31 2015 for evaluating the impact of soil properties on tlt soil cores of top 0 3 m of the thaw layer were collected at five locations along the ert transect in summer 2014 using a plastic tube pushed down to various depths and then excavated in this study we defined the soc content as the volumetric fraction of soc in soc mineral mixture without pores as in the community land model clm table 1 indicates that there is a sharp change in both soil porosity and soc content between depths of 0 075 and 0 15 m at all locations for example at the lcp soc location of x 29 m see fig 1 the porosity reduces from 95 to 82 and the soc content reduces from 94 to 51 as for the horizontal variations the most notable difference in the soil properties is observed at x 3 m along the transect and refer later as the hcp mineral location both soil porosity and soc content at this location are significantly smaller than those at the other locations for example the porosity and soc content of the top 0 075 m at the hcp mineral location are respectively 78 and 68 while at the other locations the porosity is greater than 86 and the soc content is greater than 94 based on various investigations at the ngee site the high mineral content at the hcp mineral location is likely linked to the presence of a type of non sorted circle that has limited expression at the surface at several locations over the site but mostly in the hcp there is not much difference in soil properties among the hcp fcp and lcp the top 0 075 m at all of the other locations are approximately identical the spatial variations of soil porosity at depths of 0 15 0 21 and 0 26 m are significant with the porosity ranging from 51 to 82 and the soc content ranging from 16 to 51 it is worth noting that there is another definition of soc content which is the percentage of the soc in total volume of bulk soil shown at the bottom row of table 1 table 1 shows that when the soc content in soil material increases the soil porosity increases and therefore the soc content in bulk soil decreases 3 spatial and temporal analysis of electrical resistivity and thaw layer thickness 3 1 spatial and temporal analysis of soil electrical resistivity data fig 3 presents the estimated soil electrical resistivity images at specific times over the period from may to november 2014 the figure indicates that vertical variations in electrical resistivity at the end of winter and beginning of summer 05 02 2014 and 06 15 2014 are related to the presence of a shallow frozen active layer and upper permafrost high resistivity located over a saline permafrost layer lower resistivity the latter documented by dafflon et al 2016 during this spring and early summer period there is not much difference in the vertical resistivity distribution between lcp fcp and hcps however when thawing occurs there is a thaw layer with low resistivity above the permafrost and saline permafrost we observed that this layer remained relatively conductive until the beginning of winter in the horizontal direction fig 3 shows that tlt at the lcp is larger and remains unfrozen longer than that at the hcp for example on 11 16 2016 while there is no thaw layer at the hcp there is still a shallow thaw layer at the lcp to enable detailed analysis of temporal variations of soil electrical resistivity and its link to soil liquid content in the growing season we transformed the electrical resistivity to the temporally normalized value δ as below 1 δ tj ρ tj ρ j ρ j ρ tj ρ j 1 in which subscripts t and j denote the measurement at time instant t and bert grid cell j ρ represents the soil electrical resistivity ρ j 1 m t 1 m ρ tj is the temporal mean of electrical resistivity at grid cell j m is the number of ert measurements over the considered period 08 15 2013 12 31 2015 the advantage of this normalization is that it removes variability due to soil physical characteristics which do not change with time and highlights changes due to freeze state and moisture content for example if the relationship between water liquid and soil electrical conductivity follows archie s formula ρ ϕ m s l n σ w ϕ m 1 σ s 1 archie 1942 the temporally normalized resistivity at a certain bert grid cell is formulated as 2 δ s l n σ w ϕ m 1 σ s s l n σ w ϕ m 1 σ s 1 s l n s l n 1 in which s l n is the liquid saturation s l n is the temporal mean of s l n ϕ is the soil porosity σ w and σ s are respectively the water conductivity and soil surface conductance and m and n are the cement and saturation exponential coefficients eq 2 illustrates that the temporal normalization removes the effect of temporally constant terms assuming soil porosity and soil surface conductance do not vary significantly and highlight the temporal variations of soil liquid water the temporal variations of the temporally normalized resistivity in the 3 month period august to november in 2013 and 5 month period from june to november in 2014 and 2015 are compared in fig 4 there were no data in june and july of the year 2013 in general the soil depth with low resistivity gradually increases from june to reach a maximum in september or october compared to 2014 thawing in 2015 occurs earlier for example while most of the normalized resistivity on 06 15 2014 is lower than zero at the hcp thawing occurs at almost the whole transect on 06 15 2015 in addition of the three years the normalized resistivity from june to october is lowest in 2014 however the lowest normalized resistivity in november is observed in 2013 these results imply that the air temperature in the summer of 2015 was highest but coldest in the winter see fig 9 while the winter of 2013 is warmest this fact will be clarified in the later section where numerical simulations are performed to physically explain the spatiotemporal variations of soil electrical resistivity 3 2 estimation of thaw layer thickness from electrical resistivity data in this section we combined the probe based tlt measurements along the study transect 7 datasets and co located soil electrical resistivity from the ert images to determine the resistivity threshold for separating the thaw layer and permafrost the reason we used this approach is that the number of probe based tlt measurements is sparse and insufficient to perform the spatiotemporal analysis of tlt meanwhile ert measurements collected from 2013 to 2015 are plentiful in space and time as a result if tlt can be derived from ert measurements we can explore the spatiotemporal variations of tlt with high spatiotemporal resolution over the duration of the ert autonomous acquisition period due to the lateral heterogeneity of polygon morphology and soil characteristics a common electrical resistivity threshold for the whole transect is not feasible consequently an individual threshold was defined at each ert electrode location where the probed based tlt measurements were available 71 locations the threshold was estimated by minimizing the objective function which represents the misfit between the probed based and ert derived tlt and is defined as below 3 φ ρ threshold j t 1 n alt meas j t alt ert j t 2 in which φ is the objective function alt meas j t and alt ert j t respectively are the measured and ert derived tlt at time t and location j n 7 is the number of probed based tlt measurements at location j the grid search algorithm was employed to determine the resistivity threshold at each location j the grid search algorithm simply divides the parameter search space into grid nodes and calculates the objective function at each node the optimal solution is found at the node where the objective function is minimal for constraining the inversion we assumed that the maximum tlt is 0 7 m the electrical resistivity threshold that generates a tlt greater than this value will not be considered fig 5 a compares the probed based and ert derived tlt at a 1 1 scale this is the best agreement between two terms that we can obtain by grid search algorithm the correlation between them is 0 65 compared to measurements tlt derived from soil electrical resistivity is overestimated with a bias ratio of 1 11 the differences between the two tlt values is likely mainly due to the ert and probed based tlt measurement errors bert inversion errors and differences in measurement time of ert and probed based tlt the estimated electrical resistivity thresholds show large spatial variations ranging from 130 to 774 ohm m along the transect fig 5b in order to compare these spatial variations with that of the soil electrical resistivity we plotted the average electrical resistivity at the top 0 3 m on 09 22 2014 as an illustration the figure shows that the spatial variations of the resistivity threshold are similar to those of the electrical resistivity in the topsoil the comparison between the resistivity threshold and surface elevation also shows that there is a positive correlation between the resistivity threshold and the surface elevation this can be explained by the fact that soil tends to be drier at higher elevations and therefore the soil electrical resistivity is also larger for example the threshold is pronounced high at the location x 6 m of the hcp because it is situated at the higher elevation than the other locations along the transect 3 3 spatial and temporal variations of thaw layer thickness based on the electrical resistivity thresholds determined in the previous section we estimated tlt along the intensive transect from the soil electrical resistivity images fig 6 presents tlt versus time and space for the three years 2013 2014 and 2015 as for the spatial variations of tlt the figure indicates that while there is not much difference in tlt between the hcp and fcp tlt at the lcp is significantly larger than that at the hcp and fcp except for the hcp location x 1 6 m tlt is also different within each polygon type especially at the hcp tlt at the hcp location x 1 6 m is larger than that at the hcp location x 6 10 m for example while tlt in 2015 at x 1 6 m is up to 0 69 m that at x 6 10 m is 0 5 m in the section 4 2 below we will prove that while the difference in tlt among the polygon types is caused primarily by the topography morphology the difference within each polygon is controlled by the soil properties as for the temporal variations fig 6 also shows that freezing occurs later at the lcp than at the hcp and fcp at the end of growing season tlt at the lcp is considerably thicker than the fcp and hcp for example on 10 31 2013 the average tlt at the lcp is around 0 44 m it is 0 and 0 05 m at the hcp and fcp respectively thawing at the hcp and fcp also occurs earlier than that at the lcp but the difference is relatively small among these polygon types through comparing tlt over the three years of measurements we found that the onset of thawing and freezing was different in different years for example thawing began much earlier in 2015 06 24 2015 than in 2014 07 05 2014 because air temperature in early summer of 2015 is higher than that in 2014 due to thicker snow depth freezing in 2013 occurred later than in 2015 which is especially visible at the lcp while there was no thaw layer on 10 31 2015 tlt on that date was relatively high in 2013 0 44 m these relationships between the thaw freeze onset and meteorological forcing will be subsequently described section 4 4 below 4 numerical simulation 4 1 surface subsurface hydro thermal model in this section we physically explain the above spatiotemporal variations of electrical resistivity and tlt as well as the factors controlling these variations using numerical simulations we performed 1 d hydro thermal simulations in a soil column using clm model clm can simulate hydro thermal processes from bedrock to the top of canopy with consideration of different land surface processes e g evapotranspiration radiation balance snow melting accumulation and the phase transition of water from liquid to ice and vice versa soil heat conduction in the subsurface is modeled by the diffusion equation while soil liquid water dynamics is modeled by richard s equation richards 1931 with influences of runoff evaporation canopy transpiration root water uptake and groundwater recharge evaporation and transpiration are separately calculated for the soil surface and vegetation using the monin obukhov similarity theory melting or freezing occurs when temperature in snow soil greater or lower than the water freezing temperature 273 15 k the rate of phase change is determined by the energy excess for melting or deficit for freezing that needs to change soil snow temperature to the water freezing temperature for more information about this model we refer to oleson et al 2013 in clm soil hydro thermal parameters i e soil thermal conductivity heat capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention curve are calculated from soil types sand clay and soil organic content formulas for these relationships are presented in details in lawrence and slater 2008 as for vegetation clm allows assignment of 17 plant functional types pfts with the predefined leaf area index lai stem area index sai and plant top and bottom heights in this study we selected the c3 arctic grass plant type we developed a soil column including 32 soil layers in which hydrological simulation was performed at 27 topsoil layers and thermal simulation was performed at all 32 layers the total thickness of 27 topsoil layers was 2 4 m and that of 5 bottom layers was 3 1 m we performed clm simulations over the period from 01 01 2013 to 12 31 2015 the model was run during a spin up period from 01 01 1996 to 12 31 2012 to generate realistic initial conditions for our simulations meteorological input data for clm includes atmospheric temperature pressure precipitation wind speed and downward solar and longwave radiation these data in the 1996 2013 period were obtained from the ngee database xu and yuan 2014 for the 2013 2015 period we obtained precipitation data from barrow airport station the other data were taken from the noaa barrow station http www esrl noaa gov gmd obop brw clm can provide multiple outputs such as soil temperature and soil liquid ice content at different depths runoff surface water depth snow depth evaporation transpiration infiltration and groundwater recharge etc tlts are determined as the largest soil depth where soil temperature is greater than or equal to the water freezing temperature we performed four synthetic cases to evaluate the influence of topsoil properties soc content and soil porosity using cases hcp lowsoc toplayer hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer and polygon morphology using cases hcp thinsoc toplayer and lcp thinsoc toplayer on the tlt table 2 these four cases represent the four typical conditions in term of polygon morphology and soil properties of the lcp and hcp 4 2 effect of soc on the spatiotemporal dynamics of thaw layer thickness in this section we explore the impacts of soil porosity and volumetric soc content on the hydro thermal dynamics and tlt variations these impacts were evaluated by comparing the clm simulation results of three synthetic cases namely hcp lowsoc toplayer hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer table 2 and fig 7 a the model parameters of these three cases are identical except for the layer thickness soil porosity and soc content of the top layer the hcp lowsoc toplayer case mimics the soil properties at the hcp mineral location x 3 m see table 1 with a porosity of 0 78 and a soc content of 68 at 0 0 125 m depth and 0 38 and 19 at 0 125 0 6 m depth the hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer cases represent the soil properties at the hcp organic location x 8 m but with different thicknesses of the top layer to evaluate the effect of the soc layer thickness on tlt the top layer thickness is 0 075 m for the hcp thinsoc toplayer case and 0 125 m for the hcp thicksoc toplayer case which are the upper and lower limits of the soc thickness observed in the ert transect for both cases this top layer has a porosity of 0 92 and a soc content of 96 fig 7d clearly indicates that when the soc content at the topsoil layer increases tlt decreases tlt also decreases when the thickness of topsoil soc content increases similarly the soil temperature in the hcp lowsoc toplayer case is higher than that at the hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer cases fig 7c however soil liquid water saturation in the hcp lowsoc toplayer case is smaller fig 7b this is reasonable because when the soc content is higher the soil heat capacity increases and the soil thermal conductivity decreases lawrence and slater 2008 this causes the summer variations in the atmospheric temperature to propagate more slowly to the deep layers as a result the soil temperature is higher and tlt is thicker in hcp lowsoc toplayer case in addition because the organic material holds water better than mineral the water saturation in the hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer cases is higher than that in the hcp lowsoc toplayer case it is worth noting that there are several abrupt changes in tlts during the 2013 2014 period it is because tlts are very sensitive to the change of soil temperature as a result a small change in soil temperature can cause significant variations of tlts these abrupt variations appear in 2013 2014 because compared to 2015 air temperature in these years varies in a larger range fig 7d 4 3 effect of polygon morphology on spatiotemporal variations of thaw layer thickness in this section we investigated the impact of polygon morphology on tlt variability by comparing the simulation results of hcp thinsoc toplayer and lcp thinsoc toplayer cases the lcp thinsoc toplayer case mimics the lcp soc location at x 29 m table 2 although there are differences in the soil porosity and soc content the most profound difference between the two cases is the polygon morphology due to the effect of polygon morphology while a large portion of water from precipitation or and snowmelt contributes to runoff at the hcp runoff is much smaller at the lcp in clm the total liquid water at the soil surface is partitioned into surface runoff surface water storage and infiltration appendix a the surface runoff is calculated by the saturation excess mechanism i e surface runoff appears only at the saturated parts of soil surface runoff is controlled by parameter f max eq 2 of appendix which is the maximum fraction of soil surface that can be saturated and ranges from 0 to 1 runoff is potentially larger for a higher f max the surface water storage represents the wetlands and sub grid scale water body e g pond as shown in the appendix a the depth of the surface water storage increases when the topographic slope β decreases the decreasing topography slope also causes the smaller lateral drainage of groundwater in this study the effect of polygon morphology on the hydro thermal dynamics was accounted by assigning f max 1 β π 3 for the hcp thinsoc toplayer case and f max 0 2 β 0 02 for the lcp thinsoc toplayer case in addition at the beginning of the simulation period 01 01 1996 the soil porosity at the lcp was fully filled by liquid water and ice while ice and liquid water content at the shallow surface of the hcp 0 4 m was equal to 20 of the porosity below this depth the soil porosity was also fully saturated fig 8 e shows that the tlt at the hcp is shallower than that at the lcp which is suitable with the observations derived from ert measurements the hcp was only relatively wet when melting occurs and then became drier because a large part of liquid water flowed down to its surrounding lower locations the surface water body appears at the beginning of snowmelt period and rapidly disappears fig 8a by contrast because runoff was relatively small soil at the lcp was fully saturated and the surface water storage still exists fig 8a and c snow depth at the lcp is also higher than at the hcp fig 8b it is because at the beginning of winter when first snow falls it may transform to liquid due to the fact that soil surface temperature is still greater than 0 c at the hcp soil is unsaturated and slope is high so this liquid mainly partitions into runoff and infiltration meanwhile this liquid remains at the surface of the lcp because soil at the lcp is totally saturated and its slope is low when soil temperature is equal or below 0 c surface water is transformed to ice the thicker snow layer keeps soil at the lcp warmer during the winter and costs less heat to melt when summer comes which makes a deeper thaw depth within the soil layer the ice liquid water content impacts the freezing thawing in two opposite ways higher ice liquid water content at the lcp leads to the higher soil thermal conductivity which helps to move more heat from the top to lower layers for thawing by contrast higher ice content requires more heat to thaw it as a result the competition between these two processes will influence the tlt variations it is worth noting that in this study we did not consider the difference in vegetation characteristics between the hcp and lcp lichens which primarily cover the hcp have a higher albedo than graminoid which mainly cover the lcp therefore inclusion of this spatial variability of vegetation may more increase the difference in tlt between the hcp and lcp in addition because clm is a 1 d model the influence of the subsurface lateral flow was not accounted for in this study we also only concentrated on the hydro thermal dynamics in the active layer and shallow permafrost top 2 4 m the dynamics of the saline permafrost layer that is partially unfrozen was not considered fig 8e also shows that both thawing and freezing at the hcp occurs earlier than at the lcp this can be explained by the fact that the thicker snow layer in winter and the thicker water surface layer in summer at the lcp caused soil at the lcp respond more slowly to the variations of atmospheric temperature in addition more ice liquid water content at the hcp also takes a longer time to melt 4 4 effect of meteorological forcing on temporal dynamics of hydro thermal variables and tlt to explore controls on tlt temporal variations we present in fig 9 the measured meteorological forcing data air temperature yearly accumulated snow precipitation and rainfall as well as simulated snow thickness and simulated soil temperature at depths of 0 02 0 13 and 0 5 m during the 2013 2015 period for the lcp thinsoc toplayer case for comparison soil temperature at a depth of 0 5 m is also presented in order to evaluate the agreement between modeling and simulation of soil temperature we employed the nash sutcliffe coefficient e 4 e 1 t 1 t m t o t 2 t 1 t o t o 2 in which m t and o t are respectively the simulated and measured soil temperature at time t o is the average of measured soil temperature over the measurement period t the nash sutcliffe coefficient varies from to 1 the accuracy of model prediction increases when this coefficient approaches 1 fig 9a shows that the agreement between the clm simulations and measurements of soil temperature is relatively good with a nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 86 clm accurately predicts the soil temperature in summer time of all three years however the simulated soil temperature is remarkably lower than the measured value at the beginning of winter these may come from the fact that the soil freezing temperature at the site is lower than the freshwater freezing temperature due to its salinity while its variations with soil salinity were not accounted for in clm fig 9c indicates that the simulated tlt is slightly smaller than the ert derived tlt and well agrees with probe measurements this difference may be caused by the overestimation of ert measurements see fig 5a in addition in this study we did not try to calibrate the clm model but used the measured soil properties to directly parameterize the model as a result the errors in model prediction may be caused by uncertainties in some model parameters such as soil porosity soc content and topographic factors because tlt is very sensitive to the freezing temperature a small error in soil temperature around the water freezing temperature can cause a significant change in tlt as for the temporal variation fig 9 indicates that the annual variations in atmospheric temperature at 2 m above the soil surface and precipitation both snow and rainfall are the primary controls on the temporal variations of tlt indeed comparing to 2014 the atmospheric temperature in summer 2013 and summer 2015 were relatively high fig 9a the maximum air temperature for 2013 2014 and 2015 is respectively 11 6 10 6 and 12 1 c and the average temperature in the summer from june 15 to september 15 of these three years is 3 8 3 1 and 3 8 c as a result the soil temperature in 2013 and 2015 was slightly higher the time span that tlt exists in 2013 and 2015 is also longer than that in 2014 comparison of tlt in two years 2013 and 2015 indicates that the time span that tlt remains at its maximum depth 0 6 m in 2013 was shorter than that in 2015 although air temperature in the two years was similar we interpret this difference to be due to the presence of a thick snow layer which was caused by large precipitation in the 2014 2015 winter the snow layer kept the soil warmer and therefore was more susceptible to thaw as for the freezing time the high precipitation and high air temperature in the 2013 led to the latest freeze onset out of the three years by contrast freezing occurred earlier in 2014 due to low air temperature and in 2015 due to thin snow depth 5 conclusion this study analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the electrical resistivity and tlt along a 35 m intensive transect in barrow ak by jointly using ert measurements and through performing physically based modeling simulations the spatiotemporally dense ert measurements allowed investigation of the annual variations of electrical resistivity and tlt as well as their comparisons in different years and seasons by combining measurements and numerical simulations our research provides a valuable approach to confidently interpret the spatiotemporal variations of tlt the numerical simulation supports our ert based interpretation of tlt spatial variability and dynamics while the measurements enhanced the reliability of the numerical modeling providing validations of simulation results and insights about sources of errors based on the probe based tlt measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity images obtained by inversion of ert data we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds along the intensive transect that separated the thaw layer from permafrost the electrical resistivity thresholds were estimated by minimizing the misfit between point tlt measurements and those obtained from ert using the grid search algorithm using these thresholds we then derived tlt from electrical resistivity images in the 2013 2015 period we subsequently analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of both soil electrical resistivity and ert derived tlt the spatial analysis indicates that within each polygon feature tlt at locations with high soc content is thinner than locations with low soc content values compared to the lcp the hcp is drier and has a shallower thaw layer the freezing occurred earlier at the hcp than at the lcp the temporal analysis shows that of three years 2013 2014 and 2015 tlt in 2014 is smallest using this approach we were able to determine tlt with a high spatiotemporal resolution over a long period this in turn allowed to investigate the tlt dynamics in detail which had not been possible in previous studies however uncertainties of tlt values obtained by this approach were not quantitatively considered in this study the main uncertainty sources include measurement errors of ert and thaw probe ert inversion uncertainties and resistivity threshold uncertainties our on going study will individually quantify each of these uncertainties and their contribution to the uncertainties of ert derived tlts the numerical simulations were performed to identify the factors that control the spatiotemporal variations of tlt and electrical resistivity we investigated the influence of soil properties polygon morphology and meteorological forcing on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the soil electrical resistivity and tlt the results show that the spatial variations of tlt within each polygon feature are due to the soil porosity and soc content at the locations with a higher soc content and correlated soil porosity the soil thermal diffusivity is lower and therefore the heat flux from the top to lower layers in the summer is smaller as a result tlt at these locations is shallower meanwhile the difference in tlt among the polygon features hcp fcp and lcp strongly depends on polygon morphology at the lcp the snow layer is thicker due to the phase transition of surface water to ice and the entrapment of snow the isolation effect of this thicker snow layer causes the thawing and freezing at the lcp occur later than those in the hcp and makes the maximum tlt larger at the lcp the temporal variations of tlt are strongly controlled by the atmospheric temperature and precipitation tlt in 2014 is thinnest because the atmospheric temperature in summer of this year is low due to thick snow layer which was caused by large precipitation the freezing in 2013 occurred later than the other two years tlt in 2015 was largest due to the fact that the summer temperature was high and the snow in the 2014 2015 winter was thick our conclusion about the role of soc content is similar to atchley et al 2016 who investigated the individual impact of soc liquid water saturation surface water in summer and snow depth in winter however because snow depth surface water liquid water saturation in barrow are closely related and controlled by polygon morphology we evaluated the impact of polygon morphology on snow depth surface water and liquid saturation and their overall contribution to tlt rather than assessing each of these topography controlled factors individually as per atchley et al 2016 by comparing tlt derived from probe and ert measurements and clm simulation results we found that the clm model estimated the spatiotemporal variations of tlt well and could be used to identify the factors controlling these variations however there are still some limitations of this model first the freezing temperature is fixed in clm so that it cannot account for the impact of soil salinity on freezing thawing secondly clm only considers the diffusive heat transport and ignores the advective heat transport as a result the heat exchange between the top and lower layers simulated in the model is smaller than the reality especially at the hcp where soil water dynamics is stronger than at the lcp thirdly the subsurface lateral flows of heat and water were not simulated in clm which may influence the evaluation of topography effect finally the dynamics of heat and liquid water in the saline permafrost layer were not considered in this study due to lack of information of soil properties at this layer this study demonstrates that combination of the above and below ground measurements with the numerical modeling can help us to better understand the tlt dynamics and controls on their spatial and temporal variations it provides important knowledge about the relationship between tlt and polygon morphology soil properties and atmospheric forcing for upscaling from local scale with intensive dense measurements to larger scales which is crucial for assessing the permafrost feedbacks to global warming acknowledgements the next generation ecosystem experiments ngee arctic project is supported by the office of biological and environmental research

rainfall arriving at soil surface and snowmelt water this total liquid water is partitioned into surface runoff surface water storage and infiltration the determination of surface runoff q over is

7308,quantitative understanding of controls on thaw layer thickness tlt dynamics in the arctic peninsula is essential for predictive understanding of permafrost degradation feedbacks to global warming and hydrobiochemical processes this study jointly interprets electrical resistivity tomography ert measurements and hydro thermal numerical simulation results to assess spatiotemporal variations of tlt and to determine its controlling factors in barrow alaska time lapse ert measurements along a 35 m transect were autonomously collected from 2013 to 2015 and inverted to obtain soil electrical resistivity based on several probe based tlt measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds associated with the boundary between the thaw layer and permafrost using a grid search optimization algorithm then we used the obtained thresholds to derive the tlt from all soil electrical resistivity images the spatiotemporal analysis of the ert derived tlt shows that the tlt at high centered polygons hcps is smaller than that at low centered polygons lcps and that both thawing and freezing occur earlier at the hcps compared to the lcps in order to provide a physical explanation for dynamics in the thaw layer we performed 1 d hydro thermal simulations using the community land model clm simulation results showed that air temperature and precipitation jointly govern the temporal variations of tlt while the topsoil organic content soc and polygon morphology are responsible for its spatial variations when the topsoil soc and its thickness increase tlt decreases meanwhile at lcps a thicker snow layer and saturated soil contribute to a thicker tlt and extend the time needed for tlt to freeze and thaw this research highlights the importance of combination of measurements and numerical modeling to improve our understanding spatiotemporal variations and key controls of tlt in cold regions keywords electrical resistivity

techniques provide the relatively accurate measurements of tlt they are labor intensive and often do not provide dense spatiotemporal information several noninvasive geophysical techniques have demonstrated utility for tlt estimation for example arcone et al 1998 hinkel et al 2001 jørgensen and andreasen 2007 and léger et al 2017 employed ground penetrating radar gpr to characterize the thaw layer schaefer et al 2015 used interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar to estimate the thaw depth at barrow you et al 2013 employed electrical resistivity tomography ert ground temperature monitoring frost table probing and coring to detect the permafrost depth hubbard et al 2013 combined lidar data with multiple geophysical ert gpr electromagnetic and point measurements to characterize the thaw layer and permafrost variability over a large area however the time span of most of these studies were limited taking place from few measurements to one growing season there is a lack of data tracking the spatiotemporal variations of tlt over the course of a year or many years there have been only few studies that cover several years for example hilbich et al 2008 used ert and temperature observations in seven years to explore the long term and short term variations of the freezing thawing process in alpine permafrost and its links to the atmospheric temperature dafflon et al 2017 used one year multiple datasets obtained from autonomous above and below ground measurements including ert to monitor the annual cycle of freezing thaw dynamics winter growing season freezing and its link to surface processes besides monitoring tlt identifying the factors that control tlt dynamics is important as well hubbard et al 2013 found that tlt co varied with several parameters including vegetation soil physical properties soil water content polygon morphology and seasonal temperature hinzman et al 1991 and tran et al 2017 identified soil organic carbon soc as a main factor that governs the hydro thermal and thaw layer dynamics in the alaskan arctic nelson et al 1998 stated that topography via near surface hydrology is closely linked to the variations of tlt wright et al 2009 reported that the spatial pattern of tlt strongly correlates with the soil moisture distribution and found that its temporal variations are influenced by air temperature and precipitation hinkel and nelson 2003 analyzed data collected at seven circumpolar active layer monitoring calm sites in northern alaska during the 1995 2000 period and found that the annual maximum thaw depth is controlled by air temperature meanwhile its spatial variations depend on vegetation substrate properties snow cover and soil surface topography blok et al 2010 observed that the shrub expansion in the arctic region may increase soil temperature and tlt mcclymont et al 2013 showed that soil temperature in winter in the peat plateau is considerably lower than that in the bog dafflon et al 2017 showed that subsurface soil moisture and thaw depth in the arctic tundra exhibit a strong correlation with the vegetation greenness using numerical simulations nicolsky et al 2007 showed that inclusion of surface soc in the land surface model could improve the tlt estimation in a study at barrow alaska atchley et al 2016 performed a sensitivity analysis and found that tlt is the most sensitive to top organic layer thickness and snow depth but relatively insensitive to water saturation the above studies indicate the need to simultaneously investigate the spatiotemporal variations of tlt and identify the factors that control these variations in permafrost regions our study addressed this requirement using the following model data integration approach we first estimated tlt variations in time and space using time lapse subsurface electrical resistivity images which were obtained by inversion of ert measurements in an ice wedge polygon dominated tundra in barrow alaska secondly we used the probe based tlt measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity to determine the electrical resistivity thresholds that separate the thaw layer from the permafrost layer using the grid search optimization algorithm then these thresholds were used to derive tlt from soil electrical resistivity images over a period from 2013 to 2015 next we analyzed the annual and multiannual variations of the soil electrical resistivity and tlt finally we performed numerical hydro thermal simulations to explore tlt dynamics and to investigate the factors that govern these dynamics including soil properties morphology and atmospheric forcing compared to previous studies this study advances the knowledge of how to use long term measurements to provide a more comprehensive picture of the spatiotemporal variability of tlt and its controlling factors in addition the joint interpretation of measurements and numerical modeling provides new insights and decreased uncertainty about the controls of tlt dynamics 2 description of study site and data availability our study site is associated with the department of energy s next generation ecosystem experiment ngee arctic project and is situated at the barrow environmental observatory in alaska fig 1 the ngee site is characterized by ice wedge polygons which include low centered polygon lcp flat centered polygon fcp and high centered polygon hcp morphologic features hubbard et al 2013 the polygon morphology largely controls the spatial distribution of snow thickness wainwright et al 2017 and tlt e g gangodagamage et al 2014 in the summer season while the centers of the lcps are usually fully filled with water the hcps are relatively dry and unsaturated sedges grasses mosses and dwarf shrubs are main vegetation types at this site the mean annual air temperature is around 12 c and that in summer june to august is 3 3 c the annual precipitation is 173 mm in which summer rain contributes up to 42 liljedahl et al 2011 thawing occurs during the growing season from june to october and the maximum tlt ranges from 25 to 65 cm shiklomanov et al 2010 we established a 35 m intensive transect at this site which traverses a hcp a fcp and a lcp an above and below ground autonomous measurement system which included ert and other measurements was installed fig 1 probe based tlt snow depth tdr and gpr data were also occasionally manually acquired soil samples were collected during the summer of 2014 at the thaw layer of five locations along the transect in this study we utilized the time lapse ert probe based tlt data and physical soil properties estimated from the soil samples the ert data were acquired along the transect using wenner schlumberger configuration with a 0 5 m electrode spacing the time lapse ert measurements were autonomously acquired daily over a long time period from 08 15 2013 to 07 07 2016 however because the last measurements in 2016 were collected at the beginning of the summer season we only used data from 2013 to 2015 for our spatiotemporal analysis details of the acquisition were provided by dafflon et al 2017 the time lapse images of soil electrical resistivity along the transect were obtained by inversion of ert measurements using the boundless electrical resistivity tomography bert model developed by rücker et al 2006 the unstructured mesh was internally generated by bert and kept the same for all the inversions the grid cell size which is controlled by the model increases from the surface to the bottom layer in this study we set the maximum area of a grid cell at 0 5 m2 the maximum cell width at the surface layer was set at 25 of the electrode spacing 0 5 m for inversion we used both electrical resistance and phase data contained in ert measurements with a relative measurement error of 5 the probe based tlt data were measured at all locations of ert electrodes 71 locations on seven days during the 2013 2016 period fig 2 based on these measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity images collected on the nearest days we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds that separate the thaw layer and permafrost layer at each electrode location as described in section 3 2 then these thresholds were used to specify tlt from all electrical resistivity images in the period from 08 15 2013 to 12 31 2015 for evaluating the impact of soil properties on tlt soil cores of top 0 3 m of the thaw layer were collected at five locations along the ert transect in summer 2014 using a plastic tube pushed down to various depths and then excavated in this study we defined the soc content as the volumetric fraction of soc in soc mineral mixture without pores as in the community land model clm table 1 indicates that there is a sharp change in both soil porosity and soc content between depths of 0 075 and 0 15 m at all locations for example at the lcp soc location of x 29 m see fig 1 the porosity reduces from 95 to 82 and the soc content reduces from 94 to 51 as for the horizontal variations the most notable difference in the soil properties is observed at x 3 m along the transect and refer later as the hcp mineral location both soil porosity and soc content at this location are significantly smaller than those at the other locations for example the porosity and soc content of the top 0 075 m at the hcp mineral location are respectively 78 and 68 while at the other locations the porosity is greater than 86 and the soc content is greater than 94 based on various investigations at the ngee site the high mineral content at the hcp mineral location is likely linked to the presence of a type of non sorted circle that has limited expression at the surface at several locations over the site but mostly in the hcp there is not much difference in soil properties among the hcp fcp and lcp the top 0 075 m at all of the other locations are approximately identical the spatial variations of soil porosity at depths of 0 15 0 21 and 0 26 m are significant with the porosity ranging from 51 to 82 and the soc content ranging from 16 to 51 it is worth noting that there is another definition of soc content which is the percentage of the soc in total volume of bulk soil shown at the bottom row of table 1 table 1 shows that when the soc content in soil material increases the soil porosity increases and therefore the soc content in bulk soil decreases 3 spatial and temporal analysis of electrical resistivity and thaw layer thickness 3 1 spatial and temporal analysis of soil electrical resistivity data fig 3 presents the estimated soil electrical resistivity images at specific times over the period from may to november 2014 the figure indicates that vertical variations in electrical resistivity at the end of winter and beginning of summer 05 02 2014 and 06 15 2014 are related to the presence of a shallow frozen active layer and upper permafrost high resistivity located over a saline permafrost layer lower resistivity the latter documented by dafflon et al 2016 during this spring and early summer period there is not much difference in the vertical resistivity distribution between lcp fcp and hcps however when thawing occurs there is a thaw layer with low resistivity above the permafrost and saline permafrost we observed that this layer remained relatively conductive until the beginning of winter in the horizontal direction fig 3 shows that tlt at the lcp is larger and remains unfrozen longer than that at the hcp for example on 11 16 2016 while there is no thaw layer at the hcp there is still a shallow thaw layer at the lcp to enable detailed analysis of temporal variations of soil electrical resistivity and its link to soil liquid content in the growing season we transformed the electrical resistivity to the temporally normalized value δ as below 1 δ tj ρ tj ρ j ρ j ρ tj ρ j 1 in which subscripts t and j denote the measurement at time instant t and bert grid cell j ρ represents the soil electrical resistivity ρ j 1 m t 1 m ρ tj is the temporal mean of electrical resistivity at grid cell j m is the number of ert measurements over the considered period 08 15 2013 12 31 2015 the advantage of this normalization is that it removes variability due to soil physical characteristics which do not change with time and highlights changes due to freeze state and moisture content for example if the relationship between water liquid and soil electrical conductivity follows archie s formula ρ ϕ m s l n σ w ϕ m 1 σ s 1 archie 1942 the temporally normalized resistivity at a certain bert grid cell is formulated as 2 δ s l n σ w ϕ m 1 σ s s l n σ w ϕ m 1 σ s 1 s l n s l n 1 in which s l n is the liquid saturation s l n is the temporal mean of s l n ϕ is the soil porosity σ w and σ s are respectively the water conductivity and soil surface conductance and m and n are the cement and saturation exponential coefficients eq 2 illustrates that the temporal normalization removes the effect of temporally constant terms assuming soil porosity and soil surface conductance do not vary significantly and highlight the temporal variations of soil liquid water the temporal variations of the temporally normalized resistivity in the 3 month period august to november in 2013 and 5 month period from june to november in 2014 and 2015 are compared in fig 4 there were no data in june and july of the year 2013 in general the soil depth with low resistivity gradually increases from june to reach a maximum in september or october compared to 2014 thawing in 2015 occurs earlier for example while most of the normalized resistivity on 06 15 2014 is lower than zero at the hcp thawing occurs at almost the whole transect on 06 15 2015 in addition of the three years the normalized resistivity from june to october is lowest in 2014 however the lowest normalized resistivity in november is observed in 2013 these results imply that the air temperature in the summer of 2015 was highest but coldest in the winter see fig 9 while the winter of 2013 is warmest this fact will be clarified in the later section where numerical simulations are performed to physically explain the spatiotemporal variations of soil electrical resistivity 3 2 estimation of thaw layer thickness from electrical resistivity data in this section we combined the probe based tlt measurements along the study transect 7 datasets and co located soil electrical resistivity from the ert images to determine the resistivity threshold for separating the thaw layer and permafrost the reason we used this approach is that the number of probe based tlt measurements is sparse and insufficient to perform the spatiotemporal analysis of tlt meanwhile ert measurements collected from 2013 to 2015 are plentiful in space and time as a result if tlt can be derived from ert measurements we can explore the spatiotemporal variations of tlt with high spatiotemporal resolution over the duration of the ert autonomous acquisition period due to the lateral heterogeneity of polygon morphology and soil characteristics a common electrical resistivity threshold for the whole transect is not feasible consequently an individual threshold was defined at each ert electrode location where the probed based tlt measurements were available 71 locations the threshold was estimated by minimizing the objective function which represents the misfit between the probed based and ert derived tlt and is defined as below 3 φ ρ threshold j t 1 n alt meas j t alt ert j t 2 in which φ is the objective function alt meas j t and alt ert j t respectively are the measured and ert derived tlt at time t and location j n 7 is the number of probed based tlt measurements at location j the grid search algorithm was employed to determine the resistivity threshold at each location j the grid search algorithm simply divides the parameter search space into grid nodes and calculates the objective function at each node the optimal solution is found at the node where the objective function is minimal for constraining the inversion we assumed that the maximum tlt is 0 7 m the electrical resistivity threshold that generates a tlt greater than this value will not be considered fig 5 a compares the probed based and ert derived tlt at a 1 1 scale this is the best agreement between two terms that we can obtain by grid search algorithm the correlation between them is 0 65 compared to measurements tlt derived from soil electrical resistivity is overestimated with a bias ratio of 1 11 the differences between the two tlt values is likely mainly due to the ert and probed based tlt measurement errors bert inversion errors and differences in measurement time of ert and probed based tlt the estimated electrical resistivity thresholds show large spatial variations ranging from 130 to 774 ohm m along the transect fig 5b in order to compare these spatial variations with that of the soil electrical resistivity we plotted the average electrical resistivity at the top 0 3 m on 09 22 2014 as an illustration the figure shows that the spatial variations of the resistivity threshold are similar to those of the electrical resistivity in the topsoil the comparison between the resistivity threshold and surface elevation also shows that there is a positive correlation between the resistivity threshold and the surface elevation this can be explained by the fact that soil tends to be drier at higher elevations and therefore the soil electrical resistivity is also larger for example the threshold is pronounced high at the location x 6 m of the hcp because it is situated at the higher elevation than the other locations along the transect 3 3 spatial and temporal variations of thaw layer thickness based on the electrical resistivity thresholds determined in the previous section we estimated tlt along the intensive transect from the soil electrical resistivity images fig 6 presents tlt versus time and space for the three years 2013 2014 and 2015 as for the spatial variations of tlt the figure indicates that while there is not much difference in tlt between the hcp and fcp tlt at the lcp is significantly larger than that at the hcp and fcp except for the hcp location x 1 6 m tlt is also different within each polygon type especially at the hcp tlt at the hcp location x 1 6 m is larger than that at the hcp location x 6 10 m for example while tlt in 2015 at x 1 6 m is up to 0 69 m that at x 6 10 m is 0 5 m in the section 4 2 below we will prove that while the difference in tlt among the polygon types is caused primarily by the topography morphology the difference within each polygon is controlled by the soil properties as for the temporal variations fig 6 also shows that freezing occurs later at the lcp than at the hcp and fcp at the end of growing season tlt at the lcp is considerably thicker than the fcp and hcp for example on 10 31 2013 the average tlt at the lcp is around 0 44 m it is 0 and 0 05 m at the hcp and fcp respectively thawing at the hcp and fcp also occurs earlier than that at the lcp but the difference is relatively small among these polygon types through comparing tlt over the three years of measurements we found that the onset of thawing and freezing was different in different years for example thawing began much earlier in 2015 06 24 2015 than in 2014 07 05 2014 because air temperature in early summer of 2015 is higher than that in 2014 due to thicker snow depth freezing in 2013 occurred later than in 2015 which is especially visible at the lcp while there was no thaw layer on 10 31 2015 tlt on that date was relatively high in 2013 0 44 m these relationships between the thaw freeze onset and meteorological forcing will be subsequently described section 4 4 below 4 numerical simulation 4 1 surface subsurface hydro thermal model in this section we physically explain the above spatiotemporal variations of electrical resistivity and tlt as well as the factors controlling these variations using numerical simulations we performed 1 d hydro thermal simulations in a soil column using clm model clm can simulate hydro thermal processes from bedrock to the top of canopy with consideration of different land surface processes e g evapotranspiration radiation balance snow melting accumulation and the phase transition of water from liquid to ice and vice versa soil heat conduction in the subsurface is modeled by the diffusion equation while soil liquid water dynamics is modeled by richard s equation richards 1931 with influences of runoff evaporation canopy transpiration root water uptake and groundwater recharge evaporation and transpiration are separately calculated for the soil surface and vegetation using the monin obukhov similarity theory melting or freezing occurs when temperature in snow soil greater or lower than the water freezing temperature 273 15 k the rate of phase change is determined by the energy excess for melting or deficit for freezing that needs to change soil snow temperature to the water freezing temperature for more information about this model we refer to oleson et al 2013 in clm soil hydro thermal parameters i e soil thermal conductivity heat capacity saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention curve are calculated from soil types sand clay and soil organic content formulas for these relationships are presented in details in lawrence and slater 2008 as for vegetation clm allows assignment of 17 plant functional types pfts with the predefined leaf area index lai stem area index sai and plant top and bottom heights in this study we selected the c3 arctic grass plant type we developed a soil column including 32 soil layers in which hydrological simulation was performed at 27 topsoil layers and thermal simulation was performed at all 32 layers the total thickness of 27 topsoil layers was 2 4 m and that of 5 bottom layers was 3 1 m we performed clm simulations over the period from 01 01 2013 to 12 31 2015 the model was run during a spin up period from 01 01 1996 to 12 31 2012 to generate realistic initial conditions for our simulations meteorological input data for clm includes atmospheric temperature pressure precipitation wind speed and downward solar and longwave radiation these data in the 1996 2013 period were obtained from the ngee database xu and yuan 2014 for the 2013 2015 period we obtained precipitation data from barrow airport station the other data were taken from the noaa barrow station http www esrl noaa gov gmd obop brw clm can provide multiple outputs such as soil temperature and soil liquid ice content at different depths runoff surface water depth snow depth evaporation transpiration infiltration and groundwater recharge etc tlts are determined as the largest soil depth where soil temperature is greater than or equal to the water freezing temperature we performed four synthetic cases to evaluate the influence of topsoil properties soc content and soil porosity using cases hcp lowsoc toplayer hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer and polygon morphology using cases hcp thinsoc toplayer and lcp thinsoc toplayer on the tlt table 2 these four cases represent the four typical conditions in term of polygon morphology and soil properties of the lcp and hcp 4 2 effect of soc on the spatiotemporal dynamics of thaw layer thickness in this section we explore the impacts of soil porosity and volumetric soc content on the hydro thermal dynamics and tlt variations these impacts were evaluated by comparing the clm simulation results of three synthetic cases namely hcp lowsoc toplayer hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer table 2 and fig 7 a the model parameters of these three cases are identical except for the layer thickness soil porosity and soc content of the top layer the hcp lowsoc toplayer case mimics the soil properties at the hcp mineral location x 3 m see table 1 with a porosity of 0 78 and a soc content of 68 at 0 0 125 m depth and 0 38 and 19 at 0 125 0 6 m depth the hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer cases represent the soil properties at the hcp organic location x 8 m but with different thicknesses of the top layer to evaluate the effect of the soc layer thickness on tlt the top layer thickness is 0 075 m for the hcp thinsoc toplayer case and 0 125 m for the hcp thicksoc toplayer case which are the upper and lower limits of the soc thickness observed in the ert transect for both cases this top layer has a porosity of 0 92 and a soc content of 96 fig 7d clearly indicates that when the soc content at the topsoil layer increases tlt decreases tlt also decreases when the thickness of topsoil soc content increases similarly the soil temperature in the hcp lowsoc toplayer case is higher than that at the hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer cases fig 7c however soil liquid water saturation in the hcp lowsoc toplayer case is smaller fig 7b this is reasonable because when the soc content is higher the soil heat capacity increases and the soil thermal conductivity decreases lawrence and slater 2008 this causes the summer variations in the atmospheric temperature to propagate more slowly to the deep layers as a result the soil temperature is higher and tlt is thicker in hcp lowsoc toplayer case in addition because the organic material holds water better than mineral the water saturation in the hcp thinsoc toplayer and hcp thicksoc toplayer cases is higher than that in the hcp lowsoc toplayer case it is worth noting that there are several abrupt changes in tlts during the 2013 2014 period it is because tlts are very sensitive to the change of soil temperature as a result a small change in soil temperature can cause significant variations of tlts these abrupt variations appear in 2013 2014 because compared to 2015 air temperature in these years varies in a larger range fig 7d 4 3 effect of polygon morphology on spatiotemporal variations of thaw layer thickness in this section we investigated the impact of polygon morphology on tlt variability by comparing the simulation results of hcp thinsoc toplayer and lcp thinsoc toplayer cases the lcp thinsoc toplayer case mimics the lcp soc location at x 29 m table 2 although there are differences in the soil porosity and soc content the most profound difference between the two cases is the polygon morphology due to the effect of polygon morphology while a large portion of water from precipitation or and snowmelt contributes to runoff at the hcp runoff is much smaller at the lcp in clm the total liquid water at the soil surface is partitioned into surface runoff surface water storage and infiltration appendix a the surface runoff is calculated by the saturation excess mechanism i e surface runoff appears only at the saturated parts of soil surface runoff is controlled by parameter f max eq 2 of appendix which is the maximum fraction of soil surface that can be saturated and ranges from 0 to 1 runoff is potentially larger for a higher f max the surface water storage represents the wetlands and sub grid scale water body e g pond as shown in the appendix a the depth of the surface water storage increases when the topographic slope β decreases the decreasing topography slope also causes the smaller lateral drainage of groundwater in this study the effect of polygon morphology on the hydro thermal dynamics was accounted by assigning f max 1 β π 3 for the hcp thinsoc toplayer case and f max 0 2 β 0 02 for the lcp thinsoc toplayer case in addition at the beginning of the simulation period 01 01 1996 the soil porosity at the lcp was fully filled by liquid water and ice while ice and liquid water content at the shallow surface of the hcp 0 4 m was equal to 20 of the porosity below this depth the soil porosity was also fully saturated fig 8 e shows that the tlt at the hcp is shallower than that at the lcp which is suitable with the observations derived from ert measurements the hcp was only relatively wet when melting occurs and then became drier because a large part of liquid water flowed down to its surrounding lower locations the surface water body appears at the beginning of snowmelt period and rapidly disappears fig 8a by contrast because runoff was relatively small soil at the lcp was fully saturated and the surface water storage still exists fig 8a and c snow depth at the lcp is also higher than at the hcp fig 8b it is because at the beginning of winter when first snow falls it may transform to liquid due to the fact that soil surface temperature is still greater than 0 c at the hcp soil is unsaturated and slope is high so this liquid mainly partitions into runoff and infiltration meanwhile this liquid remains at the surface of the lcp because soil at the lcp is totally saturated and its slope is low when soil temperature is equal or below 0 c surface water is transformed to ice the thicker snow layer keeps soil at the lcp warmer during the winter and costs less heat to melt when summer comes which makes a deeper thaw depth within the soil layer the ice liquid water content impacts the freezing thawing in two opposite ways higher ice liquid water content at the lcp leads to the higher soil thermal conductivity which helps to move more heat from the top to lower layers for thawing by contrast higher ice content requires more heat to thaw it as a result the competition between these two processes will influence the tlt variations it is worth noting that in this study we did not consider the difference in vegetation characteristics between the hcp and lcp lichens which primarily cover the hcp have a higher albedo than graminoid which mainly cover the lcp therefore inclusion of this spatial variability of vegetation may more increase the difference in tlt between the hcp and lcp in addition because clm is a 1 d model the influence of the subsurface lateral flow was not accounted for in this study we also only concentrated on the hydro thermal dynamics in the active layer and shallow permafrost top 2 4 m the dynamics of the saline permafrost layer that is partially unfrozen was not considered fig 8e also shows that both thawing and freezing at the hcp occurs earlier than at the lcp this can be explained by the fact that the thicker snow layer in winter and the thicker water surface layer in summer at the lcp caused soil at the lcp respond more slowly to the variations of atmospheric temperature in addition more ice liquid water content at the hcp also takes a longer time to melt 4 4 effect of meteorological forcing on temporal dynamics of hydro thermal variables and tlt to explore controls on tlt temporal variations we present in fig 9 the measured meteorological forcing data air temperature yearly accumulated snow precipitation and rainfall as well as simulated snow thickness and simulated soil temperature at depths of 0 02 0 13 and 0 5 m during the 2013 2015 period for the lcp thinsoc toplayer case for comparison soil temperature at a depth of 0 5 m is also presented in order to evaluate the agreement between modeling and simulation of soil temperature we employed the nash sutcliffe coefficient e 4 e 1 t 1 t m t o t 2 t 1 t o t o 2 in which m t and o t are respectively the simulated and measured soil temperature at time t o is the average of measured soil temperature over the measurement period t the nash sutcliffe coefficient varies from to 1 the accuracy of model prediction increases when this coefficient approaches 1 fig 9a shows that the agreement between the clm simulations and measurements of soil temperature is relatively good with a nash sutcliffe coefficient of 0 86 clm accurately predicts the soil temperature in summer time of all three years however the simulated soil temperature is remarkably lower than the measured value at the beginning of winter these may come from the fact that the soil freezing temperature at the site is lower than the freshwater freezing temperature due to its salinity while its variations with soil salinity were not accounted for in clm fig 9c indicates that the simulated tlt is slightly smaller than the ert derived tlt and well agrees with probe measurements this difference may be caused by the overestimation of ert measurements see fig 5a in addition in this study we did not try to calibrate the clm model but used the measured soil properties to directly parameterize the model as a result the errors in model prediction may be caused by uncertainties in some model parameters such as soil porosity soc content and topographic factors because tlt is very sensitive to the freezing temperature a small error in soil temperature around the water freezing temperature can cause a significant change in tlt as for the temporal variation fig 9 indicates that the annual variations in atmospheric temperature at 2 m above the soil surface and precipitation both snow and rainfall are the primary controls on the temporal variations of tlt indeed comparing to 2014 the atmospheric temperature in summer 2013 and summer 2015 were relatively high fig 9a the maximum air temperature for 2013 2014 and 2015 is respectively 11 6 10 6 and 12 1 c and the average temperature in the summer from june 15 to september 15 of these three years is 3 8 3 1 and 3 8 c as a result the soil temperature in 2013 and 2015 was slightly higher the time span that tlt exists in 2013 and 2015 is also longer than that in 2014 comparison of tlt in two years 2013 and 2015 indicates that the time span that tlt remains at its maximum depth 0 6 m in 2013 was shorter than that in 2015 although air temperature in the two years was similar we interpret this difference to be due to the presence of a thick snow layer which was caused by large precipitation in the 2014 2015 winter the snow layer kept the soil warmer and therefore was more susceptible to thaw as for the freezing time the high precipitation and high air temperature in the 2013 led to the latest freeze onset out of the three years by contrast freezing occurred earlier in 2014 due to low air temperature and in 2015 due to thin snow depth 5 conclusion this study analyzes the spatiotemporal dynamics of the electrical resistivity and tlt along a 35 m intensive transect in barrow ak by jointly using ert measurements and through performing physically based modeling simulations the spatiotemporally dense ert measurements allowed investigation of the annual variations of electrical resistivity and tlt as well as their comparisons in different years and seasons by combining measurements and numerical simulations our research provides a valuable approach to confidently interpret the spatiotemporal variations of tlt the numerical simulation supports our ert based interpretation of tlt spatial variability and dynamics while the measurements enhanced the reliability of the numerical modeling providing validations of simulation results and insights about sources of errors based on the probe based tlt measurements and co located soil electrical resistivity images obtained by inversion of ert data we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds along the intensive transect that separated the thaw layer from permafrost the electrical resistivity thresholds were estimated by minimizing the misfit between point tlt measurements and those obtained from ert using the grid search algorithm using these thresholds we then derived tlt from electrical resistivity images in the 2013 2015 period we subsequently analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of both soil electrical resistivity and ert derived tlt the spatial analysis indicates that within each polygon feature tlt at locations with high soc content is thinner than locations with low soc content values compared to the lcp the hcp is drier and has a shallower thaw layer the freezing occurred earlier at the hcp than at the lcp the temporal analysis shows that of three years 2013 2014 and 2015 tlt in 2014 is smallest using this approach we were able to determine tlt with a high spatiotemporal resolution over a long period this in turn allowed to investigate the tlt dynamics in detail which had not been possible in previous studies however uncertainties of tlt values obtained by this approach were not quantitatively considered in this study the main uncertainty sources include measurement errors of ert and thaw probe ert inversion uncertainties and resistivity threshold uncertainties our on going study will individually quantify each of these uncertainties and their contribution to the uncertainties of ert derived tlts the numerical simulations were performed to identify the factors that control the spatiotemporal variations of tlt and electrical resistivity we investigated the influence of soil properties polygon morphology and meteorological forcing on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the soil electrical resistivity and tlt the results show that the spatial variations of tlt within each polygon feature are due to the soil porosity and soc content at the locations with a higher soc content and correlated soil porosity the soil thermal diffusivity is lower and therefore the heat flux from the top to lower layers in the summer is smaller as a result tlt at these locations is shallower meanwhile the difference in tlt among the polygon features hcp fcp and lcp strongly depends on polygon morphology at the lcp the snow layer is thicker due to the phase transition of surface water to ice and the entrapment of snow the isolation effect of this thicker snow layer causes the thawing and freezing at the lcp occur later than those in the hcp and makes the maximum tlt larger at the lcp the temporal variations of tlt are strongly controlled by the atmospheric temperature and precipitation tlt in 2014 is thinnest because the atmospheric temperature in summer of this year is low due to thick snow layer which was caused by large precipitation the freezing in 2013 occurred later than the other two years tlt in 2015 was largest due to the fact that the summer temperature was high and the snow in the 2014 2015 winter was thick our conclusion about the role of soc content is similar to atchley et al 2016 who investigated the individual impact of soc liquid water saturation surface water in summer and snow depth in winter however because snow depth surface water liquid water saturation in barrow are closely related and controlled by polygon morphology we evaluated the impact of polygon morphology on snow depth surface water and liquid saturation and their overall contribution to tlt rather than assessing each of these topography controlled factors individually as per atchley et al 2016 by comparing tlt derived from probe and ert measurements and clm simulation results we found that the clm model estimated the spatiotemporal variations of tlt well and could be used to identify the factors controlling these variations however there are still some limitations of this model first the freezing temperature is fixed in clm so that it cannot account for the impact of soil salinity on freezing thawing secondly clm only considers the diffusive heat transport and ignores the advective heat transport as a result the heat exchange between the top and lower layers simulated in the model is smaller than the reality especially at the hcp where soil water dynamics is stronger than at the lcp thirdly the subsurface lateral flows of heat and water were not simulated in clm which may influence the evaluation of topography effect finally the dynamics of heat and liquid water in the saline permafrost layer were not considered in this study due to lack of information of soil properties at this layer this study demonstrates that combination of the above and below ground measurements with the numerical modeling can help us to better understand the tlt dynamics and controls on their spatial and temporal variations it provides important knowledge about the relationship between tlt and polygon morphology soil properties and atmospheric forcing for upscaling from local scale with intensive dense measurements to larger scales which is crucial for assessing the permafrost feedbacks to global warming acknowledgements the next generation ecosystem experiments ngee arctic project is supported by the office of biological and environmental research

stan wullschleger ornl for support and thomas günther for providing the bert codes appendix a 1 saturation excess runoff in clm the total liquid water at the soil surface q liq 0 is the sum of rainfall arriving at soil surface and snowmelt water this total liquid water is partitioned into surface runoff surface water storage and infiltration the determination of surface runoff q over is based on the saturation excess mechanism i e the runoff occurs at the saturated parts of soil and is calculated as below 5 q over f sat q liq 0 where q liq 0 is calculated as the sum of the precipitation liquid arriving the soil surface and water liquid from snowmelt f sat denotes the saturated fraction which is calculated as 6 f sat f max e 0 5 f over z in which f max ranging from 0 to 1 is the maximum saturated fraction f over is a decay factor m 1 z is the water table depth in this study the center of the lcp has a lower elevation compared to surrounding locations incoming water from precipitation or and snowmelt will fill this center pond before generating runoff in order to simulate this phenomenon we set fmax at a small value fmax 0 2 to keep water at the surface of the center of lcp 2 surface water storage clm also considers the water that stays in the depression of the soil surface surface water storage the relationship between surface water mass and surface water

7309,in this study reference evapotranspiration et0 forecasting models are developed for the least economically developed regions subject to meteorological data scarcity firstly the partial mutual information pmi capable of capturing the linear and nonlinear dependence is investigated regarding its utility to identify relevant predictors and exclude those that are redundant through the comparison with partial linear correlation an efficient input selection technique is crucial for decreasing model data requirements then the interconnection between global climate indices and regional et0 is identified relevant climatic indices are introduced as additional predictors to comprise information regarding et0 which ought to be provided by meteorological data unavailable the case study in the jing river and beiluo river basins china reveals that pmi outperforms the partial linear correlation in excluding the redundant information favouring the yield of smaller predictor sets the teleconnection analysis identifies the correlation between nino 1 2 and regional et0 indicating influences of enso events on the evapotranspiration process in the study area furthermore introducing nino 1 2 as predictors helps to yield more accurate et0 forecasts a model performance comparison also shows that non linear stochastic models svr or rf with input selection through pmi do not always outperform linear models mlr with inputs screen by linear correlation however the former can offer quite comparable performance depending on smaller predictor sets therefore efforts such as screening model inputs through pmi and incorporating global climatic indices interconnected with et0 can benefit the development of et0 forecasting models suitable for data scarce regions keywords evapotranspiration partial mutual information climatic indices teleconnection 1 introduction evapotranspiration is a crucial component in the hydrological cycle simultaneously transferring water from land oceans and plants to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration tabari et al 2013 estimating the reference evapotranspiration et0 is essential for engineering applications like the irrigation scheduling as well as scientific research like the hydrological modelling the fao 56 penman monteith fao pm equation allen et al 1998 is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao to be a standard model for estimating et0 benefiting from a solid physical foundation the fao pm equation with related adjustments can be used as a good estimator jato espino et al 2016 its main drawback however lies in its relatively high data requirement which limits its application in many regions especially in the least economically developed countries where sufficient meteorological stations and reliable observations are often unavailable droogers and allen 2002 therefore it is of important significance to develop alternative models with lower data burden and computationally suitable for forecasting et0 in data scarce regions the aforementioned limitation of the fao pm equation has led researchers to turn to numerous empirical models with reduced data requirements empirical models mainly include temperature based hargreaves blaney criddle and thornthwaite equations and radiation based priestley taylor makkink and jensen haise equations some of which the fao pm equation evolved from as no universal consensus has been achieved on their global applicability additional parameter estimation is an indispensable step in applying empirical models to different climatic conditions droogers and allen 2002 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 the other category of alternative models manages to capture the mapping relationship between selected inputs and et0 by means of statistical methods or artificial intelligence approaches covering from multiple linear regression autoregressive moving average and support vector regression jato espino et al 2016 psilovikos and elhag 2013 tabari et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 to various neural networks and evolutionary algorithms falamarzi et al 2014 shiri et al 2014 traore et al 2016 fang et al 2017 for all these models identifying the optimal input is a fundamental task and is a necessity to reduce the model data requirements the conventional solution is to test several input combinations comprising only a portion of the meteorological variables available and then derive the optimal input set according to predetermined evaluation criteria parasuraman et al 2007 partal 2016 traore et al 2016 though a computationally efficient searching strategy examining a fraction of all possible combinations instead of an exhaustive search still leaves doubt as to whether there are some combinations with lower data requirements outperforming the optimal input set selected the other strategy for screening model inputs is based on calculating the linear correlation coefficient which statistically quantifies the linear dependence between each meteorological variable and et0 jain et al 2008 kişi 2006 meteorological variables with strong linear correlation with et0 are included in the model input set this strategy however is argued to likely select redundant inputs that provide the same amount of information regarding et0 afterward the partial linear correlation is introduced to further eliminate the redundant information from the input set mallikarjuna et al 2012 on the other hand evapotranspiration is universally considered a nonlinear process dependent on interacting climatological variables as a result the nonlinear dynamics of the evapotranspiration process may not be well captured by only examining the linear correlation to this end entropy and mutual information mi two important notions in information theory are introduced to quantify more general both linear and nonlinear dependence entropy is known to be a measure of uncertainty for given variables and it is through the notion of entropy that mi is derived quilty et al 2016 mi also termed transinformation is defined as the information content of one variable that is also contained by another variable and is formulated as the difference between total entropy of the two random variables and their joint entropy ahmadi et al 2009 yang et al 2000 ahmadi et al 2009 and nourani et al 2015 have applied these two information content based criteria namely entropy and mi to input selection for solar radiation estimation and rainfall runoff modelling respectively evaluating entropy and mi makes it possible for input selection to consider both linear and nonlinear dependence between input candidates and model output however as in the case of selecting input through the linear correlation coefficient there is a disadvantage when using entropy and mi to screen meaningful inputs this is an input strongly correlated with the model output might provide redundant information that has been explained by previously selected inputs to overcome this shortcoming sharma 2000 proposed partial mutual information pmi for evaluating the additional mutual information attained by adding a potential input to the model input set in this study the utility of the partial mutual information to identify relevant predictors for et0 is investigated and is compared with that of the partial linear correlation the past two decades have witnessed an increasing number of studies on the interconnections between hydrological variables and global climate patterns at multiple timescales for precipitation streamflow and groundwater levels numerous research has identified their delayed response to variability in climatic indices such as the north atlantic oscillation nao southern oscillation index soi and pacific north american pattern pna cai et al 2010 coleman and budikova 2013 tremblay et al 2011 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2006 revealed the strong influence of el niño southern oscillation enso events on regional precipitation in the yellow river basin china which resulted in a 51 decrease in runoff to the sea zhang et al 2007 reported the spatially changing in phase or anti phase interconnection between enso and the annual maximum streamflow from the upper to the lower yangtze river basin china it was found by xu et al 2007 that approximately 20 of 481 gauging stations in china showed a significant correlation between precipitation and soi and a more negative correlation than positive was observed such interconnections have been exploited by forecast practices involving these hydrological variables successfully fan et al 2015 schepen et al 2012 yang et al 2017 with respect to et0 meza 2005 found that et0 variation in the maipo river basin chile was influenced by phases of enso concluding that during the winter and spring there was up to a 30 difference in et0 between the el niño and la niña years sabziparvar et al 2011 analysed the et0 soi interconnection at 13 meteorological station sites in iran at most of the studied sites winter and spring enso events influenced the et0 values of the following summer and autumn spatially more significant impacts of enso forcing on et0 variability were observed at warm arid sites than at humid sites tabari et al 2014 examined the et0 nao interconnection during winter at 41 iranian meteorological stations the results disclosed the negative correlation between winter et0 and noa index and a negative phase of nao led to a 3 increase in et0 values relative to those during a positive phase in spite of studies reporting the apparent interconnection between regional et0 and global climate patterns little attention has been paid to incorporating influential climatic indices into et0 forecasting practices therefore this study employs global climatic indices as additional potential inputs of forecasting models to analyse their correlation with et0 in the study area and investigate their role in yielding a higher forecasting accuracy the merit lies in that these climatic indices can be easily acquired from related research institutions and do not increase the data collection burden and they can be universally applied to regions with meteorological data scarcity this study aims to 1 investigate the utility of partial mutual information to identify meaningful predictors for et0 through a comparison with the partial linear correlation which merely measures the linear dependence 2 recognize the interconnection between global climate indices and regional et0 and 3 recommend the optimal et0 forecasting models having both favourable performance and lower data requirements for regions subject to data scarcity an appropriate input variable selection ivs technique benefits models through effectively decreasing the data requirements in addition introducing climatic indices may favour the explanation of variability in et0 which ought to be interpreted by the missing meteorological variables therefore the study could have important implications for developing et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed countries 2 model developments 2 1 an overview of et0 forecasting models the procedure for developing et0 forecasting models is organized into four parts which are depicted in fig 1 2 1 1 input candidate pools scenario 1 is utilized to compare the utility of the partial mutual information and partial linear correlation to screen predictors for et0 under scenario 1 the input candidate pool comprises all local meteorological variables characterizing variations in air temperature air pressure precipitation humidity solar radiation and wind speed it is a prevailing means of composing the input candidate pool and has been used in many previous studies chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 kumar et al 2002 tabari et al 2012 scenario 2 further comprises global climatic indices in addition to the meteorological variables of scenario 1 and can provide a comparison with scenario 1 for investigating the effectiveness of climatic indices in enhancing model performance scenario 3 is used for developing et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed regions with consideration of the meteorological data scarcity in many such regions the input candidate pool under the latter scenario only includes routinely measured meteorological variables air temperature and sunshine duration which are available at nearly all meteorological stations global climatic indices are further introduced as potential model inputs to make up the information regarding et0 which ought to be provided by meteorological variables unavailable such as the humidity wind speed and solar radiation 2 1 2 input identification variables relevant to et0 are identified from the candidate pool by means of partial correlation based or partial mutual information based ivs methods which can measure the linear or nonlinear dependence between random variables then the relevant variables selected constitute the predictor set for the predictand et0 2 1 3 fitting process predictors of et0 serve as inputs of the fitting methods adopted including multiple linear regression support vector regression and random forecast three methods compete to capture the mapping relationship between predictors and the predictand in linear or nonlinear manners 2 1 4 post analysis performance of et0 forecasting models combining different ivs methods and fitting methods is quantified according to evaluation criteria then the optimal model is recommended that has both favourable forecasting skills and low data requirements to predict et0 in data scarce regions 2 2 input variable selection techniques ivs is the fundamental consideration during the development of accurate and cost effective statistical models whose task is to identify the fewest input variables required to interpret the behaviour of model output may et al 2011 fewest implies that both irrelevant and redundant variables need to be excluded from the resulting predictor set in this study the partial correlation and partial mutual information based ivs techniques are adopted 2 2 1 partial correlation based input selection pcis the pearson correlation coefficient measuring the linear dependence between two random variables is defined as follows 1 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y and x are a predictand and a potential input variable respectively xi yi represents the i th bivariate sample and n denotes the sample size in an extensively used ivs algorithm pearson correlation coefficients between the predictand and each potential input variable are calculated and arranged in a descending order afterwards a forward selection is performed in which potential input variables whose correlation coefficients rank the top k or significantly differ from zero are selected as relevant variables or predictors of the predictand obviously the pearson correlation coefficient based ivs algorithm follows the screening criterion of maximum relevance however without considering the redundancy between selected predictors redundancy means that two or more predictors can provide the same amount of information regarding the predictand as a result the predictor identification based on pearson correlation coefficients ignoring the other crucial filtering criterion the minimum redundancy tends to choose some redundant predictors from the input candidate pool to further exclude redundant variables this algorithm is modified by replacing the pearson correlation coefficient with the partial correlation the partial correlation coefficient quantifies the additional dependence between each input candidate and the predictand y that cannot be accounted for by the predictors having been selected sharma 2000 in detail if the first predictor z 1 is identified the partial correlation between y and each potential input x in the candidate pool is expressed as follows 2 r xy z 1 r xy r xz 1 r yz 1 1 r xz 1 2 1 r yz 1 2 if the second predictor z 2 is subsequently identified the partial correlation conditional on two predictors selected z 1 and z 2 is computed as de la fuente et al 2004 follows 3 r xy z 1 z 2 r xy z 1 r xz 2 z 1 r yz 2 z 1 1 r xz 2 z 1 2 1 r yz 2 z 1 2 similarly a higher order partial correlation coefficient can be calculated as more predictors are progressively screened out in the partial correlation based input variable selection pcis algorithm the modified correlation measurement and the forward selection guarantee the effective implementation of the minimum redundancy maximum relevance mrmr criterion the selection process will terminate if the maximum partial correlation regarding the remaining potential input variables no longer significantly differs from zero at the 95 confidence level 2 2 2 partial mutual information based input selection pmis the pcis algorithm despite having been used extensively is criticized for its fundamental assumption of a linearly structured dependence between predictors and predictands within the system to be modelled as well as its sensitivity to the noise carried by samples may et al 2008 as a crucial component in the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration is a highly complicated and nonlinear process driven by interacting climatological factors such as precipitation temperature and wind speed kim and kim 2008 kumar et al 2002 therefore a pcis algorithm capable of evaluating linear dependence in the system studied may not be suitable for addressing the nonlinear relationships of the evapotranspiration process an alternative to the pcis algorithm is the partial mutual information based input variable selection pmis algorithm without an assumption of the dependence structure it provides an emerging approach for detecting both linear and nonlinear dependence in a multivariate system based on mutual information mi rooted in the information theory fraser and swinney 1986 mi between the predictand y and a potential input variable x is given as follows 4 i xy p x y x y log p x y x y p x x p y y dxdy where px x and py y signify marginal probability density functions pdfs of x and y respectively and px y x y denotes the joint pdf ixy is often interpreted as the reduction in the uncertainty regarding y owing to the observation of x evidently no dependence between x and y will lead to an ixy equal to 0 and a higher ixy value shows a stronger correlation between two random variables in a practical context ixy is estimated using a set of bivariate samples as follows 5 i xy 1 n i 1 n log f x y x i y i f x x i f y y i where xi yi is the i th sample point n represents the sample size fx x and fy y and fx y x y denote the estimation of the corresponding marginal and joint pdfs respectively estimating the marginal and joint pdfs can be performed using either a crude histogram or a kernel density estimator kde here owing to its favourable accuracy and robustness the latter coupled with the gaussian kernel is employed to derive the following estimation of pdf 6 f u u 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d 2 λ d det s 1 2 exp u u i t s 1 u u i 2 λ 2 where f u u is the multivariate pdf estimation of d dimensional variable set u s denotes the sample covariance matrix of u det symbolizes the determinant operation and λ represents the kernel bandwidth that largely determines the estimation accuracy of pdf and is empirically recommended by sharma 2000 as eq 7 7 λ 4 d 2 1 d 4 n 1 d 4 as in the case of the pearson correlation coefficient the forward selection scheme choosing the top k values of mi between the predictand and each potential input variable serves as an effective means of excluding irrelevant variables but it is likely to include those that are redundant hence there is a need to introduce the partial mutual information pmi analogous to the partial relation it quantifies how much remaining uncertainty regarding y that has not yet been explained by the selected predictors can be further interpreted by the observation of x pmi between x and y conditional on a predictor set z with m members is formulated as follows 8 i xy z p x y x y log p x y x y p x x p y y d x d y where x and y represent the residual information contained in variables x and y which cannot be accounted for by z sample based estimation of pmi is expressed as follows 9 i xy z 1 n i 1 n log f x y x i y i f x x i f y y i where f x x f y y and f x y x y are marginal and joint pdfs that can be estimated by following eq 6 respectively and n is the number of samples 10a f x x 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d 2 λ d det s x x 1 2 exp x x i s x x 1 x x i 2 λ 2 10b f y y 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d 2 λ d det s y y 1 2 exp y y i s y y 1 y y i 2 λ 2 10c f x y x y 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d 2 λ d det s x y 1 2 exp x x i y y i t s x y 1 x x i y y i 2 λ 2 10d x i x i e x z i y i y i e y z i in which e denotes the expectation operation the conditional expectation e x z is the mean of the conditional pdf p x z x z p x z x z p z z therefore it can be estimated via the kde according to eq 11 as follows 11a e x z 1 n i 1 n ω i x i z z i t s zz 1 s xz 11b ω i exp z z i t s zz 1 z z i 2 λ 2 j 1 n exp z z j t s zz 1 z z j 2 λ 2 where sxz signifies the cross covariance of x and z and szz denotes the covariance of z e y z can be obtained in a similar manner in this study the predictor identification process based on the pims algorithm adopts akaike information criterion aic as the termination criterion and is detailed as follows a construct an input candidate pool c based on prior knowledge regarding the system to be modelled initialize a null set x to place selected predictors assume x and the predictand to be the system input and output respectively b to identify the first predictor calculate the mi between the predictand and each potential input by following eqs 5 7 add that with the maximum mi score to the predictor set x and remove it from the candidate pool c c use a general regression neural network grnn to fit the relationship between the model input x and output calculate the aic of the system and mark it by aic x d as for recognizing more predictors follow eqs 9 11 to evaluate the pmi between the predictand and each remaining input candidate in c e identify the input candidate cj having the maximum pmi score assume x cj to be the new predictor set use grnn to fit the relationship between the predictand and x cj calculate the corresponding aic aic x c j if aic x c j is smaller than aic x add cj to the predictor set x and remove it from the candidate pool c f repeat steps c e once aic x c j becomes larger than aic x the input selection is terminated note that the termination criterion aic can provide a tradeoff between the goodness of fit and the model complexity and is formulated as follows 12 aic n log e 1 n i 1 n u i 2 2 p where n denotes the number of samples ui represents the model output residual resulting from the regression of et0 on the predictor set x through grnn and p is the vapnik chernovenkis vc dimension characterizing the model complexity 2 3 fitting techniques three fitting techniques multiple linear regression support vector regression and random forest compete to capture the mapping relationship between et0 and the screened predictor set such efforts aim at reducing the model uncertainties arising from selecting appropriate fitting techniques 2 3 1 multiple linear regression assume that the predictor set x of the predictand y is composed of k variables i e x 1 xk multiple linear regression mlr approximates the input output relationship of a multivariable system in the following manner grégoire 2014 13 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β k x k ε where β β 1 β k are coefficients to be estimated ɛ is the noise with the mean equal to zero and unknown variance usually the core task estimating coefficients β is accomplished using the least square method chatterjee and hadi 1986 2 3 2 support vector regression svr support vector regression svr first maps the predictor set into a higher dimensional feature space where the predictand can be linearly described and then subtly converts the linear expression in the feature space back to the original predictor space with the help of a mercer kernel the linear relationship in the higher feature space can be formulated as follows 14 f x w φ x b where w and b are the weight vector and offset coefficient respectively represents the dot product and φ is the transformation function used for mapping x from the original predictor space into the a higher feature space w and b are estimated by minimizing the regression risk expressed as eq 15 15 r svr 1 2 w 2 r emp where w 2 measures the flatness of the regression model which indicates the model complexity and remp is the empirical risk usually the regression risk is minimized by addressing it with a convex optimization important details regarding the algorithm can be found in chang and lin 2011 cortes and vapnik 1995 and smola and schölkopf 2004 finally the derived linear equation in the higher feature space is converted to a nonlinear form in the original predictor space by the kernel function k commonly used kernel functions include linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf types in this study the rbf kernel presented in eq 16 is adopted 16 k x x i exp γ x x i 2 where γ denotes the kernel width the performance of svr is largely dependent on appropriately selecting the parameter combination of c γ and ɛ therefore there is a need to carefully tune these parameters 2 3 3 random forest rf in 2001 breiman 2001 developed the random forest rf for the purpose of enhancing the performance of classification and regression trees carts and reducing the risk of overfitting hereafter the rf has been widely applied to streamflow and electricity price forecasting mei et al 2014 yang et al 2017 as well as land cover and gene classification díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 gislason et al 2006 in the regression analysis the rf is an ensemble of regression trees and the algorithm is detailed as follows liaw and wiener 2002 a draw a bootstrap sample from the training set b grow an unpruned regression tree to fit the bootstrap sample at each node select m variables from all predictors randomly pick the best split among the selected m variables to divide the node into two child nodes the best split is defined as the one capable of minimizing the mean square error recursively repeat the split process until the predetermined termination criterion such as the minimum members in child nodes or the maximum tree size is met c repeat steps a and b and aggregate b trees as an rf d produce the final prediction by averaging the outputs of all the trees the performance of rf is sensitive to the selection of the maximum number of variables used to grow a regression tree m and the number of regression trees b in the forest therefore these two parameters need to be carefully tuned 2 4 model calibration as previously stated there are several parameters largely governing the performance of the fitting methods the model calibration aims at searching for the optimal combination of these parameters for svr and rf the calibration mechanism adopted by this study combines a two stage calibration strategy and the well known shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 1992 firstly to prevent the model from overfitting the calibration period is divided into a calibration subperiod and a test subperiod svr or rf with each parameter combination candidate is trained by samples in the calibration subperiod note that the calibrated models are evaluated in the test subperiod prior to being directly applied to the validation period the fitness of each parameter combination is characterized by the smaller value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients during the calibration and test subperiods which is given by eq 17 17 fitness min nse cal nse tes then the sce ua algorithm is responsible for evolutionally and iteratively generating a number of parameter combination candidates within a predetermined parameter space eventually the parameter combination with the maximum fitness is identified to be the optimal for svr or rf previous model calibration is accustomed to determining fitness of parameter combinations only based on model performance during the calibration period however the two stage calibration strategy provides a more conservative but safer alternative which could effectively restrain the overfitting risk and therefore benefit models in maintaining consistent in sample and out of sample performance 2 5 evaluation criteria the goodness of fit of et0 forecasting models is evaluated by three statistical measures namely nse percent bias pbias and rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr nse is computed using eq 18 as follows 18 nse 1 i 1 n e i obs e i fore 2 i 1 n e i obs e obs 2 where e i obs and e i fore denote the i th observed and forecasted values of et0 respectively e obs represents the mean of the observed et0 and n is the total number of observations nse varies from negative infinity to 1 with 1 suggesting a perfect match between forecasts and observations and a value less than 0 indicating that e obs outperforms e i fore in providing the better prediction the pbias shown in eq 19 measures the average tendency of the forecasted et0 relative to observations a positive or negative value of pbias indicates the overestimation or underestimation bias a pbias nearer to zero corresponds to a more accurate prediction 19 pbias i 1 n e i obs e i fore 100 i 1 n e i obs rmse is a statistic used extensively in evaluating model performance in rsr rmse is standardized by the standard deviation of observations the merit of applying rsr is that singh et al 2005 have proposed a guideline to quantify which rmse is eligible to be identified at a low level based on a comparison with the standard deviation of observations as follows 20 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n e i obs e i fore 2 i 1 n e i obs e obs 2 in addition the hit rate and the fraction of the predictions within a factor of two of the observations fac2 are also calculated for the validation period they are formulated as follows tominaga et al 2015 21 hit rate 1 n i 1 n i i in which i i 1 if e i fore e i obs e i fore 0 25 0 else 22 fac2 1 n i 1 n i i in which i i 1 if 1 2 e i fore e i obs 2 0 else 3 study area and data two basins namely the jing river basin jrb and the beiluo river basin brb in china were taken as a case study 3 1 overview of the jing river and beiluo river the jing river and beiluo river which are depicted in fig 2 are second order tributaries of the yellow river china huang et al 2014 the jing river flows 455 km from its headwaters in the ningxia hui autonomous region draining an area of 45 400 km2 the mean annual discharge of the jing river is 1 832 billion m3 the beiluo river with a main channel length of 680 km is the longest river in shaanxi province annually approximately 0 997 billion m3 of runoff flows within its drainage area estimated to be 26 900 km2 the two rivers mainly travel across the loess plateau which is known as one of china s most ecologically fragile regions having suffered from severe soil erosion and desertification for centuries li et al 2017 over 350 million tons of highly erodible loess are annually delivered from surface runoff to the yellow river the jrb and brb have a continental monsoonal climate featuring intensive precipitation and high temperatures during the summer and rare precipitation and low temperatures during the winter liu et al 2017 annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration are approximately 550 mm and 1100 mm in the jrb respectively they are 520 mm and 1100 mm in the brb respectively the reference evapotranspiration is much higher than precipitation in both basins and may be largely attributed to the sparse vegetative cover as a result of extensive human interventions such as deforestation over cultivation and over grazing 3 2 data collection monthly meteorological data gauged at 13 meteorological stations situated within or adjacent to the jrb and brb are retrieved from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx these data covering a period from 1966 to 2010 have observations of 12 variables including the mean temperature t mean of daily maximum temperature t max mean of daily minimum temperature t min extreme high temperature text extreme low temperature text sunshine duration sh percentage of sunshine sp mean relative humidity rh mean wind speed u precipitation p mean vapor pressure vp and mean air pressure ap observations obtained at one station site are not competent to describe meteorological conditions of the whole basin therefore the weight regarding each meteorological station is computed using the thiessen polygon method and then area weighted observations of corresponding meteorological variables were yielded for the two studied basins the jrb and brb as is indicated in fig 3 observations of the 12 meteorological variables during the current month constitute the input candidate pool in scenario 1 in addition to local meteorological information the 24 global climatic indices listed in table 1 are also employed to analyse whether they can contribute to a more accurate prediction of et0 selected climatic indices are mainly associated with oceanic and atmospheric phenomena such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and many teleconnection patterns their monthly values from 1965 to 2010 were retrieved from the earth system research laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list as has been noted in subsection 2 1 both the 12 meteorological variables and the 24 climatic indices are employed under scenario 2 as potential model inputs under scenario 3 the 24 climatic indices and routinely measured meteorological variables air temperature and sunshine duration available at nearly all meteorological stations are both introduced into the input candidate pool particularly potential input variables related to the 24 climatic indices cover their monthly observations at the current time step and those lagging from 1 month to 12 months due to the consideration of the propagation speed and transport paths of water vapor on a global scale input candidate pools under scenarios 2 and 3 are depicted in fig 3 as for the modelling target the reference evapotranspiration is calculated using the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 as follows 23 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 in which δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve rn represents the net radiation reaching the crop surface g denotes the soil heat flux density γ signifies the psychrometric constant t represents the average air temperature at 2 m height u 2 represents the wind speed at 2 m and es and ea represent the saturation and actual vapor pressure respectively the preparation of all the data needed for the et0 calculation follows the procedure presented in chapter 3 of the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 4 results analysis and discussion under scenario 1 the utility of pmis to identify the relevant predictors for et0 and eliminate the redundant predictors is investigated through a comparison with pcis under scenario 2 whether global climatic indices contribute to a more accurate et0 forecast is investigated et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed regions subject to data scarcity are eventually recommended under scenario 3 4 1 scenario 1 et0 forecasting based on local meteorological information monthly data employed for the development of models cover a time period from 1966 to 2010 according to the model calibration mechanism formulated in subsection 2 4 the dataset is divided into two parts the first part 1966 2001 accounting for 80 of the whole studied period is used for model calibration and the second part 2002 2010 comprising the remaining 20 is used for validation purposes subsequently the calibration period is further split into a calibration subperiod 1966 1993 and a test subperiod 1994 2001 to effectively prevent models from overfitting the other key issue in the model development involves initializing the parameter space for the fitting techniques as for svr three parameters to be tuned namely c γ and ɛ are set to vary from 2 10 2 10 and 2 8 to 210 210 and 2 1 respectively with respect to rf the maximum number of input variables used to grow regression trees is set to equal the total number of employed predictors on the basis of findings regarding rf presented by yang et al 2016 the number of regression trees is set at 100 this dataset division and parameter configuration are adopted by all three scenarios as shown in fig 3 the input candidate pool in scenario 1 comprises observations of 12 meteorological variables at the current time step table 2 presents the predictor set screened by pcis from the input candidate pool for the jrb the predictors are listed in the sequence in which they have been chosen the first selected predictor is tmax t which has the largest pearson correlation coefficient 0 932 among the 12 potential inputs the corresponding p value is far less than 0 05 indicating that the positive linear correlation between tmax t and et0 is significant at the 95 confidence level then the linear dependence of et0 on the remaining potential inputs that cannot be accounted for by tmax t is quantified by calculating the partial correlation rht is found to own the maximum absolute value of partial correlation 0 682 among the remaining 11 potential inputs and therefore is chosen to be the second predictor unlike tmax t rht is negatively related to et0 subsequently tt with a partial correlation value of 0 408 is considered to reveal the most amount of additional dependence regarding et0 compared with the other nine potential inputs as a result tt joins the predictor set as the third member followed by tmin t sht spt vpt text t being progressively selected in a similar manner potential inputs not included into the predictor set are those with partial correlation values not significantly different form zero at the 95 confidence level by measuring the linear dependence between meteorological variables and et0 pcis identifies a total of eight predictors for et0 in the jbr table 2 presents the predictor set screened by pmis for jrb predictors are also ranked in the sequence in which they were selected in pmis the pmi between each of the potential inputs and et0 is calculated conditional on predictors having been selected tmax t has the highest pmi score of 1 144 among the 12 potential inputs and is identified as the first predictor the inclusion of rht whose pmi score of 0 435 exceeds its 10 counterparts in the predictor set yields a decreasing aic value from 705 to 972 therefore it is selected to be the second predictor a downward trend in aic is maintained when tt having the highest pmi score 0 292 relative to the other nine potential inputs is included similarly tmin t sht spt text t are progressively identified as predictors until the aic value starts to increase by measuring both linear and nonlinear dependence between meteorological variables and et0 pmis chooses seven predictors for et0 in the brb it is noticeable that pcis and pmis select the same first six predictors indicating that their strong correlation with et0 has been captured using the two ivs methods the only difference is that pmis excluding vpt yields a smaller predictor set relative to pcis the utility of the predictor sets obtained by pcis and pmis for the jrb is examined by fitting their relationship with et0 over the calibration period 1966 2001 and then testing it over the calibration period 2002 2010 three fitting methods namely mlr svr and rf are employed to reduce the model uncertainties arising from the appropriate selection of fitting techniques table 3 presents the performance evaluation of et0 forecasting models combining diverse ivs techniques and fitting techniques a predictor set consisting of all 12 potential inputs is denoted by m12 and the corresponding models are used as benchmarks for comparison purposes for all models the consistent performance during the calibration test and validation periods suggests that the overfitting risk has been addressed well in the jrb it was observed that for a given predictor set svr invariably outperforms the other fitting methods in terms of two out of the three evaluation statistics namely nse and rsr while mlr yields a better pbias than that of svr and rf as a result svr performs better against its two counterparts in capturing the relationship between predictors and et0 in the jrb with respect to different predictor sets the m12 svr model presents the best performance with nse pbis and rsr equal to 0 997 1 407 and 0 058 respectively however quite comparable performance was found in the pcis svr and pmis svr models signifying that both pcis and pmis are effective means to select relevant variables for et0 in jrb with lower data requirements the pcis svr and pmis svr models provide more economical alternatives compared with the m12 svr model in addition the pmis svr model with a smaller predictor set achieved nearly the same model performance as the pcis svr model also suggesting that pcis identifies a redundant predictor vpt in the brb pcis as shown in table 4 selects as many as 11 predictors to interpret the variability of et0 the first predictor chosen is tmax t with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 926 rht is found to have the maximum absolute value of partial correlation 0 697 among the remaining 11 potential inputs and is selected to be the second predictor subsequently tt sht spt tmin t vpt ut text t pt text t whose partial correlation values are significantly different from zero at the 95 confidence level are identified compared with that of pcis pmis yields a smaller predictor set composed of nine components by measuring both linear and nonlinear dependence table 4 shows that tmax t has the highest pmi score of 1 099 among all 12 potential inputs and is the first to enter the predictor set then rht is selected to be the second predictor owing to its highest pmi score of 0 458 compared with the other 10 potential inputs and a decreased aic value from 667 to 956 a descending trend in aic value continues to be observed as tt tmin t ut sht spt text t text t are included in the predictor set it is noted that all predictors obtained through pmis are also identified by pcis meanwhile excluding vpt and pt results in pmis yielding a smaller predictor set than that of pcis the utility of predictor sets obtained using the two ivs techniques for the brb is examined as listed in table 5 the consistent performance during the calibration test and validation periods indicates that all models have been prevented from overfitting for a given predictor set svr presents the best nse and rsr among the three fitting methods mlr is observed to have better pbias than that of both svr and rf therefore svr is more capable of capturing the relationship between et0 and its predictors in the brb with regard to different predictor sets the m12 svr model employing all 12 potential inputs yields the best performance however fairly comparable performance is presented by the pcis svr and pmis svr models with their equivalent nse values of 0 995 pbis values of 2 956 and 2 764 and rsr values of 0 069 and 0 070 suggesting that pcis and pmis can serve as effective approaches for identifying variables relevant to et0 in the brb decreased data requirements together with a similar performance make the pcis svr and pmis svr models more economical alternatives to the m12 svr model in addition the pmis svr model using a smaller predictor set achieves nearly the same performance as the pcis svr model it is suggested that pcis includes two redundant predictors ut and pt the results under scenario 1 reveal that pcis and pmis are capable of identifying meaningful predictors for et0 in the jrb and brb from numerous meteorological variables available thus they are in favour of deriving foresting models with lower data requirements additionally pcis tends to include some redundant predictors however pmis effectively excludes the redundant information by simultaneously measuring linear and nonlinear dependence it should be noted that though et0 can be predicted quite well at the basin scale with numerous meteorological variables alone models developed under scenario 1 are not suitable for regions where usually there are not adequate observations of meteorological variables available 4 2 scenario 2 et0 forecasting based on meteorological information and climatic indices compared with scenario 1 scenario 2 further includes 24 climatic indices as potential inputs so as to investigate their correlation to et0 and whether they can contribute to more accurate forecasts in the jrb pcis identifies as many as 32 meteorological variables and climatic indices as predictors for et0 among which the first nine are listed in table 6 pmis yields a much smaller predictor set containing eight members in the brb a total of 28 input variables are selected by pcis to explain the variability of et0 while 11 predictors are selected through pmis as shown in table 7 note that nino 1 2 one of the eastern pacific sst indices used for characterizing enso events is identified by both pmis and pcis to be predictors and ranks higher in the predictor set implying that et0 in the jrb and brb may be strongly correlated with enso events afterwards the utility of these predictor sets obtained are examined by the model performance as presented in tables 8 and 9 m12c24 denotes a predictor set composed of all potential inputs under scenario 1 and 24 climatic indices for the jrb a comparison between tables 3 and 8 shows a general improvement in model performance due to the further inclusion of relevant climatic indices in predictor sets similar performance enhancement is also observed in tables 5 and 9 for the brb results under scenario 2 are a reminder that climatic indices are likely to carry additional information regarding et0 and introducing those that are relevant through the appropriate ivs techniques can favour the yield of more accurate et0 forecasts 4 3 scenario 3 et0 forecasting models recommended for data scarce regions under scenario 3 et0 forecasting models are developed for data scarce regions only routinely measured meteorological variables such as air temperatures tt tmax t tmin t text t and text t and sunshine duration sht are employed in comparison with other meteorological variables such as solar radiation vapor pressure relative humidity and wind speed measuring air temperature and solar duration requires quite simple instruments which supports the global availability of these observations meanwhile 24 climatic indices are introduced into the input candidate pool potential inputs related to climatic indices cover their monthly values at the current time step and those lagging from 1 month to 12 months therefore there are in total 318 potential inputs under scenario 3 in the jrb pmis identifies seven predictors as listed in table 10 to interpret the variability of et0 in detail the predictor set screened by pmis comprises all meteorological variables except text t and nino 1 2 with lag lengths of two and six months nino 1 2 is utilized to characterize the evolution of enso events as these predictors progressively join in the predictor set a decreasing trend in aic values is continuously observed compared with pmis pcis selects as many as 32 predictors among which the first nine predictors are listed in table 10 the other 23 are climatic indices of different lag months similar to pmis pcis is found to choose all meteorological variables except text t predictors related to nino 1 2 are ranked at higher positions in the predictor set indicating their strong correlation with et0 in the jrb however it is noted that pcis and pmis identify nino 1 2 with slightly different lag lengths subsequently the utility of predictor sets obtained by pcis and pmis for the jrb is examined for comparison purposes two predictor sets are adopted as benchmarks one denoted by t5 contains five temperature variables and for the other symbolized by t5s sunshine duration is further added the performances of the et0 forecasting models with the four predictor sets are presented in table 11 for t5 t5s and the predictor set acquired by pmis svr is generally found to outperform mlr and rf mlr offers the best performance compared with that of svr and rf when fitting the relationship between et0 and the predictor set obtained through pcis with respect to different predictor sets a comparison between the t5 svr and t5s svr models exhibits that adding the solar duration contributes to enhanced model performance more importantly introducing climatic indices into predictor sets favours yielding a distinct improvement in model performance relative to t5 and t5s which is intuitively shown by the more compact concentration of forecasts around their targets in fig 4 a comparison of two predictor sets containing both meteorological variables and climatic indices shows that the pmis svr model with seven predictors had superior performance compared with that of the pcis mlr model with as many as 32 predictors due to a 0 02 increase in nse value a 0 009 decrease in rsr value and a 0 009 increase in hit rate it is suggested that some redundant predictors are selected by pcis therefore with lower data requirements and superior performance the pmis svr model is recommended to forecast et0 in the jrb in the brb pmis identifies seven predictors as listed in table 12 including all temperature variables except text t and nino 1 2 with lag lengths of three and six months in comparison pcis yields a much larger predictor set containing 32 elements the first nine of these are listed in table 12 and show that nino 1 2 with the lag lengths of four and seven months are ranked at higher positions in the predictor set indicating their strong linear correlation with et0 in the brb it is noticeable that the nino 1 2 selected by pmis and pcis are of different time lags the utility of predictor sets obtained using the two ivs techniques are further evaluated by model performance as shown in table 13 for t5 t5s and the predictor set acquired through pmis svr invariably offers superior model performance compared with that of mlr and rf in terms of nse and rsr however the mapping relationship between the predictor set obtained by pcis and et0 in the brb is more accurately fitted by mlr with respect to different predictor sets the comparison between the t5 svr and t5s svr models exhibits an improved model performance due to the employment of solar duration as an additional predictor more importantly introducing climatic indices into predictor sets favours achieving a distinct improvement in model performance relative to t5 and t5s which is intuitively presented in fig 5 in detail compared with the t5s svr model the pmis svr model is observed to have a 0 012 increase in nse a 0 037 decrease in rsr and a 0 019 increase in hit rate the pcis mlr model offers a 0 019 increase in nse a decrease of 3 167 and 0 066 in the pbias and rsr respectively and a 0 009 increase in the hit rate under scenario 3 the similar performance of the pcis and pmis models suggests that pcis tends to include some redundant predictors meanwhile it is found that introducing climatic indices favours yielding a more accurate et0 forecast in terms of nse rsr and hit rate nino 1 2 one of the enso indices is selected by both pcis and pmis as a predictor and ranks higher in the predictor set revealing that the evapotranspiration process in the jrb and brb is strongly influenced by enso events compared with the predictors under scenario 1 those under scenario 3 are all routinely measured meteorological variables and climatic indices making the models developed under scenario 3 more suitable for forecasting et0 in the least economically developed regions as is shown in tables 11 and 13 the pmis svr models with seven predictors offer favourable forecasting skills and are therefore recommended for forecasting et0 in the jrb and brb 5 conclusions this study aimed to develop et0 forecasting models for the least economically developed regions subject to meteorological data scarcity mainly through 1 exploring appropriate input variable selection techniques to effectively reduce model data requirements and 2 introducing global climatic indices as additional model inputs for creating information regarding et0 which ought to be provided by meteorological variables unavailable first it was investigated whether pmis was capable of identifying relevant predictors and excluding those that were redundant a comparison was also made with pcis then the interconnection between global climatic indices and regional et0 was recognized by pmis and pcis and relevant climatic indices were incorporated into the models as additional predictors finally models with both lower data requirements and favourable performance were recommended et0 forecasting models were developed for two study areas namely the jrb and brb in china the results indicated that pmis and pcis were both effective approaches for identifying the relevant predictors for regional et0 however pcis only measuring the linear dependence tended to select redundant predictors pmis presented better performance in excluding redundant information by simultaneously evaluating the linear and nonlinear correlations therefore smaller predictor sets were yielded by pmis relative to pcis which is crucial for model development in data scarce regions furthermore nino 1 2 characterizing enso evolutions was identified by both pmis and pcis to be correlated with et0 revealing enso influences on the evapotranspiration process in the study areas introducing nino 1 2 into the models yielded more accurate et0 forecasts among the various models investigated the non linear stochastic models svr or rf with inputs selected through pmis did not always improve the accuracy of the linear models mlr with inputs screened by pcis however the pmis svr model was able to offer quite comparable performance depending on smaller predictor sets and was therefore recommended to predict et0 in the jrb and brb these findings suggest that selecting model inputs through pmis as well as introducing global climatic indices into input candidate pools favours developing et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed regions although pmis is proven to be a competitive alternative capable of identifying meaningful predictors for et0 previous studies on solar radiation estimation ahmadi et al 2009 remesan et al 2008 reyhani et al 2005 have shown the superiority of the gamma test gt over mi in selecting the best predictor set therefore future work could be carried out to investigate the applicability of gt in et0 estimation and a further comparison between gt and pmis could be made acknowledgments this study was joint funded by the national

7309,in this study reference evapotranspiration et0 forecasting models are developed for the least economically developed regions subject to meteorological data scarcity firstly the partial mutual information pmi capable of capturing the linear and nonlinear dependence is investigated regarding its utility to identify relevant predictors and exclude those that are redundant through the comparison with partial linear correlation an efficient input selection technique is crucial for decreasing model data requirements then the interconnection between global climate indices and regional et0 is identified relevant climatic indices are introduced as additional predictors to comprise information regarding et0 which ought to be provided by meteorological data unavailable the case study in the jing river and beiluo river basins china reveals that pmi outperforms the partial linear correlation in excluding the redundant information favouring the yield of smaller predictor sets the teleconnection analysis identifies the correlation between nino 1 2 and regional et0 indicating influences of enso events on the evapotranspiration process in the study area furthermore introducing nino 1 2 as predictors helps to yield more accurate et0 forecasts a model performance comparison also shows that non linear stochastic models svr or rf with input selection through pmi do not always outperform linear models mlr with inputs screen by linear correlation however the former can offer quite comparable performance depending on smaller predictor sets therefore efforts such as screening model inputs through pmi and incorporating global climatic indices interconnected with et0 can benefit the development of et0 forecasting models suitable for data scarce regions keywords evapotranspiration partial mutual information climatic indices teleconnection 1 introduction evapotranspiration is a crucial component in the hydrological cycle simultaneously transferring water from land oceans and plants to the atmosphere through evaporation and transpiration tabari et al 2013 estimating the reference evapotranspiration et0 is essential for engineering applications like the irrigation scheduling as well as scientific research like the hydrological modelling the fao 56 penman monteith fao pm equation allen et al 1998 is recommended by the food and agriculture organization fao to be a standard model for estimating et0 benefiting from a solid physical foundation the fao pm equation with related adjustments can be used as a good estimator jato espino et al 2016 its main drawback however lies in its relatively high data requirement which limits its application in many regions especially in the least economically developed countries where sufficient meteorological stations and reliable observations are often unavailable droogers and allen 2002 therefore it is of important significance to develop alternative models with lower data burden and computationally suitable for forecasting et0 in data scarce regions the aforementioned limitation of the fao pm equation has led researchers to turn to numerous empirical models with reduced data requirements empirical models mainly include temperature based hargreaves blaney criddle and thornthwaite equations and radiation based priestley taylor makkink and jensen haise equations some of which the fao pm equation evolved from as no universal consensus has been achieved on their global applicability additional parameter estimation is an indispensable step in applying empirical models to different climatic conditions droogers and allen 2002 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 the other category of alternative models manages to capture the mapping relationship between selected inputs and et0 by means of statistical methods or artificial intelligence approaches covering from multiple linear regression autoregressive moving average and support vector regression jato espino et al 2016 psilovikos and elhag 2013 tabari et al 2012 cheng et al 2016 to various neural networks and evolutionary algorithms falamarzi et al 2014 shiri et al 2014 traore et al 2016 fang et al 2017 for all these models identifying the optimal input is a fundamental task and is a necessity to reduce the model data requirements the conventional solution is to test several input combinations comprising only a portion of the meteorological variables available and then derive the optimal input set according to predetermined evaluation criteria parasuraman et al 2007 partal 2016 traore et al 2016 though a computationally efficient searching strategy examining a fraction of all possible combinations instead of an exhaustive search still leaves doubt as to whether there are some combinations with lower data requirements outperforming the optimal input set selected the other strategy for screening model inputs is based on calculating the linear correlation coefficient which statistically quantifies the linear dependence between each meteorological variable and et0 jain et al 2008 kişi 2006 meteorological variables with strong linear correlation with et0 are included in the model input set this strategy however is argued to likely select redundant inputs that provide the same amount of information regarding et0 afterward the partial linear correlation is introduced to further eliminate the redundant information from the input set mallikarjuna et al 2012 on the other hand evapotranspiration is universally considered a nonlinear process dependent on interacting climatological variables as a result the nonlinear dynamics of the evapotranspiration process may not be well captured by only examining the linear correlation to this end entropy and mutual information mi two important notions in information theory are introduced to quantify more general both linear and nonlinear dependence entropy is known to be a measure of uncertainty for given variables and it is through the notion of entropy that mi is derived quilty et al 2016 mi also termed transinformation is defined as the information content of one variable that is also contained by another variable and is formulated as the difference between total entropy of the two random variables and their joint entropy ahmadi et al 2009 yang et al 2000 ahmadi et al 2009 and nourani et al 2015 have applied these two information content based criteria namely entropy and mi to input selection for solar radiation estimation and rainfall runoff modelling respectively evaluating entropy and mi makes it possible for input selection to consider both linear and nonlinear dependence between input candidates and model output however as in the case of selecting input through the linear correlation coefficient there is a disadvantage when using entropy and mi to screen meaningful inputs this is an input strongly correlated with the model output might provide redundant information that has been explained by previously selected inputs to overcome this shortcoming sharma 2000 proposed partial mutual information pmi for evaluating the additional mutual information attained by adding a potential input to the model input set in this study the utility of the partial mutual information to identify relevant predictors for et0 is investigated and is compared with that of the partial linear correlation the past two decades have witnessed an increasing number of studies on the interconnections between hydrological variables and global climate patterns at multiple timescales for precipitation streamflow and groundwater levels numerous research has identified their delayed response to variability in climatic indices such as the north atlantic oscillation nao southern oscillation index soi and pacific north american pattern pna cai et al 2010 coleman and budikova 2013 tremblay et al 2011 huang et al 2018 liu et al 2018 wang et al 2006 revealed the strong influence of el niño southern oscillation enso events on regional precipitation in the yellow river basin china which resulted in a 51 decrease in runoff to the sea zhang et al 2007 reported the spatially changing in phase or anti phase interconnection between enso and the annual maximum streamflow from the upper to the lower yangtze river basin china it was found by xu et al 2007 that approximately 20 of 481 gauging stations in china showed a significant correlation between precipitation and soi and a more negative correlation than positive was observed such interconnections have been exploited by forecast practices involving these hydrological variables successfully fan et al 2015 schepen et al 2012 yang et al 2017 with respect to et0 meza 2005 found that et0 variation in the maipo river basin chile was influenced by phases of enso concluding that during the winter and spring there was up to a 30 difference in et0 between the el niño and la niña years sabziparvar et al 2011 analysed the et0 soi interconnection at 13 meteorological station sites in iran at most of the studied sites winter and spring enso events influenced the et0 values of the following summer and autumn spatially more significant impacts of enso forcing on et0 variability were observed at warm arid sites than at humid sites tabari et al 2014 examined the et0 nao interconnection during winter at 41 iranian meteorological stations the results disclosed the negative correlation between winter et0 and noa index and a negative phase of nao led to a 3 increase in et0 values relative to those during a positive phase in spite of studies reporting the apparent interconnection between regional et0 and global climate patterns little attention has been paid to incorporating influential climatic indices into et0 forecasting practices therefore this study employs global climatic indices as additional potential inputs of forecasting models to analyse their correlation with et0 in the study area and investigate their role in yielding a higher forecasting accuracy the merit lies in that these climatic indices can be easily acquired from related research institutions and do not increase the data collection burden and they can be universally applied to regions with meteorological data scarcity this study aims to 1 investigate the utility of partial mutual information to identify meaningful predictors for et0 through a comparison with the partial linear correlation which merely measures the linear dependence 2 recognize the interconnection between global climate indices and regional et0 and 3 recommend the optimal et0 forecasting models having both favourable performance and lower data requirements for regions subject to data scarcity an appropriate input variable selection ivs technique benefits models through effectively decreasing the data requirements in addition introducing climatic indices may favour the explanation of variability in et0 which ought to be interpreted by the missing meteorological variables therefore the study could have important implications for developing et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed countries 2 model developments 2 1 an overview of et0 forecasting models the procedure for developing et0 forecasting models is organized into four parts which are depicted in fig 1 2 1 1 input candidate pools scenario 1 is utilized to compare the utility of the partial mutual information and partial linear correlation to screen predictors for et0 under scenario 1 the input candidate pool comprises all local meteorological variables characterizing variations in air temperature air pressure precipitation humidity solar radiation and wind speed it is a prevailing means of composing the input candidate pool and has been used in many previous studies chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 kumar et al 2002 tabari et al 2012 scenario 2 further comprises global climatic indices in addition to the meteorological variables of scenario 1 and can provide a comparison with scenario 1 for investigating the effectiveness of climatic indices in enhancing model performance scenario 3 is used for developing et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed regions with consideration of the meteorological data scarcity in many such regions the input candidate pool under the latter scenario only includes routinely measured meteorological variables air temperature and sunshine duration which are available at nearly all meteorological stations global climatic indices are further introduced as potential model inputs to make up the information regarding et0 which ought to be provided by meteorological variables unavailable such as the humidity wind speed and solar radiation 2 1 2 input identification variables relevant to et0 are identified from the candidate pool by means of partial correlation based or partial mutual information based ivs methods which can measure the linear or nonlinear dependence between random variables then the relevant variables selected constitute the predictor set for the predictand et0 2 1 3 fitting process predictors of et0 serve as inputs of the fitting methods adopted including multiple linear regression support vector regression and random forecast three methods compete to capture the mapping relationship between predictors and the predictand in linear or nonlinear manners 2 1 4 post analysis performance of et0 forecasting models combining different ivs methods and fitting methods is quantified according to evaluation criteria then the optimal model is recommended that has both favourable forecasting skills and low data requirements to predict et0 in data scarce regions 2 2 input variable selection techniques ivs is the fundamental consideration during the development of accurate and cost effective statistical models whose task is to identify the fewest input variables required to interpret the behaviour of model output may et al 2011 fewest implies that both irrelevant and redundant variables need to be excluded from the resulting predictor set in this study the partial correlation and partial mutual information based ivs techniques are adopted 2 2 1 partial correlation based input selection pcis the pearson correlation coefficient measuring the linear dependence between two random variables is defined as follows 1 r xy i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y and x are a predictand and a potential input variable respectively xi yi represents the i th bivariate sample and n denotes the sample size in an extensively used ivs algorithm pearson correlation coefficients between the predictand and each potential input variable are calculated and arranged in a descending order afterwards a forward selection is performed in which potential input variables whose correlation coefficients rank the top k or significantly differ from zero are selected as relevant variables or predictors of the predictand obviously the pearson correlation coefficient based ivs algorithm follows the screening criterion of maximum relevance however without considering the redundancy between selected predictors redundancy means that two or more predictors can provide the same amount of information regarding the predictand as a result the predictor identification based on pearson correlation coefficients ignoring the other crucial filtering criterion the minimum redundancy tends to choose some redundant predictors from the input candidate pool to further exclude redundant variables this algorithm is modified by replacing the pearson correlation coefficient with the partial correlation the partial correlation coefficient quantifies the additional dependence between each input candidate and the predictand y that cannot be accounted for by the predictors having been selected sharma 2000 in detail if the first predictor z 1 is identified the partial correlation between y and each potential input x in the candidate pool is expressed as follows 2 r xy z 1 r xy r xz 1 r yz 1 1 r xz 1 2 1 r yz 1 2 if the second predictor z 2 is subsequently identified the partial correlation conditional on two predictors selected z 1 and z 2 is computed as de la fuente et al 2004 follows 3 r xy z 1 z 2 r xy z 1 r xz 2 z 1 r yz 2 z 1 1 r xz 2 z 1 2 1 r yz 2 z 1 2 similarly a higher order partial correlation coefficient can be calculated as more predictors are progressively screened out in the partial correlation based input variable selection pcis algorithm the modified correlation measurement and the forward selection guarantee the effective implementation of the minimum redundancy maximum relevance mrmr criterion the selection process will terminate if the maximum partial correlation regarding the remaining potential input variables no longer significantly differs from zero at the 95 confidence level 2 2 2 partial mutual information based input selection pmis the pcis algorithm despite having been used extensively is criticized for its fundamental assumption of a linearly structured dependence between predictors and predictands within the system to be modelled as well as its sensitivity to the noise carried by samples may et al 2008 as a crucial component in the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration is a highly complicated and nonlinear process driven by interacting climatological factors such as precipitation temperature and wind speed kim and kim 2008 kumar et al 2002 therefore a pcis algorithm capable of evaluating linear dependence in the system studied may not be suitable for addressing the nonlinear relationships of the evapotranspiration process an alternative to the pcis algorithm is the partial mutual information based input variable selection pmis algorithm without an assumption of the dependence structure it provides an emerging approach for detecting both linear and nonlinear dependence in a multivariate system based on mutual information mi rooted in the information theory fraser and swinney 1986 mi between the predictand y and a potential input variable x is given as follows 4 i xy p x y x y log p x y x y p x x p y y dxdy where px x and py y signify marginal probability density functions pdfs of x and y respectively and px y x y denotes the joint pdf ixy is often interpreted as the reduction in the uncertainty regarding y owing to the observation of x evidently no dependence between x and y will lead to an ixy equal to 0 and a higher ixy value shows a stronger correlation between two random variables in a practical context ixy is estimated using a set of bivariate samples as follows 5 i xy 1 n i 1 n log f x y x i y i f x x i f y y i where xi yi is the i th sample point n represents the sample size fx x and fy y and fx y x y denote the estimation of the corresponding marginal and joint pdfs respectively estimating the marginal and joint pdfs can be performed using either a crude histogram or a kernel density estimator kde here owing to its favourable accuracy and robustness the latter coupled with the gaussian kernel is employed to derive the following estimation of pdf 6 f u u 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d 2 λ d det s 1 2 exp u u i t s 1 u u i 2 λ 2 where f u u is the multivariate pdf estimation of d dimensional variable set u s denotes the sample covariance matrix of u det symbolizes the determinant operation and λ represents the kernel bandwidth that largely determines the estimation accuracy of pdf and is empirically recommended by sharma 2000 as eq 7 7 λ 4 d 2 1 d 4 n 1 d 4 as in the case of the pearson correlation coefficient the forward selection scheme choosing the top k values of mi between the predictand and each potential input variable serves as an effective means of excluding irrelevant variables but it is likely to include those that are redundant hence there is a need to introduce the partial mutual information pmi analogous to the partial relation it quantifies how much remaining uncertainty regarding y that has not yet been explained by the selected predictors can be further interpreted by the observation of x pmi between x and y conditional on a predictor set z with m members is formulated as follows 8 i xy z p x y x y log p x y x y p x x p y y d x d y where x and y represent the residual information contained in variables x and y which cannot be accounted for by z sample based estimation of pmi is expressed as follows 9 i xy z 1 n i 1 n log f x y x i y i f x x i f y y i where f x x f y y and f x y x y are marginal and joint pdfs that can be estimated by following eq 6 respectively and n is the number of samples 10a f x x 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d 2 λ d det s x x 1 2 exp x x i s x x 1 x x i 2 λ 2 10b f y y 1 n i 1 n 1 2 π d

the expectation operation the conditional expectation e x z is the mean of the conditional pdf p x z x z p x z x z p z z therefore it can be estimated via the kde according to eq 11 as follows 11a e x

of z e y z can be obtained in a similar manner in this study the predictor identification process based on the pims algorithm adopts akaike information criterion aic as the termination criterion and is detailed as follows a construct an input candidate pool c based on prior knowledge regarding the system to be modelled initialize a null set x to place selected predictors assume x and the predictand to be the system input and output respectively b to identify the first predictor calculate the mi between the predictand and each potential input by following eqs 5 7 add that with the maximum mi score to the predictor set x and remove it from the candidate pool c c use a general regression neural network grnn to fit the relationship between the model input x and output calculate the aic of the system and mark it by aic x d as for recognizing more predictors follow eqs 9 11 to evaluate the pmi between the predictand and each remaining input candidate in c e identify the input candidate cj having the maximum pmi score assume x cj to be the new predictor set use grnn to fit the relationship between the predictand and x cj calculate the corresponding aic aic x c j if aic x c j is smaller than aic x add cj to the predictor set x and remove it from the candidate pool c f repeat steps c e once aic x c j becomes larger than aic x the input selection is terminated note that the termination criterion aic can provide a tradeoff between the goodness of fit and the model complexity and is formulated as follows 12 aic n log e 1 n i 1 n u i 2 2 p where n denotes the number of samples ui represents the model output residual resulting from the regression of et0 on the predictor set x through grnn and p is the vapnik chernovenkis vc dimension characterizing the model complexity 2 3 fitting techniques three fitting techniques multiple linear regression support vector regression and random forest compete to capture the mapping relationship between et0 and the screened predictor set such efforts aim at reducing the model uncertainties arising from selecting appropriate fitting techniques 2 3 1 multiple linear regression assume that the predictor set x of the predictand y is composed of k variables i e x 1 xk multiple linear regression mlr approximates the input output relationship of a multivariable system in the following manner grégoire 2014 13 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β k x k ε where β β 1 β k are coefficients to be estimated ɛ is the noise with the mean equal to zero and unknown variance usually the core task estimating coefficients β is accomplished using the least square method chatterjee and hadi 1986 2 3 2 support vector regression svr support vector regression svr first maps the predictor set into a higher dimensional feature space where the predictand can be linearly described and then subtly converts the linear expression in the feature space back to the original predictor space with the help of a mercer kernel the linear relationship in the higher feature space can be formulated as follows 14 f x w φ x b where w and b are the weight vector and offset coefficient respectively represents the dot product and φ is the transformation function used for mapping x from the original predictor space into the a higher feature space w and b are estimated by minimizing the regression risk expressed as eq 15 15 r svr 1 2 w 2 r emp where w 2 measures the flatness of the regression model which indicates the model complexity and remp is the empirical risk usually the regression risk is minimized by addressing it with a convex optimization important details regarding the algorithm can be found in chang and lin 2011 cortes and vapnik 1995 and smola and schölkopf 2004 finally the derived linear equation in the higher feature space is converted to a nonlinear form in the original predictor space by the kernel function k commonly used kernel functions include linear polynomial sigmoid and radial basis function rbf types in this study the rbf kernel presented in eq 16 is adopted 16 k x x i exp γ x x i 2 where γ denotes the kernel width the performance of svr is largely dependent on appropriately selecting the parameter combination of c γ and ɛ therefore there is a need to carefully tune these parameters 2 3 3 random forest rf in 2001 breiman 2001 developed the random forest rf for the purpose of enhancing the performance of classification and regression trees carts and reducing the risk of overfitting hereafter the rf has been widely applied to streamflow and electricity price forecasting mei et al 2014 yang et al 2017 as well as land cover and gene classification díaz uriarte and de andres 2006 gislason et al 2006 in the regression analysis the rf is an ensemble of regression trees and the algorithm is detailed as follows liaw and wiener 2002 a draw a bootstrap sample from the training set b grow an unpruned regression tree to fit the bootstrap sample at each node select m variables from all predictors randomly pick the best split among the selected m variables to divide the node into two child nodes the best split is defined as the one capable of minimizing the mean square error recursively repeat the split process until the predetermined termination criterion such as the minimum members in child nodes or the maximum tree size is met c repeat steps a and b and aggregate b trees as an rf d produce the final prediction by averaging the outputs of all the trees the performance of rf is sensitive to the selection of the maximum number of variables used to grow a regression tree m and the number of regression trees b in the forest therefore these two parameters need to be carefully tuned 2 4 model calibration as previously stated there are several parameters largely governing the performance of the fitting methods the model calibration aims at searching for the optimal combination of these parameters for svr and rf the calibration mechanism adopted by this study combines a two stage calibration strategy and the well known shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 1992 firstly to prevent the model from overfitting the calibration period is divided into a calibration subperiod and a test subperiod svr or rf with each parameter combination candidate is trained by samples in the calibration subperiod note that the calibrated models are evaluated in the test subperiod prior to being directly applied to the validation period the fitness of each parameter combination is characterized by the smaller value of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficients during the calibration and test subperiods which is given by eq 17 17 fitness min nse cal nse tes then the sce ua algorithm is responsible for evolutionally and iteratively generating a number of parameter combination candidates within a predetermined parameter space eventually the parameter combination with the maximum fitness is identified to be the optimal for svr or rf previous model calibration is accustomed to determining fitness of parameter combinations only based on model performance during the calibration period however the two stage calibration strategy provides a more conservative but safer alternative which could effectively restrain the overfitting risk and therefore benefit models in maintaining consistent in sample and out of sample performance 2 5 evaluation criteria the goodness of fit of et0 forecasting models is evaluated by three statistical measures namely nse percent bias pbias and rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr nse is computed using eq 18 as follows 18 nse 1 i 1 n e i obs e i fore 2 i 1 n e i obs e obs 2 where e i obs and e i fore denote the i th observed and forecasted values of et0 respectively e obs represents the mean of the observed et0 and n is the total number of observations nse varies from negative infinity to 1 with 1 suggesting a perfect match between forecasts and observations and a value less than 0 indicating that e obs outperforms e i fore in providing the better prediction the pbias shown in eq 19 measures the average tendency of the forecasted et0 relative to observations a positive or negative value of pbias indicates the overestimation or underestimation bias a pbias nearer to zero corresponds to a more accurate prediction 19 pbias i 1 n e i obs e i fore 100 i 1 n e i obs rmse is a statistic used extensively in evaluating model performance in rsr rmse is standardized by the standard deviation of observations the merit of applying rsr is that singh et al 2005 have proposed a guideline to quantify which rmse is eligible to be identified at a low level based on a comparison with the standard deviation of observations as follows 20 rsr rmse stdev obs i 1 n e i obs e i fore 2 i 1 n e i obs e obs 2 in addition the hit rate and the fraction of the predictions within a factor of two of the observations fac2 are also calculated for the validation period they are formulated as follows tominaga et al 2015 21 hit rate 1 n i 1 n i i in which i i 1 if e i fore e i obs e i fore 0 25 0 else 22 fac2 1 n i 1 n i i in which i i 1 if 1 2 e i fore e i obs 2 0 else 3 study area and data two basins namely the jing river basin jrb and the beiluo river basin brb in china were taken as a case study 3 1 overview of the jing river and beiluo river the jing river and beiluo river which are depicted in fig 2 are second order tributaries of the yellow river china huang et al 2014 the jing river flows 455 km from its headwaters in the ningxia hui autonomous region draining an area of 45 400 km2 the mean annual discharge of the jing river is 1 832 billion m3 the beiluo river with a main channel length of 680 km is the longest river in shaanxi province annually approximately 0 997 billion m3 of runoff flows within its drainage area estimated to be 26 900 km2 the two rivers mainly travel across the loess plateau which is known as one of china s most ecologically fragile regions having suffered from severe soil erosion and desertification for centuries li et al 2017 over 350 million tons of highly erodible loess are annually delivered from surface runoff to the yellow river the jrb and brb have a continental monsoonal climate featuring intensive precipitation and high temperatures during the summer and rare precipitation and low temperatures during the winter liu et al 2017 annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration are approximately 550 mm and 1100 mm in the jrb respectively they are 520 mm and 1100 mm in the brb respectively the reference evapotranspiration is much higher than precipitation in both basins and may be largely attributed to the sparse vegetative cover as a result of extensive human interventions such as deforestation over cultivation and over grazing 3 2 data collection monthly meteorological data gauged at 13 meteorological stations situated within or adjacent to the jrb and brb are retrieved from the china meteorological data service center cmdc http www cma gov cn 2011qxfw 2011qsjgx these data covering a period from 1966 to 2010 have observations of 12 variables including the mean temperature t mean of daily maximum temperature t max mean of daily minimum temperature t min extreme high temperature text extreme low temperature text sunshine duration sh percentage of sunshine sp mean relative humidity rh mean wind speed u precipitation p mean vapor pressure vp and mean air pressure ap observations obtained at one station site are not competent to describe meteorological conditions of the whole basin therefore the weight regarding each meteorological station is computed using the thiessen polygon method and then area weighted observations of corresponding meteorological variables were yielded for the two studied basins the jrb and brb as is indicated in fig 3 observations of the 12 meteorological variables during the current month constitute the input candidate pool in scenario 1 in addition to local meteorological information the 24 global climatic indices listed in table 1 are also employed to analyse whether they can contribute to a more accurate prediction of et0 selected climatic indices are mainly associated with oceanic and atmospheric phenomena such as the el niño southern oscillation enso and many teleconnection patterns their monthly values from 1965 to 2010 were retrieved from the earth system research laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration https www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list as has been noted in subsection 2 1 both the 12 meteorological variables and the 24 climatic indices are employed under scenario 2 as potential model inputs under scenario 3 the 24 climatic indices and routinely measured meteorological variables air temperature and sunshine duration available at nearly all meteorological stations are both introduced into the input candidate pool particularly potential input variables related to the 24 climatic indices cover their monthly observations at the current time step and those lagging from 1 month to 12 months due to the consideration of the propagation speed and transport paths of water vapor on a global scale input candidate pools under scenarios 2 and 3 are depicted in fig 3 as for the modelling target the reference evapotranspiration is calculated using the fao pm equation allen et al 1998 as follows 23 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 in which δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve rn represents the net radiation reaching the crop surface g denotes the soil heat flux density γ signifies the psychrometric constant t represents the average air temperature at 2 m height u 2 represents the wind speed at 2 m and es and ea represent the saturation and actual vapor pressure respectively the preparation of all the data needed for the et0 calculation follows the procedure presented in chapter 3 of the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 4 results analysis and discussion under scenario 1 the utility of pmis to identify the relevant predictors for et0 and eliminate the redundant predictors is investigated through a comparison with pcis under scenario 2 whether global climatic indices contribute to a more accurate et0 forecast is investigated et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed regions subject to data scarcity are eventually recommended under scenario 3 4 1 scenario 1 et0 forecasting based on local meteorological information monthly data employed for the development of models cover a time period from 1966 to 2010 according to the model calibration mechanism formulated in subsection 2 4 the dataset is divided into two parts the first part 1966 2001 accounting for 80 of the whole studied period is used for model calibration and the second part 2002 2010 comprising the remaining 20 is used for validation purposes subsequently the calibration period is further split into a calibration subperiod 1966 1993 and a test subperiod 1994 2001 to effectively prevent models from overfitting the other key issue in the model development involves initializing the parameter space for the fitting techniques as for svr three parameters to be tuned namely c γ and ɛ are set to vary from 2 10 2 10 and 2 8 to 210 210 and 2 1 respectively with respect to rf the maximum number of input variables used to grow regression trees is set to equal the total number of employed predictors on the basis of findings regarding rf presented by yang et al 2016 the number of regression trees is set at 100 this dataset division and parameter configuration are adopted by all three scenarios as shown in fig 3 the input candidate pool in scenario 1 comprises observations of 12 meteorological variables at the current time step table 2 presents the predictor set screened by pcis from the input candidate pool for the jrb the predictors are listed in the sequence in which they have been chosen the first selected predictor is tmax t which has the largest pearson correlation coefficient 0 932 among the 12 potential inputs the corresponding p value is far less than 0 05 indicating that the positive linear correlation between tmax t and et0 is significant at the 95 confidence level then the linear dependence of et0 on the remaining potential inputs that cannot be accounted for by tmax t is quantified by calculating the partial correlation rht is found to own the maximum absolute value of partial correlation 0 682 among the remaining 11 potential inputs and therefore is chosen to be the second predictor unlike tmax t rht is negatively related to et0 subsequently tt with a partial correlation value of 0 408 is considered to reveal the most amount of additional dependence regarding et0 compared with the other nine potential inputs as a result tt joins the predictor set as the third member followed by tmin t sht spt vpt text t being progressively selected in a similar manner potential inputs not included into the predictor set are those with partial correlation values not significantly different form zero at the 95 confidence level by measuring the linear dependence between meteorological variables and et0 pcis identifies a total of eight predictors for et0 in the jbr table 2 presents the predictor set screened by pmis for jrb predictors are also ranked in the sequence in which they were selected in pmis the pmi between each of the potential inputs and et0 is calculated conditional on predictors having been selected tmax t has the highest pmi score of 1 144 among the 12 potential inputs and is identified as the first predictor the inclusion of rht whose pmi score of 0 435 exceeds its 10 counterparts in the predictor set yields a decreasing aic value from 705 to 972 therefore it is selected to be the second predictor a downward trend in aic is maintained when tt having the highest pmi score 0 292 relative to the other nine potential inputs is included similarly tmin t sht spt text t are progressively identified as predictors until the aic value starts to increase by measuring both linear and nonlinear dependence between meteorological variables and et0 pmis chooses seven predictors for et0 in the brb it is noticeable that pcis and pmis select the same first six predictors indicating that their strong correlation with et0 has been captured using the two ivs methods the only difference is that pmis excluding vpt yields a smaller predictor set relative to pcis the utility of the predictor sets obtained by pcis and pmis for the jrb is examined by fitting their relationship with et0 over the calibration period 1966 2001 and then testing it over the calibration period 2002 2010 three fitting methods namely mlr svr and rf are employed to reduce the model uncertainties arising from the appropriate selection of fitting techniques table 3 presents the performance evaluation of et0 forecasting models combining diverse ivs techniques and fitting techniques a predictor set consisting of all 12 potential inputs is denoted by m12 and the corresponding models are used as benchmarks for comparison purposes for all models the consistent performance during the calibration test and validation periods suggests that the overfitting risk has been addressed well in the jrb it was observed that for a given predictor set svr invariably outperforms the other fitting methods in terms of two out of the three evaluation statistics namely nse and rsr while mlr yields a better pbias than that of svr and rf as a result svr performs better against its two counterparts in capturing the relationship between predictors and et0 in the jrb with respect to different predictor sets the m12 svr model presents the best performance with nse pbis and rsr equal to 0 997 1 407 and 0 058 respectively however quite comparable performance was found in the pcis svr and pmis svr models signifying that both pcis and pmis are effective means to select relevant variables for et0 in jrb with lower data requirements the pcis svr and pmis svr models provide more economical alternatives compared with the m12 svr model in addition the pmis svr model with a smaller predictor set achieved nearly the same model performance as the pcis svr model also suggesting that pcis identifies a redundant predictor vpt in the brb pcis as shown in table 4 selects as many as 11 predictors to interpret the variability of et0 the first predictor chosen is tmax t with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 926 rht is found to have the maximum absolute value of partial correlation 0 697 among the remaining 11 potential inputs and is selected to be the second predictor subsequently tt sht spt tmin t vpt ut text t pt text t whose partial correlation values are significantly different from zero at the 95 confidence level are identified compared with that of pcis pmis yields a smaller predictor set composed of nine components by measuring both linear and nonlinear dependence table 4 shows that tmax t has the highest pmi score of 1 099 among all 12 potential inputs and is the first to enter the predictor set then rht is selected to be the second predictor owing to its highest pmi score of 0 458 compared with the other 10 potential inputs and a decreased aic value from 667 to 956 a descending trend in aic value continues to be observed as tt tmin t ut sht spt text t text t are included in the predictor set it is noted that all predictors obtained through pmis are also identified by pcis meanwhile excluding vpt and pt results in pmis yielding a smaller predictor set than that of pcis the utility of predictor sets obtained using the two ivs techniques for the brb is examined as listed in table 5 the consistent performance during the calibration test and validation periods indicates that all models have been prevented from overfitting for a given predictor set svr presents the best nse and rsr among the three fitting methods mlr is observed to have better pbias than that of both svr and rf therefore svr is more capable of capturing the relationship between et0 and its predictors in the brb with regard to different predictor sets the m12 svr model employing all 12 potential inputs yields the best performance however fairly comparable performance is presented by the pcis svr and pmis svr models with their equivalent nse values of 0 995 pbis values of 2 956 and 2 764 and rsr values of 0 069 and 0 070 suggesting that pcis and pmis can serve as effective approaches for identifying variables relevant to et0 in the brb decreased data requirements together with a similar performance make the pcis svr and pmis svr models more economical alternatives to the m12 svr model in addition the pmis svr model using a smaller predictor set achieves nearly the same performance as the pcis svr model it is suggested that pcis includes two redundant predictors ut and pt the results under scenario 1 reveal that pcis and pmis are capable of identifying meaningful predictors for et0 in the jrb and brb from numerous meteorological variables available thus they are in favour of deriving foresting models with lower data requirements additionally pcis tends to include some redundant predictors however pmis effectively excludes the redundant information by simultaneously measuring linear and nonlinear dependence it should be noted that though et0 can be predicted quite well at the basin scale with numerous meteorological variables alone models developed under scenario 1 are not suitable for regions where usually there are not adequate observations of meteorological variables available 4 2 scenario 2 et0 forecasting based on meteorological information and climatic indices compared with scenario 1 scenario 2 further includes 24 climatic indices as potential inputs so as to investigate their correlation to et0 and whether they can contribute to more accurate forecasts in the jrb pcis identifies as many as 32 meteorological variables and climatic indices as predictors for et0 among which the first nine are listed in table 6 pmis yields a much smaller predictor set containing eight members in the brb a total of 28 input variables are selected by pcis to explain the variability of et0 while 11 predictors are selected through pmis as shown in table 7 note that nino 1 2 one of the eastern pacific sst indices used for characterizing enso events is identified by both pmis and pcis to be predictors and ranks higher in the predictor set implying that et0 in the jrb and brb may be strongly correlated with enso events afterwards the utility of these predictor sets obtained are examined by the model performance as presented in tables 8 and 9 m12c24 denotes a predictor set composed of all potential inputs under scenario 1 and 24 climatic indices for the jrb a comparison between tables 3 and 8 shows a general improvement in model performance due to the further inclusion of relevant climatic indices in predictor sets similar performance enhancement is also observed in tables 5 and 9 for the brb results under scenario 2 are a reminder that climatic indices are likely to carry additional information regarding et0 and introducing those that are relevant through the appropriate ivs techniques can favour the yield of more accurate et0 forecasts 4 3 scenario 3 et0 forecasting models recommended for data scarce regions under scenario 3 et0 forecasting models are developed for data scarce regions only routinely measured meteorological variables such as air temperatures tt tmax t tmin t text t and text t and sunshine duration sht are employed in comparison with other meteorological variables such as solar radiation vapor pressure relative humidity and wind speed measuring air temperature and solar duration requires quite simple instruments which supports the global availability of these observations meanwhile 24 climatic indices are introduced into the input candidate pool potential inputs related to climatic indices cover their monthly values at the current time step and those lagging from 1 month to 12 months therefore there are in total 318 potential inputs under scenario 3 in the jrb pmis identifies seven predictors as listed in table 10 to interpret the variability of et0 in detail the predictor set screened by pmis comprises all meteorological variables except text t and nino 1 2 with lag lengths of two and six months nino 1 2 is utilized to characterize the evolution of enso events as these predictors progressively join in the predictor set a decreasing trend in aic values is continuously observed compared with pmis pcis selects as many as 32 predictors among which the first nine predictors are listed in table 10 the other 23 are climatic indices of different lag months similar to pmis pcis is found to choose all meteorological variables except text t predictors related to nino 1 2 are ranked at higher positions in the predictor set indicating their strong correlation with et0 in the jrb however it is noted that pcis and pmis identify nino 1 2 with slightly different lag lengths subsequently the utility of predictor sets obtained by pcis and pmis for the jrb is examined for comparison purposes two predictor sets are adopted as benchmarks one denoted by t5 contains five temperature variables and for the other symbolized by t5s sunshine duration is further added the performances of the et0 forecasting models with the four predictor sets are presented in table 11 for t5 t5s and the predictor set acquired by pmis svr is generally found to outperform mlr and rf mlr offers the best performance compared with that of svr and rf when fitting the relationship between et0 and the predictor set obtained through pcis with respect to different predictor sets a comparison between the t5 svr and t5s svr models exhibits that adding the solar duration contributes to enhanced model performance more importantly introducing climatic indices into predictor sets favours yielding a distinct improvement in model performance relative to t5 and t5s which is intuitively shown by the more compact concentration of forecasts around their targets in fig 4 a comparison of two predictor sets containing both meteorological variables and climatic indices shows that the pmis svr model with seven predictors had superior performance compared with that of the pcis mlr model with as many as 32 predictors due to a 0 02 increase in nse value a 0 009 decrease in rsr value and a 0 009 increase in hit rate it is suggested that some redundant predictors are selected by pcis therefore with lower data requirements and superior performance the pmis svr model is recommended to forecast et0 in the jrb in the brb pmis identifies seven predictors as listed in table 12 including all temperature variables except text t and nino 1 2 with lag lengths of three and six months in comparison pcis yields a much larger predictor set containing 32 elements the first nine of these are listed in table 12 and show that nino 1 2 with the lag lengths of four and seven months are ranked at higher positions in the predictor set indicating their strong linear correlation with et0 in the brb it is noticeable that the nino 1 2 selected by pmis and pcis are of different time lags the utility of predictor sets obtained using the two ivs techniques are further evaluated by model performance as shown in table 13 for t5 t5s and the predictor set acquired through pmis svr invariably offers superior model performance compared with that of mlr and rf in terms of nse and rsr however the mapping relationship between the predictor set obtained by pcis and et0 in the brb is more accurately fitted by mlr with respect to different predictor sets the comparison between the t5 svr and t5s svr models exhibits an improved model performance due to the employment of solar duration as an additional predictor more importantly introducing climatic indices into predictor sets favours achieving a distinct improvement in model performance relative to t5 and t5s which is intuitively presented in fig 5 in detail compared with the t5s svr model the pmis svr model is observed to have a 0 012 increase in nse a 0 037 decrease in rsr and a 0 019 increase in hit rate the pcis mlr model offers a 0 019 increase in nse a decrease of 3 167 and 0 066 in the pbias and rsr respectively and a 0 009 increase in the hit rate under scenario 3 the similar performance of the pcis and pmis models suggests that pcis tends to include some redundant predictors meanwhile it is found that introducing climatic indices favours yielding a more accurate et0 forecast in terms of nse rsr and hit rate nino 1 2 one of the enso indices is selected by both pcis and pmis as a predictor and ranks higher in the predictor set revealing that the evapotranspiration process in the jrb and brb is strongly influenced by enso events compared with the predictors under scenario 1 those under scenario 3 are all routinely measured meteorological variables and climatic indices making the models developed under scenario 3 more suitable for forecasting et0 in the least economically developed regions as is shown in tables 11 and 13 the pmis svr models with seven predictors offer favourable forecasting skills and are therefore recommended for forecasting et0 in the jrb and brb 5 conclusions this study aimed to develop et0 forecasting models for the least economically developed regions subject to meteorological data scarcity mainly through 1 exploring appropriate input variable selection techniques to effectively reduce model data requirements and 2 introducing global climatic indices as additional model inputs for creating information regarding et0 which ought to be provided by meteorological variables unavailable first it was investigated whether pmis was capable of identifying relevant predictors and excluding those that were redundant a comparison was also made with pcis then the interconnection between global climatic indices and regional et0 was recognized by pmis and pcis and relevant climatic indices were incorporated into the models as additional predictors finally models with both lower data requirements and favourable performance were recommended et0 forecasting models were developed for two study areas namely the jrb and brb in china the results indicated that pmis and pcis were both effective approaches for identifying the relevant predictors for regional et0 however pcis only measuring the linear dependence tended to select redundant predictors pmis presented better performance in excluding redundant information by simultaneously evaluating the linear and nonlinear correlations therefore smaller predictor sets were yielded by pmis relative to pcis which is crucial for model development in data scarce regions furthermore nino 1 2 characterizing enso evolutions was identified by both pmis and pcis to be correlated with et0 revealing enso influences on the evapotranspiration process in the study areas introducing nino 1 2 into the models yielded more accurate et0 forecasts among the various models investigated the non linear stochastic models svr or rf with inputs selected through pmis did not always improve the accuracy of the linear models mlr with inputs screened by pcis however the pmis svr model was able to offer quite comparable performance depending on smaller predictor sets and was therefore recommended to predict et0 in the jrb and brb these findings suggest that selecting model inputs through pmis as well as introducing global climatic indices into input candidate pools favours developing et0 forecasting models suitable for the least economically developed regions although pmis is proven to be a competitive alternative capable of identifying meaningful predictors for et0 previous studies on solar radiation estimation ahmadi et al 2009 remesan et al 2008 reyhani et al 2005 have shown the superiority of the gamma test gt over mi in selecting the best predictor set therefore future work could be carried out to investigate the applicability of gt in et0 estimation and a further comparison between gt and pmis could be made acknowledgments this study was joint funded by the national
