18275,to reduce the discharge of trace organic compounds into water bodies associated with potential toxic effects such as endocrine disruption new advanced treatment methods are being investigated at several wastewater treatment plants wwtps one of the most studied and already implemented technologies is ozonation however ozonation only partially oxidizes trace organic compounds troc and as a result transformation products tps with unknown properties can be formed in order to minimise the risk of releasing unknown and potentially toxic tps into surface water it is recommended to install a biological post treatment after ozonation the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a moving bed reactor following ozonation in a full scale plant different ozone dosages zspec 0 3 0 5 0 7 mg o3 mgdoc were investigated to assess the biological activity of the post treatment the assimilable organic carbon aoc was determined in addition to the formed biomass furthermore selected troc were analysed in parallel to monitor the ozonation efficiency at different ozone doses in addition estrogenic androgenic as well as corresponding antagonistic effects were investigated after each treatment step using the a yes and a yas assay a non target screening was performed to evaluate a trend analysis of formed tps as well as their removal by the post treatment procedure the results proved the successful design of the biological post treatment reactor by a constant biofilm development and reduction of the aoc endocrine effects were removed below the limit of detection lod of 10 pg eeq l already after ozonation for all applied ozone doses antagonistic effects were not significantly reduced during ozonation and subsequent biological post treatment for this reason further research is needed to evaluate different post treatment technologies the trend analysis from non target screening data showed a reduction of about 95 of the number of formed tps by the biological post treatment consequently an assessment of the biological activity and the elimination capacity of a certain biological post treatment technique is thus possible by applying the aoc in combination with a non target screening graphical abstract image 1 keywords municipal wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes ozonation biological post treatment endocrine activity micropollutant removal 1 introduction one major source of trace organic compounds troc in surface waters are wastewater treatment plants wwtps ternes et al 2006 because of the introduction of these compounds into surface waters aquatic organisms may be affected depending on the toxicity of the compounds one example are endocrine effects which can be triggered by naturally excreted hormones as well as by chemicals capable of acting endocrine kidd et al 2007 peschke et al 2014 henneberg et al 2014 especially for non natural endocrine disrupting compounds edcs biological effects could already be observed in very low concentrations such as ng l pg l range aris et al 2014 kidd et al 2007 apart from estrogenic or androgenic effects which are leading to an increased hormonal effect level agonistic activity in organisms there are also inhibitory effects lowering the overall effect level caused by agonists antagonistic activity such an antagonistic activity was still observed during advanced treatment of hospital wastewater in prior studies itzel et al 2018 gehrmann et al 2018 it is worth to note that antagonistic effects especially anti androgen effects can lead to similar effects in organisms compared to estrogens due to the reduction of the androgen level jobling et al 2009 for this reason the potential discharge of antagonistic endocrine active compounds could become important in terms of ecological status of water bodies even by implementing advanced treatment technologies an often applied technique is the use of oxidative processes such as ozonation andreozzi et al 1999 hollender et al 2009 tuerk et al 2010 margot et al 2013 audenaert et al 2014 verlicchi et al 2015 knopp et al 2016 itzel et al 2017 2018 völker et al 2019 in case of ozonation a full mineralization during wastewater treatment is not achieved due to high organic matter contents which is leading to a fast ozone depletion for this reason a transformation of troc is more likely lee et al 2010 however the toxicological characteristics of transformation products tps are difficult to predict and thus lead to increased uncertainty compared to the precursor compound today there are various studies which show contradictory results regarding different toxic effects by tps schmidt et al 2014 knopp et al 2016 lee et al 2016 li et al 2016 itzel et al 2017 knoop et al 2018 in order to minimise the risk of releasing unknown potentially toxic tps into surface water a further post treatment is recommended after ozonation in switzerland gschg 814 20 gschv 814 201 besides legal requirements applying to the swiss plants there are numerous studies recommending the implementation of additional biological post treatment procedures to reduce the potential risk of formed tps during oxidative processes hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 prasse et al 2015 applied biological post treatments are for example sand filters moving bed filters and fixed bed reactors additionally granular activated carbon gac are often investigated as sorption technologies in parallel to their biological activity due to the formation of biofilm on the surface knopp et al 2016 böhler et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 the use of gac filters as biological post treatment by targeted cultivation of biofilm on its surface is also referred to as biologically activated carbon bac filter kalkan et al 2011 partial oxidation during ozonation increases polarity of tps compared with the parent troc due to that reason tps often exhibit a higher bioavailability to organisms hübner et al 2014 for the reduction of tps different post treatment procedures were investigated in the swiss project re treat in this study böhler et al 2017 demonstrated that n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a known cancinerogenic transformation product could be reduced by 66 by a biological sand filter in addition other studies investigating biological post treatment showed a removal of oxidative tps formed during drinking water production indicating the efficiency as well richardson et al 1999 hammes et al 2006 to evaluate different technologies and especially the efficiency of a certain biological post treatment parameters need to be selected which are able to give information about removal toxicity and the bioavailability of the compounds a common evaluation criterion is the removal efficiency of certain indicator parameters such as compounds listed within the european water framework directive eu wfd ec 2000 60 ec 2008 105 eu 2013 39 eu 2018 840 or selected compounds within the swiss legal requirement for evaluation uvek 2016 however after ozonation an integrative approach would be necessary due to unknown tps and potential corresponding ecotoxicological effects effect based methods are a useful tool in order to ascertain the elimination efficiency in terms of genotoxicity cytotoxicity and endocrine activity itzel et al 2017 valitalo et al 2017 however the regulatory measures may make it necessary to identify relevant compounds as well as their emission sources thus effect based analysis can be used as a sensitive screening tool in the first step followed by a more extensive instrumental analysis this approach has already been implemented in some studies in particular the combination of both analysis techniques enables faster and more precise identification through decisive meta information weiss et al 2011 altenburger et al 2015 brack et al 2016 comtois marotte et al 2017 neale et al 2017 tousova et al 2017 itzel et al 2018 especially in terms of tps such an effect based identification approach could help to identify most potent and relevant tps and their fate during treatment as tps potentially exhibit a higher bioavailability the assimilable organic carbon aoc fraction of the dissolved organic carbon doc could be a further important indicator parameter to assess the removal effectivity of a certain post treatment van der kooij 1992 the aoc analysis method was originally developed to determine the biological regrowth potential of freshwater distribution networks van der kooij et al 1989 van der kooij 1992 the correlation of aoc and ozone dose was already observed during ozonation of drinking water indicating the correlation to formed tps van der kooij et al 1989 escobar et al 2001 as the aoc analysis method is based on isolated drinking water specific organisms pseudomonas fluorescens p17 and spirillum species nox the influence of high doc containing wastewater samples remains mostly unknown the aim of this study was to evaluate the full scale ozonation at the wwtp warburg with a biological post treatment in terms of the removal of endocrine activities and potential tps to that end effect based methods using arxula adeninivorans yeast cell assays were applied to determine estrogen androgen as well as anti estrogen and anti androgen effects that are often not investigated but known to be present after ozonation in some cases parallel to effect based methods relevant indicator parameters were measured to characterise the full treatment process to determine the elimination rate of formed tps during a biological post treatment the aoc as a novel parameter in terms of waste water analysis was investigated to further evaluate the elimination efficiency of tps by the biological post treatment a trend analysis was done using a non target approach based on high resolution mass spectrometry hrms measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards acetonitrile lc ms grade methanol lc ms grade methyl tert butylether mtbe for residue analysis

mechanical biological municipal wwtp warburg stadtwerke warburg gmbh warburg germany is designed for 70 000 population equivalents pe and receives municipal as well as industrial wastewater since november 2016 an ozonation unit is in operation the advanced treatment unit is designed as a two line full scale ozonation with a moving bed reactor as biological post treatment a detailed scheme is shown in the supplementary information fig si 1 the specific operation parameters of the plant are listed in table 1 2 3 sampling the samples were taken at specific ozone dosages of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc over a period of three weeks in addition to qualified grab samples 24 h composite samples were taken to assess the general elimination efficiency of the ozonation for selected indicator parameters grab samples were always analysed for all parameters a detailed sampling plan is shown in table si1 2 4 sample preparation 2 4 1 effect based methods sample preparation performed for effect based analysis of edc included a solid phase extraction spe step according to the iso 19040 2 2018 which was carried out within 48 h after sampling at first the cartridge 150 mg 6 ml oasis hlb waters germany was conditioned 2 5 ml methanol and equilibrated 2 5 ml water lc ms grade separate cartridges were loaded with 1000 ml sample after drying the cartridges under vacuum the loaded cartridges were stored at 18 c until further analysis the elution was performed with 5 5 ml mtbe the solvent was evaporated to complete dryness evaporator vapotherm basis mobil i barkley germany at 50 c under a nitrogen gas stream and re dissolved in 2 ml a yes a yas and 4 ml anti a yes anti a yas water lc ms grade resulting in a nominal enrichment factor of 500 and 250 respectively additional to the samples blanks lc ms water as well as positive controls using e2 or dht for the a yes or a yas assay were always measured in parallel respectively 2 4 2 trace organic compounds troc for determination of troc ppcps and pesticides 2 ml of the samples were filtered using syringe filters chromafil rc 45 25 macherey nagel germany and filled into 2 ml glass vials before lc ms ms measurement 10 ng ml internal standards see table si 2 were added 2 4 3 non target analysis the sample preparation for hrms included an enrichment step using spe cartridges 150 mg 6 ml oasis hlb waters germany that was performed as described in section 2 4 1 2 5 biological activity 2 5 1 biofilm growth to monitor biofilm formation in the fluidized moving bed reactor samples of growth bodies anox k5 anoxkaldnes ab sweden were taken as grab samples and analysed for their biofilm mass as the plant was already running for about 24 months a constant biofilm mass was expected the protected surface area for biofilm growth is 800 m2 m³ four samples 40 g each of the exposed growth bodies were placed in a beaker and stored at 50 c overnight two samples were then dried at 105 c for 24 h the two other samples were washed with 50 ml hydrochloric acid 37 followed by ultra pure water in order to remove the biofilm from the growth bodies and then also dried at 105 c for 24 h the calculation of the biofilm mass was based on the difference between the two sets of samples which were treated with and without hydrochloric acid 2 5 2 assimilable organic carbon the measurement of the assimilable organic carbon aoc was performed after van der kooij et al 1982 with the following modifications the aoc was performed with grab samples as 24 h composite samples would not be representative due to microbial degradation to prevent a biodegradation until the measurement the samples were directly filled in sterile 30 ml glass vials and pasteurised at 150 c for 30 min in an oven within 4 h after sampling after pasteurisation the samples were stored at 20 c until further investigation prior to the sample incubation with target organisms the cell cultures had to be prepared for this purpose both freeze dried strains the spirillum strain nox atcc no 49643 usa manassas and the pseudomonas fluorescens strain p 17 atcc no 49642 usa manassas were re suspended in 2 ml sterile drinking water autoclaved and filtered 0 2 μm separately from these suspensions 100 μl were transferred into separate 250 ml sterile erlenmeyer flask containing 125 ml sterile drinking water the cell cultures were incubated at room temperature 15 20 c until the stationary phase was reached over a period of one week 100 μl of the cell cultures were spread onto r2a agar plates on each day and incubated for 3 5 days at 25 c using an incubator colony counting was done manually after reaching the stationary phase both organisms were spiked to the samples at a concentration of 500 cfu ml and incubated for 7 10 days at room temperature 15 20 c to count the formed colonies 100 μl of the samples were spread onto r2a agar in triplicate and incubated for 5 days the nox were identified as small 1 2 mm white colonies and the p 17 as larger 3 4 mm yellow colonies 2 6 estrogen and androgen effects 2 6 1 agonistic effects the enriched and aqueous samples samples without enrichment were analysed using the arxula adeninivorans yeast estrogen and androgen screen assays a yes a yas new diagnostics gmbh berlin germany the measurements of estrogenic effects were done according to the iso 19040 2 2018 and for androgenic effects similar to our prior study itzel et al 2017 the achieved lods were 20 pg eeq l for the a yes and 0 06 ng dhteq l for the a yas enrichment factor of 500 included 2 6 2 antagonistic effects the measurement of antagonistic effects was done similar to the agonistic effects as described in 2 6 1 using the yeast arxula adeninivorans the analyses were done after itzel et al 2018 by spiking a known amount of an agonist to the samples in case of antagonistic estrogenic effects anti a yes 20 μl 17β estradiol solution 1000 ng l were added to samples 380 μl inside the 96 well plate resulting in a final assay concentration of 50 μg ml e2 to investigate antagonistic androgenic effects anti a yas 100 μl dht solution 800 ng l were added to the samples 300 μl inside the 96 well plate resulting in a final assay concentration of 200 μg ml dht after performing the test the detected concentration was set relative to the spiked amount leading to a percentage inhibition 2 7 instrumental analysis 2 7 1 dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with reference to din en 1484 1997 08 for the measurement of doc 20 ml of the sample to be measured were filtered with a syringe filter chromafil rc 45 25 macherey nagel germany and acidified with hydrochloric acid c 2 mol l roth rotipuran ultra 34 to a ph value 2 acidification was done within 24 h after sampling samples were sealed and stored in the refrigerator 8 c until analysis the sample was measured within one week using a toc vcpn analyzer shimadzu deutschland gmbh duisburg germany by catalytic oxidation at 680 c followed by ndir detection 2 7 2 ozone measurement and control the ozone is produced onsite out of technical oxygen using a smoevo 410 ozone generator xylem water solutions deutschland gmbh herford germany the ozone concentration in the product gas is given by the manufacturer by 148 g o3 m³ a defined part of this product gas is than fed into the reaction basin via 7 ceramic diffusor depending of the gas feed and the doc concentration of the water the resulting specific ozone concentration can be calculated additional the potential residual ozone gas is measured by an uv probe lc 400plus xylem water solutions deutschland gmbh herford germany above the ozone reaction chamber at 254 nm the residual off gas is than included within the calculated ozone concentration in the water phase 2 7 3 liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry the samples for determination of troc ppcps and pesticides were analysed without a prior enrichment by lc ms ms using a 1260 infinity lc pump agilent technologies gmbh waldbronn germany with a hts pla autosampler ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland and a qtrap 6500 ab sciex germany gmbh darmstadt germany tandem mass spectrometer 50 μl of the samples were injected onto a raptor arc 18 column 50 2 1 mm 2 7 μm with a raptor arc 18 guard column 5 2 1 mm 2 7 μm purchased from restek gmbh bad homburg germany a generic gradient of water and acetonitrile both with 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 500 μl min was used for separation the gradient started from 1 acetonitrile to 67 within 8 min followed by 2 min with 99 acetonitrile and 3 min with 1 acetonitrile for equilibration the column temperature was set to 40 c mass spectrometric detection was realised using the scheduled multiple reaction monitoring smrm mode the respective mass transfers ion source setup for measured analytes as well as internal standards used for quantification are listed in table si 2 corresponding limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq are shown in table si 3 2 7 4 high resolution mass spectrometry 2 7 4 1 method parameters for hrms measurements only samples treated with the highest ozone dose were further processed and analysed as these samples should be influenced the most by ozone tps and the effect of the biological post treatment should be best visible at the same time this demonstrates a worst case scenario after eluting the cartridges see 2 4 3 the measurement was done within 48 h chromatographic separation was performed using a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc system thermo scientific bremen germany a gradient method was carried out on a xselect hss t3 2 1 mm 75 mm 3 5 μm particle size column from waters waters milford ma usa the mobile phase consisted of eluent a ultrapure water 0 1 formic acid and eluent b methanol 0 1 formic acid after an isocratic step with 5 b for 5 min the concentration of eluent b was raised to 95 within 10 min and kept constant for 10 min following the initial conditions were reached again within 0 1 min and were kept for 5 min constant to re equilibrate the column the injection volume was 20 μl and the flow rate 0 35 ml min all samples were measured in triplicates mass spectrometric detection was performed on an orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive thermo scientific bremen germany using positive electrospray ionization in separate runs the parameters of the ion source are summarized in table si 4 the full scan hrms spectra m z 100 1000 with a resolution of 70 000 was followed by data dependent ms2 scans of the five most intense ions with a resolution of 17 500 the settings of the full scan ddms2 top 5 measurement are shown in table si 5 mass calibration was performed with the calibration solution pierce ltq velos positive negative ions calibration solution thermo scientific bremen germany before a new measurement series was started in addition a lock mass 391 2843 for positive mode and 265 1476 for negative mode was used further an exclusion list was used to avoid fragmentation scans of continuous background signals see table si 6 2 7 4 2 non target data evaluation the peak processing and peak picking as well as final trend analysis were done by the r r core team 2018 based software tool mzmine 2 version 2 0 pluskal et al 2019 therefore the raw data from lc hrms analysis were loaded as mzxml files into mzmine 2 in a centroided mode the first step was the peak detection therefore the noise level was set to 1 0 104 by manual view into the total ion chromatogram tic of the samples to reduce the number of features from the noise for this reason an additional blank subtraction was not done the peak detection in mzmine 2 is based on the r script xcms and features with a min time span of 0 02 min and a m z tolerance of 0 001 are assigned to one peak to pick relevant peaks and reduce artefacts a chromatogram deconvolution was done by setting the max peak duration to 0 8 min prior to the function chromatogram builder the chromatogram builder generates a list for each detected peak with an m z tolerance of 5 ppm and minimum signal intensity above the set noise level the peak alignment was done to be able to track features during the treatment steps therefore the retention time tolerance was set to 5 an additional isotope pattern comparison was done to improve alignment of corresponding peaks the minimum score of the isotope ratios was set to 85 as a last step the formula prediction was done using a m z tolerance of 5 ppm the ionization type m h isotope pattern as well as ms ms information score threshold of 80 2 7 4 3 suspect target screening after peak picking by the prior non target analysis the sample after ozonation and after biological post treatment were compared with known substances from the iuta database using the open source software tool r r development core team 2019 as well as the platform stoff ident stoff ident 2019 the in house database contains known pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals as well as corresponding tps the exact mass under consideration of ionization m h was used for the database comparison as the analytical methods in the database are different the retention time was not used as identification criterion the mass deviation was set to 5 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological investigations 3 1 1 biofilm growth the biofilm mass of 30 2 mg per growth body was constant during the sampling campaign in both lines data not shown these results indicate a constant biofilm growth in the lag phase of a typical biofilm growth curve for this reason an ozone entry from the reactor into the biological post treatment could be excluded in an earlier study a decreasing biofilm mass could be observed which was due to ozone input from the reactor gruenebaum et al 2014 since this was not the case in warburg the design of the reaction chambers can be evaluated as successful comparing the biofilm growth bodies by their developed biofilm mass with prior investigations the now used growth bodies showed a 3 times higher biofilm mass per growth body itzel et al 2017 the design of the growth body in this study was different from the one reported by itzel et al 2017 thus a normalization of the surface area was done for both types and it resulted in 12 4 10 3 mg m2 based on manufacturers data of 800 m2 m³ 331 000 pieces m³ type anox k5 used in this study and 3 2 10 3 mg m2 based on manufacturers data of 635 m2 m³ 255 000 pieces m³ type 2h bcp 750 itzel et al 2017 this comparison demonstrates that the biofilm growth bodies used in this study can achieve up to 4 times higher biofilm masses and are potentially more suitable for an efficient post treatment 3 1 2 biological activity the results of the doc measurements showed a significant decrease to a minimum of 6 mg l after conventional wastewater treatment due to the biological assimilation a further reduction by ozonation and subsequent moving bed reactor was not observed since ozonation does not completely mineralize the organic content a conversion of compounds to tps is more likely which is reflected in a constant doc through the oxidative treatment as smaller polar molecules are more easily accessible to microorganisms the formation of corresponding tps should lead to higher biological activity after ozonation von gunten 2003 this is shown by an increasing aoc concentration fig 1 parallel to an increasing ozone dose comparable to van der kooij et al 1989 and escobar et al 2001 the significant drop of the aoc to 100 25 μg carbon l for all ozone doses clearly demonstrates the biological activity of the post treatment by a high assimilation of degradable organic compounds especially for the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc a significant increase in activity factor 2 as well as a decrease after biological post treatment was observed these results show that this specific biological post treatment setup has the potential to remove the bioavailable organic carbon fraction which originates from tps during ozonation the investigation of the biological activity demonstrates that the aoc could be a powerful parameter to describe the effectivity of a certain biological post treatment in terms of the reduction of tps formed during ozonation bourgin et al 2018 compared different biological post treatment processes in pilot scale after the full scale ozonation at the wwtp neugut dübendorf switzerland a threefold increase of the aoc was observed at a specific ozone dose of 0 55 mgo3 mgdoc which is higher compared to the here observed increase shown in fig 1 this difference could be explained by different wastewater composition at different wwtps the results of bourgin et al 2018 showed the highest aoc removal of 50 70 for gac filters due to the additional sorption the sand filter showed still a high abatement of 40 the moving bed reactor had the lowest removal rate of 13 17 which contradicts the results obtained in our study however the aoc method applied in this study after van der kooij et al 1982 is optimised for drinking water samples with low levels of bacteria nutrients and doc and not for wastewater during the experiments in the laboratory some wwtp influent samples could not be evaluated due to high bacterial background leading to false values therefore this method needs to be adapted and optimised for an accurate and robust measurement in wastewater matrix as the applied method of van der kooij 1982 uses organisms isolated from drinking water a more natural inoculum isolated from wastewater could help to overcome matrix problems this approach of analysing by a natural microbial consortium of the respective sample was already applied by hammes et al 2005 using fluorescenes staining combined with flow cytometry 3 2 endocrine effects and compounds 3 2 1 estrogen activity the results of the estrogen effects fig 2 measured with the a yes assay showed the highest activity of 0 15 ng eeq l in week 2 this value is already below the proposed effect based trigger value of 0 4 ng eeq l jarosova et al 2014 kunz et al 2015 in week 1 no estrogen activity was detected in the inlet of the treatment plant possibly due to the type of sample grab sample thus no data on elimination by conventional waste water treatment can be provided the results for the ozonation showed a significant decrease below the lod of 0 02 ng eeq l in week 2 and 3 at zspec 0 5 and 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc respectively such an elimination rate is comparable to prior studies using ozone in full scale in which a reduction below the lod was observed as well itzel et al 2017 the achieved elimination rates in relation to the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant were 55 80 and 90 for the ozone doses of zspec 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc the moving bed reactor further removed the estrogenic effect at a zspec of 0 3 mgo3 mgdoc which was below the lod the results for anti estrogenic effects showed the highest inhibition in the inflow of the wastewater treatment plant 90 inhibition an anti estrogenic effect was observed in week 1 zspec 0 3 mgo3 mgdoc after conventional treatment and ozonation indicating a lower reduction due to ozonation compared to agonistic estrogen effects this could be an indication that either compounds acting as anti estrogens are not reduced by ozonation or formed tps during ozonation could cause an anti estrogenic effect in a recent study by knoop et al 2018 in which anti estrogen effects of tps from the anti estrogen pharmaceutical tamoxifene were investigated during ozonation it could be shown that the total effect was not reduced this is an indication that tps contributed to the overall effect and thus compensated for the reduction of tamoxifen regarding the biological post treatment a further reduction below 10 could be observed for the sample in week 3 zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc this is comparable to a prior study by itzel et al 2018 at a hospital wwtp using granular activated carbon gac as post treatment indicating that antagonistic active compounds could be rather biological available or adsorbing to surfaces which is also shown by elimination rates of already 60 70 during conventional treatment fig 3 the relatively high anti estrogen activity that occurs after biological post treatment in week 2 zspec 0 5 mgo3 mgdoc may be due to a peak value specific for this week as the cell growth of the bioassay was always checked a false positive result from the assay can be excluded however as this increase after biological post treatment is only detected in this single sample further investigations should be done to verify the results comparing the anti estrogen activity our results are different from prior studies investigating full scale ozonation at hospital wastewater treatment plants gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2018 in those studies a constant anti estrogenic effect was observed during the conventional biological wastewater treatment and advanced treatment using ozonation gehrmann et al 2018 furthermore even an increasing trend during conventional treatment was observed itzel et al 2018 since the composition of hospital wastewater differs from that of municipal wastewater anti estrogenic effects could be attributed to different compounds characteristic for hospital wastewater and municipal wastewater this fact should be investigated in more detail to identify relevant anti estrogen active compounds in a study by buckley 2010 a relative inhibition of estrogenic activity by the wwtp effluent of about 50 was observed therewith a further treatment combination seems to be necessary to improve the reduction of anti estrogen effects as well however as the effluent activity seems to be highly variable more samples should be investigated to make a representative statement about the inhibition by anti estrogenic compounds 3 2 2 androgen activity the results of androgen activity measured by the a yas are shown in fig 4 due to grab sampling at different weeks the influent concentrations vary between lod and 0 75 ng dhteq l the elimination rates were between 50 and 70 compared to the effluent of the wwtp at high ozone concentrations the highest elimination would be expected however the ratio seems to remain constant which is probably due to variations prior to ozonation however since this assumption is based on only two out of three samples further measurements should be performed in future these results are in accordance to those found in prior investigations with elimination rates of about 30 60 itzel et al 2017 a further reduction by the biological post treatment was not observed however the proposed human trigger value of 11 ng dhteq l is not exceeded and therewith a risk for human health can be excluded brand et al 2013 nevertheless this trigger value was derived for drinking water and is only relevant for humans effects on aquatic organisms are not considered compared to detected androgen activities anti androgen activity showed a contrary result fig 5 in the wwtp influent an inhibition of up to 100 was observed however only one sample of week 2 showed an inhibition due to the detected effects after the conventional treatment one explanation could be that compounds are already in the influent and getting effective after metabolization during biological processes quality control samples did not indicate any interferences like growth inhibition or photometric absorption effects by the sample itself so that the effect detected can be attributed to pure anti androgen activity samples from the wwtp effluent influent ozonation showed inhibitions of 20 60 comparing the samples an increasing trend can be observed during ozonation the biological post treatment showed almost no further reduction of anti androgen activity only at the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc week 3 a significant reduction could be observed this trend can also be observed for the aoc indicating a potential correlation of tps to anti androgen activity however a residual inhibition of about 40 60 independent of the applied ozone dose illustrates the need of future identification of relevant compounds a similar trend of increased activity after ozonation was already shown in a different study investigating hospital wastewater after full scale ozonation gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2018 the release of anti androgen active compounds to the receiving surface water can lead to ecotoxicological issues similar to those by estrogens in a study by jobling et al 2009 it was demonstrated that anti androgens are responsible for sexual disruption in fish of rivers in the uk one option to further reduce anti androgen activity after ozone treatment could be the application of granular activated carbon gac itzel et al 2018 due to the ecological relevance of anti androgen active compounds several studies started to identify potential candidates of known compounds compounds being under suspicion are highly diverse including pcbs pahs flame retardants pesticides as well as pharmaceuticals liscio et al 2014 li et al 2013 kortenkamp et al 2014 rostkowski et al 2011 due to the large variety of compounds able to act as endocrine disruptors effect based trigger values ebt for direct application of bioassay results for regulatory measures are in discussion van der oost et al 2017 escher et al 2018 wernersson et al 2015 3 3 chemical target analysis 3 3 1 ppcps and pesticides for ozone control due to ozonation system failure at the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc grab samples were taken instead of 24 h composite samples for this setting for the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc the elimination for all ppcps was around 86 and thus within the swiss regulation of 80 annual average elimination gschv 814 201 elimination of 24 h composite samples would be expected to be 80 for zspec 0 7 as prior investigations showed elimination of 80 at already significantly lower specific ozone dosage of zspec 0 3 0 4 mgo3 mgdoc abegglen et al 2009 hollender et al 2009 götz et al 2011 since the pesticides were always determined from the collected grab samples the results were not influenced by the failure of ozonation during the 24 h sampling as expected the highest elimination rate was at the highest ozone dose zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc all results of single compounds are shown in fig si 2 3 4 hrms analysis 3 4 1 non target analyses processing of the non target data using the software mzmine 2 resulted in 822 detected features in the inflow of ozonation at the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc the peak alignment and following trend analysis showed a reduction of the number of features by 60 resulting in 336 residual features simultaneously the formation of 241 new features by ozonation was observed as the spe as well as the chromatographic method during the lc run was done by a balanced phase polar non polar also tps should be detected to some extent however this procedure also represents a certain selectivity which limits the analytical window nevertheless the 241 features only detected after ozonation are highly probable to be tps the predicted sum formulae support the assumption by a high number of oxygen atoms compared to other features si chapter 1 4 2 a further data filtration was done to evaluate the elimination efficiency of the biological post treatment the result showed the elimination of 230 tps from ozonation 11 residual features leading to a tp elimination rate of 95 by the biological post treatment this tracking of formed and eliminated tps shows the efficiency of the post treatment after ozone fig 6 the suspect target screening was performed by comparing the detected features with an in house database containing tps of common indicator parameter such as described in 3 3 1 resulted in 6 hits of known tps after ozonation table 2 a further tracking of those identified tps through the biological post treatment resulted in no hits for this reason the detected targets are likely to get completely retained or degraded by the biological post treatment as the 11 formed compounds are released into the receiving water they are of major interest due to lack of information about their toxicity and structure the corresponding ms2 spectra retention times as well as predicted sum formulae are shown in table si 7 the further suspect screening using the in house database showed no results for the 11 released compounds these results are only based on a single random sample and further sampling should be done to assess the relevance of these 11 compounds the trends of individual peaks which were detected through the whole treatment are shown in fig 8 in total profiles could be created from influent ozone to the effluent post treatment of all 822 peaks detected in the influent ozone the results could be clustered into three major groups increasing after biological post treatment constant during biological post treatment and elimination during biological post treatment fig 7 the first group comprising increasing signal area of detected features could be due to matrix interferences as the increase shown on the left of fig 7 is not significant when compared to the influent the second group of constant signal area of detected features are compounds not influenced by ozonation and biological post treatment or formed compounds not further reduced by the post treatment as already shown in table si 7 by 11 residual tps the last group of decreasing signal area could be attributed to compounds which are biologically degradable and getting reduced by the biological post treatment in this case formed tps are shown which are completely removed as well as compounds which remained rather constant during ozonation but reduced in the biological post treatment similar results were shown by deeb et al 2017 in which a significant removal of formed tps was achieved by a biological post treatment fluidized moving bed reactor these results indicate that the non target approach in combination with meta information such as the aoc is a useful tool to evaluate the efficiency of treatment steps in case of unknown compounds comparing the formation and elimination in fig 7 with the trend of the aoc and the anti androgen activity analysis for the ozone setup of zspec 0 7 a correlation can be observed as the tps are smaller potentially more polar compounds due to oxidation the biological assimilation is promoted so that the increase in aoc should correlate with the number of formed tps this correlation supports the hypothesis that tps are relevant for the aoc result however correlations are based on only one sampling and should be further investigated as peak picking and the identification of features is still difficult especially for tps meta information are very important to reduce the number of relevant features bader et al 2017 brack 2003 itzel et al 2018 weiss et al 2011 4 conclusions this study on the efficiency and evaluation of biological post treatment after ozonation showed that concentrations of known target parameters such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and pesticides cannot be further reduced however endocrine effects could be further reduced in some samples here further investigations must be carried out to examine the possible correlation of anti androgenic effects to formed tps antagonistic activity in general showed no significant reduction during ozonation and should be further monitored as such inhibitory antagonistic effects are also suspected to interfere with the endocrine system of aquatic organisms the high diversity of compounds which is potentially able to lead to an anti androgen effect illustrates the need of further investigations and set up of regulations and limit values to evaluate results of anti androgen as well as anti estrogen activity since biological post treatment steps are installed for the removal of unknown tps formed in ozonation the use of non target screening can be considered very useful for evaluation to evaluate a certain biological post treatment in terms of its biological activity the aoc seems to be a powerful parameter however as this was only shown for one plant experience should be gained by further investigations before a final conclusion can be drawn in combination with non target analysis substances which are not retained and thus are potentially relevant for the receiving water body could thereby be identified in future

18275,to reduce the discharge of trace organic compounds into water bodies associated with potential toxic effects such as endocrine disruption new advanced treatment methods are being investigated at several wastewater treatment plants wwtps one of the most studied and already implemented technologies is ozonation however ozonation only partially oxidizes trace organic compounds troc and as a result transformation products tps with unknown properties can be formed in order to minimise the risk of releasing unknown and potentially toxic tps into surface water it is recommended to install a biological post treatment after ozonation the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a moving bed reactor following ozonation in a full scale plant different ozone dosages zspec 0 3 0 5 0 7 mg o3 mgdoc were investigated to assess the biological activity of the post treatment the assimilable organic carbon aoc was determined in addition to the formed biomass furthermore selected troc were analysed in parallel to monitor the ozonation efficiency at different ozone doses in addition estrogenic androgenic as well as corresponding antagonistic effects were investigated after each treatment step using the a yes and a yas assay a non target screening was performed to evaluate a trend analysis of formed tps as well as their removal by the post treatment procedure the results proved the successful design of the biological post treatment reactor by a constant biofilm development and reduction of the aoc endocrine effects were removed below the limit of detection lod of 10 pg eeq l already after ozonation for all applied ozone doses antagonistic effects were not significantly reduced during ozonation and subsequent biological post treatment for this reason further research is needed to evaluate different post treatment technologies the trend analysis from non target screening data showed a reduction of about 95 of the number of formed tps by the biological post treatment consequently an assessment of the biological activity and the elimination capacity of a certain biological post treatment technique is thus possible by applying the aoc in combination with a non target screening graphical abstract image 1 keywords municipal wastewater treatment advanced oxidation processes ozonation biological post treatment endocrine activity micropollutant removal 1 introduction one major source of trace organic compounds troc in surface waters are wastewater treatment plants wwtps ternes et al 2006 because of the introduction of these compounds into surface waters aquatic organisms may be affected depending on the toxicity of the compounds one example are endocrine effects which can be triggered by naturally excreted hormones as well as by chemicals capable of acting endocrine kidd et al 2007 peschke et al 2014 henneberg et al 2014 especially for non natural endocrine disrupting compounds edcs biological effects could already be observed in very low concentrations such as ng l pg l range aris et al 2014 kidd et al 2007 apart from estrogenic or androgenic effects which are leading to an increased hormonal effect level agonistic activity in organisms there are also inhibitory effects lowering the overall effect level caused by agonists antagonistic activity such an antagonistic activity was still observed during advanced treatment of hospital wastewater in prior studies itzel et al 2018 gehrmann et al 2018 it is worth to note that antagonistic effects especially anti androgen effects can lead to similar effects in organisms compared to estrogens due to the reduction of the androgen level jobling et al 2009 for this reason the potential discharge of antagonistic endocrine active compounds could become important in terms of ecological status of water bodies even by implementing advanced treatment technologies an often applied technique is the use of oxidative processes such as ozonation andreozzi et al 1999 hollender et al 2009 tuerk et al 2010 margot et al 2013 audenaert et al 2014 verlicchi et al 2015 knopp et al 2016 itzel et al 2017 2018 völker et al 2019 in case of ozonation a full mineralization during wastewater treatment is not achieved due to high organic matter contents which is leading to a fast ozone depletion for this reason a transformation of troc is more likely lee et al 2010 however the toxicological characteristics of transformation products tps are difficult to predict and thus lead to increased uncertainty compared to the precursor compound today there are various studies which show contradictory results regarding different toxic effects by tps schmidt et al 2014 knopp et al 2016 lee et al 2016 li et al 2016 itzel et al 2017 knoop et al 2018 in order to minimise the risk of releasing unknown potentially toxic tps into surface water a further post treatment is recommended after ozonation in switzerland gschg 814 20 gschv 814 201 besides legal requirements applying to the swiss plants there are numerous studies recommending the implementation of additional biological post treatment procedures to reduce the potential risk of formed tps during oxidative processes hollender et al 2009 zimmermann et al 2011 prasse et al 2015 applied biological post treatments are for example sand filters moving bed filters and fixed bed reactors additionally granular activated carbon gac are often investigated as sorption technologies in parallel to their biological activity due to the formation of biofilm on the surface knopp et al 2016 böhler et al 2017 bourgin et al 2018 the use of gac filters as biological post treatment by targeted cultivation of biofilm on its surface is also referred to as biologically activated carbon bac filter kalkan et al 2011 partial oxidation during ozonation increases polarity of tps compared with the parent troc due to that reason tps often exhibit a higher bioavailability to organisms hübner et al 2014 for the reduction of tps different post treatment procedures were investigated in the swiss project re treat in this study böhler et al 2017 demonstrated that n nitrosodimethylamine ndma a known cancinerogenic transformation product could be reduced by 66 by a biological sand filter in addition other studies investigating biological post treatment showed a removal of oxidative tps formed during drinking water production indicating the efficiency as well richardson et al 1999 hammes et al 2006 to evaluate different technologies and especially the efficiency of a certain biological post treatment parameters need to be selected which are able to give information about removal toxicity and the bioavailability of the compounds a common evaluation criterion is the removal efficiency of certain indicator parameters such as compounds listed within the european water framework directive eu wfd ec 2000 60 ec 2008 105 eu 2013 39 eu 2018 840 or selected compounds within the swiss legal requirement for evaluation uvek 2016 however after ozonation an integrative approach would be necessary due to unknown tps and potential corresponding ecotoxicological effects effect based methods are a useful tool in order to ascertain the elimination efficiency in terms of genotoxicity cytotoxicity and endocrine activity itzel et al 2017 valitalo et al 2017 however the regulatory measures may make it necessary to identify relevant compounds as well as their emission sources thus effect based analysis can be used as a sensitive screening tool in the first step followed by a more extensive instrumental analysis this approach has already been implemented in some studies in particular the combination of both analysis techniques enables faster and more precise identification through decisive meta information weiss et al 2011 altenburger et al 2015 brack et al 2016 comtois marotte et al 2017 neale et al 2017 tousova et al 2017 itzel et al 2018 especially in terms of tps such an effect based identification approach could help to identify most potent and relevant tps and their fate during treatment as tps potentially exhibit a higher bioavailability the assimilable organic carbon aoc fraction of the dissolved organic carbon doc could be a further important indicator parameter to assess the removal effectivity of a certain post treatment van der kooij 1992 the aoc analysis method was originally developed to determine the biological regrowth potential of freshwater distribution networks van der kooij et al 1989 van der kooij 1992 the correlation of aoc and ozone dose was already observed during ozonation of drinking water indicating the correlation to formed tps van der kooij et al 1989 escobar et al 2001 as the aoc analysis method is based on isolated drinking water specific organisms pseudomonas fluorescens p17 and spirillum species nox the influence of high doc containing wastewater samples remains mostly unknown the aim of this study was to evaluate the full scale ozonation at the wwtp warburg with a biological post treatment in terms of the removal of endocrine activities and potential tps to that end effect based methods using arxula adeninivorans yeast cell assays were applied to determine estrogen androgen as well as anti estrogen and anti androgen effects that are often not investigated but known to be present after ozonation in some cases parallel to effect based methods relevant indicator parameters were measured to characterise the full treatment process to determine the elimination rate of formed tps during a biological post treatment the aoc as a novel parameter in terms of waste water analysis was investigated to further evaluate the elimination efficiency of tps by the biological post treatment a trend analysis was done using a non target approach based on high resolution mass spectrometry hrms measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and standards acetonitrile lc ms grade methanol lc ms grade methyl tert butylether mtbe for residue analysis

mechanical biological municipal wwtp warburg stadtwerke warburg gmbh warburg germany is designed for 70 000 population equivalents pe and receives municipal as well as industrial wastewater since november 2016 an ozonation unit is in operation the advanced treatment unit is designed as a two line full scale ozonation with a moving bed reactor as biological post treatment a detailed scheme is shown in the supplementary information fig si 1 the specific operation parameters of the plant are listed in table 1 2 3 sampling the samples were taken at specific ozone dosages of 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc over a period of three weeks in addition to qualified grab samples 24 h composite samples were taken to assess the general elimination efficiency of the ozonation for selected indicator parameters grab samples were always analysed for all parameters a detailed sampling plan is shown in table si1 2 4 sample preparation 2 4 1 effect based methods sample preparation performed for effect based analysis of edc included a solid phase extraction spe step according to the iso 19040 2 2018 which was carried out within 48 h after sampling at first the cartridge 150 mg 6 ml oasis hlb waters germany was conditioned 2 5 ml methanol and equilibrated 2 5 ml water lc ms grade separate cartridges were loaded with 1000 ml sample after drying the cartridges under vacuum the loaded cartridges were stored at 18 c until further analysis the elution was performed with 5 5 ml mtbe the solvent was evaporated to complete dryness evaporator vapotherm basis mobil i barkley germany at 50 c under a nitrogen gas stream and re dissolved in 2 ml a yes a yas and 4 ml anti a yes anti a yas water lc ms grade resulting in a nominal enrichment factor of 500 and 250 respectively additional to the samples blanks lc ms water as well as positive controls using e2 or dht for the a yes or a yas assay were always measured in parallel respectively 2 4 2 trace organic compounds troc for determination of troc ppcps and pesticides 2 ml of the samples were filtered using syringe filters chromafil rc 45 25 macherey nagel germany and filled into 2 ml glass vials before lc ms ms measurement 10 ng ml internal standards see table si 2 were added 2 4 3 non target analysis the sample preparation for hrms included an enrichment step using spe cartridges 150 mg 6 ml oasis hlb waters germany that was performed as described in section 2 4 1 2 5 biological activity 2 5 1 biofilm growth to monitor biofilm formation in the fluidized moving bed reactor samples of growth bodies anox k5 anoxkaldnes ab sweden were taken as grab samples and analysed for their biofilm mass as the plant was already running for about 24 months a constant biofilm mass was expected the protected surface area for biofilm growth is 800 m2 m³ four samples 40 g each of the exposed growth bodies were placed in a beaker and stored at 50 c overnight two samples were then dried at 105 c for 24 h the two other samples were washed with 50 ml hydrochloric acid 37 followed by ultra pure water in order to remove the biofilm from the growth bodies and then also dried at 105 c for 24 h the calculation of the biofilm mass was based on the difference between the two sets of samples which were treated with and without hydrochloric acid 2 5 2 assimilable organic carbon the measurement of the assimilable organic carbon aoc was performed after van der kooij et al 1982 with the following modifications the aoc was performed with grab samples as 24 h composite samples would not be representative due to microbial degradation to prevent a biodegradation until the measurement the samples were directly filled in sterile 30 ml glass vials and pasteurised at 150 c for 30 min in an oven within 4 h after sampling after pasteurisation the samples were stored at 20 c until further investigation prior to the sample incubation with target organisms the cell cultures had to be prepared for this purpose both freeze dried strains the spirillum strain nox atcc no 49643 usa manassas and the pseudomonas fluorescens strain p 17 atcc no 49642 usa manassas were re suspended in 2 ml sterile drinking water autoclaved and filtered 0 2 μm separately from these suspensions 100 μl were transferred into separate 250 ml sterile erlenmeyer flask containing 125 ml sterile drinking water the cell cultures were incubated at room temperature 15 20 c until the stationary phase was reached over a period of one week 100 μl of the cell cultures were spread onto r2a agar plates on each day and incubated for 3 5 days at 25 c using an incubator colony counting was done manually after reaching the stationary phase both organisms were spiked to the samples at a concentration of 500 cfu ml and incubated for 7 10 days at room temperature 15 20 c to count the formed colonies 100 μl of the samples were spread onto r2a agar in triplicate and incubated for 5 days the nox were identified as small 1 2 mm white colonies and the p 17 as larger 3 4 mm yellow colonies 2 6 estrogen and androgen effects 2 6 1 agonistic effects the enriched and aqueous samples samples without enrichment were analysed using the arxula adeninivorans yeast estrogen and androgen screen assays a yes a yas new diagnostics gmbh berlin germany the measurements of estrogenic effects were done according to the iso 19040 2 2018 and for androgenic effects similar to our prior study itzel et al 2017 the achieved lods were 20 pg eeq l for the a yes and 0 06 ng dhteq l for the a yas enrichment factor of 500 included 2 6 2 antagonistic effects the measurement of antagonistic effects was done similar to the agonistic effects as described in 2 6 1 using the yeast arxula adeninivorans the analyses were done after itzel et al 2018 by spiking a known amount of an agonist to the samples in case of antagonistic estrogenic effects anti a yes 20 μl 17β estradiol solution 1000 ng l were added to samples 380 μl inside the 96 well plate resulting in a final assay concentration of 50 μg ml e2 to investigate antagonistic androgenic effects anti a yas 100 μl dht solution 800 ng l were added to the samples 300 μl inside the 96 well plate resulting in a final assay concentration of 200 μg ml dht after performing the test the detected concentration was set relative to the spiked amount leading to a percentage inhibition 2 7 instrumental analysis 2 7 1 dissolved organic carbon doc was determined with reference to din en 1484 1997 08 for the measurement of doc 20 ml of the sample to be measured were filtered with a syringe filter chromafil rc 45 25 macherey nagel germany and acidified with hydrochloric acid c 2 mol l roth rotipuran ultra 34 to a ph value 2 acidification was done within 24 h after sampling samples were sealed and stored in the refrigerator 8 c until analysis the sample was measured within one week using a toc vcpn analyzer shimadzu deutschland gmbh duisburg germany by catalytic oxidation at 680 c followed by ndir detection 2 7 2 ozone measurement and control the ozone is produced onsite out of technical oxygen using a smoevo 410 ozone generator xylem water solutions deutschland gmbh herford germany the ozone concentration in the product gas is given by the manufacturer by 148 g o3 m³ a defined part of this product gas is than fed into the reaction basin via 7 ceramic diffusor depending of the gas feed and the doc concentration of the water the resulting specific ozone concentration can be calculated additional the potential residual ozone gas is measured by an uv probe lc 400plus xylem water solutions deutschland gmbh herford germany above the ozone reaction chamber at 254 nm the residual off gas is than included within the calculated ozone concentration in the water phase 2 7 3 liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry the samples for determination of troc ppcps and pesticides were analysed without a prior enrichment by lc ms ms using a 1260 infinity lc pump agilent technologies gmbh waldbronn germany with a hts pla autosampler ctc analytics ag zwingen switzerland and a qtrap 6500 ab sciex germany gmbh darmstadt germany tandem mass spectrometer 50 μl of the samples were injected onto a raptor arc 18 column 50 2 1 mm 2 7 μm with a raptor arc 18 guard column 5 2 1 mm 2 7 μm purchased from restek gmbh bad homburg germany a generic gradient of water and acetonitrile both with 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 500 μl min was used for separation the gradient started from 1 acetonitrile to 67 within 8 min followed by 2 min with 99 acetonitrile and 3 min with 1 acetonitrile for equilibration the column temperature was set to 40 c mass spectrometric detection was realised using the scheduled multiple reaction monitoring smrm mode the respective mass transfers ion source setup for measured analytes as well as internal standards used for quantification are listed in table si 2 corresponding limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq are shown in table si 3 2 7 4 high resolution mass spectrometry 2 7 4 1 method parameters for hrms measurements only samples treated with the highest ozone dose were further processed and analysed as these samples should be influenced the most by ozone tps and the effect of the biological post treatment should be best visible at the same time this demonstrates a worst case scenario after eluting the cartridges see 2 4 3 the measurement was done within 48 h chromatographic separation was performed using a dionex ultimate 3000 hplc system thermo scientific bremen germany a gradient method was carried out on a xselect hss t3 2 1 mm 75 mm 3 5 μm particle size column from waters waters milford ma usa the mobile phase consisted of eluent a ultrapure water 0 1 formic acid and eluent b methanol 0 1 formic acid after an isocratic step with 5 b for 5 min the concentration of eluent b was raised to 95 within 10 min and kept constant for 10 min following the initial conditions were reached again within 0 1 min and were kept for 5 min constant to re equilibrate the column the injection volume was 20 μl and the flow rate 0 35 ml min all samples were measured in triplicates mass spectrometric detection was performed on an orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive thermo scientific bremen germany using positive electrospray ionization in separate runs the parameters of the ion source are summarized in table si 4 the full scan hrms spectra m z 100 1000 with a resolution of 70 000 was followed by data dependent ms2 scans of the five most intense ions with a resolution of 17 500 the settings of the full scan ddms2 top 5 measurement are shown in table si 5 mass calibration was performed with the calibration solution pierce ltq velos positive negative ions calibration solution thermo scientific bremen germany before a new measurement series was started in addition a lock mass 391 2843 for positive mode and 265 1476 for negative mode was used further an exclusion list was used to avoid fragmentation scans of continuous background signals see table si 6 2 7 4 2 non target data evaluation the peak processing and peak picking as well as final trend analysis were done by the r r core team 2018 based software tool mzmine 2 version 2 0 pluskal et al 2019 therefore the raw data from lc hrms analysis were loaded as mzxml files into mzmine 2 in a centroided mode the first step was the peak detection therefore the noise level was set to 1 0 104 by manual view into the total ion chromatogram tic of the samples to reduce the number of features from the noise for this reason an additional blank subtraction was not done the peak detection in mzmine 2 is based on the r script xcms and features with a min time span of 0 02 min and a m z tolerance of 0 001 are assigned to one peak to pick relevant peaks and reduce artefacts a chromatogram deconvolution was done by setting the max peak duration to 0 8 min prior to the function chromatogram builder the chromatogram builder generates a list for each detected peak with an m z tolerance of 5 ppm and minimum signal intensity above the set noise level the peak alignment was done to be able to track features during the treatment steps therefore the retention time tolerance was set to 5 an additional isotope pattern comparison was done to improve alignment of corresponding peaks the minimum score of the isotope ratios was set to 85 as a last step the formula prediction was done using a m z tolerance of 5 ppm the ionization type m h isotope pattern as well as ms ms information score threshold of 80 2 7 4 3 suspect target screening after peak picking by the prior non target analysis the sample after ozonation and after biological post treatment were compared with known substances from the iuta database using the open source software tool r r development core team 2019 as well as the platform stoff ident stoff ident 2019 the in house database contains known pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals as well as corresponding tps the exact mass under consideration of ionization m h was used for the database comparison as the analytical methods in the database are different the retention time was not used as identification criterion the mass deviation was set to 5 ppm 3 results and discussion 3 1 biological investigations 3 1 1 biofilm growth the biofilm mass of 30 2 mg per growth body was constant during the sampling campaign in both lines data not shown these results indicate a constant biofilm growth in the lag phase of a typical biofilm growth curve for this reason an ozone entry from the reactor into the biological post treatment could be excluded in an earlier study a decreasing biofilm mass could be observed which was due to ozone input from the reactor gruenebaum et al 2014 since this was not the case in warburg the design of the reaction chambers can be evaluated as successful comparing the biofilm growth bodies by their developed biofilm mass with prior investigations the now used growth bodies showed a 3 times higher biofilm mass per growth body itzel et al 2017 the design of the growth body in this study was different from the one reported by itzel et al 2017 thus a normalization of the surface area was done for both types and it resulted in 12 4 10 3 mg m2 based on manufacturers data of 800 m2 m³ 331 000 pieces m³ type anox k5 used in this study and 3 2 10 3 mg m2 based on manufacturers data of 635 m2 m³ 255 000 pieces m³ type 2h bcp 750 itzel et al 2017 this comparison demonstrates that the biofilm growth bodies used in this study can achieve up to 4 times higher biofilm masses and are potentially more suitable for an efficient post treatment 3 1 2 biological activity the results of the doc measurements showed a significant decrease to a minimum of 6 mg l after conventional wastewater treatment due to the biological assimilation a further reduction by ozonation and subsequent moving bed reactor was not observed since ozonation does not completely mineralize the organic content a conversion of compounds to tps is more likely which is reflected in a constant doc through the oxidative treatment as smaller polar molecules are more easily accessible to microorganisms the formation of corresponding tps should lead to higher biological activity after ozonation von gunten 2003 this is shown by an increasing aoc concentration fig 1 parallel to an increasing ozone dose comparable to van der kooij et al 1989 and escobar et al 2001 the significant drop of the aoc to 100 25 μg carbon l for all ozone doses clearly demonstrates the biological activity of the post treatment by a high assimilation of degradable organic compounds especially for the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc a significant increase in activity factor 2 as well as a decrease after biological post treatment was observed these results show that this specific biological post treatment setup has the potential to remove the bioavailable organic carbon fraction which originates from tps during ozonation the investigation of the biological activity demonstrates that the aoc could be a powerful parameter to describe the effectivity of a certain biological post treatment in terms of the reduction of tps formed during ozonation bourgin et al 2018 compared different biological post treatment processes in pilot scale after the full scale ozonation at the wwtp neugut dübendorf switzerland a threefold increase of the aoc was observed at a specific ozone dose of 0 55 mgo3 mgdoc which is higher compared to the here observed increase shown in fig 1 this difference could be explained by different wastewater composition at different wwtps the results of bourgin et al 2018 showed the highest aoc removal of 50 70 for gac filters due to the additional sorption the sand filter showed still a high abatement of 40 the moving bed reactor had the lowest removal rate of 13 17 which contradicts the results obtained in our study however the aoc method applied in this study after van der kooij et al 1982 is optimised for drinking water samples with low levels of bacteria nutrients and doc and not for wastewater during the experiments in the laboratory some wwtp influent samples could not be evaluated due to high bacterial background leading to false values therefore this method needs to be adapted and optimised for an accurate and robust measurement in wastewater matrix as the applied method of van der kooij 1982 uses organisms isolated from drinking water a more natural inoculum isolated from wastewater could help to overcome matrix problems this approach of analysing by a natural microbial consortium of the respective sample was already applied by hammes et al 2005 using fluorescenes staining combined with flow cytometry 3 2 endocrine effects and compounds 3 2 1 estrogen activity the results of the estrogen effects fig 2 measured with the a yes assay showed the highest activity of 0 15 ng eeq l in week 2 this value is already below the proposed effect based trigger value of 0 4 ng eeq l jarosova et al 2014 kunz et al 2015 in week 1 no estrogen activity was detected in the inlet of the treatment plant possibly due to the type of sample grab sample thus no data on elimination by conventional waste water treatment can be provided the results for the ozonation showed a significant decrease below the lod of 0 02 ng eeq l in week 2 and 3 at zspec 0 5 and 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc respectively such an elimination rate is comparable to prior studies using ozone in full scale in which a reduction below the lod was observed as well itzel et al 2017 the achieved elimination rates in relation to the effluent of the wastewater treatment plant were 55 80 and 90 for the ozone doses of zspec 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc the moving bed reactor further removed the estrogenic effect at a zspec of 0 3 mgo3 mgdoc which was below the lod the results for anti estrogenic effects showed the highest inhibition in the inflow of the wastewater treatment plant 90 inhibition an anti estrogenic effect was observed in week 1 zspec 0 3 mgo3 mgdoc after conventional treatment and ozonation indicating a lower reduction due to ozonation compared to agonistic estrogen effects this could be an indication that either compounds acting as anti estrogens are not reduced by ozonation or formed tps during ozonation could cause an anti estrogenic effect in a recent study by knoop et al 2018 in which anti estrogen effects of tps from the anti estrogen pharmaceutical tamoxifene were investigated during ozonation it could be shown that the total effect was not reduced this is an indication that tps contributed to the overall effect and thus compensated for the reduction of tamoxifen regarding the biological post treatment a further reduction below 10 could be observed for the sample in week 3 zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc this is comparable to a prior study by itzel et al 2018 at a hospital wwtp using granular activated carbon gac as post treatment indicating that antagonistic active compounds could be rather biological available or adsorbing to surfaces which is also shown by elimination rates of already 60 70 during conventional treatment fig 3 the relatively high anti estrogen activity that occurs after biological post treatment in week 2 zspec 0 5 mgo3 mgdoc may be due to a peak value specific for this week as the cell growth of the bioassay was always checked a false positive result from the assay can be excluded however as this increase after biological post treatment is only detected in this single sample further investigations should be done to verify the results comparing the anti estrogen activity our results are different from prior studies investigating full scale ozonation at hospital wastewater treatment plants gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2018 in those studies a constant anti estrogenic effect was observed during the conventional biological wastewater treatment and advanced treatment using ozonation gehrmann et al 2018 furthermore even an increasing trend during conventional treatment was observed itzel et al 2018 since the composition of hospital wastewater differs from that of municipal wastewater anti estrogenic effects could be attributed to different compounds characteristic for hospital wastewater and municipal wastewater this fact should be investigated in more detail to identify relevant anti estrogen active compounds in a study by buckley 2010 a relative inhibition of estrogenic activity by the wwtp effluent of about 50 was observed therewith a further treatment combination seems to be necessary to improve the reduction of anti estrogen effects as well however as the effluent activity seems to be highly variable more samples should be investigated to make a representative statement about the inhibition by anti estrogenic compounds 3 2 2 androgen activity the results of androgen activity measured by the a yas are shown in fig 4 due to grab sampling at different weeks the influent concentrations vary between lod and 0 75 ng dhteq l the elimination rates were between 50 and 70 compared to the effluent of the wwtp at high ozone concentrations the highest elimination would be expected however the ratio seems to remain constant which is probably due to variations prior to ozonation however since this assumption is based on only two out of three samples further measurements should be performed in future these results are in accordance to those found in prior investigations with elimination rates of about 30 60 itzel et al 2017 a further reduction by the biological post treatment was not observed however the proposed human trigger value of 11 ng dhteq l is not exceeded and therewith a risk for human health can be excluded brand et al 2013 nevertheless this trigger value was derived for drinking water and is only relevant for humans effects on aquatic organisms are not considered compared to detected androgen activities anti androgen activity showed a contrary result fig 5 in the wwtp influent an inhibition of up to 100 was observed however only one sample of week 2 showed an inhibition due to the detected effects after the conventional treatment one explanation could be that compounds are already in the influent and getting effective after metabolization during biological processes quality control samples did not indicate any interferences like growth inhibition or photometric absorption effects by the sample itself so that the effect detected can be attributed to pure anti androgen activity samples from the wwtp effluent influent ozonation showed inhibitions of 20 60 comparing the samples an increasing trend can be observed during ozonation the biological post treatment showed almost no further reduction of anti androgen activity only at the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc week 3 a significant reduction could be observed this trend can also be observed for the aoc indicating a potential correlation of tps to anti androgen activity however a residual inhibition of about 40 60 independent of the applied ozone dose illustrates the need of future identification of relevant compounds a similar trend of increased activity after ozonation was already shown in a different study investigating hospital wastewater after full scale ozonation gehrmann et al 2018 itzel et al 2018 the release of anti androgen active compounds to the receiving surface water can lead to ecotoxicological issues similar to those by estrogens in a study by jobling et al 2009 it was demonstrated that anti androgens are responsible for sexual disruption in fish of rivers in the uk one option to further reduce anti androgen activity after ozone treatment could be the application of granular activated carbon gac itzel et al 2018 due to the ecological relevance of anti androgen active compounds several studies started to identify potential candidates of known compounds compounds being under suspicion are highly diverse including pcbs pahs flame retardants pesticides as well as pharmaceuticals liscio et al 2014 li et al 2013 kortenkamp et al 2014 rostkowski et al 2011 due to the large variety of compounds able to act as endocrine disruptors effect based trigger values ebt for direct application of bioassay results for regulatory measures are in discussion van der oost et al 2017 escher et al 2018 wernersson et al 2015 3 3 chemical target analysis 3 3 1 ppcps and pesticides for ozone control due to ozonation system failure at the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc grab samples were taken instead of 24 h composite samples for this setting for the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc the elimination for all ppcps was around 86 and thus within the swiss regulation of 80 annual average elimination gschv 814 201 elimination of 24 h composite samples would be expected to be 80 for zspec 0 7 as prior investigations showed elimination of 80 at already significantly lower specific ozone dosage of zspec 0 3 0 4 mgo3 mgdoc abegglen et al 2009 hollender et al 2009 götz et al 2011 since the pesticides were always determined from the collected grab samples the results were not influenced by the failure of ozonation during the 24 h sampling as expected the highest elimination rate was at the highest ozone dose zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc all results of single compounds are shown in fig si 2 3 4 hrms analysis 3 4 1 non target analyses processing of the non target data using the software mzmine 2 resulted in 822 detected features in the inflow of ozonation at the highest ozone dose of zspec 0 7 mgo3 mgdoc the peak alignment and following trend analysis showed a reduction of the number of features by 60 resulting in 336 residual features simultaneously the formation of 241 new features by ozonation was observed as the spe as well as the chromatographic method during the lc run was done by a balanced phase polar non polar also tps should be detected to some extent however this procedure also represents a certain selectivity which limits the analytical window nevertheless the 241 features only detected after ozonation are highly probable to be tps the predicted sum formulae support the assumption by a high number of oxygen atoms compared to other features si chapter 1 4 2 a further data filtration was done to evaluate the elimination efficiency of the biological post treatment the result showed the elimination of 230 tps from ozonation 11 residual features leading to a tp elimination rate of 95 by the biological post treatment this tracking of formed and eliminated tps shows the efficiency of the post treatment after ozone fig 6 the suspect target screening was performed by comparing the detected features with an in house database containing tps of common indicator parameter such as described in 3 3 1 resulted in 6 hits of known tps after ozonation table 2 a further tracking of those identified tps through the biological post treatment resulted in no hits for this reason the detected targets are likely to get completely retained or degraded by the biological post treatment as the 11 formed compounds are released into the receiving water they are of major interest due to lack of information about their toxicity and structure the corresponding ms2 spectra retention times as well as predicted sum formulae are shown in table si 7 the further suspect screening using the in house database showed no results for the 11 released compounds these results are only based on a single random sample and further sampling should be done to assess the relevance of these 11 compounds the trends of individual peaks which were detected through the whole treatment are shown in fig 8 in total profiles could be created from influent ozone to the effluent post treatment of all 822 peaks detected in the influent ozone the results could be clustered into three major groups increasing after biological post treatment constant during biological post treatment and elimination during biological post treatment fig 7 the first group comprising increasing signal area of detected features could be due to matrix interferences as the increase shown on the left of fig 7 is not significant when compared to the influent the second group of constant signal area of detected features are compounds not influenced by ozonation and biological post treatment or formed compounds not further reduced by the post treatment as already shown in table si 7 by 11 residual tps the last group of decreasing signal area could be attributed to compounds which are biologically degradable and getting reduced by the biological post treatment in this case formed tps are shown which are completely removed as well as compounds which remained rather constant during ozonation but reduced in the biological post treatment similar results were shown by deeb et al 2017 in which a significant removal of formed tps was achieved by a biological post treatment fluidized moving bed reactor these results indicate that the non target approach in combination with meta information such as the aoc is a useful tool to evaluate the efficiency of treatment steps in case of unknown compounds comparing the formation and elimination in fig 7 with the trend of the aoc and the anti androgen activity analysis for the ozone setup of zspec 0 7 a correlation can be observed as the tps are smaller potentially more polar compounds due to oxidation the biological assimilation is promoted so that the increase in aoc should correlate with the number of formed tps this correlation supports the hypothesis that tps are relevant for the aoc result however correlations are based on only one sampling and should be further investigated as peak picking and the identification of features is still difficult especially for tps meta information are very important to reduce the number of relevant features bader et al 2017 brack 2003 itzel et al 2018 weiss et al 2011 4 conclusions this study on the efficiency and evaluation of biological post treatment after ozonation showed that concentrations of known target parameters such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and pesticides cannot be further reduced however endocrine effects could be further reduced in some samples here further investigations must be carried out to examine the possible correlation of anti androgenic effects to formed tps antagonistic activity in general showed no significant reduction during ozonation and should be further monitored as such inhibitory antagonistic effects are also suspected to interfere with the endocrine system of aquatic organisms the high diversity of compounds which is potentially able to lead to an anti androgen effect illustrates the need of further investigations and set up of regulations and limit values to evaluate results of anti androgen as well as anti estrogen activity since biological post treatment steps are installed for the removal of unknown tps formed in ozonation the use of non target screening can be considered very useful for evaluation to evaluate a certain biological post treatment in terms of its biological activity the aoc seems to be a powerful parameter however as this was only shown for one plant experience should be gained by further investigations before a final conclusion can be drawn in combination with non target analysis substances which are not retained and thus are potentially relevant for the receiving water body could thereby be identified in future

engineering yale university new haven ct 06511 united states department of chemical and environmental engineering yale university new haven ct 06511 united states department of chemical and environmental engineering yale university new haven ct 06511 united states corresponding author minimal and zero liquid discharge mld zld are wastewater management strategies that are attracting heightened attention worldwide while conventional reverse osmosis ro has been proposed as a promising technology in desalination and mld zld processes its application is limited by the maximum hydraulic pressures that current ro membranes and modules can withstand in this study we develop low salt rejection ro lsrro a novel staged ro process that employs low salt rejection membranes to desalinate or concentrate highly saline feed streams requiring only moderate hydraulic pressures based on process modeling we demonstrate that lsrro can overcome the hydraulic pressure limitations of conventional ro achieving hypersaline brine salinities 4 0 m nacl or 234 g l 1 nacl that are required for mld zld applications without using excessively high hydraulic pressures 70 bar in addition we show that the energy efficiency of lssro is substantially higher than traditional thermally driven phase change based technologies such as mechanical vapor compressor mvc for example to concentrate a saline feed stream from 0 1 to 1 0 m nacl the specific energy consumption s e c of 4 stage lsrro ranges from 2 4 to 8 0 kwh of electrical energy per m3 of feedwater treated around four times less than that of mvc which requires 20 25 kwhe m 3 furthermore compared to osmotically mediated ro technologies that require bilateral countercurrent stages to treat hypersaline brines lsrro is eminently more practical as it can be readily implemented by using loose ro or nanofiltration membranes in conventional ro our study highlights lsrro s potential for energy efficient brine concentration using moderate hydraulic pressures which would drastically improve the energetic and economic performance of mld zld processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords desalination reverse osmosis zero liquid discharge minimal liquid discharge brine concentration 1 introduction with the ever growing industrial activities a substantial amount of freshwater drawn from the environment turns to industrial wastewaters urban 2017 the discharge of inappropriately treated industrial wastewaters into the environment leads to the severe pollution of aquatic ecosystems and can contaminate freshwater resources exacerbating water scarcity grant et al 2012 schwarzenbach et al 2010 shaffer et al 2013 driven by intensifying freshwater scarcity worldwide regulations governing industrial wastewater disposal are becoming stricter hoekstra 2014 in some scenarios zero liquid discharge zld is required madwar and tarazi 2003 onishi et al 2018 tong and elimelech 2016 zld has also been proposed for brine management of inland desalination plants as previously practiced management strategies such as deep well injection and evaporation ponds are not permitted mickley 2008 xevgenos et al 2016 in zld processes all of the water in wastewater streams is recovered and reused leaving only solid waste which can be disposed in a safer and more environmentally friendly manner in addition minimal liquid discharge mld processes which target a water recovery up to 95 rather than the 100 required for zld have been proposed for scenarios in which the use of zld is cost prohibitive due to its high energy and capital requirements hermsen et al 2016 hotchkies 2018 hence mld allows the optimization of water recovery with consideration of capital and operation costs as well as environmental impact currently zld is achieved using thermally driven phase change based processes onishi et al 2017 tong and elimelech 2016 specifically the feed wastewater is first pretreated to reduce its inorganic scaling potential before entering a brine concentrator and a brine crystallizer in which water is removed through evaporation the clean water or distillate which is recovered by condensing the water vapor produced can be reused for various industrial applications and the solids deposited in the crystallizer can be further treated for resource recovery or sent for waste disposal for the brine concentrator mechanical vapor compressor mvc is commonly used due to its superior energy efficiency compared to other phase change based desalination technologies al karaghouli and kazmerski 2013 schwantes et al 2018 thiel et al 2015 yaqub and lee 2019 however even with mvc the energy consumption for wastewater concentration is still high typically 20 25 kwh of electrical energy per m3 of feedwater treated davenport et al 2018 mickley 2008 schwantes et al 2018 in addition the capital costs of mvc are very high due to the extensive use of stainless steel and titanium for corrosion resistance bostjancic and ludlum 2013 eastern municipal water district carollo engineers 2008 in mld filtration based processes are employed instead of thermally drive phase change based processes thus substantially reducing the energy consumption of mld systems compared to zld dow 2016 reverse osmosis ro which is the most energy efficient desalination technology is commonly used in mld bartholomew et al 2017 chen and yip 2018 elimelech and phillip 2011 greenlee et al 2009 lin and elimelech 2015 werber et al 2017 typically ro can concentrate wastewater up to 70 000 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds for handling a wastewater with 35 000 mg l 1 tds i e seawater concentration the water recovery with ro is limited to around 50 high pressure ro hpro systems have been recently proposed to further increase the water recovery in ro davenport et al 2018 schantz et al 2018 in hpro the brine concentration can be elevated to 250 000 mg l 1 which corresponds to a water recovery of 85 when treating wastewater with 35 000 mg l 1 tds however so far hpro is still under development as both the design and fabrication of ro membranes and membrane modules that can withstand the high hydraulic pressures required 200 bar to reach 250 000 mg l 1 tds are extremely challenging to reduce the hydraulic pressure requirement of ro in mld novel ro based technologies including osmotically assisted ro oaro and cascading osmotically mediated ro comro have been proposed bartholomew et al 2017 2018 chen and yip 2018 however the application of these alternative ro based technologies continues to be limited by the practical challenges associated with building bilateral countercurrent modules that function under the operating pressures used in conventional ro therefore the development of novel technologies that can concentrate wastewater to high salinities with moderate pressure and energy consumption is essential to enable efficient and effective mld and zld processes in this study we present a novel low salt rejection reverse osmosis lsrro technology that employs loose ro membranes to enable energy efficient mld zld processes we first introduce the working principles of lsrro using process modeling we then demonstrate the potential for 2 stage lsrro to achieve high brine concentrations using only moderate hydraulic pressures and discuss the interplay between brine concentration and specific energy consumption s e c lastly we calculate the s e c required to concentrate a range of saline feed waters to the salinities required for mld zld using lsrro configurations with different number of stages highlighting the vast potential of lsrro brine concentration 2 reverse osmosis with low salt rejection membranes 2 1 limitations of conventional ro for brine concentration in conventional ro operation a high pressure pump is used to increase the hydraulic pressure δ p of the saline feed stream fig 1 a once δ p exceeds the osmotic pressure of the saline feed stream δ π water from the feed permeates through the ro membrane yielding pure product or permeate water and concentrated brine or retentate an energy recovery device is often used to recover mechanical energy from the pressurized brine stream reducing the overall energy consumption during operation the osmotic pressure of the brine stream π b increases with its salt concentration c b with π b linearly proportional to c b when the van t hoff approximation applies murad and powles 1993 pitzer 1973 and δ π π b as the osmotic pressure of the product water is negligible fig 1b based on these working principles of ro the maximum c b is achieved when π b δ p and thus c b is restricted by δ p in practice due to the detrimental effects of high hydraulic pressures on membrane transport properties coday et al 2013 rautenbach et al 2000 straub et al 2015 δ p is usually 85 bar baker 2012 mulder 1996 typically δ p in most ro operations is limited to 70 bar resulting in a maximum c b of 1 4 m nacl or 82 000 mg l 1 tds fig 1b in seawater ro c b is usually 1 2 m nacl 70 000 mg l 1 tds davenport et al 2018 for mld zld processes c b needs to be 4 m nacl i e 250 000 mg l 1 tds the typical inlet feed to a crystallizer davenport et al 2018 tong and elimelech 2016 such high c b values require a δ p of 200 bar in conventional ro for simplicity of calculations and presentation of results hereafter all concentrations denoted by c and regardless of the subscript are presented as molar concentrations as nacl 2 2 working principles of low salt rejection ro lsrro to overcome the limit of the δ p that is feasible in conventional ro we propose a novel staged ro technology using low salt rejection ro membranes lsrro the working principle of an n stage lsrro is schematically shown in fig 2 in an n stage lsrro a regular high rejection ro membrane is employed in the 1st stage i e the salt rejection r 1 is assumed to be 100 with loose low rejection ro membranes utilized in subsequent stages i e the salt rejection r i of the ith stage is less than 100 for i 2 to n in this study unless particularly stated all the salt rejections refer to the observed salt rejection at the specified stage i e r 1 c p c f the saline feed is pressurized by a high pressure pump before entering the 1st stage where freshwater is produced assuming that parasitic pressure losses in the membrane module are negligible the brine or retentate stream from the ith stage i e brine i which remains pressurized as the entering feed serves as feed for the i 1th stage the permeate from the i 1th stage i e permeate i 1 is repressurized and cycled back to the ith stage as additional feed with the final brine being generated by the n th stage like conventional ro lsrro employs an energy recovery device to recover mechanical energy from the final brine stream thereby lowering energy consumption with a fixed δ p and complete rejection r 1 100 in the 1st stage of lsrro the concentration of brine 1 c b 1 is such that the osmotic pressure of brine 1 π b 1 is equal to δ p as in conventional ro in the 2nd stage since the salt rejection r 2 is less than 100 permeate 2 is saline water with a non zero osmotic pressure π p 2 following the limiting case principle for which δ π δ p the osmotic pressure of brine 2 π b 2 is π p 2 δ p since δ π π b 2 π p 2 δ p consequently the corresponding concentration of brine 2 c b 2 would be higher than c b 1 on the other hand if r 2 is 100 there would be no water permeation in the 2nd stage since π b 1 δ p thereby c b 2 would be the same as c b 1 in other words for a given δ p the brine stream can be concentrated to higher salinities using a 2 stage lsrro than conventional 2 stage ro likewise additional low salt rejection stages enable further brine concentration allowing multi stage lsrro to overcome the limitation of δ p fixing brine concentration 3 brine concentration and energy consumption in two stage lsrro 3 1 brine concentration to further elucidate the working principles of lsrro a mass balance was performed for a 2 stage lsrro configuration fig s1 in supplementary materials the final brine concentration in 2 stage lsrro c b can be calculated as a function of salt rejection in the second stage r 2 and applied pressure δ p detailed derivation in supplementary materials 1 c b 2 r 2 δ p v r g t where v is the van t hoff dissociation parameter e g v 2 for nacl r g is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature according to eq 1 for given δ p c b increases as r 2 is reduced as shown in fig 3 a for a 0 6 m saline feed using δ p of 70 bar and r 2 of 50 c b can reach over 2 1 m which is 50 greater than the maximum brine concentration attainable in conventional ro 1 4 m for r 2 100 the increase in c b is attributed to the saline permeate that results from the low salt rejection of the loose ro membrane in the 2nd stage for a given δ p a lower salt rejection in the 2nd stage leads to a higher salinity permeate 2 i e the permeate from the 2nd stage with a more concentrated permeate 2 the osmotic pressure of the final brine i e the sum of the permeate osmotic pressure and δ p is larger thereby leading to a higher corresponding c b in addition based on eq 1 for a given r 2 c b is directly proportional to δ p for concentrating a 0 6 m saline feed stream using 2 stage lsrro with r 2 50 c b can be elevated from 2 1 to 2 4 m as δ p is increased from 70 to 80 bar fig 3b the dependence of c b on δ p can be explained by the correlation between salt concentration and osmotic pressure in this analysis we use the van t hoff approximation a larger δ p results in a higher osmotic pressure of the brine which corresponds to a higher c b 3 2 energy consumption high salinity brine concentration processes are inherently energy intensive and in addition to c b energy efficiency is an important performance metric in saline feed concentration processes mistry et al 2011 tong and elimelech 2016 to quantify the energy efficiency specific energy consumption s e c is calculated by definition s e c is the energy consumed per unit volume reduction of the saline feed which corresponds to the volume of the purified water produced assuming an ideal energy recovery device i e a device that can recovery 100 of the energy embedded in the final brine we can obtain a simple analytical expression for the s e c detailed derivation in supplementary materials 2 s e c 1 q p 2 q p δ p where q p and q p 2 are the permeate flow rates from the first and second stages respectively for a given δ p fig 3a shows that both c b and s e c increase as r 2 is decreased indicating that achieving a higher brine concentration using ro membranes with lower salt rejections increases energy consumption according to eq 2 at a fixed δ p s e c is determined by q p 2 q p by performing a mass balance detailed derivation in supplementary materials q p 2 q p can be expressed as a function of r 2 and δ p 3 q p 2 q p 1 r 2 c 0 v r g t r 2 2 r 2 δ p r 2 c 0 v r g t based on eq 3 with the other parameters fixed q p 2 q p monotonically increases with a decrease in r 2 resulting in higher s e c as shown in fig 3a in other words lowering r 2 produces a larger permeate 2 as the net effective pressure across the membrane δ p π b 1 π p 2 increases an increase in the volumetric flow rate of permeate 2 q p 2 which must be repressurized before being recycled back to the 1st stage leads to an increased s e c for a given r 2 s e c first decreases and then increases with increasing δ p whereas c b increases linearly with δ p fig 3b such a dependence of s e c on δ p suggests that there exists an optimal δ p in lsrro that minimizes the energy consumption required to achieve a specified c b the impact of δ p on s e c is described by eqs 2 and 3 since an elevated δ p leads to a decreased q p 2 q p eq 3 s e c which is a product of 1 q p 2 q p and δ p eq 2 is not a monotonic function of δ p the synergistic effect of r 2 and δ p on c b and s e c in 2 stage lsrro is illustrated in fig 3c in general c b can be increased by lowering r 2 and increasing δ p though this leads to a larger required s e c however for the same s e c different c b values can be obtained by varying r 2 and δ p for instance to concentrate a 0 6 m saline feed with a s e c of 3 kwhe m 3 c b can reach either 2 5 m with a r 2 of 0 23 and δ p of 70 bar or 1 4 m with a r 2 of 0 22 and δ p of 38 bar therefore the applied pressure and salt rejection of each stage must be optimized to maximize the performance of an lsrro system i e achieve the highest c b with the smallest s e c 3 3 water recovery freshwater recovery r w defined as the ratio of the produced freshwater to the saline feed flow rates has also been investigated in 2 stage lsrro a higher r w is critical in wastewater and brackish water desalination as smaller volumes of waste streams or brines are produced and larger volumes of freshwater are recovered and reused as shown in fig 3d r w increases with c b a direct result of the mass balances of salt and water due to the mass balance of salt a higher c b corresponds to a smaller flow rate of brine according to the mass balance of water a smaller flow rate of brine suggests a larger flow rate of produced freshwater thereby resulting in a higher r w therefore with a moderate δ p lsrro not only increases the final brine concentration but also boosts the freshwater recovery compared to conventional ro additionally fig 3c and d clearly suggests that s e c increases with c b indicating that to achieve a higher r w in lsrro a larger s e c is required 4 multistage lsrro for mld zld 4 1 brine concentration for mld zld following the working principle described above the theoretical maximum achievable brine concentration c b m a x in an n stage lsrro is 4 c b m a x n δ p m a x v r g t where δ p m a x is the maximum applied hydraulic pressure to achieve c b m a x the salt rejections of each stage must approach zero except for the 1st stage where salt rejection is 100 in such a configuration the maximum concentration of brine 1 from the 1st stage c b 1 based on the van t hoff approximation would be δ p m a x v r g t since δ π 1 δ p m a x using brine 1 as the feed for the 2nd stage and given the salt rejection in the 2nd stage is close to 0 the concentration of permeate 2 from the 2nd stage is close to the concentration of feed 2 i e δ p m a x v r g t in the 2nd stage because of the equilibrium of pressure i e δ π 2 δ p m a x the concentration of brine 2 would be closed to 2 δ p m a x v r g t likewise in the ith stage the concentration of brine i would be close to i δ p m a x v r g t implying that the maximum final brine concentration c b m a x approaches n δ p m a x v r g t the maximum exit brine concentration c b m a x in lsrro for various stage numbers is presented in fig 4 a it is clearly shown that lsrro with more stages can achieve higher c b m a x for mld zld processes the brine concentration needs to reach 4 m the typical feed concentration for a brine crystallizer green dashed line fig 4a suggests that concentrating saline feeds using lsrro with 2 stages and δ p m a x 70 bar is insufficient for mld zld as the resulting c b m a x is less than 3 m hence at least 3 stages are needed to attain c b m a x 4 m 4 2 energy consumption in multi stage lsrro the s e c in 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro can be obtained using detailed derivation in supplementary materials 5 s e c n 3 1 q p 2 q p q p 3 q p δ p 6 s e c n 4 1 q p 2 q p q p 3 q p q p 4 q p δ p where q p i is the permeate flow rate from the ith stage and q p is the flow rate of the produced freshwater in the lsrro system since the specific energy consumption of the ith stage s e c i can be calculated as q p i δ p q p and s e c 1 δ p a straightforward interpretation of eqs 5 and 6 is that the total s e c in an lsrro system is the sum of s e c in each stage fig 4b compares the s e c in 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro for concentrating different saline feed concentrations for mld zld applications i e c b 4 m the s e c values presented were obtained by performing a system scale optimization for δ p and salt rejections details in supplementary materials the optimal salt rejections and δ p together with the resulted permeate flow rates and s e c are summarized in table 1 the s e c of 4 stage lsrro orange columns is significantly smaller than that of 3 stage lsrro red columns for concentrating each saline feed to mld zld to elucidate the difference in s e c of lsrro with different number of stages according to eqs 5 and 6 we have broken the s e c to the contribution of each stage to the total energy consumption the s e c of each stage in 3 stage red columns and 4 stage orange columns lsrro for concentrating 0 6 m saline feed to 4 m with δ p m a x 70 b a r is shown in fig 4c the s e c in the 1st stage s e c 1 of 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro is approximately the same because s e c 1 is equal to δ p we note that for these lsrro systems δ p is close to 70 bar table 1 and thus s e c 1 is similar the distinctive s e c of 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro results from the sum of s e c i in the low salt rejection stages i 2 n s e c i since δ p is similar and q p is the same for c b 4 m based on eqs 5 and 6 i 2 n s e c i is dictated by i 2 n q p i as shown in table 1 i 2 4 q p i is smaller than i 2 3 q p i which is ascribed to the much lower salt rejection rates in 3 stage lsrro than those in 4 stage lsrro therefore to achieve a certain c b lsrro with more stages could be more energy efficient i e have a lower s e c due to the smaller permeate flow rates produced from the low salt rejection stages for repressurization and recirculation s e c also varies for concentrating saline feeds with different concentration c 0 in mld zld practices fig 4b to better understand the relationship between s e c and c 0 the s e c of each stage in 4 stage lsrro with c 0 0 1 m yellow columns and c 0 0 6 m orange columns is shown in fig 4d as with the s e c of other lsrro configurations s e c 1 in 4 stage lsrro is similar for two different c 0 values as discussed previously the weak dependence of s e c 1 on c 0 is attributed to the similar δ p table 1 the dependence of the overall s e c of 4 stage lsrro on c 0 is driven by the different permeate flow rates in the low salt rejection stages table 1 to achieve a certain c b with a lower c 0 the produced permeate flow rate from the 1st stage is larger and thus the feed flow rate i e brine 1 from the 1st stage entering the low salt rejection stages is smaller consequently all the flow rates including the permeate flow rates in the low salt rejection stages are smaller hence less energy is needed to repressurize the smaller recirculating streams resulting in a lower s e c therefore for mld zld using lsrro the lower the feed salinity is the lower s e c is required our above analysis shows that the s e c of lsrro is determined by the permeate flow rates in the low salt rejection stages in addition to salt rejections and δ p the permeate flow rates are also dependent on the number of stages and feed salinity for concentrating 0 6 m saline feed for mld zld i e c b 4 m using 4 stage lsrro the s e c is 5 2 kwhe m 3 in contrast the s e c of mvc which is the most efficient phase change based desalination technology ranges from 20 to 25 kwhe m 3 mickley 2008 schwantes et al 2018 which is substantially larger than that of 4 stage lsrro such significant difference in s e c can be attributed to the inherent distinction between phase change based processes such as mvc multi effect distillation multi stage flash and membrane distillation and pressure driven membrane separations i e ro deshmukh et al 2018 elimelech and phillip 2011 mistry et al 2011 2013 mistry and lienhard 2013 warsinger et al 2015 in thermally driven phase change based processes the majority of the input energy is used to evaporate water resulting in an s e c that is similar in magnitude to the latent heat of vaporization by contrast in pressure driven separation processes the energy is mainly used to separate water from salts and the s e c is within the same order of magnitude as the gibbs free energy of separation since the latent heat of evaporation is much higher than the gibbs free energy of separation the s e c of pressure driven separation technologies is much smaller than that of thermal phase change based technologies we further note that the s e c of lsrro increases with c 0 while the s e c of thermal distillation technologies is nearly independent of feed concentration with a high c 0 of 1 m the s e c of 4 stage lsrro for mld zld is 8 0 kwhe m 3 fig 4b table 1 which is still substantially lower than the s e c of thermal distillation technologies 20 25 kwhe m 3 with a lower c 0 the s e c is even smaller e g s e c 2 4 kwhe m 3 for c 0 0 1 m the s e c of lsrro could be further reduced by using more stages fig 4b table 1 the relatively small energy consumption of lsrro compared to the most energy efficient thermal phase change based technologies highlights the potential of lsrro for mld zld applications 5 practical considerations of lsrro recently several membrane based technologies for high salinity waters have been proposed such as osmotically assisted ro oaro bartholomew et al 2017 2018 and cascading osmotically mediated ro comro chen and yip 2018 these osmotically mediated ro technologies utilize a saline stream on the permeate side of the membrane to lower the hydraulic pressure required to concentrate high salinity brines for mld zld processes unlike conventional ro and lsrro both oaro and comro are based on bilateral countercurrent modules in which the pressurized high salinity feed stream is contacted with a lower salinity permeate stream consequently the implementation of osmotically mediated desalination processes is drastically constrained by two major inherent challenges i maintaining cross flow on the permeate side of the membrane while using spacers that are dense enough to limit membrane deformation and prevent the collapse of permeate side flow channel under the high hydraulic pressures required and ii internal concentration polarization icp in the membrane support layer as discussed below the countercurrent modules required for oaro and comro are similar to those used in forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro in which spacers are needed to simultaneously maintain channel geometry and enhance mass transfer near the membrane surface koutsou et al 2009 shakaib et al 2009 she et al 2013 in contrast to conventional ro and lsrro oaro and comro require loose spacer configurations in both the feed and permeate channels in order to permit the high crossflow rates required on both sides of the membrane however using loose or low density channel spacers on the low pressure side of a pressurized membrane module can lead to highly detrimental membrane deformation previous studies on pro in which loose feed side spacers are used to maintain crossflow without incurring excessive parasitic pressure losses have shown a rapid deterioration in membrane performance due to deformation and rupture at hydraulic pressures of around 55 bar straub et al 2014 2015 similarly applying a high feed side hydraulic pressure in osmotically mediated processes such as oaro and comro that require low density permeate side spacers will likely lead to significant membrane deformation as the membrane is pressed against the loose spacer in the low pressure permeate channel kim and elimelech 2012 she et al 2013 such membrane deformation is highly detrimental to membrane performance as the water permeability and solute selectivity are reduced while the pressure drop in the permeate channel is increased furthermore as the hydraulic pressure exceeds 55 bar current thin film composite membranes may fail catastrophically due to membrane rupture straub et al 2014 2015 mitigating membrane deformation requires the use of relatively dense spacer configurations to adequately support the membrane polymer however using dense spacers in a channel with significant crossflow will result in large parasitic pressure losses that can drastically increase energy consumption hickenbottom et al 2016 schock and miquel 1987 straub et al 2016 wang et al 2016 in addition to membrane deformation shadow spacer effects would also compromise membrane performance by hindering transmembrane water transport in the module hickenbottom et al 2016 kim and elimelech 2013 kim et al 2013 concentration polarization cp inherently reduces the driving force for transmembrane transport in all membrane based separation processes in conventional ro and lsrro external cp ecp occurs on the feed side of the membrane the extent of ecp can be reduced by increasing crossflow velocities and improving spacer design to promote hydrodynamic mixing near the membrane surface however in osmotically mediated processes cp occurs on both the feed and permeate sides of the membrane as both sides are in contact with a saline stream in crossflow consequently as with fo and pro oaro and comro are impacted by both ecp and internal cp icp which is defined as cp inside the membrane support layer davenport et al 2018 deshmukh et al 2015 kim et al 2018 tiraferri et al 2013 togo et al 2019 in osmotically mediated processes feed side ecp increases the osmotic pressure at the feed side membrane solution interface π f m while permeate side icp and ecp reduce the osmotic pressure at the permeate side membrane solution interface π p m these phenomena lead to an increase in the osmotic pressure gradient δ π m π f m π p m and a substantial reduction in the driving force for transmembrane water transport δ p δ π m kim and min 2019 ro membranes require a relatively dense support layer to withstand the high transmembrane hydraulic pressures applied while the support layer provides essential mechanical strength it drastically retards the back diffusion of permeate solutes from the bulk permeate stream to the membrane solution interface which is essential in osmotically mediated processes the permeate side mass transfer coefficient of nacl through the support layer of conventional ro membranes which have a structural parameter of 10 3 μm is 1 5 10 6 m s 1 5 4 l m 2 hr 1 deshmukh et al 2015 manickam et al 2014 manickam and mccutcheon 2015 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 consequently a relatively small water flux of only 1 4 10 6 m s 1 5 0 l m 2 hr 1 would result in a 60 decrease in the permeate solute concentration at the membrane solution interface drastically reducing the driving force for water permeation δ p δ π m with deleterious consequences for overall system performance the use of thin and highly porous support layers can help minimize the impact of icp by promoting the diffusion of solutes from the bulk permeate stream to the permeate side membrane solution interface however the low mechanical strength of membranes with thin high porosity support layers makes them unsuitable in processes that employ a transmembrane hydraulic pressure gradient to drive permeation including oaro and comro in contrast lsrro has the same configuration as the staged conventional staged ro just with regular ro membranes replaced by loose ro or nanofiltration membranes like conventional ro lsrro can use densely woven mesh spacers in the low pressure permeate channel to support the membrane and maintain channel geometry with minimal detrimental effects on membrane performance hickenbottom et al 2016 she et al 2013 straub et al 2014 in lsrro the permeate flows perpendicularly away from the membrane surface as in conventional ro rather than the cross flow configuration of bilateral countercurrent systems such as fo pro oaro and comro consequently transmembrane transport in lsrro is not affected by icp chong et al 2007 sablani et al 2001 therefore compared to osmotically mediated ro lsrro can be readily implemented and produce sufficiently high water flux 6 concluding remarks in this study we developed and analyzed a novel staged brine concentration technology based on low salt rejection ro membranes named lsrro unlike conventional ro which is limited by the hydraulic pressures required to reach high final brine concentration lsrro can produce hypersaline brines using moderate hydraulic pressures with a reasonably low energy consumption s e c our analysis shows that lsrro operating with relatively low intermediate salt rejection rates and high hydraulic pressures can produce more concentrated brines albeit with a higher s e c in addition we show that s e c is not a monotonic function of applied pressure in lsrro to minimize the s e c for a specified brine concentration a system scale optimization is required to calculate key salt rejection and applied pressure values with an applied pressure of 70 bar which is typical for seawater ro systems lsrro with three or more stages can produce highly concentrated brines with salinities exceeding the 4 0 m or 234 g l 1 nacl that is commonly required to facilitate mld zld processes the s e c of lsrro decreases with number of stages while increasing with feed concentration for mld zld processes multi stage lsrro is highly advantageous compared to conventional thermally driven phase change based desalination technologies such as mechanical vapor compression as it can achieve a significantly smaller s e c values over a wide range of feed concentrations from 0 1 to 1 0 m furthermore unlike osmotically mediated ro processes that require bilateral countercurrent modules lsrro can use the same membrane modules as conventional ro consequently lsrro avoids the detrimental impacts of membrane deformation under high pressures and internal concentration polarization which significantly limit the practical implementation of osmotically mediated processes consequently lsrro can be readily implemented by replacing regular ro membranes with loose ro or nf membranes in staged ro systems given its unique advantages over inefficient thermally driven phase change based brine concentrators and mass transport limited osmotically mediated processes lsrro has the potential to form the backbone of efficient and cost effective mld zld processes we note that the salt rejection values presented in this study represent the observed salt rejection of the respective stage the observed salt rejection of an lsrro stage is distinct from the real or true salt rejection of the membrane used in the given stage in an lsrro stage the observed salt rejection is a function of both membrane properties i e water and salt permeabilities and operating conditions i e feed flow rate and operating pressure in order to develop a practical lsrro system the dependence of the observed salt rejections on membrane properties and operating conditions must be simulated using a detailed module scale analysis additionally since the water recovery and salt concentration in lsrro operation is high membrane fouling particularly mineral scaling will be a pervasive problem as is the case with all high salinity brine desalination or concentration processes therefore the development of novel scaling mitigation strategies would be a pertinent aspect in the development of practical lsrro systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

heightened attention worldwide while conventional reverse osmosis ro has been proposed as a promising technology in desalination and mld zld processes its application is limited by the maximum hydraulic pressures that current ro membranes and modules can withstand in this study we develop low salt rejection ro lsrro a novel staged ro process that employs low salt rejection membranes to desalinate or concentrate highly saline feed streams requiring only moderate hydraulic pressures based on process modeling we demonstrate that lsrro can overcome the hydraulic pressure limitations of conventional ro achieving hypersaline brine salinities 4 0 m nacl or 234 g l 1 nacl that are required for mld zld applications without using excessively high hydraulic pressures 70 bar in addition we show that the energy efficiency of lssro is substantially higher than traditional thermally driven phase change based technologies such as mechanical vapor compressor mvc for example to concentrate a saline feed stream from 0 1 to 1 0 m nacl the specific energy consumption s e c of 4 stage lsrro ranges from 2 4 to 8 0 kwh of electrical energy per m3 of feedwater treated around four times less than that of mvc which requires 20 25 kwhe m 3 furthermore compared to osmotically mediated ro technologies that require bilateral countercurrent stages to treat hypersaline brines lsrro is eminently more practical as it can be readily implemented by using loose ro or nanofiltration membranes in conventional ro our study highlights lsrro s potential for energy efficient brine concentration using

requirements hermsen et al 2016 hotchkies 2018 hence mld allows the optimization of water recovery with consideration of capital and operation costs as well as environmental impact currently zld is achieved using thermally driven phase change based processes onishi et al 2017 tong and elimelech 2016 specifically the feed wastewater is first pretreated to reduce its inorganic scaling potential before entering a brine concentrator and a brine crystallizer in which water is removed through evaporation the clean water or distillate which is recovered by condensing the water vapor produced can be reused for various industrial applications and the solids deposited in the crystallizer can be further treated for resource recovery or sent for waste disposal for the brine concentrator mechanical

2018 elimelech and phillip 2011 greenlee et al 2009 lin and elimelech 2015 werber et al 2017 typically ro can concentrate wastewater up to 70 000 mg l 1 total dissolved solids tds for handling a wastewater with 35 000 mg l 1 tds i e seawater concentration the water recovery with ro is limited to around 50 high pressure ro hpro systems have been recently proposed to further increase the water recovery in ro davenport et al 2018 schantz et al 2018 in hpro the brine concentration can be elevated to 250 000 mg l 1 which corresponds to a water recovery of 85 when treating wastewater with 35 000 mg l 1 tds however so far hpro is still under development as both the design and fabrication of ro membranes and membrane modules that can withstand the high hydraulic pressures required 200 bar to reach 250 000 mg l 1 tds are extremely challenging to reduce the hydraulic pressure requirement of ro in mld novel ro based technologies including osmotically assisted ro oaro and cascading osmotically mediated ro comro have been proposed bartholomew et al 2017 2018 chen and yip 2018 however the application of these alternative ro based technologies continues to be limited by the practical challenges associated with building bilateral countercurrent modules that function under the operating pressures used in conventional ro therefore the development of novel technologies that can concentrate wastewater to high salinities with moderate pressure and energy consumption is essential to enable efficient and effective mld and zld processes in this study we present a novel low salt rejection reverse osmosis lsrro technology that employs loose ro membranes to enable energy efficient mld zld processes we first introduce the working principles of lsrro using process modeling we then demonstrate the potential for 2 stage lsrro to achieve high brine concentrations using only moderate hydraulic pressures and discuss the interplay between brine concentration and specific energy consumption s e c lastly we calculate the s e c required to concentrate a range of saline feed waters to the salinities required for mld zld using lsrro configurations with different number of stages highlighting the vast potential of lsrro brine concentration 2 reverse osmosis with low salt rejection membranes 2 1 limitations of conventional ro for brine concentration in conventional ro operation a high pressure pump is used to increase the hydraulic pressure δ p of the saline feed stream fig 1 a once δ p exceeds the osmotic pressure of the saline feed stream δ π water from the feed permeates through the ro membrane yielding pure product or permeate water and concentrated brine or retentate an energy recovery device is often used to recover mechanical energy from the pressurized brine stream reducing the overall energy consumption during operation the osmotic pressure of the brine stream π b increases with its salt concentration c b with π b linearly proportional to c b when the van t hoff approximation applies murad and powles 1993 pitzer 1973 and δ π π b as the osmotic pressure of the product water is negligible fig 1b based on these working principles of ro the maximum c b is achieved when π b δ p and thus c b is restricted by δ p in practice due to the detrimental effects of high hydraulic pressures on membrane transport properties coday et al 2013 rautenbach et al 2000 straub et al 2015 δ p is usually 85 bar baker 2012 mulder 1996 typically δ p in most ro operations is limited to 70 bar resulting in a maximum c b of 1 4 m nacl or 82 000 mg l 1 tds fig 1b in seawater ro c b is usually 1 2 m nacl 70 000 mg l 1 tds davenport et al 2018 for mld zld processes c b needs to be 4 m nacl i e 250 000 mg l 1 tds the typical inlet feed to a crystallizer davenport et al 2018 tong and elimelech 2016 such high c b values require a δ p of 200 bar in conventional ro for simplicity of calculations and presentation of results hereafter all concentrations denoted by c and regardless of the subscript are presented as molar concentrations as nacl 2 2 working principles of low salt rejection ro lsrro to overcome the limit of the δ p that is feasible in conventional ro we propose a novel staged ro technology using low salt rejection ro membranes lsrro the working principle of an n stage lsrro is schematically shown in fig 2 in an n stage lsrro a regular high rejection ro membrane is employed in the 1st stage i e the salt rejection r 1 is assumed to be 100 with loose low rejection ro membranes utilized in subsequent stages i e the salt rejection r i of the ith stage is less than 100 for i 2 to n in this study unless particularly stated all the salt rejections refer to the observed salt rejection at the specified stage i e r 1 c p c f the saline feed is pressurized by a high pressure pump before entering the 1st stage where freshwater is produced assuming that parasitic pressure losses in the membrane module are negligible the brine or retentate stream from the ith stage i e brine i which remains pressurized as the entering feed serves as feed for the i 1th stage the permeate from the i 1th stage i e permeate i 1 is repressurized and cycled back to the ith stage as additional feed with the final brine being generated by the n th stage like conventional ro lsrro employs an energy recovery device to recover mechanical energy from the final brine stream thereby lowering energy consumption with a fixed δ p and complete rejection r 1 100 in the 1st stage of lsrro the concentration of brine 1 c b 1 is such that the osmotic pressure of brine 1 π b 1 is equal to δ p as in conventional ro in the 2nd stage since the salt rejection r 2 is less than 100 permeate 2 is saline water with a non zero osmotic pressure π p 2 following the limiting case principle for which δ π δ p the osmotic pressure of brine 2 π b 2 is π p 2 δ p since δ π π b 2 π p 2 δ p consequently the corresponding concentration of brine 2 c b 2 would be higher than c b 1 on the other hand if r 2 is 100 there would be no water permeation in the 2nd stage since π b 1 δ p thereby c b 2 would be the same as c b 1 in other words for a given δ p the brine stream can be concentrated to higher salinities using a 2 stage lsrro than conventional 2 stage ro likewise additional low salt rejection stages enable further brine concentration allowing multi stage lsrro to overcome the limitation of δ p fixing brine concentration 3 brine concentration and energy consumption in two stage lsrro 3 1 brine concentration to further elucidate the working principles of lsrro a mass balance was performed for a 2 stage lsrro configuration fig s1 in supplementary materials the final brine concentration in 2 stage lsrro c b can be calculated as a function of salt rejection in the second stage r 2 and applied pressure δ p detailed derivation in supplementary materials 1 c b 2 r 2 δ p v r g t where v is the van t hoff dissociation parameter e g v 2 for nacl r g is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature according to eq 1 for given δ p c b increases as r 2 is reduced as shown in fig 3 a for a 0 6 m saline feed using δ p of 70 bar and r 2 of 50 c b can reach over 2 1 m which is 50 greater than the maximum brine concentration attainable in conventional ro 1 4 m for r 2 100 the increase in c b is attributed to the saline permeate that results from the low salt rejection of the loose ro membrane in the 2nd stage for a given δ p a lower salt rejection in the 2nd stage leads to a higher salinity permeate 2 i e the permeate from the 2nd stage with a more concentrated permeate 2 the osmotic pressure of the final brine i e the sum of the permeate osmotic pressure and δ p is larger thereby leading to a higher corresponding c b in addition based on eq 1 for a given r 2 c b is directly proportional to δ p for concentrating a 0 6 m saline feed stream using 2 stage lsrro with r 2 50 c b can be elevated from 2 1 to 2 4 m as δ p is increased from 70 to 80 bar fig 3b the dependence of c b on δ p can be explained by the correlation between salt concentration and osmotic pressure in this analysis we use the van t hoff approximation a larger δ p results in a higher osmotic pressure of the brine which corresponds to a higher c b 3 2 energy consumption high salinity brine concentration processes are inherently energy intensive and in addition to c b energy efficiency is an important performance metric in saline feed concentration processes mistry et al 2011 tong and elimelech 2016 to quantify the energy efficiency specific energy consumption s e c is calculated by definition s e c is the energy consumed per unit volume reduction of the saline feed which corresponds to the volume of the purified water produced assuming an ideal energy recovery device i e a device that can recovery 100 of the energy embedded in the final brine we can obtain a simple analytical expression for the s e c detailed derivation in supplementary materials 2 s e c 1 q p 2 q p δ p where q p and q p 2 are the permeate flow rates from the first and second stages respectively for a given δ p fig 3a shows that both c b and s e c increase as r 2 is decreased indicating that achieving a higher brine concentration using ro membranes with lower salt rejections increases energy consumption according to eq 2 at a fixed δ p s e c is determined by q p 2 q p by performing a mass balance detailed derivation in supplementary materials q p 2 q p can be expressed as a function of r 2 and δ p 3 q p 2 q p 1 r 2 c 0 v r g t r 2 2 r 2 δ p r 2 c 0 v r g t based on eq 3 with the other parameters fixed q p 2 q p monotonically increases with a decrease in r 2 resulting in higher s e c as shown in fig 3a in other words lowering r 2 produces a larger permeate 2 as the net effective pressure across the membrane δ p π b 1 π p 2 increases an increase in the volumetric flow rate of permeate 2 q p 2 which must be repressurized before being recycled back to the 1st stage leads to an increased s e c for a given r 2 s e c first decreases and then increases with increasing δ p whereas c b increases linearly with δ p fig 3b such a dependence of s e c on δ p suggests that there exists an optimal δ p in lsrro that minimizes the energy consumption required to achieve a specified c b the impact of δ p on s e c is described by eqs 2 and 3 since an elevated δ p leads to a decreased q p 2 q p eq 3 s e c which is a product of 1 q p 2 q p and δ p eq 2 is not a monotonic function of δ p the synergistic effect of r 2 and δ p on c b and s e c in 2 stage lsrro is illustrated in fig 3c in general c b can be increased by lowering r 2 and increasing δ p though this leads to a larger required s e c however for the same s e c different c b values can be obtained by varying r 2 and δ p for instance to concentrate a 0 6 m saline feed with a s e c of 3 kwhe m 3 c b can reach either 2 5 m with a r 2 of 0 23 and δ p of 70 bar or 1 4 m with a r 2 of 0 22 and δ p of 38 bar therefore the applied pressure and salt rejection of each stage must be optimized to maximize the performance of an lsrro system i e achieve the highest c b with the smallest s e c 3 3 water recovery freshwater recovery r w defined as the ratio of the produced freshwater to the saline feed flow rates has also been investigated in 2 stage lsrro a higher r w is critical in wastewater and brackish water desalination as smaller volumes of waste streams or brines are produced and larger volumes of freshwater are recovered and reused as shown in fig 3d r w increases with c b a direct result of the mass balances of salt and water due to the mass balance of salt a higher c b corresponds to a smaller flow rate of brine according to the mass balance of water a smaller flow rate of brine suggests a larger flow rate of produced freshwater thereby resulting in a higher r w therefore with a moderate δ p lsrro not only increases the final brine concentration but also boosts the freshwater recovery compared to conventional ro additionally fig 3c and d clearly suggests that s e c increases with c b indicating that to achieve a higher r w in lsrro a larger s e c is required 4 multistage lsrro for mld zld 4 1 brine concentration for mld zld following the working principle described above the theoretical maximum achievable brine concentration c b m a x in an n stage lsrro is 4 c b m a x n δ p m a x v r g t where δ p m a x is the maximum applied hydraulic pressure to achieve c b m a x the salt rejections of each stage must approach zero except for the 1st stage where salt rejection is 100 in such a configuration the maximum concentration of brine 1 from the 1st stage c b 1 based on the van t hoff approximation would be δ p m a x v r g t since δ π 1 δ p m a x using brine 1 as the feed for the 2nd stage and given the salt rejection in the 2nd stage is close to 0 the concentration of permeate 2 from the 2nd stage is close to the concentration of feed 2 i e δ p m a x v r g t in the 2nd stage because of the equilibrium of pressure i e δ π 2 δ p m a x the concentration of brine 2 would be closed to 2 δ p m a x v r g t likewise in the ith stage the concentration of brine i would be close to i δ p m a x v r g t implying that the maximum final brine concentration c b m a x approaches n δ p m a x v r g t the maximum exit brine concentration c b m a x in lsrro for various stage numbers is presented in fig 4 a it is clearly shown that lsrro with more stages can achieve higher c b m a x for mld zld processes the brine concentration needs to reach 4 m the typical feed concentration for a brine crystallizer green dashed line fig 4a suggests that concentrating saline feeds using lsrro with 2 stages and δ p m a x 70 bar is insufficient for mld zld as the resulting c b m a x is less than 3 m hence at least 3 stages are needed to attain c b m a x 4 m 4 2 energy consumption in multi stage lsrro the s e c in 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro can be obtained using detailed derivation in supplementary materials 5 s e c n 3 1 q p 2 q p q p 3 q p δ p 6 s e c n 4 1 q p 2 q p q p 3 q p q p 4 q p δ p where q p i is the permeate flow rate from the ith stage and q p is the flow rate of the produced freshwater in the lsrro system since the specific energy consumption of the ith stage s e c i can be calculated as q p i δ p q p and s e c 1 δ p a straightforward interpretation of eqs 5 and 6 is that the total s e c in an lsrro system is the sum of s e c in each stage fig 4b compares the s e c in 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro for concentrating different saline feed concentrations for mld zld applications i e c b 4 m the s e c values presented were obtained by performing a system scale optimization for δ p and salt rejections details in supplementary materials the optimal salt rejections and δ p together with the resulted permeate flow rates and s e c are summarized in table 1 the s e c of 4 stage lsrro orange columns is significantly smaller than that of 3 stage lsrro red columns for concentrating each saline feed to mld zld to elucidate the difference in s e c of lsrro with different number of stages according to eqs 5 and 6 we have broken the s e c to the contribution of each stage to the total energy consumption the s e c of each stage in 3 stage red columns and 4 stage orange columns lsrro for concentrating 0 6 m saline feed to 4 m with δ p m a x 70 b a r is shown in fig 4c the s e c in the 1st stage s e c 1 of 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro is approximately the same because s e c 1 is equal to δ p we note that for these lsrro systems δ p is close to 70 bar table 1 and thus s e c 1 is similar the distinctive s e c of 3 stage and 4 stage lsrro results from the sum of s e c i in the low salt rejection stages i 2 n s e c i since δ p is similar and q p is the same for c b 4 m based on eqs 5 and 6 i 2 n s e c i is dictated by i 2 n q p i as shown in table 1 i 2 4 q p i is smaller than i 2 3 q p i which is ascribed to the much lower salt rejection rates in 3 stage lsrro than those in 4 stage lsrro therefore to achieve a certain c b lsrro with more stages could be more energy efficient i e have a lower s e c due to the smaller permeate flow rates produced from the low salt rejection stages for repressurization and recirculation s e c also varies for concentrating saline feeds with different concentration c 0 in mld zld practices fig 4b to better understand the relationship between s e c and c 0 the s e c of each stage in 4 stage lsrro with c 0 0 1 m yellow columns and c 0 0 6 m orange columns is shown in fig 4d as with the s e c of other lsrro configurations s e c 1 in 4 stage lsrro is similar for two different c 0 values as discussed previously the weak dependence of s e c 1 on c 0 is attributed to the similar δ p table 1 the dependence of the overall s e c of 4 stage lsrro on c 0 is driven by the different permeate flow rates in the low salt rejection stages table 1 to achieve a certain c b with a lower c 0 the produced permeate flow rate from the 1st stage is larger and thus the feed flow rate i e brine 1 from the 1st stage entering the low salt rejection stages is smaller consequently all the flow rates including the permeate flow rates in the low salt rejection stages are smaller hence less energy is needed to repressurize the smaller recirculating streams resulting in a lower s e c therefore for mld zld using lsrro the lower the feed salinity is the lower s e c is required our above analysis shows that the s e c of lsrro is determined by the permeate flow rates in the low salt rejection stages in addition to salt rejections and δ p the permeate flow rates are also dependent on the number of stages and feed salinity for concentrating 0 6 m saline feed for mld zld i e c b 4 m using 4 stage lsrro the s e c is 5 2 kwhe m 3 in contrast the s e c of mvc which is the most efficient phase change based desalination technology ranges from 20 to 25 kwhe m 3 mickley 2008 schwantes et al 2018 which is substantially larger than that of 4 stage lsrro such significant difference in s e c can be attributed to the inherent distinction between phase change based processes such as mvc multi effect distillation multi stage flash and membrane distillation and pressure driven membrane separations i e ro deshmukh et al 2018 elimelech and phillip 2011 mistry et al 2011 2013 mistry and lienhard 2013 warsinger et al 2015 in thermally driven phase change based processes the majority of the input energy is used to evaporate water resulting in an s e c that is similar in magnitude to the latent heat of vaporization by contrast in pressure driven separation processes the energy is mainly used to separate water from salts and the s e c is within the same order of magnitude as the gibbs free energy of separation since the latent heat of evaporation is much higher than the gibbs free energy of separation the s e c of pressure driven separation technologies is much smaller than that of thermal phase change based technologies we further note that the s e c of lsrro increases with c 0 while the s e c of thermal distillation technologies is nearly independent of feed concentration with a high c 0 of 1 m the s e c of 4 stage lsrro for mld zld is 8 0 kwhe m 3 fig 4b table 1 which is still substantially lower than the s e c of thermal distillation technologies 20 25 kwhe m 3 with a lower c 0 the s e c is even smaller e g s e c 2 4 kwhe m 3 for c 0 0 1 m the s e c of lsrro could be further reduced by using more stages fig 4b table 1 the relatively small energy consumption of lsrro compared to the most energy efficient thermal phase change based technologies highlights the potential of lsrro for mld zld applications 5 practical considerations of lsrro recently several membrane based technologies for high salinity waters have been proposed such as osmotically assisted ro oaro bartholomew et al 2017 2018 and cascading osmotically mediated ro comro chen and yip 2018 these osmotically mediated ro technologies utilize a saline stream on the permeate side of the membrane to lower the hydraulic pressure required to concentrate high salinity brines for mld zld processes unlike conventional ro and lsrro both oaro and comro are based on bilateral countercurrent modules in which the pressurized high salinity feed stream is contacted with a lower salinity permeate stream consequently the implementation of osmotically mediated desalination processes is drastically constrained by two major inherent challenges i maintaining cross flow on the permeate side of the membrane while using spacers that are dense enough to limit membrane deformation and prevent the collapse of permeate side flow channel under the high hydraulic pressures required and ii internal concentration polarization icp in the membrane support layer as discussed below the countercurrent modules required for oaro and comro are similar to those used in forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro in which spacers are needed to simultaneously maintain channel geometry and enhance mass transfer near the membrane surface koutsou et al 2009 shakaib et al 2009 she et al 2013 in contrast to conventional ro and lsrro oaro and comro require loose spacer configurations in both the feed and permeate channels in order to permit the high crossflow rates required on both sides of the membrane however using loose or low density channel spacers on the low pressure side of a pressurized membrane module can lead to highly detrimental membrane deformation previous studies on pro in which loose feed side spacers are used to maintain crossflow without incurring excessive parasitic pressure losses have shown a rapid deterioration in membrane performance due to deformation and rupture at hydraulic pressures of around 55 bar straub et al 2014 2015 similarly applying a high feed side hydraulic pressure in osmotically mediated processes such as oaro and comro that require low density permeate side spacers will likely lead to significant membrane deformation as the membrane is pressed against the loose spacer in the low pressure permeate channel kim and elimelech 2012 she et al 2013 such membrane deformation is highly detrimental to membrane performance as the water permeability and solute selectivity are reduced while the pressure drop in the permeate channel is increased furthermore as the hydraulic pressure exceeds 55 bar current thin film composite membranes may fail catastrophically due to membrane rupture straub et al 2014 2015 mitigating membrane deformation requires the use of relatively dense spacer configurations to adequately support the membrane polymer however using dense spacers in a channel with significant crossflow will result in large parasitic pressure losses that can drastically increase energy consumption hickenbottom et al 2016 schock and miquel 1987 straub et al 2016 wang et al 2016 in addition to membrane deformation shadow spacer effects would also compromise membrane performance by hindering transmembrane water transport in the module hickenbottom et al 2016 kim and elimelech 2013 kim et al 2013 concentration polarization cp inherently reduces the driving force for transmembrane transport in all membrane based separation processes in conventional ro and lsrro external cp ecp occurs on the feed side of the membrane the extent of ecp can be reduced by increasing crossflow velocities and improving spacer design to promote hydrodynamic mixing near the membrane surface however in osmotically mediated processes cp occurs on both the feed and permeate sides of the membrane as both sides are in contact with a saline stream in crossflow consequently as with fo and pro oaro and comro are impacted by both ecp and internal cp icp which is defined as cp inside the membrane support layer davenport et al 2018 deshmukh et al 2015 kim et al 2018 tiraferri et al 2013 togo et al 2019 in osmotically mediated processes feed side ecp increases the osmotic pressure at the feed side membrane solution interface π f m while permeate side icp and ecp reduce the osmotic pressure at the permeate side membrane solution interface π p m these phenomena lead to an increase in the osmotic pressure gradient δ π m π f m π p m and a substantial reduction in the driving force for transmembrane water transport δ p δ π m kim and min 2019 ro membranes require a relatively dense support layer to withstand the high transmembrane hydraulic pressures applied while the support layer provides essential mechanical strength it drastically retards the back diffusion of permeate solutes from the bulk permeate stream to the membrane solution interface which is essential in osmotically mediated processes the permeate side mass transfer coefficient of nacl through the support layer of conventional ro membranes which have a structural parameter of 10 3 μm is 1 5 10 6 m s 1 5 4 l m 2 hr 1 deshmukh et al 2015 manickam et al 2014 manickam and mccutcheon 2015 mccutcheon and elimelech 2006 consequently a relatively small water flux of only 1 4 10 6 m s 1 5 0 l m 2 hr 1 would result in a 60 decrease in the permeate solute concentration at the membrane solution interface drastically reducing the driving force for water permeation δ p δ π m with deleterious consequences for overall system performance the use of thin and highly porous support layers can help minimize the impact of icp by promoting the diffusion of solutes from the bulk permeate stream to the permeate side membrane solution interface however the low mechanical strength of membranes with thin high porosity support layers makes them unsuitable in processes that employ a transmembrane hydraulic pressure gradient to drive permeation including oaro and comro in contrast lsrro has the same configuration as the staged conventional staged ro just with regular ro membranes replaced by loose ro or nanofiltration membranes like conventional ro lsrro can use densely woven mesh spacers in the low pressure permeate channel to support the membrane and maintain channel geometry with minimal detrimental effects on membrane performance hickenbottom et al 2016 she et al 2013 straub et al 2014 in lsrro the permeate flows perpendicularly away from the membrane surface as in conventional ro rather than the cross flow configuration of bilateral countercurrent systems such as fo pro oaro and comro consequently transmembrane transport in lsrro is not affected by icp chong et al 2007 sablani et al 2001 therefore compared to osmotically mediated ro lsrro can be readily implemented and produce sufficiently high water flux 6 concluding remarks in this study we developed and analyzed a novel staged brine concentration technology based on low salt rejection ro membranes named lsrro unlike conventional ro which is limited by the hydraulic pressures required to reach high final brine concentration lsrro can produce hypersaline brines using moderate hydraulic pressures with a reasonably low energy consumption s e c our analysis shows that lsrro operating with relatively low intermediate salt rejection rates and high hydraulic pressures can produce more concentrated brines albeit with a higher s e c in addition we show that s e c is not a monotonic function of applied pressure in lsrro to minimize the s e c for a specified brine concentration a system scale optimization is required to calculate key salt rejection and applied pressure values with an applied pressure of 70 bar which is typical for seawater ro systems lsrro with three or more stages can produce highly concentrated brines with salinities exceeding the 4 0 m or 234 g l 1 nacl that is commonly required to facilitate mld zld processes the s e c of lsrro decreases with number of stages while increasing with feed concentration for mld zld processes multi stage lsrro is highly advantageous compared to conventional thermally driven phase change based desalination technologies such as mechanical vapor compression as it can achieve a significantly smaller s e c values over a wide range of feed concentrations from 0 1 to 1 0 m furthermore unlike osmotically mediated ro processes that require bilateral countercurrent modules lsrro can use the same membrane modules as conventional ro consequently lsrro avoids the detrimental impacts of membrane deformation under high pressures and internal concentration polarization which significantly limit the practical implementation of osmotically mediated processes consequently lsrro can be readily implemented by replacing regular ro membranes with loose ro or nf membranes in staged ro systems given its unique advantages over inefficient thermally driven phase change based brine concentrators and mass transport limited osmotically mediated processes lsrro has the potential to form the backbone of efficient and cost effective mld zld processes we note that the salt rejection values presented in this study represent the observed salt rejection of the respective stage the observed salt rejection of an lsrro stage is distinct from the real or true salt rejection of the membrane used in the given stage in an lsrro stage the observed salt rejection is a function of both membrane properties i e water and salt permeabilities and operating conditions i e feed flow rate and operating pressure in order to develop a practical lsrro system the dependence of the observed salt rejections on membrane properties and operating conditions must be simulated using a detailed module scale analysis additionally since the water recovery and salt concentration in lsrro operation is high membrane fouling particularly mineral scaling will be a pervasive problem as is the case with all high salinity brine desalination or concentration processes therefore the development of novel scaling mitigation strategies would be a pertinent aspect in the development of practical lsrro systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18277,reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing simultaneously satisfies challenges of fresh water sourcing and the installation operation of an extensive disposal well infrastructure herein we systematically and rigorously investigate produced water treatment for reuse during hydraulic fracturing highly saline and turbid produced water from the permian basin was treated by adding chlorine as an oxidant fecl3 as the primary coagulant and an anionic polymer to induce high rate sedimentation to generate clean brine by removing suspended solids and iron over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures mobile phone video capture optical microscopy and digital image video analysis were employed to characterize floc morphology and measure its size and settling velocity conformational changes of the polymeric coagulant between 4 and 44 c were inferred from viscosity and dynamic light scattering measurements providing clues to its performance characteristics floc settling velocities measured over the entire range of polymer dosages and temperatures were empirically modelled incorporating their fractal nature average size and the viscosity of the produced water using only a single fitting parameter juxtaposing the anionic polymer with the hydrolyzing metal ion coagulant effectively destabilized the suspension and caused floc growth through a combination of enmeshment adsorption and charge neutralization and inter particle bridging as evidenced by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis very high turbidity 98 and total iron 97 removals were accomplished even with very short flocculation and sedimentation times of only 6 minutes each suggesting the feasibility of this approach to reuse produced water for hydraulic fracturing graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydraulic fracturing coagulation flocculation clarification produced water reuse polymer 1 introduction high volume hydraulic fracturing has largely enabled the dramatic growth in oil and natural gas production from unconventional reservoirs in the united states however median values of cumulative water use for horizontal well completion and water use intensity water use normalized to well lateral length have increased 17 fold from 2460 m3 to 42 560 m3 and 9 fold from 2 4 m3 m to 21 1 m3 m respectively from 2008 to 2016 kondash et al 2018 scanlon et al 2017 correspondingly increasing produced water volumes the vast majority of produced water is currently disposed via injection wells kondash et al 2018 vidic et al 2013 which requires suitable isolated injection zones with sufficient capacity for the life of the field and incurs substantial infrastructure and operating and maintenance costs however recycling produced water simultaneously addresses issues related to deep well disposal and reduces the freshwater volume necessary for fracturing barnes et al 2015 vidic et al 2013 we target the most prolific unconventional reservoir play in the united states the permian basin sourcing water for full field development therein represents a significant problem since it is in short supply in semi arid regions of west texas and southeastern new mexico the median ratio of water to oil production in the permian basin ranges from 3 to 5 kondash et al 2018 walsh and sharma 2018 presenting significant operational challenges to water management and disposal further produced water volumes are 200 400 in excess of the annual completion source water demand offering significant reuse opportunities scanlon et al 2017 necessitating systematic and rigorous investigations to select appropriate treatment techniques and optimize their operating conditions reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing is predicated primarily on efficient removal of solids and iron and inactivating microorganisms to minimize the potential for well clogging and formation damage barnes et al 2015 iron is incompatible with polymers and other fracturing fluid additives and an upper limit of 10 mg l has been suggested for reuse in hydraulic fracturing barnes et al 2015 sharma and bjornen 2018 given the geographic spread of production well locations a compact decentralized mobile campaign style high throughput treatment is required to purify produced water since fast pumping rates are required for high volume hydraulic fracturing pointing to the need for high rate clarification sharma and bjornen 2018 aluminum and iron have been used to remove colloids and organics in produced water with existing literature mainly focusing on evaluating the role of operating conditions such as ph chemical dosage and type mixing speeds or shear rate residence time feed water quality etc he et al 2014 2016 rosenblum et al 2016 shamaei et al 2018 wang et al 2015 these studies have typically employed 30 min residence times each for flocculation and sedimentation which are too long for mobile field installations however treatment footprint can be reduced and portability enhanced by complementing hydrolyzing metal ion coagulants with organic polymers which greatly increases floc size strength and sedimentation rate at low cost bolto and gregory 2007 duan and gregory 2003 hogg 2013 jarvis et al 2005a to date only limited data are available regarding the suitability of polymers to treat produced water colloids he et al 2014 pourrezaei et al 2011 these studies on canadian oil sands and the marcellus shale employed long treatment times 30 min each for flocculation and sedimentation not investigating high rate sedimentation another challenge is seasonal operation since temperature impacts treatment kinetics by changing water density and viscosity duan and gregory 2003 mpofu et al 2004 winkler et al 2012 necessitating experiments over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures the objectives of this research are to i mechanistically evaluate synergistic effects of fecl3 and polymer addition on colloid including particulate iron destabilization and high rate sedimentation ii develop and implement robust techniques using video and image analysis to quantify floc morphology size and settling

shale play of ultralow permeability within a vertical depth of 3000 m scanlon et al 2017 samples were acidified to ph 5 prior to shipment to avoid iron precipitation and stored at 4 c upon receipt experiments were completed in 2 months to avoid significant changes to the sample s integrity during storage several of its water quality parameters were measured via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ion gas chromatography and colorimetry control experiments were performed with a solution of 160 g l nacl and 30 5 g l cacl2 2h2o mimicking the major ions and the ionic strength of the produced water sample to better understand underlying coagulation mechanisms by eliminating interferences from organic matter present in the field sample 2 2 jar testing initially we attempted to solely use the dissolved iron inherently present in the produced water as the primary coagulant by adding chlorine and simultaneously increasing the ph to 8 5 to precipitate fe iii this did not well remove turbidity possibly due to formation of less dense colloidal iron lytle et al 2004 hence fecl3 was externally added 20 50 70 and 120 mg l as fe and ph was adjusted to 7 5 8 0 and 8 5 targeting 2

polymer dosage in these jar tests samples were rapidly mixed at 586 s 1 for 2 min after first adding fecl3 as the primary coagulant followed by naoh and free cl2 and the polymer was added 30 s before end of flash mixing a linear anionic polymer of molecular weight of the order of 107 da flopam em235 snf was selected to facilitate bridging flocculation bolto and gregory 2007 several polymer concentrations 0 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l were evaluated in conjunction with the optimal fecl3 dosage flocculation was performed at 28 s 1 for 6 min and flocs were allowed to settle for only 6 min isothermal jar tests at 4 14 22 34 and 44 c innova 42 incubator eppendorf were performed at 120 mg l fecl3 dosage 8 5 0 1 ph 2 mg l total cl2 residual and 1 mg l polymer dosage to compare performance under identical chemical conditions sections 3 2 and 3 3 at the end of each experiment 100 ml of the supernatant was pipetted for water quality analysis the power input was adjusted accounting for changes in produced water viscosity with temperature fig 8 to maintain the mixing intensity duan and gregory 2003 duplicate jar tests at optimal coagulation conditions at 22 and 44 c revealed 5 1 coefficient of variation and 7 5 relative percent difference for average floc diameter fractal dimension and settling velocity demonstrating reproducibility of experiments and laboratory protocols allowing statistical comparison of results 2 3 fractal dimension light scattering is not well suited to measure 3d fractal dimensions of very large aggregates because of sedimentation during measurement potential shadowing and multiple scattering that invalidate the rayleigh gans debye conditions bushell et al 2002 3d fractal dimensions can also be determined by using models relating floc size to their settling velocity aziz et al 2003 johnson et al 1996 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 that invoke assumptions such as an initially monodispersed suspension of identical colloids spherical particles and flocs and brinkman darcy flow internal to the floc of known effective density since these idealizations are generally invalid in industrial wastewaters 2d fractal dimensions df 2d were obtained via digital image analysis chakraborti et al 2003 gorczyca and ganczarczyk 1996 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 yu et al 2010 especially since iron flocs provided high contrast in microscopy jarvis et al 2005b entire flocs were imaged on an olympus bx53 optical microscope in the bright field transmittance mode with a 4x objective lens to directly measure df 2d via box counting jarvis et al 2005b vahedi and gorczyca 2011 the z axis motor drive installation and cellsens dimension software facilitated easy image acquisition and processing images were overlaid after converting them to gray scale and thresholding to binary format with squares of decreasing length r and determining the number of squares n that fully encompass the floc bushell et al 2002 landini 2011 a logarithmic plot of number of squares occupied and their reciprocal size gives df 2d equation 1 50 100 flocs were analyzed from each experiment using a program written in matlab 1 d f 2 d lim r 0 l o g n l o g 1 r 2 4 floc size and settling velocity after completing jar tests 1 l of clear supernatant was transferred to a 40 cm high and 6 cm wide glass settling column floc samples were gently extracted using a wide tip pipette and carefully transferred to this column to avoid breakage to the extent possible gorczyca and ganczarczyk 1996 johnson et al 1996 winkler et al 2012 videos of settling flocs were recorded using a cellphone camera at 60 fps and 1080 1920 pixels resolution after backlighting the column with a light emitting diode source this procedure ensured that flocs were settling in water with identical chemical composition and properties e g density viscosity and ion concentration as during their formation in jar tests based on preliminary tests videos were taken at a height of 14 cm from the bottom and 24 cm from the top after particles attained and maintained their terminal velocity the video was split into frames and the threshold pixel value was set in each case to clearly visualize flocs from the background around 500 flocs were analyzed in each experiment within a central investigation window of 2 cm 1 6 cm to minimize wall effects a lagrangian approach termed particle tracking velocimetry was used to track aggregates ouellette et al 2008 the light intensity and coordinates of each pixel constituting a floc was used to determine its center of mass using a code developed in matlab the vertical displacement between frames and within each frame duration 1 67 ms of the center of mass was in turn used to calculate the instantaneous type i sedimentation rate over 3 15 s durations depending on floc characteristics sedimentation rates with a coefficient of variance 0 3 were discarded since it implied wall effects in the direction normal to the video frame floc areas were measured using the image processing toolbox in matlab which was then converted to an equivalent spherical diameter 2 5 zeta potential the electrophoretic mobility of colloids present in the produced water and from each jar testing experiment was measured using electrophoretic light scattering anton paar litesizer 500 and converted into a zeta potential using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation a latex reference material catalog number 175108 anton paar with zeta potential of 42 4 mv was used for standardization 2 6 viscosity the absolute viscosity of produced water and polymer solution 1 000 mg l were probed using a thermo scientific haake mars 60 rheometer the shear rate was increased from 0 1 to 1 000s 1 and then decreased back to the starting shear rate in a stepwise fashion collecting 5 data points per decade of shear rate using a double gap concentric cylinder measuring geometry the temperature was adjusted to target values of 4 11 20 22 34 44 and 60 c

dilution 100 mg l in high ionic strength solution mimicking the produced water 160 g l nacl and 30 5 g l cacl2 2h2o an equilibration time of 10 min was chosen for each 5 c step and an average of three measurements are reported 2 8 atr ftir atr ftir spectra were collected for the air dried polymer using a nicolet is10 spectrometer equipped with ever glo source dtgs detector kbr beam splitter and omnic 9 0 software in the range of 4000 600 cm 1 in atr mode using a diamond itx accessory prior to analysis the background spectrum was collected and an average of three spectra each consisting of 128 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution are reported 2 9 powder xrd iron polymorphs precipitated in situ were collected after sedimentation centrifuged and examined by a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer the clear supernatant was decanted and the pellet was washed with nanopure water and centrifuged again to reduce salt concentration this process was repeated three times after which a few water drops were added to the pellet and sonicated to attain a homogenous suspension around 2 ml of this suspension was pipetted onto a quartz disc air dried for at least 24 h after which diffraction patterns were collected using cu kα radiation 1 54056 å at 40 kv and 40 ma diffractograms were collected from 2 2θ 70 with a step size of 0 05 2θ s and interpreted using the international center for diffraction data database 2 10 thermogravimetric analysis tga tga was performed on 6 mg samples after overnight drying at 60 c tga q50 ta instruments over the range 22 450 c at a constant heating rate of 10 c min under a dry n2 atmosphere temperature and weight were continuously recorded to determine the tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the hydraulic fracturing produced water the sample was extremely saline tds 200 000 mg l with chloride and sodium as its main components similar to bakken and marcellus shales attributed to the partial evaporation of paleo seawater equilibration with formation mineralogy and ion exclusion in compacted shale minerals increasing salinity of surrounding formation waters correspondingly the produced water was 12 denser 1 116 g cm3 and 30 more viscous 1 30 mpa s than pure water behaving in a newtonian fashion over 4 decades of shear rates at 22 c fig 8 the sample was relatively turbid 70 ntu with dissolved organic carbon doc concentration 400 mg l which is 3 4 times higher than those reported for wolfcamp in the midland basin khan et al 2016 high mg ca sr silica and doc concentrations are attributed to its geologic origins in organic rich mixed silicate sandstone and limestone reservoirs enrichment of ca and sr in excess of seawater evaporite suggests dolomitization where mg replaces ca and sr ions to form less soluble precipitates which is supported by the relatively low bicarbonate concentration minor amounts of ba are due to baso4 equilibrium in the reservoir similarly concentrations of br i and b are in excess of seawater evaporite and attributed to microbial degradation of type ii marine kerogen present in source rocks engle et al 2016 high ammonium is attributed to denitrification of source rock engle et al 2016 and constitutes chlorine demand iron is ubiquitous in produced waters from shale plays and is released from biological activity under low redox and acidic environments as dissolved fe ii low molecular weight organic acids including acetic propionic butyric and lactic acid were present representing potential substrates for heterotrophic and sulfate reducing bacteria the ftir spectrum of the raw produced water second from the bottom in fig 4 in red color provided evidence for b 1004 cm 1 of vsb o si 1100 cm 1 of vsi o carbonates and coordinated carbonates vco3 2 1458 cm 1 and 1637 cm 1 respectively organic acids vc o of carboxylates at 1560 cm 1 as well as aliphatic and aromatic compounds vc h stretching at 2800 3000 cm 1 chorghe et al 2017 validating several inorganic and organic constituents reported in table 1 3 2 removal of turbidity doc and iron supernatant turbidity was 10 ntu 86 removal and total residual iron was 6 5 mg l 84 removal at room temperature when only fecl3 was employed polymer addition progressively improved supernatant water quality turbidity of 4 2 3 8 1 9 and 1 8 ntu and total iron of 3 8 3 0 1 2 and 1 1 mg l for polymer dosages of 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l respectively also at 22 c hence adding polymer increased flocs settling velocities and better aggregated smaller colloids that did not settle well with fecl3 alone lytle et al 2004 also doc removal was 35 similar to earlier results from eagle ford chorghe et al 2017 supernatant turbidity 2 ntu and total iron 1 2 mg l at 1 mg l polymer dose in 6 min demonstrates that optimizing chemical dosages achieves suspended solids and total iron requirements for reuse for hydraulic fracturing hence the rest of the work largely focused on analyzing floc characteristics and coagulation mechanisms responsible for high rate sedimentation 3 3 polymer effect on floc size morphology and sedimentation rates floc sizes increased by adding progressively more polymer at room temperature as seen qualitatively in optical images of representative flocs fig 1 a e which exhibited the characteristic reddish brown hue of fe iii hydr oxide equivalent spherical diameters quantitatively increased with polymer concentration fig 1f biggest enhancements to the size were obtained at lower doses rising from 180 μm with only fecl3 no polymer to 540 μm for 0 1 mg l and further to 830 μm for 0 5 mg l polymer dosage flocs did not appreciably grow in size by adding more polymer average 0 89 mm at 1 mg l increasing to only 1 0 mm at 2 mg l higher exposure times of same light intensity were needed to optically image flocs generated at increasing polymer concentrations suggesting closer packing of aggregates qualitative inspection of images in fig 1 also reveals that flocs were loose open and porous at polymer doses 0 5 mg l whereas more densely packed structures were visualized at doses 1 mg l this was quantitatively supported by df 2d measurements fig 2 a with only fecl3 i e no polymer df 2d was 1 44 which is in the same range as aluminum coagulation of kaolin and latex microspheres chakraborti et al 2003 moruzzi et al 2017 iron with and without polymer for drilling wastewater wang et al 2017 and marine snow but lower than illite and montmorillonite flocs gorczyca and ganczarczyk 1996 adding polymer increased df 2d reaching 1 74 at the highest polymer dose evaluated similar to earlier observations glover et al 2000 jarvis et al 2008 yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 which has been attributed to strong electrostatic interactions between the iron flocs and polymer jarvis et al 2005a as described in section 3 6 sedimentation rates were high in the same range as alum and activated sludge flocs gorczyca and ganczarczyk 2001 also increasing monotonically over the entire range of polymer dosages fig 2b similar to average size and fractal dimension highest increases were measured at the lowest polymer dose nearly tripling from 1 mm s with only fecl3 no polymer to 2 8 mm s for 0 1 mg l high polymer dosages did not appreciably increase the average sedimentation rate from 4 6 mm s at 1 mg l to only 5 mm s at 2 mg l similar trends in settling velocity size and fractal dimension suggests a quantitative relationship between them high resolution scanning electron microscopy vega3 tescan also showed changes in floc surface morphology with polymer addition as depicted in fig 2c d and e for polymer dosages of 0 1 and 2 mg l respectively when no polymer was added fig 2c floc surfaces appeared to be smooth and gelatinous with no discernible order or habit consistent with the precipitation of polymorphic amorphous fe iii hydr oxide in the presence of organic matter and other contaminants also fig 3 this is similar to aluminum which precipitates as amorphous al oh 3 in natural waters due to competition of organic acids with hydroxyl ions violante and huang 1985 in the presence of the polymer flocs appeared to be rough fig 2d and e attributed to macroflocs arising from bridges between primary particles compact flocculi and microflocs and preservation of voids and channels after evaporation during drying prior to electron microscopy gorczyca and ganczarczyk 2001 zhou et al 2017 3 4 precipitation of amorphous fe iii hydr oxide diffractogram peaks fig 3 were used to calculate d spacing of planes using bragg s law and in turn the miller indices even though the flocs had been washed multiple times only halite 200 220 111 and 222 and calcite crystals were detected 104 110 113 202 211 214 and 300 absence of strong iron peaks and the noisy baseline indicates poor crystallinity of the fresh fe iii hydr oxide precipitates lytle et al 2004 consistent with the retarded crystallization of highly ordered phases caused by sorption of in organic components gunnars et al 2002 3 5 physicochemical evidence for polymer adsorption the atr ftir spectrum of the air dried polymer bottom spectrum in fig 4 in black color exhibited the following peaks 1410 cm 1 of vscoo of acrylate υcn of acrylamide 1458 cm 1 of ch2 scissoring vibration of acyl amino group 1559 cm 1 of vascoo of acrylate 1654 cm 1 of vc o of acrylamide and δoh of water broad bands spanning 3700 3000 cm 1 vh o h are largely due to residual water that overwhelmed any amine peaks vas and vsnh2 of acrylamide magalhães et al 2012 thermogravimetry of the polymer fig 5 a showed two stage degradation as previously reported for polyacrylamide the weight loss around 350 c corresponding to ammonia release from amide groups and the peak around 400 c symptomatic of its thermal decomposition burrows et al 1981 yang 2000 ftir and tga results together validate the composition of flopam em 235 as poly sodium acrylate co acrylamide as designated by the manufacturer the raw produced water second spectrum from the bottom in fig 4 in red color also exhibited peaks at 1412 1459 1560 cm 1 demonstrating presence of functionalities characteristic of the polymer phenol a commonly reported produced water constituent elsner and hoelzer 2016 also contributes to peaks in 1700 1600 cm 1 range masking vc o of acrylamide at 1654 cm 1 these peaks were retained when coagulating the produced water without polymer i e only with iron second spectrum from the top in fig 4 in olive green color suggesting their uptake onto flocs therefore even though these characteristic peaks were also detected in spectra of produced water flocs generated with polymer top spectrum in fig 4 in orange color polymer adsorption cannot be inferred for this reason control experiments were performed using synthetic saline water closely matching major ions in the produced water without added organic matter flocs generated in this synthetic produced water with iron only fourth spectrum from the top in fig 4 in blue color served as the negative control where the characteristic anionic polymeric coagulant peaks 1410 1458 or 1560 cm 1 were absent note that the peak at 1654 cm 1 also arises from δoh of residual water not just vc o of acrylamide however the spectrum of the positive control i e coagulation of synthetic produced water with both iron and polymer third spectrum from the top in fig 4 in magenta color showed the peak at 1560 cm 1 corresponding to vascoo of acrylate signifying sorption of polymeric coagulant on iron precipitates dtg curves of solids remaining after low temperature oven drying the untreated produced water also showed several heat absorption peaks between 300 and 400 c overlapping those of the pure polymer fig 5b the corresponding tg curve showed weight loss in this temperature range which arises from the organics present table 1 and fig 4 hence although tg and dtg curves of flocs generated from produced water with and without polymer fig 5c and d respectively showed weight loss in the same temperature range as the pure polymer its sorption cannot be inferred from tga alone weight loss was observed only below 250 c attributed to loss of moisture in the negative control i e flocs generated without polymer in the synthetic water with no organics fig 5e in contrast weight loss in the tg curve and peaks in the dtg curve were detected in the positive control i e flocs with polymer in saline synthetic water fig 5f importantly the dtg peak of the raw polymer centered at 347 c fig 5a was shifted to 363 c in the presence of iron flocs and high salt concentrations fig 5f additionally a new peak appeared at 420 c suggesting a new thermal degradation step burrows et al 1981 increases in thermal degradation temperature and appearance of a new peak provides additional evidence for polymer sorption onto flocs verifying ftir results and the stabilizing effect of na and ca burrows et al 1981 yang 2000 additionally fig 5a shows that polymer weight loss commenced only at 350 c and 10 was refractory at 450 c weight loss in the 350 450 c range in fig 5f the positive control was 1 4 translating to a total mass of 1 8 mg closely corresponding to the 2 mg l polymer dosage providing further evidence of polymer sorption on iron flocs leading to colloid destabilization by bridging spectra of coagulated produced water top two spectra in fig 4 also show evidence of other sorbed constituents on flocs including tetrahedral and trigonal boron complexes 948 and 1412 cm 1 chorghe et al 2017 and organic species 1500 1600 and 2800 3000 cm 1 as did thermal stability of iron flocs in produced water fig 5c and d consistent with bulk removal of inorganics and doc section 3 2 3 6 destabilization and floc growth mechanisms the ζ potential of colloids present in the raw produced water was near neutral blue dot in fig 6 comparable to a previous report younker and walsh 2014 owing to its high ionic strength and presence of high concentrations of multivalent cations such as mg ca and fe adding fecl3 reversed the ζ potential to 15 mv justifying the use of an anionic polymer similar to he et al 2014 substantial turbidity removal in the absence of polymer 86 when colloids were significantly positively charged suggests that enmeshment and sweep coagulation by amorphous fe iii hydr oxides was the dominant destabilization mechanism progressive polymer addition reduced the ζ potential 2 mv at 0 1 mg l and 6 mv at higher dosages indicative of its adsorption as evidenced by ftir and tga hence adsorption of polymer chains charge neutralized colloids also contributing to floc growth by interparticle bridging bolto and gregory 2007 hogg 2013 increasing floc sizes for dosages 0 5 mg l fig 1f corresponding to negative ζ potential indicates polymer sorption was dominated by hydrogen bonding and formation of particle mg or ca polyelectrolyte bridges bolto and gregory 2007 given their high concentrations in the produced water charge neutralization and inter particle bridging upon polymer sorption formed large strong and dense aggregates with higher df 2d with polymer addition as shown in fig 2a wang et al 2017 yang et al 2013 zeng et al 2007 3 7 temperature effects on floc size morphology and sedimentation based on results presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 a polymer dose of 1 mg l ph 8 5 120 mg l fecl3 as fe and 2 mg l cl2 residual was selected for jar testing at different temperatures as summarized in fig 7 a flocs were biggest on average 900 μm at 22 c but decreased considerably in size at higher and lower temperatures to only 240 μm at 4 c and 380 μm at 44 c these measurements were supported by optical images that also qualitatively showed modifications to floc morphology with changing temperatures with denser structures visible at 22 c this was confirmed by digital analysis of optical images which showed highest df 2d at room temperature 1 67 decreasing to 1 57 at the highest and lowest temperatures investigated fig 7b type 1 free settling velocities fig 7c followed identical trends as their size and df 2d in that it was highest 4 5 mm s at 22 c decreasing to 1 1 mm s at 4 c and to 3 1 mm s at 44 c loose open flocs are expected to settle slower than their denser counterparts having the same overall size aziz et al 2003 johnson et al 1996 tang and raper 2002 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 this non monotonic relationship between temperature and size df 2d and sedimentation velocity all peaking at an intermediate value of 22 c could be the result of optimizing coagulation chemistry only at room temperature as described in section 2 2 in other words since temperature impacts the ζ potential of reservoir minerals and colloids mpofu et al 2004 rodríguez and araujo 2006 and flocculation kinetics it is necessary to adjust jar testing conditions when temperature changes to maximize turbidity removal and settling velocity duan and gregory 2003 fitzpatrick et al 2004 winkler et al 2012 in addition to size and fractal dimension temperature also influences floc sedimentation by affecting the suspending fluid s viscosity i e the frictional resistance experienced during sedimentation adachi 2016 fitzpatrick et al 2004 winkler et al 2012 as shown in fig 8 left panel the produced water behaved as a newtonian liquid with an average viscosity of 1 30 mpa s at 22 c increasing to 2 1 mpa s at 4 c and reducing to 0 85 mpa s at 44 c these values were used to quantitatively adjust the mixing intensity in jar tests at different temperatures section 2 2 and also used in modeling floc sedimentation fig 9 the viscosity and hydrodynamic size of the polymeric coagulant were also measured to better understand its role in aggregation the anionic polymer exhibited shear thinning rheology fig 8 middle panel attributed to disentanglement of its individual chains at higher shear rates bolto and gregory 2007 its zero shear viscosity was 60 7 mpa s at 4 c decreasing to only 18 4 mpa s at 44 c decreasing viscosities at higher temperatures has been reported to negatively impact flocculation by disrupting hydrogen bonds between the polymer and water in turn favoring polymer polymer interactions leading to more coiling mpofu et al 2004 dls showed polymer hydrodynamic sizes 3 5 times higher in the highly saline water compared with low salinity systems mpofu et al 2004 suggesting aggregation of individual polymer units in fig 8 right panel it also confirmed decreasing polymer sizes above room temperature e g 1 440 nm at 22 c and 700 nm at 44 c polymer units were smaller below 22 c as well e g 900 nm at 4 c demonstrating its coiling polymer coiling impedes its ability to effectively form inter particle bridges between colloids resulting in the formation of smaller flocs at temperatures both higher and lower than 22 c when its concentration was maintained at 1 mg l similar results have been reported for a na acrylate carboxyl substituted anionic polyacrylamide copolymer flocculent aid for a warm 20 60 c low salinity synthetic water mpofu et al 2004 based on average floc diameter d in mm df 2d and settling velocity vsettling in mm s coupled to viscosity μ in mpa s a simple model was derived v settling d d f 2 d 0 56 μ which accurately captured the entire dataset i e for various polymer doses at 22 c fig 9 left panel and for various temperatures at 1 mg l polymer dose fig 9 right panel the exponent 0 56 was statistically estimated by fitting to experimental data since it is unlikely that the myriad assumptions underlying theoretical models of sedimentation of fractal aggregates adachi 2016 aziz et al 2003 johnson et al 1996 tang and raper 2002 would be satisfied in our jar tests nevertheless settling velocity scaled in similar manner reported for idealized scenarios with only a single fitting parameter suggesting the validity of this simple model of high rate sedimentation over the entire range of temperatures and polymer doses investigated 4 conclusions fecl3 in conjunction with an anionic polymer dramatically improved colloid destabilization and floc growth in a highly saline produced water via enmeshment of primary colloids by amorphous iron precipitates and inter particle bridging by the adsorbed polymer larger stronger and denser flocs thus formed settled at extremely high rates without breakage exceeding 1 mm s even at 4 c a modest polymer dose of 1 mg l enhanced sedimentation rate by a factor of 5 at 22 c reducing supernatant turbidity and total iron concentration with low 6 min flocculation and sedimentation times even at these high settling rates clarification times using traditional weir tanks or conventional settling tanks can be 1 h in the permian and 6 h for marcellus and bakken during cold weather operation the full advantage of extremely rapid solids settling rates can be realized only by installing properly designed high rate clarifiers with inclined internal settlers plate or tube which have the potential to reduce clarification times by a factor of 10 we addressed a key data gap in the literature by measuring settling rates for coagulated amorphous iron flocs in a high density brine over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures which will assist design engineers develop new and optimize existing clarifier designs results also demonstrate the explicit need to optimize coagulation chemistry when temperatures change with season floc settling velocities were quantitatively related to their average size and fractal dimension over the entire range of temperatures and polymer dosages investigated using a simple model with a single fitting parameter this empirical parameter would need to be estimated on a case by case basis since it is expected to vary with produced water composition metal ion coagulant and polymer type ph mixing conditions residence time etc finally we recommend video analysis of floc settling rate in conjunction with conventional jar testing to optimize chemical addition which is typically the largest opex component for treatment of produced water to reuse in hydraulic fracturing

18277,reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing simultaneously satisfies challenges of fresh water sourcing and the installation operation of an extensive disposal well infrastructure herein we systematically and rigorously investigate produced water treatment for reuse during hydraulic fracturing highly saline and turbid produced water from the permian basin was treated by adding chlorine as an oxidant fecl3 as the primary coagulant and an anionic polymer to induce high rate sedimentation to generate clean brine by removing suspended solids and iron over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures mobile phone video capture optical microscopy and digital image video analysis were employed to characterize floc morphology and measure its size and settling velocity conformational changes of the polymeric coagulant between 4 and 44 c were inferred from viscosity and dynamic light scattering measurements providing clues to its performance characteristics floc settling velocities measured over the entire range of polymer dosages and temperatures were empirically modelled incorporating their fractal nature average size and the viscosity of the produced water using only a single fitting parameter juxtaposing the anionic polymer with the hydrolyzing metal ion coagulant effectively destabilized the suspension and caused floc growth through a combination of enmeshment adsorption and charge neutralization and inter particle bridging as evidenced by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis very high turbidity 98 and total iron 97 removals were accomplished even with very short flocculation and sedimentation times of only 6 minutes each suggesting the feasibility of this approach to reuse produced water for hydraulic fracturing graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydraulic fracturing coagulation flocculation clarification produced water reuse polymer 1 introduction high volume hydraulic fracturing has largely enabled the dramatic growth in oil and natural gas production from unconventional reservoirs in the united states however median values of cumulative water use for horizontal well completion and water use intensity water use normalized to well lateral length have increased 17 fold from 2460 m3 to 42 560 m3 and 9 fold from 2 4 m3 m to 21 1 m3 m respectively from 2008 to 2016 kondash et al 2018 scanlon et al 2017 correspondingly increasing produced water volumes the vast majority of produced water is currently disposed via injection wells kondash et al 2018 vidic et al 2013 which requires suitable isolated injection zones with sufficient capacity for the life of the field and incurs substantial infrastructure and operating and maintenance costs however recycling produced water simultaneously addresses issues related to deep well disposal and reduces the freshwater volume necessary for fracturing barnes et al 2015 vidic et al 2013 we target the most prolific unconventional reservoir play in the united states the permian basin sourcing water for full field development therein represents a significant problem since it is in short supply in semi arid regions of west texas and southeastern new mexico the median ratio of water to oil production in the permian basin ranges from 3 to 5 kondash et al 2018 walsh and sharma 2018 presenting significant operational challenges to water management and disposal further produced water volumes are 200 400 in excess of the annual completion source water demand offering significant reuse opportunities scanlon et al 2017 necessitating systematic and rigorous investigations to select appropriate treatment techniques and optimize their operating conditions reusing produced water for hydraulic fracturing is predicated primarily on efficient removal of solids and iron and inactivating microorganisms to minimize the potential for well clogging and formation damage barnes et al 2015 iron is incompatible with polymers and other fracturing fluid additives and an upper limit of 10 mg l has been suggested for reuse in hydraulic fracturing barnes et al 2015 sharma and bjornen 2018 given the geographic spread of production well locations a compact decentralized mobile campaign style high throughput treatment is required to purify produced water since fast pumping rates are required for high volume hydraulic fracturing pointing to the need for high rate clarification sharma and bjornen 2018 aluminum and iron have been used to remove colloids and organics in produced water with existing literature mainly focusing on evaluating the role of operating conditions such as ph chemical dosage and type mixing speeds or shear rate residence time feed water quality etc he et al 2014 2016 rosenblum et al 2016 shamaei et al 2018 wang et al 2015 these studies have typically employed 30 min residence times each for flocculation and sedimentation which are too long for mobile field installations however treatment footprint can be reduced and portability enhanced by complementing hydrolyzing metal ion coagulants with organic polymers which greatly increases floc size strength and sedimentation rate at low cost bolto and gregory 2007 duan and gregory 2003 hogg 2013 jarvis et al 2005a to date only limited data are available regarding the suitability of polymers to treat produced water colloids he et al 2014 pourrezaei et al 2011 these studies on canadian oil sands and the marcellus shale employed long treatment times 30 min each for flocculation and sedimentation not investigating high rate sedimentation another challenge is seasonal operation since temperature impacts treatment kinetics by changing water density and viscosity duan and gregory 2003 mpofu et al 2004 winkler et al 2012 necessitating experiments over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures the objectives of this research are to i mechanistically evaluate synergistic effects of fecl3 and polymer addition on colloid including particulate iron destabilization and high rate sedimentation ii develop and implement robust techniques using video and image analysis to quantify floc morphology size and settling velocity and iii characterize process performance and floc properties over the 4 44 c range isothermal jar tests were performed with produced water from the permian basin using fecl3 as the primary coagulant in conjunction with an anionic polymer floc size and settling rate were measured by digitally analyzing mobile phone videos of their sedimentation in a quiescent water column optical images were used to determine 2 d floc fractal dimensions an empirical relationship linking the settling velocity to the floc size fractal dimension and produced water viscosity over a range of polymer dosages and temperatures was derived thermogravimetric analysis tga and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy provided direct evidence of polymer adsorption on iron flocs 2 materials and methods 2 1 produced water sample produced water was obtained from the wolfcamp shale formation of the delaware basin in the western structural subdivision of the permian basin at the new mexico texas border during late stages of production with no existing flooding indicating that it was predominantly native formation water wolfcamp is a thermally mature organic rich shale play of ultralow permeability within a vertical depth of 3000 m scanlon et al 2017 samples were acidified to ph 5 prior to shipment to avoid iron precipitation and stored at 4 c upon receipt experiments were completed in 2 months to avoid significant changes to the sample s integrity during storage several of its water quality parameters were measured via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry ion gas chromatography and colorimetry control experiments were performed with a solution of 160 g l nacl and 30 5 g l cacl2 2h2o mimicking the major ions and the ionic strength of the produced water sample to better understand underlying coagulation mechanisms by eliminating interferences from organic matter present in the field sample 2 2 jar testing initially we attempted to solely use the dissolved iron inherently present in the produced water as the primary coagulant by adding chlorine and simultaneously increasing the ph to 8 5 to precipitate fe iii this did not well remove turbidity possibly due to formation of less dense colloidal iron lytle et al 2004 hence fecl3 was externally added 20 50 70 and 120 mg l as fe and ph was adjusted to 7 5 8 0 and 8 5 targeting 2 mg l total chlorine residual for microbial control maximum turbidity was removed at a fecl3 dosage of 120 mg l as fe and ph of 8 5 0 1 at room temperature which was then used to determine the optimal polymer dosage in these jar tests samples were rapidly mixed at 586 s 1 for 2 min after first adding fecl3 as the primary coagulant followed by naoh and free cl2 and the polymer was added 30 s before end of flash mixing a linear anionic polymer of molecular weight of the order of 107 da flopam em235 snf was selected to facilitate bridging flocculation bolto and gregory 2007 several polymer concentrations 0 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l were evaluated in conjunction with the optimal fecl3 dosage flocculation was performed at 28 s 1 for 6 min and flocs were allowed to settle for only 6 min isothermal jar tests at 4 14 22 34 and 44 c innova 42 incubator eppendorf were performed at 120 mg l fecl3 dosage 8 5 0 1 ph 2 mg l total cl2 residual and 1 mg l polymer dosage to compare performance under identical chemical conditions sections 3 2 and 3 3 at the end of each experiment 100 ml of the supernatant was pipetted for water quality analysis the power input was adjusted accounting for changes in produced water viscosity with temperature fig 8 to maintain the mixing intensity duan and gregory 2003 duplicate jar tests at optimal coagulation conditions at 22 and 44 c revealed 5 1 coefficient of variation and 7 5 relative percent difference for average floc diameter fractal dimension and settling velocity demonstrating reproducibility of experiments and laboratory protocols allowing statistical comparison of results 2 3 fractal dimension light scattering is not well suited to measure 3d fractal dimensions of very large aggregates because of sedimentation during measurement potential shadowing and multiple scattering that invalidate the rayleigh gans debye conditions bushell et al 2002 3d fractal dimensions can also be determined by using models relating floc size to their settling velocity aziz et al 2003 johnson et al 1996 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 that invoke assumptions such as an initially monodispersed suspension of identical colloids spherical particles and flocs and brinkman darcy flow internal to the floc of known effective density since these idealizations are generally invalid in industrial wastewaters 2d fractal dimensions df 2d were obtained via digital image analysis chakraborti et al 2003 gorczyca and ganczarczyk 1996 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 yu et al 2010 especially since iron flocs provided high contrast in microscopy jarvis et al 2005b entire flocs were imaged on an olympus bx53 optical microscope in the bright field transmittance mode with a 4x objective lens to directly measure df 2d via box counting jarvis et al 2005b vahedi and gorczyca 2011 the z axis motor drive installation and cellsens dimension software facilitated easy image acquisition and processing images were overlaid after converting them to gray scale and thresholding to binary format with squares of decreasing length r and determining the number of squares n that fully encompass the floc bushell et al 2002 landini 2011 a logarithmic plot of number of squares occupied and their reciprocal size gives df 2d equation 1 50 100 flocs were analyzed from each experiment using a program written in matlab 1 d f 2 d lim r 0 l o g n l o g 1 r 2 4 floc size and settling velocity after completing jar tests 1 l of clear supernatant was transferred to a 40 cm high and 6 cm wide glass settling column floc samples were gently extracted using a wide tip pipette and carefully transferred to this column to avoid breakage to the extent possible gorczyca and ganczarczyk 1996 johnson et al 1996 winkler et al 2012 videos of settling flocs were recorded using a cellphone camera at 60 fps and 1080 1920 pixels resolution after backlighting the column with a light emitting diode source this procedure ensured that flocs were settling in water with identical chemical composition and properties e g density viscosity and ion concentration as during their formation in jar tests based on preliminary tests videos were taken at a height of 14 cm from the bottom and 24 cm from the top after particles attained and maintained their terminal velocity the video was split into frames and the threshold pixel value was set in each case to clearly visualize flocs from the background around 500 flocs were analyzed in each experiment within a central investigation window of 2 cm 1 6 cm to minimize wall effects a lagrangian approach termed particle tracking velocimetry was used to track aggregates ouellette et al 2008 the light intensity and coordinates of each pixel constituting a floc was used to determine its center of mass using a code developed in matlab the vertical displacement between frames and within each frame duration 1 67 ms of the center of mass was in turn used to calculate the instantaneous type i sedimentation rate over 3 15 s durations depending on floc characteristics sedimentation rates with a coefficient of variance 0 3 were discarded since it implied wall effects in the direction normal to the video frame floc areas were measured using the image processing toolbox in matlab which was then converted to an equivalent spherical diameter 2 5 zeta potential the electrophoretic mobility of colloids present in the produced water and from each jar testing experiment was measured using electrophoretic light scattering anton paar litesizer 500 and converted into a zeta potential using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation a latex reference material catalog number 175108 anton paar with zeta potential of 42 4 mv was used for standardization 2 6 viscosity the absolute viscosity of produced water and polymer solution 1 000 mg l were probed using a thermo scientific haake mars 60 rheometer the shear rate was increased from 0 1 to 1 000s 1 and then decreased back to the starting shear rate in a stepwise fashion collecting 5 data points per decade of shear rate using a double gap concentric cylinder measuring geometry the temperature was adjusted to target values of 4 11 20 22 34 44 and 60 c using a peltier module with 0 1 c precision inertia effects were limited by waiting 10s before logging the data at each shear rate step using a polyoxymethylene hood and solvent trap reduced sample

dilution 100 mg l in high ionic strength solution mimicking the produced water 160 g l nacl and 30 5 g l cacl2 2h2o an equilibration time of 10 min was chosen for each 5 c step and an average of three measurements are reported 2 8 atr ftir atr ftir spectra were collected for the air dried polymer using a nicolet is10 spectrometer equipped with ever glo source dtgs detector kbr beam splitter and omnic 9 0 software in the range of 4000 600 cm 1 in atr mode using a diamond itx accessory prior to analysis the background spectrum was collected and an average of three spectra each consisting of 128 scans at 4 cm 1 resolution are reported 2 9 powder xrd iron polymorphs precipitated in situ were collected after sedimentation centrifuged and examined by a bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer the clear supernatant was decanted and the pellet was washed with nanopure water and centrifuged again to reduce salt concentration this process was repeated three times after which a few water drops were added to the pellet and sonicated to attain a homogenous suspension around 2 ml of this suspension was pipetted onto a quartz disc air dried for at least 24 h after which diffraction patterns were collected using cu kα radiation 1 54056 å at 40 kv and 40 ma diffractograms were collected from 2 2θ 70 with a step size of 0 05 2θ s and interpreted using the international center for diffraction data database 2 10 thermogravimetric analysis tga tga was performed on 6 mg samples after overnight drying at 60 c tga q50 ta instruments over the range 22 450 c at a constant heating rate of 10 c min under a dry n2 atmosphere temperature and weight were continuously recorded to determine the tga and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the hydraulic fracturing produced water the sample was extremely saline tds 200 000 mg l with chloride and sodium as its main components similar to bakken and marcellus shales attributed to the partial evaporation of paleo seawater equilibration with formation mineralogy and ion exclusion in compacted shale minerals increasing salinity of surrounding formation waters correspondingly the produced water was 12 denser 1 116 g cm3 and 30 more viscous 1 30 mpa s than pure water behaving in a newtonian fashion over 4 decades of shear rates at 22 c fig 8 the sample was relatively turbid 70 ntu with dissolved organic carbon doc concentration 400 mg l which is 3 4 times higher than those reported for wolfcamp in the midland basin khan et al 2016 high mg ca sr silica and doc concentrations are attributed to its geologic origins in organic rich mixed silicate sandstone and limestone reservoirs enrichment of ca and sr in excess of seawater evaporite suggests dolomitization where mg replaces ca and sr ions to form less soluble precipitates which is supported by the relatively low bicarbonate concentration minor amounts of ba are due to baso4 equilibrium in the reservoir similarly concentrations of br i and b are in excess of seawater evaporite and attributed to microbial degradation of type ii marine kerogen present in source rocks engle et al 2016 high ammonium is attributed to denitrification of source rock engle et al 2016 and constitutes chlorine demand iron is ubiquitous in produced waters from shale plays and is released from biological activity under low redox and acidic environments as dissolved fe ii low molecular weight organic acids including acetic propionic butyric and lactic acid were present representing potential substrates for heterotrophic and sulfate reducing bacteria the ftir spectrum of the raw produced water second from the bottom in fig 4 in red color provided evidence for b 1004 cm 1 of vsb o si 1100 cm 1 of vsi o carbonates and coordinated carbonates vco3 2 1458 cm 1 and 1637 cm 1 respectively organic acids vc o of carboxylates at 1560 cm 1 as well as aliphatic and aromatic compounds vc h stretching at 2800 3000 cm 1 chorghe et al 2017 validating several inorganic and organic constituents reported in table 1 3 2 removal of turbidity doc and iron supernatant turbidity was 10 ntu 86 removal and total residual iron was 6 5 mg l 84 removal at room temperature when only fecl3 was employed polymer addition progressively improved supernatant water quality turbidity of 4 2 3 8 1 9 and 1 8 ntu and total iron of 3 8 3 0 1 2 and 1 1 mg l for polymer dosages of 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l respectively also at 22 c hence adding polymer increased flocs settling velocities and better aggregated smaller colloids that did not settle well with fecl3 alone lytle et al 2004 also doc removal was 35 similar to earlier results from eagle ford chorghe et al 2017 supernatant turbidity 2 ntu and total iron 1 2 mg l at 1 mg l polymer dose in 6 min demonstrates that optimizing chemical dosages achieves suspended solids and total iron requirements for reuse for hydraulic fracturing hence the rest of the work largely focused on analyzing floc characteristics and coagulation mechanisms responsible for high rate sedimentation 3 3 polymer effect on floc size morphology and sedimentation rates floc sizes increased by adding progressively more polymer at room temperature as seen qualitatively in optical images of representative flocs fig 1 a e which exhibited the characteristic reddish brown hue of fe iii hydr oxide equivalent spherical diameters quantitatively increased with polymer concentration fig 1f biggest enhancements to the size were obtained at lower doses rising from 180 μm with only fecl3 no polymer to 540 μm for 0 1 mg l and further to 830 μm for 0 5 mg l polymer dosage flocs did not appreciably grow in size by adding more polymer average 0 89 mm at 1 mg l increasing to only 1 0 mm at 2 mg l higher exposure times of same light intensity were needed to optically image flocs generated at increasing polymer concentrations suggesting closer packing of aggregates qualitative inspection of images in fig 1 also reveals that flocs were loose open and porous at polymer doses 0 5 mg l whereas more densely packed structures were visualized at doses 1 mg l this was quantitatively supported by df 2d measurements fig 2 a with only fecl3 i e no polymer df 2d was 1 44 which is in the same range as aluminum coagulation of kaolin and latex microspheres chakraborti et al 2003 moruzzi et al 2017 iron with and without polymer for drilling wastewater wang et al 2017 and marine snow but lower than illite and montmorillonite flocs gorczyca and ganczarczyk 1996 adding polymer increased df 2d reaching 1 74 at the highest polymer dose evaluated similar to earlier observations glover et al 2000 jarvis et al 2008 yang et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 which has been attributed to strong electrostatic interactions between the iron flocs and polymer jarvis et al 2005a as described in section 3 6 sedimentation rates were high in the same range as alum and activated sludge flocs gorczyca and ganczarczyk 2001 also increasing monotonically over the entire range of polymer dosages fig 2b similar to average size and fractal dimension highest increases were measured at the lowest polymer dose nearly tripling from 1 mm s with only fecl3 no polymer to 2 8 mm s for 0 1 mg l high polymer dosages did not appreciably increase the average sedimentation rate from 4 6 mm s at 1 mg l to only 5 mm s at 2 mg l similar trends in settling velocity size and fractal dimension suggests a quantitative relationship between them high resolution scanning electron microscopy vega3 tescan also showed changes in floc surface morphology with polymer addition as depicted in fig 2c d and e for polymer dosages of 0 1 and 2 mg l respectively when no polymer was added fig 2c floc surfaces appeared to be smooth and gelatinous with no discernible order or habit consistent with the precipitation of polymorphic amorphous fe iii hydr oxide in the presence of organic matter and other contaminants also fig 3 this is similar to aluminum which precipitates as amorphous al oh 3 in natural waters due to competition of organic acids with hydroxyl ions violante and huang 1985 in the presence of the polymer flocs appeared to be rough fig 2d and e attributed to macroflocs arising from bridges between primary particles compact flocculi and microflocs and preservation of voids and channels after evaporation during drying prior to electron microscopy gorczyca and ganczarczyk 2001 zhou et al 2017 3 4 precipitation of amorphous fe iii hydr oxide diffractogram peaks fig 3 were used to calculate d spacing of planes using bragg s law and in turn the miller indices even though the flocs had been washed multiple times only halite 200 220 111 and 222 and calcite crystals were detected 104 110 113 202 211 214 and 300 absence of strong iron peaks and the noisy baseline indicates poor crystallinity of the fresh fe iii hydr oxide precipitates lytle et al 2004 consistent with the retarded crystallization of highly ordered phases caused by sorption of in organic components gunnars et al 2002 3 5 physicochemical evidence for polymer adsorption the atr ftir spectrum of the air dried polymer bottom spectrum in fig 4 in black color exhibited the following peaks 1410 cm 1 of vscoo of acrylate υcn of acrylamide 1458 cm 1 of ch2 scissoring vibration of acyl amino group 1559 cm 1 of vascoo of acrylate 1654 cm 1 of vc o of acrylamide and δoh of water broad bands spanning 3700 3000 cm 1 vh o h are largely due to residual water that overwhelmed any amine peaks vas and vsnh2 of acrylamide magalhães et al 2012 thermogravimetry of the polymer fig 5 a showed two stage degradation as previously reported for polyacrylamide the weight loss around 350 c corresponding to ammonia release from amide groups and the peak around 400 c symptomatic of its thermal decomposition burrows et al 1981 yang 2000 ftir and tga results together validate the composition of flopam em 235 as poly sodium acrylate co acrylamide as designated by the manufacturer the raw produced water second spectrum from the bottom in fig 4 in red color also exhibited peaks at 1412 1459 1560 cm 1 demonstrating presence of functionalities characteristic of the polymer phenol a commonly reported produced water constituent elsner and hoelzer 2016 also contributes to peaks in 1700 1600 cm 1 range masking vc o of acrylamide at 1654 cm 1 these peaks were retained when coagulating the produced water without polymer i e only with iron second spectrum from the top in fig 4 in olive green color suggesting their uptake onto flocs therefore even though these characteristic peaks were also detected in spectra of produced water flocs generated with polymer top spectrum in fig 4 in orange color polymer adsorption cannot be inferred for this reason control experiments were performed using synthetic saline water closely matching major ions in the produced water without added organic matter flocs generated in this synthetic produced water with iron only fourth spectrum from the top in fig 4 in blue color served as the negative control where the characteristic anionic polymeric coagulant peaks 1410 1458 or 1560 cm 1 were absent note that the peak at 1654 cm 1 also arises from δoh of residual water not just vc o of acrylamide however the spectrum of the positive control i e coagulation of synthetic produced water with both iron and polymer third spectrum from the top in fig 4 in magenta color showed the peak at 1560 cm 1 corresponding to vascoo of acrylate signifying sorption of polymeric coagulant on iron precipitates dtg curves of solids remaining after low temperature oven drying the untreated produced water also showed several heat absorption peaks between 300 and 400 c overlapping those of the pure polymer fig 5b the corresponding tg curve showed weight loss in this temperature range which arises from the organics present table 1 and fig 4 hence although tg and dtg curves of flocs generated from produced water with and without polymer fig 5c and d respectively showed weight loss in the same temperature range as the pure polymer its sorption cannot be inferred from tga alone weight loss was observed only below 250 c attributed to loss of moisture in the negative control i e flocs generated without polymer in the synthetic water with no organics fig 5e in contrast weight loss in the tg curve and peaks in the dtg curve were detected in the positive control i e flocs with polymer in saline synthetic water fig 5f importantly the dtg peak of the raw polymer centered at 347 c fig 5a was shifted to 363 c in the presence of iron flocs and high salt concentrations fig 5f additionally a new peak appeared at 420 c suggesting a new thermal degradation step burrows et al 1981 increases in thermal degradation temperature and appearance of a new peak provides additional evidence for polymer sorption onto flocs verifying ftir results and the stabilizing effect of na and ca burrows et al 1981 yang 2000 additionally fig 5a shows that polymer weight loss commenced only at 350 c and 10 was refractory at 450 c weight loss in the 350 450 c range in fig 5f the positive control was 1 4 translating to a total mass of 1 8 mg closely corresponding to the 2 mg l polymer dosage providing further evidence of polymer sorption on iron flocs leading to colloid destabilization by bridging spectra of coagulated produced water top two spectra in fig 4 also show evidence of other sorbed constituents on flocs including tetrahedral and trigonal boron complexes 948 and 1412 cm 1 chorghe et al 2017 and organic species 1500 1600 and 2800 3000 cm 1 as did thermal stability of iron flocs in produced water fig 5c and d consistent with bulk removal of inorganics and doc section 3 2 3 6 destabilization and floc growth mechanisms the ζ potential of colloids present in the raw produced water was near neutral blue dot in fig 6 comparable to a previous report younker and walsh 2014 owing to its high ionic strength and presence of high concentrations of multivalent cations such as mg ca and fe adding fecl3 reversed the ζ potential to 15 mv justifying the use of an anionic polymer similar to he et al 2014 substantial turbidity removal in the absence of polymer 86 when colloids were significantly positively charged suggests that enmeshment and sweep coagulation by amorphous fe iii hydr oxides was the dominant destabilization mechanism progressive polymer addition reduced the ζ potential 2 mv at 0 1 mg l and 6 mv at higher dosages indicative of its adsorption as evidenced by ftir and tga hence adsorption of polymer chains charge neutralized colloids also contributing to floc growth by interparticle bridging bolto and gregory 2007 hogg 2013 increasing floc sizes for dosages 0 5 mg l fig 1f corresponding to negative ζ potential indicates polymer sorption was dominated by hydrogen bonding and formation of particle mg or ca polyelectrolyte bridges bolto and gregory 2007 given their high concentrations in the produced water charge neutralization and inter particle bridging upon polymer sorption formed large strong and dense aggregates with higher df 2d with polymer addition as shown in fig 2a wang et al 2017 yang et al 2013 zeng et al 2007 3 7 temperature effects on floc size morphology and sedimentation based on results presented in sections 3 2 and 3 3 a polymer dose of 1 mg l ph 8 5 120 mg l fecl3 as fe and 2 mg l cl2 residual was selected for jar testing at different temperatures as summarized in fig 7 a flocs were biggest on average 900 μm at 22 c but decreased considerably in size at higher and lower temperatures to only 240 μm at 4 c and 380 μm at 44 c these measurements were supported by optical images that also qualitatively showed modifications to floc morphology with changing temperatures with denser structures visible at 22 c this was confirmed by digital analysis of optical images which showed highest df 2d at room temperature 1 67 decreasing to 1 57 at the highest and lowest temperatures investigated fig 7b type 1 free settling velocities fig 7c followed identical trends as their size and df 2d in that it was highest 4 5 mm s at 22 c decreasing to 1 1 mm s at 4 c and to 3 1 mm s at 44 c loose open flocs are expected to settle slower than their denser counterparts having the same overall size aziz et al 2003 johnson et al 1996 tang and raper 2002 vahedi and gorczyca 2011 this non monotonic relationship between temperature and size df 2d and sedimentation velocity all peaking at an intermediate value of 22 c could be the result of optimizing coagulation chemistry only at room temperature as described in section 2 2 in other words since temperature impacts the ζ potential of reservoir minerals and colloids mpofu et al 2004 rodríguez and araujo 2006 and flocculation kinetics it is necessary to adjust jar testing conditions when temperature changes to maximize turbidity removal and settling velocity duan and gregory 2003 fitzpatrick et al 2004 winkler et al 2012 in addition to size and fractal dimension temperature also influences floc sedimentation by affecting the suspending fluid s viscosity i e the frictional resistance experienced during sedimentation adachi 2016 fitzpatrick et al 2004 winkler et al 2012 as shown in fig 8 left panel the produced water behaved as a newtonian liquid with an average viscosity of 1 30 mpa s at 22 c increasing to 2 1 mpa s at 4 c and reducing to 0 85 mpa s at 44 c these values were used to quantitatively adjust the mixing intensity in jar tests at different temperatures section 2 2 and also used in modeling floc sedimentation fig 9 the viscosity and hydrodynamic size of the polymeric coagulant were also measured to better understand its role in aggregation the anionic polymer exhibited shear thinning rheology fig 8 middle panel attributed to disentanglement of its individual chains at higher shear rates bolto and gregory 2007 its zero shear viscosity was 60 7 mpa s at 4 c decreasing to only 18 4 mpa s at 44 c decreasing viscosities at higher temperatures has been reported to negatively impact flocculation by disrupting hydrogen bonds between the polymer and water in turn favoring polymer polymer interactions leading to more coiling mpofu et al 2004 dls showed polymer hydrodynamic sizes 3 5 times higher in the highly saline water compared with low salinity systems mpofu et al 2004 suggesting aggregation of individual polymer units in fig 8 right panel it also confirmed decreasing polymer sizes above room temperature e g 1 440 nm at 22 c and 700 nm at 44 c polymer units were smaller below 22 c as well e g 900 nm at 4 c demonstrating its coiling polymer coiling impedes its ability to effectively form inter particle bridges between colloids resulting in the formation of smaller flocs at temperatures both higher and lower than 22 c when its concentration was maintained at 1 mg l similar results have been reported for a na acrylate carboxyl substituted anionic polyacrylamide copolymer flocculent aid for a warm 20 60 c low salinity synthetic water mpofu et al 2004 based on average floc diameter d in mm df 2d and settling velocity vsettling in mm s coupled to viscosity μ in mpa s a simple model was derived v settling d d f 2 d 0 56 μ which accurately captured the entire dataset i e for various polymer doses at 22 c fig 9 left panel and for various temperatures at 1 mg l polymer dose fig 9 right panel the exponent 0 56 was statistically estimated by fitting to experimental data since it is unlikely that the myriad assumptions underlying theoretical models of sedimentation of fractal aggregates adachi 2016 aziz et al 2003 johnson et al 1996 tang and raper 2002 would be satisfied in our jar tests nevertheless settling velocity scaled in similar manner reported for idealized scenarios with only a single fitting parameter suggesting the validity of this simple model of high rate sedimentation over the entire range of temperatures and polymer doses investigated 4 conclusions fecl3 in conjunction with an anionic polymer dramatically improved colloid destabilization and floc growth in a highly saline produced water via enmeshment of primary colloids by amorphous iron precipitates and inter particle bridging by the adsorbed polymer larger stronger and denser flocs thus formed settled at extremely high rates without breakage exceeding 1 mm s even at 4 c a modest polymer dose of 1 mg l enhanced sedimentation rate by a factor of 5 at 22 c reducing supernatant turbidity and total iron concentration with low 6 min flocculation and sedimentation times even at these high settling rates clarification times using traditional weir tanks or conventional settling tanks can be 1 h in the permian and 6 h for marcellus and bakken during cold weather operation the full advantage of extremely rapid solids settling rates can be realized only by installing properly designed high rate clarifiers with inclined internal settlers plate or tube which have the potential to reduce clarification times by a factor of 10 we addressed a key data gap in the literature by measuring settling rates for coagulated amorphous iron flocs in a high density brine over a range of environmentally relevant temperatures which will assist design engineers develop new and optimize existing clarifier designs results also demonstrate the explicit need to optimize coagulation chemistry when temperatures change with season floc settling velocities were quantitatively related to their average size and fractal dimension over the entire range of temperatures and polymer dosages investigated using a simple model with a single fitting parameter this empirical parameter would need to be estimated on a case by case basis since it is expected to vary with produced water composition metal ion coagulant and polymer type ph mixing conditions residence time etc finally we recommend video analysis of floc settling rate in conjunction with conventional jar testing to optimize chemical addition which is typically the largest opex component for treatment of produced water to reuse in hydraulic fracturing

18278,in this work we investigated the effect of bromide ion br on ndma formation using model precursor compounds wastewater effluents and surface waters previous studies showed that br reacts with chloramines and forms bromochloramine a reactive compound responsible for ndma formation enhancement some limitations of those studies were the highest br concentrations used and the limited number of precursors considered here we observed enhancement of ndma formation from most of the model precursor compounds within the br range 0 1000 μg l but this effect was suppressed in the presence of nom also ndma formation was favored at ph 8 in the presence of br compared to ph 6 nevertheless br suppressed ndma formation in wastewater effluent samples at low monochloramine doses while no effects were observed in surface waters keywords ndma bromide ndma model precursors natural water wastewater 1 introduction n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is a disinfection byproduct dbp formed mainly during the

bromide is readily oxidized by chloramines to form bromamines and bromochloramine nhbrcl bromamines are less stable than chloramines and generally more reactive le roux et al 2012 br enhanced the formation of ndma during chloramination chen et al 2010 luh and mariñas 2012 however most of those studies were conducted with high br levels that are not likely to represent relevant environmental concentrations for instance br enhanced the formation of ndma from dimethylamine dma 0 3 mm initial monochloramine nh2cl concentration of 0 3 mm ph 7 and br ranging from 0 to 24 000 μg l chen et al 2010 however ndma formation from trimethylamine tma was inhibited in the presence of br 0 79 904 μg l and in similar disinfection conditions to dma the formation rate of ndma during chloramination of dma was faster in the presence of 2497 μg l br during the first 12 h of reaction time chen et al 2010 also the authors found that the greatest ndma formation occurred at neutral ph regardless of the absence or presence of br in another study ndma formation showed an increase of only 6 ng l from 23 to 29 ng l in an experiment with natural water in the presence of br 0 159 800 μg l nh2cl 70 mg l as

samples table 2 were amended with br at concentrations ranging from naturally occurring up to 1000 μg l and then chloraminated to investigate the effect of br on the formation of ndma the concentration of ndma was normalized to the concentration of ndma in the absence of br c0 and the results are shown in figs 1 and 2 ndma formation in the absence of br during ufc chloramination in sw samples was relatively low 10 ng l indicating the lack of a significant amount of ndma precursors on the other hand ndma formation fp conditions were relatively higher this is 30 ng l sw 1 21 ng l sw 2 and 42 ng l sw 2 in sw samples ndma formation with 3 or 100 mg l nh2cl as cl2 was not enhanced with increasing br concentration fig 1 ndma yields in the absence of br in ww fig 2 were significantly higher than in sw samples ranging from 145 to 190 ng l and 433 1620 ng l for ufc and fp respectively in the presence of br ndma formation was suppressed with nh2cl at 3 mg l as cl2 with increasing br concentration however no changes were observed at 100 mg l as cl2 bromide decreased ndma formation in ww samples but caused no effect in sw waters since nh2cl br mass ratios were the same in sw and ww samples thus other components in water need to be considered to explain the observed br effect on ndma formation in ww samples in the literature studies reported that br enhanced ndma yields from chloramination of dma chen et al 2010 luh and mariñas 2012 however competition for nh2cl of background constituents in the water was minimized since those experiments were conducted in ddw the presence of a complex background matrix that includes nom soluble microbial products smps and a wider range of ndma precursors may explain the different trends observed in this study in the presence of br nh2cl decays as br is oxidized by nh2cl to bromochloramine nhbrcl bousher et al 1989 gazda and margerum 1994 le roux et al 2012 trote et al 1980 firstly the ionization of nh2cl forms monochlorammonium ion nh3cl eq 1 table s1 nh3cl an intermediate compound oxidizes br and leads to the production of bromamines eq 2 table s1 vikesland et al 2001 additionally the hydrolysis of nh2cl forms free chlorine that can also further oxidize br to hypobromous acid hobr eq 4 5 in table s1 however in typical chloramination conditions the oxidation of br by nh3cl usually dominates both nh2br and hobr undergo further rapid reactions to produce mixed bromochloramines primarily bromochloramine nhbrcl eq 3 table s1 additional fast decomposition reactions of nhbrcl lead to formation of br eq 6 bousher et al 1989 overall br acts as a catalytic in the decomposition of nh2cl increasing br results in less nh2cl available and more highly reactive nhbrcl formed however in the presence of nom a series of reactions of nh2cl with nom provides a more complex scenario wastewater effluent samples contain more reactive ndma reactive precursors than surface waters it has been demonstrated that nh2cl decay rate increases with increasing br concentration at the same time that bromochloramine increases luh and mariñas 2014 nhbrcl is expected to produce more ndma than nh2cl due to the higher electronegativity of the brominated nitrogen atom thus favoring the nucleophilic substitution with the dma moiety le roux et al 2012 however an increase in the bromochloramine concentrations did not form more ndma in the wastewater effluent samples it is reasonable to think that bromochloramine reacted with effluent organic matter efom nom plus smps rather than with ndma precursors and consequently decreased the formation of ndma 3 2 effect of bromide on the formation of ndma from model precursor compounds the effect of br concentration 0 1000 μg l on ndma yield was assessed by conducting experiments with nine ndma model precursors compounds and ufc and fp chloramination ndma model precursor compounds concentrations were 200 nm it was expected that in these conditions nh2cl decayed predominantly by self decomposition and by br oxidation moreover the effect of background nom and or efom was minimized by running the experiments in ddw thus formation of ndma occurred from the reaction of precursors and haloamines added or formed during the reaction ndma formation was normalized to the concentration of ndma formed in the absence of br as shown in fig 3 nh2cl 3 mg l as cl2 the presence of br enhanced the formation of ndma in solutions of the selected ndma model precursors compounds in the range of br concentrations studied 0 1000 μg l dmipa dmbza and rntd exhibited the highest ndma molar conversion yield 37 9 73 1 and 78 8 respectively low yield ndma precursor compounds such as dma tma and dman had molar conversion rates 1 similar to that found in literature selbes et al 2013 however of the three compounds dma and tma rendered the higher increase of ndma in the presence of br which was about two fold nhbrcl is expected to form more ndma than nh2cl due to the higher electronegativity of the brominated nitrogen atom consequently favoring the nucleophilic substitution with dma le roux et al 2012 despite the high conversion rate to ndma of dmbza and rntd br did not enhance the formation of ndma this can be explained by the fast and high molar conversion rate into ndma upon chloramination of these two compounds le roux et al 2012 2011 shen and andrews 2011 spahr et al 2017 from the three tested polymers only polydadmac and polyacryl were affected by the presence of br a second set of experiments was conducted with the ndma model precursors compounds under fp conditions the results fig 4 indicate that the formation of ndma from the selected precursors remained relatively constant without any change with increasing br concentrations when the ratio of nh2cl to br was increased even though bromochloramine is more reactive than nh2cl it is also less stable than nh2cl due to the abundance of nh2cl in fp conditions the bromamines and bromochloramine can be deactivated by reacting with nh2cl le roux et al 2012 ndma yield from chloramination nh2cl 175 mg l as cl2 of dma was almost double in the presence of 79 904 μg l br nh2cl br molar ratio of 2 5 1 and 24 h of reaction time le roux et al 2012 in contrast in our study molar ratios of nh2cl br were 3 4 1 and 114 1 with 1000 μg l br for ufc and fp conditions respectively these findings emphasize the importance of the nh2cl to br ratio an additional experiment was conducted with only dma and tma the solutions containing the amines were oxidized with nh2cl at 3 mg l as cl2 and 3 d of reaction time bromide concentration ranged from 0 to 32 000 μg l fig 5 such high concentrations of br are not expected to occur in source waters but were used to illustrate how br can increase the formation of ndma in waters that contain precursors that generally have low ndma conversion yield under these conditions ndma rose linearly as the br increased ndma formation from dma was enhanced by 25 fold and by 45 fold from tma 3 3 effect of the ph on ndma formation in the presence of bromide in selected model precursors compounds the effect of ph on the formation of ndma from dma tma polydadmac and polyacryl was studied in the presence of 1000 μg l br and nh2cl at 3 mg l as cl2 the ph was controlled with 0 002 m phosphate buffer at 6 7 and 8 ndma formation was normalized relative to the concentration at ph 6 and the results are shown in fig 6 all the investigated compounds exhibited an increase to a different extent in the concentration of ndma formed as the ph increased particularly tma and polydadmac showed the higher rate of ndma formation while polyacryl was not considerably affected by the changes in the ph ndma formation enhancement with increasing ph from 6 to 8 in the presence of br during chloramination was attributed to the formation of the highly reactive bromochloramine bromochloramine was found to be more stable at ph 8 than 6 luh and mariñas 2014 thus the higher formation of ndma at ph 8 compared to ph 6 was attributed to the increased stability of bromochloramine at ph 6 bromochloramine rapidly decomposes decreasing the conversion rate of ndma precursors to ndma also at ph 8 the ratio of the deprotonated amine is higher than at lower ph values consequently favoring the reaction kinetics towards the ndma formation schreiber and mitch 2006 selbes et al 2018 shen and andrews 2013 3 4 effect of nom on the formation of ndma in selected model precursor compounds and treated water it is important to understand the effect of br on the formation of ndma from selected ndma model precursors in the presence of nom due to the water treatment practical implications the effect of nom on the formation of ndma from dma tma polydadmac polyacryl was evaluated in the presence of 1000 μg l br the initial concentrations were dma and tma 200 nm polydadmac 0 2 mg l and polyacryl 1 0 mg l untreated water from a dwtp was adjusted with ddw to the appropriate doc concentration the results are presented in fig 7 ndma formation was normalized to the concentration of ndma in the presence of br and no doc the formation of ndma from dma tma and polydadmac was suppressed by 70 at 0 94 mg c l while polyacryl was less impacted 25 by the presence of nom after 1 9 mg l doc the formation of ndma remained constant for the four compounds the difference in the molecular structures of the model precursors did not cause changes in the pattern of ndma formation under the experimental conditions it was clear that increasing doc concentration suppressed the formation of ndma from the selected ndma precursor compound but the effect was stronger for dma tma and polydadmac bromide enhanced the formation of ndma from the selected compounds fig 3 in the absence of nom however such conditions are not expected to happen during water treatment nom is a ubiquitous component of natural waters nh2cl decay in the presence of nom increases via two pathways auto decomposition and oxidation of nom chen and valentine 2006 in the conditions of our experiments bromamines species and to a lesser extent hobr are likely to form through the oxidation of br by nh2cl in the presence of nom hobr participates in oxidation substitution reactions resulting in a mixture of halogenated dbps that leads to the loss of nh2cl duirk and valentine 2007 the oxidation of br by nh2cl forms different active forms of bromine in the 1 valence state these bromine active species may also react with nom resulting in the formation of brominated and mixed chlorinated brominated dbps two major reactions in the oxidation of br are of importance first the ionization of nh2cl forms the monochlorammonium ion nh3cl that later oxidizes br to bromochloramine nhbrcl duirk and valentine 2007 le roux et al 2012 trote et al 1980 second the hydrolysis of nh2cl forms hypochlorous acid that further oxidize br to hobr valentine and jafvert 1988 it should be noted that nom competes for chloramines species schreiber and mitch 2007 thus all bromine species formed as a consequence of the oxidation of br either by nh2cl or hypochlorous acid can also oxidize nom duirk et al 2005 duirk and valentine 2007 vikesland et al 2001 thus there is a strong competition between ndma precursors and nom for all chloramine or bromine active species consequently it is postulated that the increase in the doc concentration results in the formation of more chlorinated brominated dbps and a decrease in the overall formation of ndma an additional experiment was conducted with treated water sw 2 to assess the effect of br on ndma formation during chloramination in the presence of nom the treated water was diluted with ddw to 2 0 mg l doc to simulate conditions of a finished water the samples were amended with dma and tma at 200 nm bromide was spiked at 0 250 500 and 1000 μg l ndma was measured and ndma molar yields were calculated results are presented in fig 8 bromide enhanced ndma formation from dma particularly at high br levels i e 1000 μg l for instance ndma molar yields were 1 26 0 02 vs 1 47 0 02 in the absence of br and with 1000 μg l this is a 17 increase from 187 3 ng l to 217 3 however tma showed no variation with increasing br concentration ndma molar yields from tma were 0 76 0 02 within the studied br range though in the absence of nom the formation of ndma from dma and tma increased by 88 and 110 respectively bromide is not effectively removed during conventional water treatment processes and br at high concentrations is a cause of concern because it can lead to higher formation of ndma overall the results show that enhancement of ndma formation due to presence of br is ndma precursor specific and is only relevant at high concentrations of br it is also important to note that the presence of nom increases the competition with ndma precursors for active brominated haloamines 4 conclusions previous studies showed that br enhanced ndma formation from a limited number of ndma precursors investigated and using high br concentrations magnifying its effect although br is a ubiquitous component in natural and wastewater effluents the reported concentrations e g 4000 μg l in the literature are lower than those used in such studies consistent with the literature we also found that br enhanced ndma formation from model precursors compounds since these experiments were conducted in deionized water the effect of nom was controlled however ndma formation increase due to the presence of br and nom is not observed nom competes with ndma precursors for chloramines or bromochloramines species in real waters increasing br concentration 0 1000 μg l in surface waters caused no enhancement on the formation of ndma either with nh2cl at 3 or 100 mg l as cl2 in contrast br suppressed ndma formation with increasing br concentration in wastewater effluent samples at nh2cl concentration of 3 mg l as cl2 an effect not observed at 100 mg cl2 l it is possible that bromochloramine reacted with nom rather than with ndma precursors and consequently decreased the formation of ndma therefore enhancement of ndma formation might not be as relevant considering environmental br levels and treated water doc conditions nonetheless it is important to note that increasing concentrations of br can occur due

18278,in this work we investigated the effect of bromide ion br on ndma formation using model precursor compounds wastewater effluents and surface waters previous studies showed that br reacts with chloramines and forms bromochloramine a reactive compound responsible for ndma formation enhancement some limitations of those studies were the highest br concentrations used and the limited number of precursors considered here we observed enhancement of ndma formation from most of the model precursor compounds within the br range 0 1000 μg l but this effect was suppressed in the presence of nom also ndma formation was favored at ph 8 in the presence of br compared to ph 6 nevertheless br suppressed ndma formation in wastewater effluent samples at low monochloramine doses while no effects

bromide is readily oxidized by chloramines to form bromamines and bromochloramine nhbrcl bromamines are less stable than chloramines and generally more reactive le roux et al 2012 br enhanced the formation of ndma during chloramination chen et al 2010 luh and mariñas 2012 however most of those studies were conducted with high br levels that are not likely to represent relevant environmental concentrations for instance br enhanced the formation of ndma from dimethylamine dma 0 3 mm initial monochloramine nh2cl concentration of 0 3 mm ph 7 and br ranging from 0 to 24 000 μg l chen et al 2010 however ndma formation from trimethylamine tma was inhibited in the presence of br 0 79 904 μg l and in similar disinfection conditions to dma the formation rate of ndma during chloramination of dma was faster in the presence of 2497 μg l br during the first 12 h of reaction time chen et al 2010 also the authors found that the greatest ndma formation occurred at neutral ph regardless of the absence or presence of br in another study ndma formation showed an increase of only 6 ng l from 23 to 29 ng l in an experiment with natural water in the presence of br 0 159 800 μg l nh2cl 70 mg l as cl2 and 48 h reaction time luo 2006 some studies reported enhancement of ndma formation during chloramination in the presence of br however typical experimental conditions focused mainly on dma as a

samples table 2 were amended with br at concentrations ranging from naturally occurring up to 1000 μg l and then chloraminated to investigate the effect of br on the formation of ndma the concentration of ndma was normalized to the concentration of ndma in the absence of br c0 and the results are shown in figs 1 and 2 ndma formation in the absence of br during ufc chloramination in sw samples was relatively low 10 ng l indicating the lack of a significant amount of ndma precursors on the other hand ndma formation fp conditions were relatively higher this is 30 ng l sw 1 21 ng l sw 2 and 42 ng l sw 2 in sw samples ndma formation with 3 or 100 mg l nh2cl as cl2 was not enhanced with increasing br concentration fig 1 ndma yields in the absence of br in ww fig 2 were significantly higher than in sw samples ranging from 145 to 190 ng l and 433 1620 ng l for ufc and fp respectively in the presence of br ndma formation was suppressed with nh2cl at 3 mg l as cl2 with increasing br concentration however no changes were observed at 100 mg l as cl2 bromide decreased ndma formation in ww samples but caused no effect in sw waters since nh2cl br mass ratios were the same in sw and ww samples thus other components in water need to be considered to explain the observed br effect on ndma formation in ww samples in the literature studies reported that br enhanced ndma yields from chloramination of dma chen et al 2010 luh and mariñas 2012 however competition for nh2cl of background constituents in the water was minimized since those experiments were conducted in ddw the presence of a complex background matrix that includes nom soluble microbial products smps and a wider range of ndma precursors may explain the different trends observed in this study in the presence of br nh2cl decays as br is oxidized by nh2cl to bromochloramine nhbrcl bousher et al 1989 gazda and margerum 1994 le roux et al 2012 trote et al 1980 firstly the ionization of nh2cl forms monochlorammonium ion nh3cl eq 1 table s1 nh3cl an intermediate compound oxidizes br and leads to the production of bromamines eq 2 table s1 vikesland et al 2001 additionally the hydrolysis of nh2cl forms free chlorine that can also further oxidize br to hypobromous acid hobr eq 4 5 in table s1 however in typical chloramination conditions the oxidation of br by nh3cl usually dominates both nh2br and hobr undergo further rapid reactions to produce mixed bromochloramines primarily bromochloramine nhbrcl eq 3 table s1 additional fast decomposition reactions of nhbrcl lead to formation of br eq 6 bousher et al 1989 overall br acts as a catalytic in the decomposition of nh2cl increasing br results in less nh2cl available and more highly reactive nhbrcl formed however in the presence of nom a series of reactions of nh2cl with nom provides a more complex scenario wastewater effluent samples contain more reactive ndma reactive precursors than surface waters it has been demonstrated that nh2cl decay rate increases with increasing br concentration at the same time that bromochloramine increases luh and mariñas 2014 nhbrcl is expected to produce more ndma than nh2cl due to the higher electronegativity of the brominated nitrogen atom thus favoring the nucleophilic substitution with the dma moiety le roux et al 2012 however an increase in the bromochloramine concentrations did not form more ndma in the wastewater effluent samples it is reasonable to think that bromochloramine reacted with effluent organic matter efom nom plus smps rather than with ndma precursors and

mariñas 2014 thus the higher formation of ndma at ph 8 compared to ph 6 was attributed to the increased stability of bromochloramine at ph 6 bromochloramine rapidly decomposes decreasing the conversion rate of ndma precursors to ndma also at ph 8 the ratio of the deprotonated amine is higher than at lower ph values consequently favoring the reaction kinetics towards the ndma formation

studies showed that br enhanced ndma formation from a limited number of ndma precursors investigated and using high br concentrations magnifying its effect although br is a ubiquitous component in natural and wastewater effluents the reported concentrations e g 4000 μg l in the literature are lower than those used in such studies consistent with the literature we also found that br enhanced ndma formation from model precursors compounds since these experiments were conducted in deionized water the effect of nom was controlled however ndma formation increase due to the presence of br and nom is not observed nom competes with ndma precursors for chloramines or bromochloramines species in real waters increasing br concentration 0 1000 μg l in surface waters caused no enhancement on the formation of ndma either with nh2cl at 3 or 100 mg l as cl2 in contrast br suppressed ndma formation with increasing br concentration in wastewater effluent samples at nh2cl concentration of 3 mg l as cl2 an effect not observed at 100 mg cl2 l it is possible that bromochloramine reacted with nom rather than with ndma precursors and consequently decreased the formation of ndma therefore enhancement of ndma formation might not be as relevant considering environmental br levels and treated water doc conditions nonetheless it is important to note that increasing concentrations of br can occur due to other anthropogenic activities and saltwater intrusion declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

18279,this study aims to enhance biological nitrogen removal performance by the innovative carbon based carriers the new carriers were produced based on recycling waste materials in these carriers the advantages of the hybrid system and physicochemical properties of activated carbon were integrated to promote microbial attachment to verify the performance of the new carriers compared to the conventional moving carriers the experiments were conducted in two parallel laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors under various operating conditions the analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the new carrier with a total pore volume of 0 0015cm3 gr was 10 9 times the specific surface area of a conventional carrier further the comparative results indicated that the new highly porous carriers made a major contribution to increasing the attached active biomass up to 20 2 from the data analysis do orp and ph it was also confirmed that the new carriers had a positive effect on the creation of a greater anoxic zone within the biofilm consequently the simultaneous nitrification denitrification and total nitrogen removal efficiencies enhanced significantly up to 14 3 and 16 8 respectively from the environmental and economic viewpoints the benefits of the novel carrier showed that it is a practical alternative for the conventional carrier providing a cost effective wastewater treatment technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal carbon based carriers biofilm adsorptive properties performance filling ratio 1 introduction the harmful environmental impacts arising from the release of wastewaters comprising nitrogen compounds into the environment such as toxicity potential on aquatic life eutrophication and the oxygen depletion in marine environments are well known today metcalf and eddy 2003 gao et al 2018 therefore to protect the environment it is essential to meet a strict restriction for the discharge of nitrogen compounds to the receiving waters in this regard by utilizing new technologies and of course regarding the economic considerations thereof enhancement of the performance of wastewater treatment plants is of major importance hence during recent years particular attention has been paid to biofilm based technologies such as the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr to achieve efficient organic and nutrient removal sbardella et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 the mbbr process has been proven as a compact and efficient technique for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters in which biomasses grow on the surfaces of moving carriers mainly interior surface ødegaard 2006 shi et al 2017 bakar et al 2018 hassani et al 2013 this process has certain benefits compared to the conventional activated sludge systems e g higher active biomass concentration robust tolerance to load fluctuations no need for sludge recirculation no sludge bulking problem less footprint requirement and resilient to toxic shock rusten et al 2006 helness and ødegaard 2008 mc quarrie and boltz 2011 leyva díaz et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 for mbbr systems the features of the carriers such as material surface roughness and surface area that affect microbial adhesion and growth have a key role in the system efficiency song et al 2019 abzazou et al 2016 accordingly various kinds of carriers such as plastic media polyurethane sponge non woven carriers ceramic carriers zeolite powder based polyurethane sponge etc have been introduced in the mbbr process deng et al 2016 peng et al 2018 young et al 2016 among the above media because of the benefits declared for the polyurethane sponge carriers for example great surface area rough surface good microbial adhesion this carrier type and its modification ways have been of interest to some researchers recently guo et al 2010 and nguyen et al 2010 reported that the organic and nutrient removal rates were independent of the sponge size and types luo et al 2014 found that micropollutant removal by this kind of carrier was unreliable and unstable investigation of the effect of filling ratio on the nitrification denitrification capacity by zhang et al 2016 indicated that total nitrogen removal tnr up to 85 5 was achievable for the optimum filling ratio of 20 deng et al 2016 stated that compared to the conventional mbbr carriers the sponge modified plastic carriers in a hybrid mbbr mbr system were capable of increasing the nutrient removal performance up to 10 and 6 8 for ammonium and phosphorous at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12h song et al 2019 modified the sponge carriers by zeolite powder addition and asserted that the modification was positively effective on the content of the attached biomass up to 30 their results revealed that the performance of tnr was improved by nearly 10 compared to the sponge carriers to date however among the upgraded carriers it has not been addressed the selection of the activated carbon coating in promoting the porosity and surface area of the carriers for decades activated carbon ac has been used for many industrial applications as the most broadly used adsorbent to remove impurities from gases or liquids and to increase process efficiency as a catalyst musmarra et al 2013 anirudhan et al 2011 arunajatesan et al 2009 pore size distribution and the magnitude of the surface area of ac are factors that influence its adsorption capacity and application ma et al 2017 zhan et al 2016 li et al 2018 bhatnagar et al 2013 furthermore depending on the properties of ac such as a high specific surface area and the chemical surface characteristics hydrophobicity and charge ac affects the adsorption of microorganisms ilomuanya et al 2011 2017 according to knezev 2015 the adsorption of microbial cells and the initial attachment of microorganisms occur due to the physicochemical interactions between the bacteria and ac surface which are controlled by van der waals and electrostatic forces thereafter a shift from the initial attachment to the powerful secondarily irreversible attachment occurs by the formation of extracellular polymers secreted by organisms based on the described subjects the purpose of this research was to enhance nitrogen removal performance in a simultaneous organic carbon and nitrogen removal system using the new carbon based carriers the idea for the manufacture of the new carriers was to merge the advantages of the mbbr hybrid system and the physicochemical features of activated carbon by employing the waste materials to improve the advantages of the conventional carriers and achieve a new optimized technology it should be noted that by referring to the literature due to different experimental conditions we encounter a wide variety of reported efficiencies therefore in this research the correct assessment of the effect and behavior of the new carriers was performed by the side by side comparison of two identical reactors with two different media types the principal objectives in this study are i to evaluate the effect of the highly porous new media on the formation and development of biofilm ii to investigate the enhancement of snd and tnr performances by employing the new carriers iii to assess the optimum filling ratio and suitable aeration rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 manufacturing process of the new carriers and the media specifications the new carriers cbmc were manufactured using the recycling of waste activated carbon disposed of into the environment and off line polyethylene mbbr carriers discarded through a chemical and thermal process the process carried out in a designed rotary drum in which the rotational speed of the drum and the temperature of the chamber were automatically controlled the production procedure has been explained in detail in the supplementary material in table1 the characteristics of the conventional and new carriers as well as the ac have been exhibited 2 2 experimental set up description the experiments were conducted in two parallel cylindrical reactors named mbbr reactor and cbmc reactor each reactor was operated in a sequential mode and had a working volume of 5 l approximately 55 of the volume of each reactor was filled with one kind of carrier i e the mbbr high quality and the cbmc in the pilot plant the feed was transferred from the storage tank to the reactors using two separate submersible pumps each reactor was equipped with a low speed mixer and a solenoid valve for complete evacuation of the reactors at the end of the cycles the sequences were automatically controlled via a plc controller and the ph orp dissolved oxygen concentration do and temperature of the content of each reactor were continuously recorded 2 3 feed composition during the tests the reactors were fed with similar wastewater the feed consisted of the following compounds which were dissolved in tap water sodium acetate and macro nutrients at average concentrations of 300mgcod l 55mgnh4 n l and 18mgpo4 3 p l plus the micro nutrients of the following mg l mncl2 7h2o 0 11 znso4 7h2o 0 18 cocl2 6h2o 0 17 cuso4 5h2o 0 16

from the return line of the settling tank of a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant in tehran was utilized as an inoculum in this phase the reactors with the filling ratio of 70 were exposed to the sludge in an anoxic aerobic sequential mode under similar conditions furthermore to favor the autotrophic growth in the attached biomasses the ph in each reactor was maintained at around 7 8 van loosdrecht et al 2016 grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the length of this phase lasted nearly 84 days for the biofilm formation and afterwards the stable conditions for ph do profile and the effluent concentrations reached the detailed procedure of acclimatization and cultivation in this phase has been explained in the supplementary material in the subsequent operating phases the tests were executed at the filling ratio of 55 excluding phases 4 and 5 for these phases the sequences were as follows i a feeding step of 5min ii an aerobic step of 350min iii a discharge step of 5min at the end of each cycle the whole liquid content of each reactor was drained through its solenoid valve so that no suspended biomass from the previous cycle remained in the reactors hrt equal to 6hr the experiments were performed in four individual phases from phase2 to phase5 except for phase2 which occurred in 30 days each of the other phases lasted 20 days within the duration of phase3 with the aim of investigating the effect of the airflow on the efficiency the air flow rate was reduced by around 20 av 3 8l min in the last two phases in order to assess the impact of the fraction ratio on the efficiency the reactors were operated under the same operating conditions as in phase2 while the fraction ratios were decreased to 50 and 45 besides the remaining carriers from phase1 were maintained in two distinct reactors which were operated under the same conditions as in the main reactors these carriers were used as alternatives to the carriers removed from the main reactors for biomass analysis overall the experiments were implemented in almost 11 months the operational circumstances are summarized in table2 2 5 sampling and analytical methods during biofilm formation for evaluation of the attachment rate of biomass biofilm growth three carriers were withdrawn from each reactor at regular intervals of every 6 8 days to specify the average concentrations of total attached solids tas and attached volatile solids avs in terms of mg l for this purpose the carriers were put in contact with 50 ml distilled water and biomass detachment from them was carried out by vigorously shaking the concentrations of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss of the samples were determined by the standard methods for water and wastewater then regarding the ratio of sampling carriers to the sum of the carriers in each reactor the total masses of the total and volatile solids per unit volume of the liquid content for each reactor were calculated it should be noted that during the phases in view of low concentrations of suspended solids derived mainly from the detached biomasses the influence of the suspended biomass and its potential activity were ignored in the analyses to measure the specific surface area and porosity of the ac and carriers a bet apparatus model belsorp ii was employed from the method of brunauer emmett teller bet the total specific surface area and from t plot the external specific surface area volume and area of the micropores were determined simultaneously mp plot and da plot were investigated to confirm the correctness of the analysis the surface morphology of the carriers was observed using a scanning electron microscope fe sem model mira in short sem as well in the operating phases in order to determine the concentrations of parameters of interest samples were collected from the reactors at regular intervals with the collection frequency of every 15min in the first hour of the test execution and every 30min for the residual time upon collection the samples were immediately filtered through 0 45 μm pore size filters to prevent further reactions and the filtrates were preserved by adding 0 1 ml of 4m h2so4 the amounts of cod nh4 no3 and no2 were determined by dr 5000 spectrophotometer using hach chemicals the do orp and ph were continuously measured using hach analyzers also by neglecting the effect of assimilation of nitrogen for the cellular synthesis snd and tnr performances were calculated as follows zhang et al 2016 song et al 2019 1 snd 100 1 no2 eff

carbon based carriers referring to data in table1 it can be understood that in contrast to the mbbr with the lack of porosity a lot of micropores with a mean diameter of about 2 7 nm and total volume of about 0 0015cm3 gr were created on the cbmc surface furthermore the specific surface area of the cbmc became about 9 9 times larger than that of the mbbr it should be noted that based on the evaluation of the waste ac information table1 the surface area and the pore volume of the utilized ac sample were not significantly high hence given that the porosity and the surface area of the cbmc are influenced by the physical properties of the coated ac definitely these parameters can be even more improved using more superior waste ac in addition contrary to the mbbr containing smooth surface the morphology of the cbmc surface in fig 1a 1 b by applying the sem technique displays that the cbmc had an irregular highly porous surface as shown in fig 1c 1 d the new carriers contained all three pore categories i e micro meso macropores with a coating thickness of approximately 34 6 4 nm however based on the bet analyzer outputs the pore size distribution on the cbmc surface was mostly in the range of micropores with diameter 2 nm nevertheless even with low fractions of mesopores with 2 diameter 50 nm and macropores diameter 50 nm a significant impact on the microbial adhesion was made as discussed in the following sections the pores of greater diameter can be used as anchoring points and are more susceptible to bacterial attachment in addition the ability of coated ac to adsorb biodegradable organic compounds must not be forgotten and has undoubtedly a positive effect on microbial growth as a result of these advantages the growth rate of the organisms on the rough surface of the new carriers enhances causing an increase in the tas concentration and the microbial activity song et al 2019 luo et al 2014 chu et al 2011 3 2 formation and growth of the biofilms fig 3 a demonstrates the trends of tas concentration variations for both carrier types during phase1 as illustrated the process of biofilm formation took place in five individual stages in the first stage lasted 14 days the occurrence of reversible initial attachment led to the very slow formation of biofilms particularly for the mbbr with an average tas concentration of 30 8 mg l versus 92 2 mg l for the cbmc in the second stage which commenced on the 14th day both biofilms initiated the acceleration in growth rate however due to better cellular response to the essence and physicochemical characteristics of the new carrier surface and probably higher cell to cell interactions the aggregation of microorganisms upon the cbmc surface took place more rapidly than that upon the conventional media surface as a result a rise in the tas concentration of about 97 2 was observed for the cbmc on the 29th day in stage3 that happened in 39 days the trend of bacterial growth continued sharply with a higher rate for the cbmc finally the tas concentrations in this stage reached the average values of 3261 mg l and 2348 mg l for the cbmc and mbbr respectively in the following stage from the 68th day the development of the biofilms decelerated ultimately in the last stage the stable maturation conditions reached and the tas concentrations altered within a very narrow range in this stage which started from the 76th and the 84th days for the cbmc and mbbr the tas concentrations reached the values of 3548 2 2 mg l and 3080 2 4 mg l respectively as depicted the analysis explicated clearly that the use of cbmc was absolutely effective to speed up the microbial adhesion and growth because of this the time required for biofilm formation diminished by approximately 26 similar results were also obtained from sem observations as seen in fig 2a 2 d more surfaces of the new carriers were occupied by biofilm after 29 and 48 days from exposure of carriers to the biomass this superiority is obviously linked to the specific characteristics of the environment created by coating the carbon media on the carriers the activated carbon possesses a hydrophobic nature attachment to a hydrophobic surface is accompanied by a drop in the surface free energy facilitating thermodynamically the adsorption of hydrophobic components on the ac surface moreover the presence of metals and functional groups at the ac surface causes certain parts of the ac surface to become charged assisting interactions between the polar constituents and the ac surface these properties enhance the extent of adsorption and attachment of microorganisms on the ac surface then the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between bacteria and the ac surface bring about a change in the status of the microbial attachment and transforms it from the initial reversible attachment the first stage to the stronger secondarily irreversible attachment the second stage knezev 2015 bos et al 1999 besides protection against biomass washout and protozoan predation as well as the reduction in the effects of inhibitors due to the high porosity of the new media surface are the other possible reasons for a rapid biofilm formation in the cbmc from the discussions described above it can be concluded that the cbmc with a large specific surface area possesses specific surface characteristics hydrophobicity charged surface and a lot of porosity providing a favorable environment for initial cell attraction microbial adhesion and irreversible attachment and formation of microcolonies consequently the rate of biofilm formation is promoted using the cbmc 3 3 organic removal in fig 4 a the cod concentration profile and the removal efficiency have been presented throughout the operating phases in the reactors as illustrated in phase2 due to the existence of a great number of fast growing heterotrophic bacteria locating at the very top layers of the biofilms with abundant oxygen concentration piculell 2016 the organic removal efficiencies were excellent in both reactors in consequence regardless of the media type the cod removal up to 93 6 and the cod concentration less than 24 mg l in the effluents were obtained this revealed that the heterotrophs within both biofilms had the same behavior towards organic matter removal during phase3 characterized by an airflow decrease the efficiencies descended to an average value of 90 4 this difference can be related to the reduction in shear stress and the movement of the carriers resulting in a negative effect on the mass transfer of substrate inside the relevant biofilm herrling et al 2015 young et al 2016 nevertheless the airflow reduction had an insignificant effect on the efficiencies and thereby the airflow reduction within the range of 20 was not considered as an effective parameter for cod removal in phases 4 and 5 operated at the same airflow as in phase2 decrease in the fraction ratios led to a drop in efficiencies in both reactors with the similar average values of 88 9 and 82 2 respectively according to this decline the effluent concentrations reached the average values of 32 mg l and 53 mg l this difference in efficiencies lies in the fact that the tas concentrations alter directly with the variation in the filling ratio fig 3b 3 c nonetheless the correlation between the filling ratio and the efficiency was not consistent with a linear trend resulted in a rather inconsiderable difference in efficiency between phases 2 and 4 these signify that depending on the operational conditions the effect of the filling ratio on the cod removal efficiency in reactors containing moving carriers reduces from a certain ratio 3 4 nitrogen removal similarly to the aerobic cod conversion the comparable behavior was observed for the ammonium removal in two reactors fig 4 b in phase2 the cbmc and mbbr reactors experienced the substantial nitrification performances of about 97 6 and 96 5 however as a result of the airflow reduction in the succeeding phase a sudden decrease followed by a gradual increase in the ammonium removal took place so that the nitrification efficiencies dropped eventually to the average values of 86 8 and 89 2 respectively considering the results it became evident that the influence of the air flow rate on the nitrification process efficiency was more than that on the cod removal efficiency this remarkable difference particularly for the cbmc can be explained by the response time to the operational changes which takes longer for the nitrifiers relative to the heterotrophs having a faster growth rate besides a lower depth of oxygen diffusion herrling et al 2015 was another reason for this difference which caused the nitrification performance in the cbmc with a higher biofilm thickness to be more dependent upon the fluid velocity or mass transfer in phases 4 and 5 lowering the filling ratios did not permit full achievement of nitrification in both reactors although the airflow was restored to the initial value in consequence the ammonium concentrations in the effluents increased progressively and the mean performances of 92 4 and 85 5 for the cbmc and 91 7 and 85 1 for the mbbr were obtained respectively in contrast to the cod and nh4 removal performances the reactors showed different behaviors towards snd and tnr performances depending on the carrier type as exhibited in fig 4 c during phase2 lower nitrate concentration in the effluent of the cbmc reactor led to an increase in the snd performance up to 13 2 for the cbmc average values 90 2 for the cbmc vs 79 6 for the mbbr accordingly the tnr performance was improved by almost 14 6 average values 87 5 for the cbmc vs 76 3 for the mbbr in this phase the average avs concentrations of 2881 mg l and 2433 mg l were measured for the cbmc and mbbr reactors fig 3b 3 c the reasons for this impressive superiority in the performances of the cbmc reactor can be found in the physicochemical characteristics of the new carriers and their relevant biofilm structure in general under stable circumstances in response to the do concentration gradients within the biofilm a microbial stratification will occur in this stratification the anaerobic and anoxic bacteria can develop in the deeper part whereas the autotrophic bacteria and the aerobic heterotrophic species grow in the outer or middle and very top layers respectively where oxygen is abundant piculell 2016 herrling et al 2015 tang et al 2017 hence depending on the characteristics of the biofilm such as thickness and porosity the oxygen gradient within the biofilm plus coexistence of different groups of bacteria in different layers guarantee a successful simultaneous nitrification denitrification process regarding the results it can be therefore concluded that the special characteristics and the structure of the new carriers were capable of making better stratified biofilm in which less oxygen was permitted to penetrate to the deeper layers due to avoiding less oxygen intrusion a larger space was devoted to the anoxic bacteria and the anoxic reactions occurred longer bassin et al 2016 as a result the availability of more space for various groups of bacteria and the desired cooperation between them provided an enhancement of the snd performance for the cbmc another important aspect to consider was the protective effect of the new carriers in addition to affecting the microbial attachment the structure and the properties of the carriers shelter the attached biomass against the collisions and fluid shearing piculell 2016 zhang et al 2017 this is the reason why a thicker biofilm with about 18 4 percent increase in the avs concentration was established on the cbmc also another conclusion from the results considering similarity in the ammonium removal efficiency in the reactors was that the snd was the controlling factor in the tnr capacity for each reactor tan et al 2017 by exerting low aeration in the next phase both the snd and tnr performances fell sharply below the values of the preceding phase irrespective of the media type in this phase the performances reached the values of 70 2 and 61 5 for the cbmc and 66 4 and 59 7 for the mbbr respectively furthermore the measurement of the tas concentrations indicated that the cbmc and mbbr reactors underwent a reduction in the attached biomass concentrations up to 8 5 and 6 0 respectively this means that both carrier types were sensitive to substrate diffusion within the biofilms nonetheless due to the stronger microbial adhesion the avs concentration in the cbmc was still higher average values 2694 mg l for the cbmc vs 2310 mg l for the mbbr and resulted in higher performances during phases 4 and 5 by decreasing the filling ratio and restoring the airflow to its former rate the superiority in the snd performance for the cbmc compared to the mbbr was in the range of 13 9 14 3 see fig 4c 4 d in these phases the avs concentrations in the cbmc descended to the average values of 2788 mg l and 2480 mg l and accordingly the snd performances of the cbmc reactor dropped to the average values of 86 8 and 79 7 respectively however due to the lower avs concentrations in the mbbr reactor average values of 2320 mg l and 2076 mg l the mbbr reactor experienced the average values of 75 9 and 70 0 for the snd performance respectively in parallel due to the strong tnr dependency on the snd the tnr performance fell correspondingly and the average values of 80 1 and 67 9 for the cbmc and 68 5 and 58 7 for the mbbr were obtained it should be noted that the nitrite effluent concentrations in both reactors did not exceed 0 2mgno2 n l often less than 0 1mgno2 n l for the cbmc throughout the operating phases this implied that there was a suitable coexistence between the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the biofilms overall in connection with the effect of the filling fraction under identical do supply on the organic and nitrogen removal performances analysis of the results revealed that the correlations were direct but not completely linear on the one hand the rise in the filling fraction despite increasing the tas concentration is accompanied by an adverse effect on the movement of the carriers impressing the diffusion of substrates into the biomass zhang et al 2017 young et al 2016 li et al 2016 because of this the efficiencies did not change substantially between phases 2 and 4 on the other hand a decrease in this parameter is coupled to the direct decrease in tas and avs concentrations leading to the decline in performances as observed in phase5 therefore based on the results and the operating conditions of this study the filling ratio of 50 seems to be the optimum filling degree for the simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal process using cbmc conversely a higher filling degree must be designated for the mbbr reactor to compensate its lower efficiency the same explanations can be expressed for the air flow rate while the excess airflow generates more collisions between the carriers and thereby more biofilm detachment its low content brings about the mass transfer limitation into the biofilm therefore to supply sufficient movement of the carriers the aeration rate of around 0 95l min l was chosen as the minimum rate for both reactors 3 5 do and orp profiles in this study to ascertain the positive effect of the new carriers on the n removal performance the oxygen penetration into each of the biofilms was indirectly assessed by measuring the do concentration in the bulk liquid in fig 5 a the graphs of do concentration versus time for both reactors have been typically depicted during phase2 as observed each graph consists of two regions in region1 regardless of the carrier types a large amount of organic matter and ammonium were removed and the do concentration increased correspondingly ultimately at the end of this region the do concentration reached its maximum value close to 6 mg l unlike for cmbc this region took place in a shorter time for the mbbr coupled with somewhat faster feed consumption under similar operational conditions the length of this stage depends on oxygen diffusion into the stratified biofilms and carbon source availability for the organisms in different layers therefore the higher the thickness of the biofilm the longer the elapsed time for region1 was required in other words in the mbbr with the thinner biofilm more microbial layers were influenced by the oxygen intrusion and hence a larger aerobic layer was made for this reason a greater amount of organic matter was consumed through the aerobic oxidation by microbial populations in the mbbr on the contrary a larger volume was under anoxic conditions in the cbmc with thicker biofilm and so a more satisfactory aerobic anoxic coexistence was obtained in the new carriers during the subsequent region the remaining ammonium concentration was oxidized to nitrate however the do concentration did not change considerably due to the do abundance in the bulk liquid in fig 5b a schematic of the orp measurement in the bulk liquid has been demonstrated for each reactor during phase2 although these analyses are not direct measurements of the interior zones of the biofilms they can be helpful to deduce the impact of the new carrier on the n removal performance in general the orp value higher than 50 mv specifies an aerobic oxidation process whereas values less than 50mv signifies an anoxic process as indicated at the beginning of the cycle in region1 when the feed was injected the orp values were within the highly negative range this implied that a part of the biodegradable organic matter diffused into the biofilms and contributed to the nitrate reduction prior to aerobic oxidation shortly thereafter aerobic oxidation of the organic matter and ammonium gave rise to the quick increase of orp values however due to the coexistence of aerobic and anoxic conditions in both reactors the values did not exceed 50 mv in region1 furthermore the time of this region was longer for the cbmc in region2 with depletion of the cod concentration the nitrification reaction became dominant and the orp values climbed with a relatively steep slope finally the orp values reached the maximum values of 66 3 mv for the mbbr and 55 1 mv for the cbmc these outcomes showed that due to deeper oxygen penetration in the mbbr biofilm a lower space was dedicated to the growth of the denitrifiers in the mbbr by contrast the anoxic layer was larger in the cbmc biofilm and consequently the anoxic reactions occurred longer an indication of a more efficient snd process 3 6 ph and no3 profiles for further assessment of the behavior of the new carriers the nitrogen removal process was investigated by monitoring the variations of ph and no3 n concentration in the bulk liquid during the operating phases in fact the profile of ph changes can be useful to identify whether nitrification process or denitrification process or even coexistence of them is dominant in fig 6 an example of such relationship in the second phase has been depicted as shown the generation of the alkalinity in the beginning of the cycle raised the ph to a maximum value which was an indication of a rapid denitrification process particularly for the cbmc reactor this was consistent with the fact that oxygen could not diffuse into the deeper layers of the biofilms due to the high oxygen demand of heterotrophic bacteria located at the very top layer of the biofilms it is noteworthy that the primary denitrification process arose from the presence of the nitrate concentration in the feed and probably from the residual quantity of the previous cycle remained among the carriers afterwards with a decrease in the oxygen demand of heterotrophic organisms the nitrification process became dominant this led to the alkalinity consumption correspondingly the ph gradually declined and the nitrate concentrations in the bulk liquid of each reactor increased to some extent especially for the mbbr reactor despite this increment however the observation of low concentrations of nitrate was still evidence of the coincidence of the nitrification and denitrification processes in both reactors after consumption of a great fraction of ammonium the second bending point was observed together with the continuation of the denitrification process then the decreasing trend was again seen for nitrate concentration but to a lesser extent at this time the nitrogen removal process was proceeded at very low cod concentrations indicating that snd occurred by endogenous denitrification under these conditions soluble microbial products created by hydrolysis of the biomass are utilized as a carbon source chen and terashima 1992 piculell 2016 finally when the nitrification process prevailed once more in the system the ph fell gradually until the end of the cycle as specified the ph variation during the cycles was in agreement with the competition of denitrifiers and nitrifiers in the biofilms affected the nitrate concentration in the bulk liquid therefore the results from the graphs emphasized that owing to higher ph values and lower nitrate concentrations in the bulk liquid in the cbmc reactor a larger volume was devoted to the anoxic zone in the cbmc biofilm in conclusion it became obvious that the new carriers with special physicochemical features and highly porous structures developed a favorable environment for the attraction and robust attachment of bacteria these carriers also presented a remarkable enhancement in the snd performance and introduced a reliable and efficient technology in simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal process from environmental and economic aspects recycling of discarded ac and use of inferior carriers as a symbol of plastic waste in the manufacturing of new media can also be interesting besides because of the higher microbial attachment upon the new carrier and hence the need for a lesser filling degree in the reactor compared to the mbbr the innovative carrier offers a cost effective wastewater treatment technology the cost effectiveness of the new carrier has been discussed in detail in the supplementary material apart from this with this technology the plastic wastes having a proper density such as polypropylene in the form of enclosed shapes such as hollow pipes or granules can be readily recycled instead of producing virgin carriers as a result it is not only possible to solve partially the problem of accumulating non biodegradable plastics using the cbmc but also the efficiency of wastewater treatment systems can be increased all these advantages showed that the new carrier is an appropriate and practical alternative for the conventional moving carrier furthermore this improvement is applicable to both media classification i e fixed and moving kinds this study was the first work for the introduction and the assessment of the cbmc more investigations should be achieved to figure

18279,this study aims to enhance biological nitrogen removal performance by the innovative carbon based carriers the new carriers were produced based on recycling waste materials in these carriers the advantages of the hybrid system and physicochemical properties of activated carbon were integrated to promote microbial attachment to verify the performance of the new carriers compared to the conventional moving carriers the experiments were conducted in two parallel laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors under various operating conditions the analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the new carrier with a total pore volume of 0 0015cm3 gr was 10 9 times the specific surface area of a conventional carrier further the comparative results indicated that the new highly porous carriers made a major contribution to increasing the attached active biomass up to 20 2 from the data analysis do orp and ph it was also confirmed that the new carriers had a positive effect on the creation of a greater anoxic zone within the biofilm consequently the simultaneous nitrification denitrification and total nitrogen removal efficiencies enhanced significantly up to 14 3 and 16 8 respectively from the environmental and economic viewpoints the benefits of the novel carrier showed that it is a practical alternative for the conventional carrier providing a cost effective wastewater treatment technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal carbon based carriers biofilm adsorptive properties performance filling ratio 1 introduction the harmful environmental impacts arising from the release of wastewaters comprising nitrogen compounds into the environment such as toxicity potential on aquatic life eutrophication and the oxygen depletion in marine environments are well known today metcalf and eddy 2003 gao et al 2018 therefore to protect the environment it is essential to meet a strict restriction for the discharge of nitrogen compounds to the receiving waters in this regard by utilizing new technologies and of course regarding the economic considerations thereof enhancement of the performance of wastewater treatment plants is of major importance hence during recent years particular attention has been paid to biofilm based technologies such as the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr to achieve efficient organic and nutrient removal sbardella et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 the mbbr process has been proven as a compact and efficient technique for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters in which biomasses grow on the surfaces of moving carriers mainly interior surface ødegaard 2006 shi et al 2017 bakar et al 2018 hassani et al 2013 this process has certain benefits compared to the conventional activated sludge systems e g higher active biomass concentration robust tolerance to load fluctuations no need for sludge recirculation no sludge bulking problem less footprint requirement and resilient to toxic shock rusten et al 2006 helness and ødegaard 2008 mc quarrie and boltz 2011 leyva díaz et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 for mbbr systems the features of the carriers such as material surface roughness and surface area that affect microbial adhesion and growth have a key role in the system efficiency song et al 2019 abzazou et al 2016 accordingly various kinds of carriers such as plastic media polyurethane sponge non woven carriers ceramic carriers zeolite powder based polyurethane sponge etc have been introduced in the mbbr process deng et al 2016 peng et al 2018 young et al 2016 among the above media because of the benefits declared for the polyurethane sponge carriers for example great surface area rough surface good microbial adhesion this carrier type and its modification ways have been of interest to some researchers recently guo et al 2010 and nguyen et al 2010 reported that the organic and nutrient removal rates were independent of the sponge size and types luo et al 2014 found that micropollutant removal by this kind of carrier was unreliable and unstable investigation of the effect of filling ratio on the nitrification denitrification capacity by zhang et al 2016 indicated that total nitrogen removal tnr up to 85 5 was achievable for the optimum filling ratio of 20 deng et al 2016 stated that compared to the conventional mbbr carriers the sponge modified plastic carriers in a hybrid mbbr mbr system were capable of increasing the nutrient removal performance up to 10 and 6 8 for ammonium and phosphorous at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12h song et al 2019 modified the sponge carriers by zeolite powder addition and asserted that the modification was positively effective on the content of the attached biomass up to 30 their results revealed that the performance of tnr was improved by nearly 10 compared to the sponge carriers to date however among the upgraded carriers it has not been addressed the selection of the activated carbon coating in promoting the porosity and surface area of the carriers for decades activated carbon ac has been used for many industrial applications as the most broadly used adsorbent to remove impurities from gases or liquids and to increase process efficiency as a catalyst musmarra et al 2013 anirudhan et al 2011 arunajatesan et al 2009 pore size distribution and the magnitude of the surface area of ac are factors that influence its adsorption capacity and application ma et al 2017 zhan et al 2016 li et al 2018 bhatnagar et al 2013 furthermore depending on the properties of ac such as a high specific surface area and the chemical surface characteristics hydrophobicity and charge ac affects the adsorption of microorganisms ilomuanya et al 2011 2017 according to knezev 2015 the adsorption of microbial cells and the initial attachment of microorganisms occur due to the physicochemical interactions between the bacteria and ac surface which are controlled by van der waals and electrostatic forces thereafter a shift from the initial attachment to the powerful secondarily irreversible attachment occurs by the formation of extracellular polymers secreted by organisms based on the described subjects the purpose of this research was to enhance nitrogen removal performance in a simultaneous organic carbon and nitrogen removal system using the new carbon based carriers the idea for the manufacture of the new carriers was to merge the advantages of the mbbr hybrid system and the physicochemical features of activated carbon by employing the waste materials to improve the advantages of the conventional carriers and achieve a new optimized technology it should be noted that by referring to the literature due to different experimental conditions we encounter a wide variety of reported efficiencies therefore in this research the correct assessment of the effect and behavior of the new carriers was performed by the side by side comparison of two identical reactors with two different media types the principal objectives in this study are i to evaluate the effect of the highly porous new media on the formation and development of biofilm ii to investigate the enhancement of snd and tnr performances by employing the new carriers iii to assess the optimum filling ratio and suitable aeration rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 manufacturing process of the new carriers and the media specifications the new carriers cbmc were manufactured using the recycling of waste activated carbon disposed of into the environment and off line polyethylene mbbr carriers discarded through a chemical and thermal process the process carried out in a designed rotary drum in which the rotational speed of the drum and the temperature of the chamber were automatically controlled the production procedure has been explained in detail in the supplementary material in table1 the characteristics of the conventional and new carriers as well as the ac have been exhibited 2 2 experimental set up description the experiments were conducted in two parallel cylindrical reactors named mbbr reactor and cbmc reactor each reactor was operated in a sequential mode and had a working volume of 5 l approximately 55 of the volume of each reactor was filled with one kind of carrier i e the mbbr high quality and the cbmc in the pilot plant the feed was transferred from the storage tank to the reactors using two separate submersible pumps each reactor was equipped with a low speed mixer and a solenoid valve for complete evacuation of the reactors at the end of the cycles the sequences were automatically controlled via a plc controller and the ph orp dissolved oxygen concentration do and temperature of the content of each reactor were continuously recorded 2 3 feed composition during the tests the reactors were fed with similar wastewater the feed consisted of the following compounds which were dissolved in tap water sodium acetate and macro nutrients at average concentrations of 300mgcod l 55mgnh4 n l and 18mgpo4 3 p l plus the micro nutrients of the following mg l mncl2 7h2o 0 11 znso4 7h2o 0 18 cocl2 6h2o 0 17 cuso4 5h2o 0 16

from the return line of the settling tank of a conventional municipal wastewater treatment plant in tehran was utilized as an inoculum in this phase the reactors with the filling ratio of 70 were exposed to the sludge in an anoxic aerobic sequential mode under similar conditions furthermore to favor the autotrophic growth in the attached biomasses the ph in each reactor was maintained at around 7 8 van loosdrecht et al 2016 grunditz and dalhammar 2001 the length of this phase lasted nearly 84 days for the biofilm formation and afterwards the stable conditions for ph do profile and the effluent concentrations reached the detailed procedure of acclimatization and cultivation in this phase has been explained in the supplementary material in the subsequent operating phases the tests were executed at the filling ratio of 55 excluding phases 4 and 5 for these phases the sequences were as follows i a feeding step of 5min ii an aerobic step of 350min iii a discharge step of 5min at the end of each cycle the whole liquid content of each reactor was drained through its solenoid valve so that no suspended biomass from the previous cycle remained in the reactors hrt equal to 6hr the experiments were performed in four individual phases from phase2 to phase5 except for phase2 which occurred in 30 days each of the other phases lasted 20 days within the duration of phase3 with the aim of investigating the effect of the airflow on the efficiency the air flow rate was reduced by around 20 av 3 8l min in the last two phases in order to assess the impact of the fraction ratio on the efficiency the reactors were operated under the same operating conditions as in phase2 while the fraction ratios were decreased to 50 and 45 besides the remaining carriers from phase1 were maintained in two distinct reactors which were operated under the same conditions as in the main reactors these carriers were used as alternatives to the carriers removed from the main reactors for biomass analysis overall the experiments were implemented in almost 11 months the operational circumstances are summarized in table2 2 5 sampling and analytical methods during biofilm formation for evaluation of the attachment rate of biomass biofilm growth three carriers were withdrawn from each reactor at regular intervals of every 6 8 days to specify the average concentrations of total attached solids tas and attached volatile solids avs in terms of mg l for this purpose the carriers were put in contact with 50 ml distilled water and biomass detachment from them was carried out by vigorously shaking the concentrations of the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids mlvss of the samples were determined by the standard methods for water and wastewater then regarding the ratio of sampling carriers to the sum of the carriers in each reactor the total masses of the total and volatile solids per unit volume of the liquid content for each reactor were calculated it should be noted that during the phases in view of low concentrations of suspended solids derived mainly from the detached biomasses the influence of the suspended biomass and its potential activity were ignored in the analyses to measure the specific surface area and porosity of the ac and carriers a bet apparatus model belsorp ii was employed from the method of brunauer emmett teller bet the total specific surface area and from t plot the external specific surface area volume and area of the micropores were determined simultaneously mp plot and da plot were investigated to confirm the correctness of the analysis the surface morphology of the carriers was observed using a scanning electron microscope fe sem model mira in short sem as well in the operating phases in order to determine the concentrations of parameters of interest samples were collected from the reactors at regular intervals with the collection frequency of every 15min in the first hour of the test execution and every 30min for the residual time upon collection the samples were immediately filtered through 0 45 μm pore size filters to prevent further reactions and the filtrates were preserved by adding 0 1 ml of 4m h2so4 the amounts of cod nh4 no3 and no2 were determined by dr 5000 spectrophotometer using hach chemicals the do orp and ph were continuously measured using hach analyzers also by neglecting the effect of assimilation of nitrogen for the cellular synthesis snd and tnr performances were calculated as follows zhang et al 2016 song et al 2019 1 snd 100 1 no2 eff

carbon based carriers referring to data in table1 it can be understood that in contrast to the mbbr with the lack of porosity a lot of micropores with a mean diameter of about 2 7 nm and total volume of about 0 0015cm3 gr were created on the cbmc surface furthermore the specific surface area of the cbmc became about 9 9 times larger than that of the mbbr it should be noted that based on the evaluation of the waste ac information table1 the surface area and the pore volume of the utilized ac sample were not significantly high hence given that the porosity and the surface area of the cbmc are influenced by the physical properties of the coated ac definitely these parameters can be even more improved using more superior waste ac in addition contrary to the mbbr containing smooth surface the morphology of the cbmc surface in fig 1a 1 b by applying the sem technique displays that the cbmc had an irregular highly porous surface as shown in fig 1c 1 d the new carriers contained all three pore categories i e micro meso macropores with a coating thickness of approximately 34 6 4 nm however based on the bet analyzer outputs the pore size distribution on the cbmc surface was mostly in the range of micropores with diameter 2 nm nevertheless even with low fractions of mesopores with 2 diameter 50 nm and macropores diameter 50 nm a significant impact on the microbial adhesion was made as discussed in the following sections the pores of greater diameter can be used as anchoring points and are more susceptible to bacterial attachment in addition the ability of coated ac to adsorb biodegradable organic compounds must not be forgotten and has undoubtedly a positive effect on microbial growth as a result of these advantages the growth rate of the organisms on the rough surface of the new carriers enhances causing an increase in the tas concentration and the microbial activity song et al 2019 luo et al 2014 chu et al 2011 3 2 formation and growth of the biofilms fig 3 a demonstrates the trends of tas concentration variations for both carrier types during phase1 as illustrated the process of biofilm formation took place in five individual stages in the first stage lasted 14 days the occurrence of reversible initial attachment led to the very slow formation of biofilms particularly for the mbbr with an average tas concentration of 30 8 mg l versus 92 2 mg l for the cbmc in the second stage which commenced on the 14th day both biofilms initiated the acceleration in growth rate however due to better cellular response to the essence and physicochemical characteristics of the new carrier surface and probably higher cell to cell interactions the aggregation of microorganisms upon the cbmc surface took place more rapidly than that upon the conventional media surface as a result a rise in the tas concentration of about 97 2 was observed for the cbmc on the 29th day in stage3 that happened in 39 days the trend of bacterial growth continued sharply with a higher rate for the cbmc finally the tas concentrations in this stage reached the average values of 3261 mg l and 2348 mg l for the cbmc and mbbr respectively in the following stage from the 68th day the development of the biofilms decelerated ultimately in the last stage the stable maturation conditions reached and the tas concentrations altered within a very narrow range in this stage which started from the 76th and the 84th days for the cbmc and mbbr the tas concentrations reached the values of 3548 2 2 mg l and 3080 2 4 mg l respectively as depicted the analysis explicated clearly that the use of cbmc was absolutely effective to speed up the microbial adhesion and growth because of this the time required for biofilm formation diminished by approximately 26 similar results were also obtained from sem observations as seen in fig 2a 2 d more surfaces of the new carriers were occupied by biofilm after 29 and 48 days from exposure of carriers to the biomass this superiority is obviously linked to the specific characteristics of the environment created by coating the carbon media on the carriers the activated carbon possesses a hydrophobic nature attachment to a hydrophobic surface is accompanied by a drop in the surface free energy facilitating thermodynamically the adsorption of hydrophobic components on the ac surface moreover the presence of metals and functional groups at the ac surface causes certain parts of the ac surface to become charged assisting interactions between the polar constituents and the ac surface these properties enhance the extent of adsorption and attachment of microorganisms on the ac surface then the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between bacteria and the ac surface bring about a change in the status of the microbial attachment and transforms it from the initial reversible attachment the first stage to the stronger secondarily irreversible attachment the second stage knezev 2015 bos et al 1999 besides protection against biomass washout and protozoan predation as well as the reduction in the effects of inhibitors due to the high porosity of the new media surface are the other possible reasons for a rapid biofilm formation in the cbmc from the discussions described above it can be concluded that the cbmc with a large specific surface area possesses specific surface characteristics hydrophobicity charged surface and a lot of porosity providing a favorable environment for initial cell attraction microbial adhesion and irreversible attachment and formation of microcolonies consequently the rate of biofilm formation is promoted using the cbmc 3 3 organic removal in fig 4 a the cod concentration profile and the removal efficiency have been presented throughout the operating phases in the reactors as illustrated in phase2 due to the existence of a great number of fast growing heterotrophic bacteria locating at the very top layers of the biofilms with abundant oxygen concentration piculell 2016 the organic removal efficiencies were excellent in both reactors in consequence regardless of the media type the cod removal up to 93 6 and the cod concentration less than 24 mg l in the effluents were obtained this revealed that the heterotrophs within both biofilms had the same behavior towards organic matter removal during phase3 characterized by an airflow decrease the efficiencies descended to an average value of 90 4 this difference can be related to the reduction in shear stress and the movement of the carriers resulting in a negative effect on the mass transfer of substrate inside the relevant biofilm herrling et al 2015 young et al 2016 nevertheless the airflow reduction had an insignificant effect on the efficiencies and thereby the airflow reduction within the range of 20 was not considered as an effective parameter for cod removal in phases 4 and 5 operated at the same airflow as in phase2 decrease in the fraction ratios led to a drop in efficiencies in both reactors with the similar average values of 88 9 and 82 2 respectively according to this decline the effluent concentrations reached the average values of 32 mg l and 53 mg l this difference in efficiencies lies in the fact that the tas concentrations alter directly with the variation in the filling ratio fig 3b 3 c nonetheless the correlation between the filling ratio and the efficiency was not consistent with a linear trend resulted in a rather inconsiderable difference in efficiency between phases 2 and 4 these signify that depending on the operational conditions the effect of the filling ratio on the cod removal efficiency in reactors containing moving carriers reduces from a certain ratio 3 4 nitrogen removal similarly to the aerobic cod conversion the comparable behavior was observed for the ammonium removal in two reactors fig 4 b in phase2 the cbmc and mbbr reactors experienced the substantial nitrification performances of about 97 6 and 96 5 however as a result of the airflow reduction in the succeeding phase a sudden decrease followed by a gradual increase in the ammonium removal took place so that the nitrification efficiencies dropped eventually to the average values of 86 8 and 89 2 respectively considering the results it became evident that the influence of the air flow rate on the nitrification process efficiency was more than that on the cod removal efficiency this remarkable difference particularly for the cbmc can be explained by the response time to the operational changes which takes longer for the nitrifiers relative to the heterotrophs having a faster growth rate besides a lower depth of oxygen diffusion herrling et al 2015 was another reason for this difference which caused the nitrification performance in the cbmc with a higher biofilm thickness to be more dependent upon the fluid velocity or mass transfer in phases 4 and 5 lowering the filling ratios did not permit full achievement of nitrification in both reactors although the airflow was restored to the initial value in consequence the ammonium concentrations in the effluents increased progressively and the mean performances of 92 4 and 85 5 for the cbmc and 91 7 and 85 1 for the mbbr were obtained respectively in contrast to the cod and nh4 removal performances the reactors showed different behaviors towards snd and tnr performances depending on the carrier type as exhibited in fig 4 c during phase2 lower nitrate concentration in the effluent of the cbmc reactor led to an increase in the snd performance up to 13 2 for the cbmc average values 90 2 for the cbmc vs 79 6 for the mbbr accordingly the tnr performance was improved by almost 14 6 average values 87 5 for the cbmc vs 76 3 for the mbbr in this phase the average avs concentrations of 2881 mg l and 2433 mg l were measured for the cbmc and mbbr reactors fig 3b 3 c the reasons for this impressive superiority in the performances of the cbmc reactor can be found in the physicochemical characteristics of the new carriers and their relevant biofilm structure in general under stable circumstances in response to the do concentration gradients within the biofilm a microbial stratification will occur in this stratification the anaerobic and anoxic bacteria can develop in the deeper part whereas the autotrophic bacteria and the aerobic heterotrophic species grow in the outer or middle and very top layers respectively where oxygen is abundant piculell 2016 herrling et al 2015 tang et al 2017 hence depending on the characteristics of the biofilm such as thickness and porosity the oxygen gradient within the biofilm plus coexistence of different groups of bacteria in different layers guarantee a successful simultaneous nitrification denitrification process regarding the results it can be therefore concluded that the special characteristics and the structure of the new carriers were capable of making better stratified biofilm in which less oxygen was permitted to penetrate to the deeper layers due to avoiding less oxygen intrusion a larger space was devoted to the anoxic bacteria and the anoxic reactions occurred longer bassin et al 2016 as a result the availability of more space for various groups of bacteria and the desired cooperation between them provided an enhancement of the snd performance for the cbmc another important aspect to consider was the protective effect of the new carriers in addition to affecting the microbial attachment the structure and the properties of the carriers shelter the attached biomass against the collisions and fluid shearing piculell 2016 zhang et al 2017 this is the reason why a thicker biofilm with about 18 4 percent increase in the avs concentration was established on the cbmc also another conclusion from the results considering similarity in the ammonium removal efficiency in the reactors was that the snd was the controlling factor in the tnr capacity for each reactor tan et al 2017 by exerting low aeration in the next phase both the snd and tnr performances fell sharply below the values of the preceding phase irrespective of the media type in this phase the performances reached the values of 70 2 and 61 5 for the cbmc and 66 4 and 59 7 for the mbbr respectively furthermore the measurement of the tas concentrations indicated that the cbmc and mbbr reactors underwent a reduction in the attached biomass concentrations up to 8 5 and 6 0 respectively this means that both carrier types were sensitive to substrate diffusion within the biofilms nonetheless due to the stronger microbial adhesion the avs concentration in the cbmc was still higher average values 2694 mg l for the cbmc vs 2310 mg l for the mbbr and resulted in higher performances during phases 4 and 5 by decreasing the filling ratio and restoring the airflow to its former rate the superiority in the snd performance for the cbmc compared to the mbbr was in the range of 13 9 14 3 see fig 4c 4 d in these phases the avs concentrations in the cbmc descended to the average values of 2788 mg l and 2480 mg l and accordingly the snd performances of the cbmc reactor dropped to the average values of 86 8 and 79 7 respectively however due to the lower avs concentrations in the mbbr reactor average values of 2320 mg l and 2076 mg l the mbbr reactor experienced the average values of 75 9 and 70 0 for the snd performance respectively in parallel due to the strong tnr dependency on the snd the tnr performance fell correspondingly and the average values of 80 1 and 67 9 for the cbmc and 68 5 and 58 7 for the mbbr were obtained it should be noted that the nitrite effluent concentrations in both reactors did not exceed 0 2mgno2 n l often less than 0 1mgno2 n l for the cbmc throughout the operating phases this implied that there was a suitable coexistence between the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in the biofilms overall in connection with the effect of the filling fraction under identical do supply on the organic and nitrogen removal performances analysis of the results revealed that the correlations were direct but not completely linear on the one hand the rise in the filling fraction despite increasing the tas concentration is accompanied by an adverse effect on the movement of the carriers impressing the diffusion of substrates into the biomass zhang et al 2017 young et al 2016 li et al 2016 because of this the efficiencies did not change substantially between phases 2 and 4 on the other hand a decrease in this parameter is coupled to the direct decrease in tas and avs concentrations leading to the decline in performances as observed in phase5 therefore based on the results and the operating conditions of this study the filling ratio of 50 seems to be the optimum filling degree for the simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal process using cbmc conversely a higher filling degree must be designated for the mbbr reactor to compensate its lower efficiency the same explanations can be expressed for the air flow rate while the excess airflow generates more collisions between the carriers and thereby more biofilm detachment its low content brings about the mass transfer limitation into the biofilm therefore to supply sufficient movement of the carriers the aeration rate of around 0 95l min l was chosen as the minimum rate for both reactors 3 5 do and orp profiles in this study to ascertain the positive effect of the new carriers on the n removal performance the oxygen penetration into each of the biofilms was indirectly assessed by measuring the do concentration in the bulk liquid in fig 5 a the graphs of do concentration versus time for both reactors have been typically depicted during phase2 as observed each graph consists of two regions in region1 regardless of the carrier types a large amount of organic matter and ammonium were removed and the do concentration increased correspondingly ultimately at the end of this region the do concentration reached its maximum value close to 6 mg l unlike for cmbc this region took place in a shorter time for the mbbr coupled with somewhat faster feed consumption under similar operational conditions the length of this stage depends on oxygen diffusion into the stratified biofilms and carbon source availability for the organisms in different layers therefore the higher the thickness of the biofilm the longer the elapsed time for region1 was required in other words in the mbbr with the thinner biofilm more microbial layers were influenced by the oxygen intrusion and hence a larger aerobic layer was made for this reason a greater amount of organic matter was consumed through the aerobic oxidation by microbial populations in the mbbr on the contrary a larger volume was under anoxic conditions in the cbmc with thicker biofilm and so a more satisfactory aerobic anoxic coexistence was obtained in the new carriers during the subsequent region the remaining ammonium concentration was oxidized to nitrate however the do concentration did not change considerably due to the do abundance in the bulk liquid in fig 5b a schematic of the orp measurement in the bulk liquid has been demonstrated for each reactor during phase2 although these analyses are not direct measurements of the interior zones of the biofilms they can be helpful to deduce the impact of the new carrier on the n removal performance in general the orp value higher than 50 mv specifies an aerobic oxidation process whereas values less than 50mv signifies an anoxic process as indicated at the beginning of the cycle in region1 when the feed was injected the orp values were within the highly negative range this implied that a part of the biodegradable organic matter diffused into the biofilms and contributed to the nitrate reduction prior to aerobic oxidation shortly thereafter aerobic oxidation of the organic matter and ammonium gave rise to the quick increase of orp values however due to the coexistence of aerobic and anoxic conditions in both reactors the values did not exceed 50 mv in region1 furthermore the time of this region was longer for the cbmc in region2 with depletion of the cod concentration the nitrification reaction became dominant and the orp values climbed with a relatively steep slope finally the orp values reached the maximum values of 66 3 mv for the mbbr and 55 1 mv for the cbmc these outcomes showed that due to deeper oxygen penetration in the mbbr biofilm a lower space was dedicated to the growth of the denitrifiers in the mbbr by contrast the anoxic layer was larger in the cbmc biofilm and consequently the anoxic reactions occurred longer an indication of a more efficient snd process 3 6 ph and no3 profiles for further assessment of the behavior of the new carriers the nitrogen removal process was investigated by monitoring the variations of ph and no3 n concentration in the bulk liquid during the operating phases in fact the profile of ph changes can be useful to identify whether nitrification process or denitrification process or even coexistence of them is dominant in fig 6 an example of such relationship in the second phase has been depicted as shown the generation of the alkalinity in the beginning of the cycle raised the ph to a maximum value which was an indication of a rapid denitrification process particularly for the cbmc reactor this was consistent with the fact that oxygen could not diffuse into the deeper layers of the biofilms due to the high oxygen demand of heterotrophic bacteria located at the very top layer of the biofilms it is noteworthy that the primary denitrification process arose from the presence of the nitrate concentration in the feed and probably from the residual quantity of the previous cycle remained among the carriers afterwards with a decrease in the oxygen demand of heterotrophic organisms the nitrification process became dominant this led to the alkalinity consumption correspondingly the ph gradually declined and the nitrate concentrations in the bulk liquid of each reactor increased to some extent especially for the mbbr reactor despite this increment however the observation of low concentrations of nitrate was still evidence of the coincidence of the nitrification and denitrification processes in both reactors after consumption of a great fraction of ammonium the second bending point was observed together with the continuation of the denitrification process then the decreasing trend was again seen for nitrate concentration but to a lesser extent at this time the nitrogen removal process was proceeded at very low cod concentrations indicating that snd occurred by endogenous denitrification under these conditions soluble microbial products created by hydrolysis of the biomass are utilized as a carbon source chen and terashima 1992 piculell 2016 finally when the nitrification process prevailed once more in the system the ph fell gradually until the end of the cycle as specified the ph variation during the cycles was in agreement with the competition of denitrifiers and nitrifiers in the biofilms affected the nitrate concentration in the bulk liquid therefore the results from the graphs emphasized that owing to higher ph values and lower nitrate concentrations in the bulk liquid in the cbmc reactor a larger volume was devoted to the anoxic zone in the cbmc biofilm in conclusion it became obvious that the new carriers with special physicochemical features and highly porous structures developed a favorable environment for the attraction and robust attachment of bacteria these carriers also presented a remarkable enhancement in the snd performance and introduced a reliable and efficient technology in simultaneous organic and nitrogen removal process from environmental and economic aspects recycling of discarded ac and use of inferior carriers as a symbol of plastic waste in the manufacturing of new media can also be interesting besides because of the higher microbial attachment upon the new carrier and hence the need for a lesser filling degree in the reactor compared to the mbbr the innovative carrier offers a cost effective wastewater treatment technology the cost effectiveness of the new carrier has been discussed in detail in the supplementary material apart from this with this technology the plastic wastes having a proper density such as polypropylene in the form of enclosed shapes such as hollow pipes or granules can be readily recycled instead of producing virgin carriers as a result it is not only possible to solve partially the problem of accumulating non biodegradable plastics using the cbmc but also the efficiency of wastewater treatment systems can be increased all these advantages showed that the new carrier is an appropriate and practical alternative for the conventional moving carrier furthermore this improvement is applicable to both media classification i e fixed and moving kinds this study was the first work for the introduction and the assessment of the cbmc more investigations should be achieved to figure out the effects of the variables of the coated layer such as fraction size physical properties e g pore radius pore volume and surface area etc on the system performance in the future 4 conclusion the innovative carrier with a high specific surface area presents a novel cost effective wastewater treatment technology based on the recycling of waste materials quantifications and microscopic observations corroborated that the highly porous carrier made a promising environment for microbial growth due to the development of a larger anoxic layer in the cbmc biofilm and the creation of a better coexistence between different microbial groups comparative analysis in this study underlined that a significant improvement was obtained in the snd and tnr performances up to 14 3 and 16 8 respectively furthermore compared to the mbbr this technique made it possible to operate at a lower filling fraction from the environmental and economic perspectives the new carrier is more
