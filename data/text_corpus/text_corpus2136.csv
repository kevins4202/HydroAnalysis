10680,the evapotranspiration et and crop coefficient kc spatial variabilities are disregarded in traditional methods of evapotranspiration estimation based on lysimeters with the development of remote sensing techniques the estimative of et on agricultural areas in a specialized way has become possible through the use of algorithms based on the surface energy balance such as the metric and its automated version featured on the google earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux platform this study was carried out at a center pivot irrigated area located in the city of primavera do leste mt brazil one growing season 2016 of the specie zea mays maize was analyzed using processed images from the landsat 8 satellite within the eeflux platform the spatial variability of the actual evapotranspiration eta and the kc curve of this crop was determined the water use efficiency wue was also determined a comparative analysis was performed using different statistical indices root mean square error rmse the mean bios error mbe and the index of agreement d the eta for maize ranged from 1 3 4 1 mm d 1 and the kc obtained ranged from 0 3 to 1 2 the average wue of maize was 1 13 kg m 3 the method of estimation of eta and kc spatialized using the google eeflux platform made possible the understanding the spatial variability of these two variables and therefore this application has high potential to estimate the eta and kc on different stages of maize crop growth cycle keywords crop coefficient evapotranspiration irrigation water use efficiency zea mays 1 introduction estimative of the total and the fraction flows of water are essential for the management of hydric resources in agriculture water use quantification and management planning in agricultural areas are carried out based on variables related to weather soil and plant such as reference evapotranspiration eto crop coefficient kc and crop evapotranspiration etc as a result of the previous two variables product allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2015 these variables used to quantify crop evapotranspiration etc are measured along homogeneous surfaces using conventional techniques however the values obtained by these traditional methods are limited in accuracy because of the spatial variability of these variables in the field in addition the costs involved in experimental apparatus of the top conventional techniques are very high suction lysimeters and eddy covariance systems allen et al 2011 kiptala et al 2013 although nowadays these methodologies are used for quantifying crop evapotranspiration in few sophisticated field experiments these techniques present the drawbacks discussed above in the last decades a variety of remote sensing techniques have been used to quantify the evapotranspiration et on large scale agricultural areas kustas and norman 1996 courault et al 2005 most of the models and algorithms used to obtain the spatial maps of et are based on the surface energy balance techniques zhang et al 2016 the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution internalized calibration metric is one of the most used nowadays allen et al 2007 which derived from the pioneer model surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a b the application of the metric algorithm takes time since it is necessary to calibrate and execute the model the metric calibration is done for each landsat scene and for each satellite passing date involving a process of manual choosing of pixels with contrasting et values different users who may not be equally experienced can achieve different results so in order to reduce the uncertainties associated with the calibration process and to save time automated calibration models have been developed for the metric algorithm generating et estimates comparable to those produced by well trained users tasumi et al 2005 morton et al 2013 however even if the automated metric calibration tool reduces some of the drawbacks of applying the algorithm to obtaining et users will still need to accumulate and assemble a variety of layers including satellite image land cover map terrain local climate and soil maps from different sources and platforms and there may be a significant amount of pre processing required for the different layers before applying the algorithm data entry and manipulation can be the most time consuming phase of this process in order to automate data entry and manipulation and to accelerate the et calculation process the google earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux platform was designed and developed within the google earth engine gee based on metric algorithm allen et al 2007 eeflux uses landsat image files stored in the gee a cloud platform allen et al 2015 enabling users to obtain et maps for any landsat scene 5 7 or 8 in a matter of seconds eeflux also provides rapid generation of intermediate product maps such as surface temperature ts normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo maps for a particular landsat scene that may be useful for applications other than et eeflux was developed by a consortium based on the university of nebraska lincoln desert research institute desert research institute and university of idaho with financial support from google the platform processes single landsat images from any period from 1984 to the present and to almost every area of the globe eeflux uses grid weather data to calibrate the surface energy balance for each image the performance of the metric algorithm in its traditional version has been promising to estimate the et of various agricultural crops in united states of america usa where adequate meteorological information has been available some examples of metric applications can be found applied to cotton french et al 2015 sugarcane zhang et al 2015 sorghum wagle et al 2017 maize singh et al 2012 soybean choi et al 2009 and other crops in brazil and in the world there are several traditional point source studies on et and kc in areas of maize allen et al 1998 guerra et al 2003 kang et al 2003 gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 however the spatial estimate of the water consumption in maize crop using metric algorithm in the google eeflux version should be better studied since this new remote sensing tool can be very useful to improve irrigation management considering fields spatial variability on large areas at extremely low cost this study aims to estimate maize water consumption based on metric algorithm at google eeflux plataform in addition we validate the spatial estimates of eta by comparing them with the traditional fao reference guidelines values and etc values measured based on maize kc values obtained in reference studies in brazil and worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 location and characterization of the experimental area the study was carried out on a traditional farm located in the municipality of primavera do leste state of mato grosso fig 1 this property has a center pivot irrigated area of approximately 130 ha latitude of 15 13 s longitude of 53 58 w and average elevation of 560 m in which maize zea mays was cultivated in the year 2016 the climate of the region is of type aw alvares et al 2013 tropical with dry winter season the annual average temperature is 22 0 c and the average annual rainfall is 1784 mm the difference between the precipitation of the driest month and the wettest month is 313 mm the average temperature variation during the year is 4 5 c the warmest month of the year is october with an average temperature of 23 4 c during the month of july the coldest month of the year the average temperature is 18 9 c the relief is flat and the predominant soils of the region are dystrophic red latosols which have low natural fertility varying from deep to very deep permeable clayey and very clayey texture with predominant vegetation of the cerrado biome lopes and guilherme 2016 2 2 set of data used field data from a maize crop were used table 1 planting date was set on april 12th and harvest date on july 28th 2016 with a crop cycle of 107 days maize crop was conducted under a center pivot irrigation system crop productivity data were also used to obtain water use efficiency wue the wue was calculated using maize productivity data as well as the data of the water consumption of the crop along its respective cycle according to eq 1 geerts and raes 2009 1 wue y 10 et all where wue is the water use efficiency kg m 3 y is the maize yield kg ha 1 and etall is the total et throughout the growing cycle mm as for the remote data images of the sensors were used oli operational land imager and tirs thermal infrared sensor of landsat 8 satellite scene path 225 and row 71 in the year 2016 the satellite used has 16 day temporal resolution and 30 meter space resolution according to the united states geological survey usgs in the selection of images priority was given to those without clouds and regularly distributed throughout the study period in order to allow a better evaluation of the variables et e kc according to the different phenological phases of the maize following these criteria three images were selected obtained in three representative days initial intermediate and final phases of the growing season 2 3 actual evapotranspiration metric algorithm the images of the landsat 8 satellite used in this study were processed on earth engine evapotranspiration flux eeflux metric version 0 20 2 the actual et is calculated as a residual of the surface energy balance allen et al 2007 according to eq 2 2 le rn h g where le is the latent heat flux spent energy in the evapotranspiration process w m 2 rn is net radiation w m 2 g is the heat flux in the soil w m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 eeflux uses the landsat thermal band and shortwave bands to estimate the surface energy balance and to estimate the amount of vegetation albedo and surface roughness the current version of eeflux employs automated image calibration eeflux is calibrated by assigning values for etof for the hot and cold parts pixels of the surface temperature spectrum of the scene the le is estimated at the exact moment of the passage of the satellite for each pixel and instantaneous et is then calculated by dividing the le by the latent heat of vaporization according to eq 3 3 e t i n s t 3600 le λ ρw where etinst is the instant evapotranspiration mm h 1 3600 converts seconds to hours λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 and ρw is the density of water 1000 kg 3 et is expressed in terms of etof which represents et as a fraction of the reference evapotranspiration eto in eeflux the eto is calculated using the reference of the grass crop according to eq 4 the etof is similar to the traditionally called crop coefficient kc 4 e t o f e t i n s t e t o etof is used as a vehicle to extrapolate et from the satellite s instantaneous passage to the 24 h period thus the eta daily is calculated by multiplying etof for each individual pixel by eto of the site and assuming consistency between etof at the time of the satellite s etof for the period of 24 h according to eq 5 5 eta etof eto 2 4 reference evapotranspiration eto and crop coefficient kc in order to obtain the reference evapotranspiration eto data of maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and precipitation of the meteorological station located in the study area were used table 2 this station is installed at a height of two meters in relation to the ground and records data every 15 min and these are stored in a data acquisition system the estimates of eto for the days of passage of the satellite were carried out based on penman monteith equation fao 56 according to methodology adopted by allen et al 1998 using ref et software version 2 01 14 after obtaining the eto the kc was calculated through the relation between the eta and the daily eto eq 6 obtaining specific values for each phenological phase initial intermediate and final of maize crop the term kc was used throughout the work to represent what is actually kc multiplied by the soil water stress coefficient ks allen et al 2007 that is the soil moisture was considered to be at field capacity on the evaluated days 6 k c et a et o the assumption that soil moisture profile was at field capacity in the three image days was based on soil moisture monitoring fig 2 shows daily rainfall and irrigation events for the growing season throughout the growing season there was only one rainfall with a considerable volume of approximately 8 mm the remaining daily rainfall values recorded was below 2 mm as for the irrigation events it is observed that these were performed frequently and with volumes ranging from 3 to 9 mm 2 5 data analysis and validation the data of eta and kc were submitted to a descriptive statistical analysis average standard deviation minimum and maximum values for each of the periods of the maize cycle considered in this study in addition spatial distribution maps were presented in the study area 130 68 ha ou 1452 pixels of these two variables eta e kc for the different periods analyzed the values of eta of maize obtained through the google eeflux platform were compared to the etc mm d 1 calculated with observed data in the field the observed etc was obtained by multiplying the eto calculated by the penman monteith pm method by the kc of the fao 56 recommendations allen et al 1998 and by reference studies in brazil and abroad table 3 some statistical indices were used to compare the etc measured and estimated the indices used were the root mean square error rmse mean error absolute mbe and the agreement index of willmott d according to eqs 7 9 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n i pi i i 8 mbe i 1 n i pi i i 9 d 1 i 1 n p i o i ² i 1 n p i o o i o ² where ii is the measured value ipi is the predicted value n is the number of observations and p and o are respectively the predicted and observed values and the 95 confidence interval ofeach index value were estimated through the bootstrap approach 3 results and discussion 2 6 spatial distribution of the eta and kc the spatial variability of the actual evapotranspiration eta obtained by metric algorithm can be seen in fig 3 eta ranged from 1 3 4 1 mm d 1 in general terms on the dates of the satellite evaluation in the year 2016 there was a greater amplitude between the values observed at the final phase of the crop 07 17 2016 and a smaller amplitude between the values observed in the initial phase of the maize 05 14 2016 the eta maps created confirm the occurrence of the spatial and temporal variability of the eta in agreement of the meteorological elements observed for the period and due to the characteristics of the soil and the crop kamali and nazari 2018 determined the water consumption of maize grown in northern iran using remote sensing data and the algorithm sebal and also checked that the variability of the spatial distribution of eta and kc are influenced by the acting meteorological elements the soil type and the plant characteristics the variability of the spatial distribution of the crop coefficient kc during the periods studied in the year 2016 for maize crop can be seen in fig 4 it can be seen that the kc obtained ranged from 0 3 to 1 2 in general terms in the analyzed satellite passage there was a greater amplitude between the values observed in the final phase of the crop 07 17 2016 and a smaller amplitude between values observed in the initial phase 05 14 2016 of maize the presented maps confirm the occurrence of the spatial and temporal variability of kc as a function of the maize crop growth so that the highest values of kc occur in places with greater soil cover by the vegetation that is leaf area index lai the variability of the spatial distribution of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be seen in fig 5 it can be observed that the ndvi obtained ranged from 0 44 to 0 90 in general terms on the dates of the satellite evaluation in the year 2016 there was a greater amplitude between the values observed in the initial and final phases of the crop 05 14 2016 and 07 17 2016 and a smaller amplitude between the values observed in the intermediate phase of the maize 06 15 2016 table 4 shows that the mean eta values were 3 64 3 59 and 3 62 mm d 1 for the initial intermediate and final phases of the growing season in 2016 the standard deviation for eta values were 0 36 0 41 and 0 49 mm d 1 for the representative dates of the initial intermediate and final phases respectively mean values of kc showed that these were 1 11 1 09 and 0 98 at representative dates of the initial intermediate and final phases of maize grown in the year 2016 the standard deviations for the values of kc of this year were 0 11 0 12 and 0 13 for the representative dates of the initial intermediate and final phases respectively cumulative evapotranspiration etac during the crop cycle of maize in 2016 was 385 23 mm d 1 considering the fixed kc values for each stage of growth and development of the crop the water use efficiency wue was 1 13 kg m 3 2 7 comparison with kc data obtained in reference works fig 6 presents the average values of the maize crop coefficient kc throughout the respective growth and development cycles obtained in the present work and in other reference works in brazil and abroad the values of kc obtained for maize have an initial phase value of 1 11 in the intermediate phase of 1 09 and in the final phase of 0 98 it is observed that the average kc for maize obtained through the metric google eeflux algorithm is similar to the fao kc value allen et al 1998 in the initial and intermediate phases however is different in the final phase according to tasumi et al 2005 kc values determined experimentally for different stages of maize have been considerably different from those recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 according to the authors the development of local data kc is a recommended estimate differences in kc values can be attributed to differences due to inherent variability in the date of emergence land use management rainfall leaf area and atmospheric conditions such as air temperature wind speed and vapor pressure deficit kamble et al 2013 in the comparison of the maize kc obtained by the metric google eeflux algorithm with the values of kc recommended by other reference works in brazil and the world guerra et al 2003 kang et al 2003 gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 it was verified that the values presented are not similar showing the limitations of the algorithm in the estimation of kc values by remote sensing but also showing that the methodological differences to obtain kc results in considerable differences the reasons why there may be a difference between kc derived from fao56 and metric eeflux are related to the temporal variability while the fao56 kc is obtained from multi day data the kc metric eeflux is obtained from the satellite s passing time data which makes these methodologies considerably different literature kc were selected according to the criterion of the merit of the published work reference works however these works were developed under conditions different from the planting conditions evaluated in this study thus the plants may have had different responses to different atmospheric demands and soil types to which they were submitted 2 8 data validation in fig 7 we can see the values of eta of maize obtained by the metric algorithm google eeflux compared to etc calculated with observed data comparing the eta of maize obtained by metric with etc calculated using kc values recommended by allen et al 1998 fig 7a it was observed that the index d presented a value of 0 22 indicating low accuracy of the model in this situation the rmse was 0 92 and the mbe was 0 81 indicating not so acceptable accuracy of the eta estimate based on the metric algorithm the low precision and accuracy found does not mean that the estimates made by the metric algorithm are not reliable but instead they consider the spatio temporal variability of et and kc unlike other existing methodologies although kc values recommended by allen et al 1998 do not represent the fundamental truth their position in the scientific community is established making it a good reference for comparison costa et al 2019 and josé et al 2019 used the sebal algorithm metric principles and techniques in brazil to quantify the water consumption of coffee and cotton respectively in both studies the kc values recommended by the fao 56 when compared to the kc values obtained through surface energy balance algorithms present low levels of precision and accuracy in general in the validation of the eta of the maize obtained by the algorithm metric google eeflux with etc values calculated with data observed and recommended by kang et al 2003 fig 7b gao et al 2009 fig 7c zhang et al 2013 fig 7d and guerra et al 2003 fig 7e it is observed that the index d presented values below 0 47 indicating a relatively low precision of the model in these situations the rmse was below 2 12 and the mbe was less than 1 85 also indicating a reasonable accuracy of the etc estimate based on the metric algorithm one of the limitations when working with landsat 8 satellite imagery to quantify crop water consumption is the amount of samples available within the crop cycle in the case of this study there were just three images the small number of samples tends to decrease the precision and accuracy of et estimation models part of that may be the single kc values from the literature represents an average kc value which is accurate when viewed over a period of a week or longer integrating times with higher and times with lower evaporation rates from a wet soil surface for example immediately following a rain or irrigation event evaporation from the soil is typically higher resulting in higher overall et rates metric on the other hand is based on the actual conditions at the satellite overpass time and therefore may have a higher kc especially during the initial crop development period than fao56 or other tabulated kc estimates therefore if residual soil evaporation from antecedent wetting events is not accounted for in the calculated kc values some discrepancy may be expected in a study such as this one where only specific days are compared 3 conclusions the estimation methods of the actual evapotranspiration eta and crop coefficient kc using the google eeflux platform enabled an understanding of the spatial variability of these two variables and therefore this application has a high potential to estimate the eta and kc of different stages of maize growth and development this may also help to understand the water requirement of this crop and to assist precision irrigation management in irrigated cropping systems the eta and kc data obtained on the basis of the metric google eefflux algorithm presented similar values as standard fao56 method the google eeflux platform is a more parsimonious alternative in the estimation of kc and therefore the kc values obtained by this method can be used directly in areas of cultivation of maize the validation of the eta obtained by the metric google eefflux algorithm with etc values calculated through data observed and recommended by reference works presented results with not so acceptable accuracy due to some limitations such as data sample size used within the growing season and the differences between the methodologies to obtain the variables eta and kc the kc curve behavior obtained by google eeflux tool is similar to the fao56 pattern in the early and intermediate phase of maize crop declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study was financed in part by the coordenação de aperfeiçoamento de pessoal de nível superior

table 3 some statistical indices were used to compare the etc measured and estimated the indices used were the root mean square error rmse mean error absolute mbe and the agreement index of willmott d according to eqs 7 9 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n i pi i i 8 mbe i 1 n i pi i i 9 d 1 i 1 n p i o i ² i 1 n p i o o i o ² where ii is the measured value ipi is the predicted value n is the number of observations and p and o are respectively the predicted and observed values and the 95 confidence interval ofeach index value were estimated through the bootstrap approach 3 results and discussion 2 6 spatial distribution of the eta and kc the spatial variability of the actual evapotranspiration eta obtained by metric algorithm can be seen in fig 3 eta ranged from 1 3 4 1 mm d 1 in general terms on the dates of the satellite evaluation in the year 2016 there was a greater amplitude between the values observed at the final phase of the crop 07 17 2016 and a smaller amplitude between the values observed in the initial phase of the maize 05 14 2016 the eta maps created confirm the occurrence of the spatial and temporal variability of the eta in agreement of the meteorological elements observed for the period and due to the characteristics of the soil and the crop kamali and nazari 2018 determined the water consumption of maize grown in northern iran using remote sensing data and the algorithm sebal and also checked that the variability of the spatial distribution of eta and kc are influenced by the acting meteorological elements the soil type and the plant characteristics the variability of the spatial distribution of the crop coefficient kc during the periods studied in the year 2016 for maize crop can be seen in fig 4 it can be seen that the kc obtained ranged from 0 3 to 1 2 in general terms in the analyzed satellite passage there was a greater amplitude between the values observed in the final phase of the crop 07 17 2016 and a smaller amplitude between values observed in the initial phase 05 14 2016 of maize the presented maps confirm the occurrence of the spatial and temporal variability of kc as a function of the maize crop growth so that the highest values of kc occur in places with greater soil cover by the vegetation that is leaf area index lai the variability of the spatial distribution of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi can be seen in fig 5 it can be observed that the ndvi obtained ranged from 0 44 to 0 90 in general terms on the dates of the satellite evaluation in the year 2016 there was a greater amplitude between the values observed in the initial and final phases of the crop 05 14 2016 and 07 17 2016 and a smaller amplitude between the values observed in the intermediate phase of the maize 06 15 2016 table 4 shows that the mean eta values were 3 64 3 59 and 3 62 mm d 1 for the initial intermediate and final phases of the growing season in 2016 the standard deviation for eta values were 0 36 0 41 and 0 49 mm d 1 for the representative dates of the initial intermediate and final phases respectively mean values of kc showed that these were 1 11 1 09 and 0 98 at representative dates of the initial intermediate and final phases of maize grown in the year 2016 the standard deviations for the values of kc of this year were 0 11 0 12 and 0 13 for the representative dates of the initial intermediate and final phases respectively cumulative evapotranspiration etac during the crop cycle of maize in 2016 was 385 23 mm d 1 considering the fixed kc values for each stage of growth and development of the crop the water use efficiency wue was 1 13 kg m 3 2 7 comparison with kc data obtained in reference works fig 6 presents the average values of the maize crop coefficient kc throughout the respective growth and development cycles obtained in the present work and in other reference works in brazil and abroad the values of kc obtained for maize have an initial phase value of 1 11 in the intermediate phase of 1 09 and in the final phase of 0 98 it is observed that the average kc for maize obtained through the metric google eeflux algorithm is similar to the fao kc value allen et al 1998 in the initial and intermediate phases however is different in the final phase according to tasumi et al 2005 kc values determined experimentally for different stages of maize have been considerably different from those recommended by fao 56 allen et al 1998 according to the authors the development of local data kc is a recommended estimate differences in kc values can be attributed to differences due to inherent variability in the date of emergence land use management rainfall leaf area and atmospheric conditions such as air temperature wind speed and vapor pressure deficit kamble et al 2013 in the comparison of the maize kc obtained by the metric google eeflux algorithm with the values of kc recommended by other reference works in brazil and the world guerra et al 2003 kang et al 2003 gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 it was verified that the values presented are not similar showing the limitations of the algorithm in the estimation of kc values by remote sensing but also showing that the methodological differences to obtain kc results in considerable differences the reasons why there may be a difference between kc derived from fao56 and metric eeflux are related to the temporal variability while the fao56 kc is obtained from multi day data the kc metric eeflux is obtained from the satellite s passing time data which makes these methodologies considerably different literature kc were selected according to the criterion of the merit of the published work reference works however these works were developed under conditions different from the planting conditions evaluated in this study thus the plants may have had different responses to different atmospheric demands and soil types to which they were submitted 2 8 data validation in fig 7 we can see the values of eta of maize obtained by the metric algorithm google eeflux compared to etc calculated with observed data comparing the eta of maize obtained by metric with etc calculated using kc values recommended by allen et al 1998 fig 7a it was observed that the index d presented a value of 0 22 indicating low accuracy of the model in this situation the rmse was 0 92 and the mbe was 0 81 indicating not so acceptable accuracy of the eta estimate based on the metric algorithm the low precision and accuracy found does not mean that the estimates made by the metric algorithm are not reliable but instead they consider the spatio temporal variability of et and kc unlike other existing methodologies although kc values recommended by allen et al 1998 do not represent the fundamental truth their position in the scientific community is established making it a good reference for comparison costa et al 2019 and josé et al 2019 used the sebal algorithm metric principles and techniques in brazil to quantify the water consumption of coffee and cotton respectively in both studies the kc values recommended by the fao 56 when compared to the kc values obtained through surface energy balance algorithms present low levels of precision and accuracy in general in the validation of the eta of the maize obtained by the algorithm metric google eeflux with etc values calculated with data observed and recommended by kang et al 2003 fig 7b gao et al 2009 fig 7c zhang et al 2013 fig 7d and guerra et al 2003 fig 7e it is observed that the index d presented values below 0 47 indicating a relatively low precision of the model in these situations the rmse was below 2 12 and the mbe was less than 1 85 also indicating a reasonable accuracy of the etc estimate based on the metric algorithm one of the limitations when working with landsat 8 satellite imagery to quantify crop water consumption is the amount of samples available within the crop cycle in the case of this study there were just three images the small number of samples tends to decrease the precision and accuracy of et estimation models part of that may be the single kc values from the literature represents an average kc value which is accurate when viewed over a period of a week or longer integrating times with higher and times with lower evaporation rates from a wet soil surface for example immediately following a rain or irrigation event evaporation from the soil is typically higher resulting in higher overall et rates metric on the other hand is based on the actual conditions at the satellite overpass time and therefore may have a higher kc especially during the initial crop development period than fao56 or other tabulated kc estimates therefore if residual soil evaporation from antecedent wetting events is not accounted for in the calculated kc values some discrepancy may be expected in a study such as this one where only specific days are compared 3 conclusions the estimation methods of the actual evapotranspiration eta and crop coefficient kc using the google eeflux platform enabled an understanding of the spatial variability of these two variables and therefore this application has a high potential to estimate the eta and kc of different stages of maize growth and development this may also help to understand the water requirement of this crop and to assist precision irrigation management in irrigated cropping systems the eta and kc data obtained on the basis of the metric google eefflux algorithm presented similar values as standard fao56 method the google eeflux platform is a more parsimonious alternative in the estimation of kc and therefore the kc values obtained by this method can be used directly in areas of cultivation of maize the validation of the eta obtained by the metric google eefflux algorithm with etc values calculated through data observed and recommended by reference works presented results with not so acceptable accuracy due to some limitations such as data sample size used within the growing season and the differences between the methodologies to obtain the variables eta and kc the kc curve behavior obtained by google eeflux tool is similar

10681,the ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms is considered an effective strategy to improve grain yield and has been widely used in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural areas however the key mechanism by which rfms increases yield and efficiency under different hydrothermal conditions remains unclear understanding this mechanism and the interaction between different rfmss and hydrothermal conditions could provide a practical reference for optimizing cultivation we aimed to investigate the yield increase potential of different planting systems under the same hydrothermal conditions and evaluate the effects of rfms treatments on drought resistance and yield increase under different hydrothermal conditions the following planting treatments were carried out in ridge furrow prepared fields under seven different hydrothermal conditions in a representative rainfed agricultural area for four consecutive years 1 ridge furrow mulching system with complete coverage rc 2 ridge furrow mulching system with ridge coverage rr and 3 planting without mulching control treatment ct compared with ct rfms improved field hydrothermal conditions and reduced evapotranspiration of crops in more hydrothermally limited areas precipitation 196 320 mm temperature 18 c the grain yield and water use efficiency wue with rc significantly increased by 49 95 and 57 12 compared with that of ct respectively however rr and rc had no significant difference in grain yield and wue in areas less hydrothermally limited precipitation 320 460 mm temperature 18 6 c 23 6 c but increased by 13 51 and 22 19 compared with that of ct additionally rfms improved economic benefits especially in hydrothermally limited areas with rc increasing benefits by 142 64 200 84 compared with that of ct therefore rc can be used as the optimal technique to overcome simultaneous drought and cold weather in rainfed agricultural areas under hydrothermally limited conditions keywords ridge furrow mulching system hydrothermal conditions maize yield aboveground biomass water use economic benefit 1 introduction in recent years the atmospheric concentration of co2 globally has been rapidly increasing owing to industrialization and field crop production the atmospheric co2 concentration is expected to reach 550 μmol mol 1 in the mid 21st century prentice et al 2001 increasing atmospheric co2 concentration has exacerbated global warming affecting the amount and patterns of precipitation resulting in increased water demand for ecological and agricultural production qin 2002 with increasing population and the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production water shortages will become a global problem and the gap between supply and demand of agricultural water will further increase shen and su 1998 under the dual pressure of water shortage and population growth ensuring food security will be a major issue in the future parry et al 2005 currently grain production in irrigated areas has reached high and stable levels thus it is difficult to further increase the total grain yield by increasing per unit area yield of districts with only traditional irrigation wang et al 2015a b besides semiarid and arid rainfed agricultural areas comprise 41 of all global land area and provide food to 38 of the global population reynolds et al 2007 therefore the development of rainfed agriculture will be the main approach and it is of great significance to ensure future food security in china and worldwide in rainfed agricultural production natural precipitation is the main source of water available for crops decreasing production of several crops has been attributed to relatively scarce water resources uneven spatial and temporal distribution of natural precipitation and even altered precipitation period and crop water demand period consequently most of the precipitation is lost through surface runoff and ineffective evaporation in most rainfed areas with less precipitation chen et al 2012 ren et al 2016 2017 to effectively overcome these problems several farming practices and water storage technologies have been developed and applied to restrict water loss improve precipitation utilization and water production efficiency reduce inefficient evaporation in the field and thereby enhance crop drought resistance and grain yield in water scarce areas bu et al 2013 li et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms has received global attention owing to the advantages of enhancing natural precipitation especially in areas with 5 mm rainfall and increasing infiltration and maintaining moisture furthermore rfms has the potential to improve soil temperature mo et al 2017 ren et al 2016 van der werf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a although several field studies have confirmed that the ridge furrow plastic mulching technique can increase the yield and water use efficiency wue of crops there is yet to be conclusive evidence suggesting that this technique reflects a better strategy for significantly improving yield and wue under different hydrothermal conditions currently it is difficult to implement cross regional multi year and multi point field trials owing to human and material constraints and unpredictable climatic conditions in addition to greenhouse studies different studies have been conducted with artificial setups of different rainfall conditions ren et al 2008 2010 a few studies have compared water harvesting effects and mechanisms in regions under different hydrothermal conditions however the relationship between the yield increase of different crops and regional hydrothermal conditions remains unclear ren et al 2017 therefore in the present study we established spring maize crops in seven typical rainfed agricultural areas with different hydrothermal gradients in northwest china from 2014 to 2017 and hypothesized that different rfms would have different effects on maize production under different hydrothermal conditions the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the potential to increase yield among different planting systems under the same hydrothermal conditions 2 evaluate the effects of rfms treatments on drought resistance and yield increase under different hydrothermal conditions and 3 suggest promising patterns for dryland maize production in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural areas under different hydrothermal conditions as well as other areas with similar climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental sites field experiments were conducted in seven sites in shaanxi gansu and ningxia provinces china varying in altitude temperature and precipitation namely yangling yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding fig 1 table 1 the altitude of these seven sites increased from yangling 521 m through yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang and yuanzhou to anding 1970 m fig 1 a the mean annual precipitation fig 1 b mean temperature fig 1 c and forest free period fig 1 d 1980 2010 decreased from yangling 660 mm 12 90 c and 210 d through yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang and yuanzhou to anding 400 mm 6 20 c and 150 d based on previous research zhang et al 2018 ye and liu 2012 30 years of mean annual precipitation and air temperature data from various regions yangling yongshou and changwu were divided into areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions i e conditions that limited crop growth less under traditional planting hydrothermal refers to the temperature and precipitation in different areas working together in the environment to affect crop growth zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding were divided into areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions i e conditions that limited crop growth more under traditional planting to unify the time of analysis and progress a 1 year ripe cropping system was used in the different areas in each site the experiments were conducted in a flat field at the same level of fertility with similar loamy texture soil that had been cropped for several years the soil physical and chemical properties in the seven regions in 2014 are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized complete block design was employed in the study three treatments with three replicates were used 1 ridge furrow mulching systems with complete coverage rc fig 2 a 2 ridge furrow mulching systems with ridge coverage rr fig 2 b 3 planting without mulching as the control treatment ct fig 2 c the experiment was conducted in a ridge furrow field with a relatively uniform base fertility basal fertilizers n 300 kg ha 1 p2o5 150 kg ha 1 and k2o 150 kg ha 1 were broadcasted over the soil and turned over by plowing to transfer it to the subsurface and then the rfms was set up as shown in fig 2 rfms was formed by alternating ridges 0 6 m wide and 0 15 m high and furrows 0 6 m wide with film mulching a transparent polyethylene sheet 0 8 m wide and 0 008 mm thick was applied to cover the entire soil surface of a plot before sowing nine plots 3 planting patterns 3 replications were established each of which was 30 m 10 m in dimension the study was carried out continuously for 4 years 2014 2017 the annual sowing time was in late april according to the water temperature conditions in different regions the harvest time was early september and late september the higher the altitude the later the harvest the seeds of xianyu 335 a local variety with strong resistance and adaptability were sown using hole sowing machine at a planting density of 75 000 plant ha 1 an additional n fertilizer pure n at 150 kg ha 1 concentration was applied as top dressing by a hole fertilizing machine between two maize plants approximately 40 days after the sowing after the annual harvest plowing was carried out and ridge furrow film mulching was carried out in the spring of the subsequent year during the whole growth process of spring maize no irrigation was applied but weeding and pest control were carried out at various growth stages of crop growth precipitation and mean air temperature data of each experimental site were obtained daily from the nearest weather station 10 km away from the experimental field in each site 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content swc soil water storage sws and crop water consumption cwc the gravimetric swc was periodically determined at a soil depth of 0 200 cm from sowing until maturity monthly for four years soil samples were collected at 10 cm increments to a soil depth of 0 20 cm and at 20 cm increments to a soil depth of 20 200 cm three random samples were collected per plot and the sampling position of the rfms treatment was the middle of furrow ridge ridge junction and middle of ridge while it was middle of two rows and middle of two plants for the traditional planting treatment the swc was determined as the average of samples

of 54 m2 3 6 m wide 15 m long were harvested for yield determination in each plot plants from border rows were excluded from the harvest in addition 10 maize ears were randomly selected from each quadrant to measure kernel number per ear and 100 grain weight all samples obtained were dried and weighed at 60 c and the grain yield and plant biomass were determined at 14 moisture content the harvest index hi of maize is the ratio of grain yield kg ha 1 to aboveground biomass kg ha 1 2 3 3 economic benefit the input values renminbi rmb yuan ha 1 were based on the following consumable items

the experimental data were subjected to an analysis of variance for each hydrothermal condition using spss 24 0 spss inc chicago il usa with year as repeats the means of the results for each treatment were compared using fisher s least significant difference lsd test at a probability level of 0 05 the data from each sampling event were analyzed separately all figures were prepared using origin 2019 origin lab northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 hydrothermal conditions during the study period precipitation varied significantly among years in each site fig 3 and the average annual precipitation during the growing period was 370 363 351 348 315 343 and 268 mm in yangling yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding respectively the proportion of effective precipitation and contribution of effective precipitation to average precipitation during the growing period were the highest in yangling 31 3 and 78 7 respectively which were 4 3 10 1 and 3 4 19 8 higher than those in the other regions however the proportion of micro effect and ineffective precipitation was larger than that of effective precipitation but its contribution in each experimental site was only 21 3 27 5 among the sites ineffective precipitation in anding accounted for a large proportion of the precipitation 41 1 the differences in soil moisture effects varied with different rfms treatments which showed different trends during the growth period of crops under different hydrothermal conditions from sowing in 2014 to harvest in 2017 fig 4 the soil moisture before sowing in each site gradually decreased with the hydrothermal gradient it was higher in yangling yongshou and changwu where the hydrothermal conditions are not restricted and the difference in soil water storage during the growing period soil moisture before sowing soil moisture after harvest was positive the soil moisture in the other sites with more limited hydrothermal conditions pengyang yuanzhou and anding showed negative values and the evapotranspiration of crops during each treatment period was the lowest in the rc treatment maize was planted throughout the year in yangling and yongshou however in areas such as pengyang yuanzhou and anding the cultivation of maize has been widely promoted the average annual temperature of the experimental sites in 2014 2017 was consistent fig 5 both average daily minimum temperature and average temperature from 0 to 30 days after sowing decreased with increasing altitude in each site with an average of 12 03 c and 17 38 c respectively in yangling which was 2 5 c 6 98 c and 1 11 c 5 9 c higher than that in the other regions and 9 53 c and 16 27 c in yongshou which was 1 68 4 48 c and 1 89 4 80 c higher than that in the other regions the total effective accumulated air temperature 10 c during the 4 year average maize growth period in each site showed a decreasing trend with increasing altitude fig 6 furthermore from 0 to 30 days after sowing the difference in total effective accumulated air temperature in each area was significant and it was significantly higher in yangling than in the other areas by 25 5 90 1 in pengyang yuanzhou and anding occasionally extreme temperatures affect seed germination emergence and seedling growth but the temperature does not become a major factor limiting the maize vegetative growth stage in yangling and yongshou as the growth period progresses the effective accumulated temperature difference in each site decreased after 90 120 days of sowing the maize entered the silking filling stage and the annual average daily maximum temperature and annual average temperature were 32 05 c and 27 45 c respectively in yangling which were higher than those in the other regions by 7 6 32 3 and 10 5 39 4 respectively 3 2 maize yield aboveground biomass and harvest index rfms increased maize grain yield and aboveground biomass significantly in this 4 year continuous study the grain yield and aboveground biomass changed similarly to the hydrothermal gradient under both more and less hydrothermally limited conditions fig 7 a and b moreover their increase in rfms treatments improved with the hydrothermal gradient fig 8 a and b compared with that of ct rc and rr treatments increased grain yield by 15 0 29 8 and 8 5 16 5 in areas where hydrothermal conditions are less limited respectively and it was increased by 45 5 52 3 and 28 3 37 5 in more hydrothermally limited areas similarly rc and rr treatments increased aboveground biomass by 19 2 36 4 and 9 7 17 0 in areas where hydrothermal conditions are less limited respectively and it was increased by 36 7 45 4 and 23 2 34 4 in more hydrothermally limited areas with increasing altitude the maize grain yield and aboveground biomass under rc treatment increased by 5 9 16 8 and 8 2 17 2 compared with that under the rr treatment respectively however the increase with each rfms treatment under the less hydrothermally limited conditions did not reach a significant level compared with that under more hydrothermally limited conditions but both were significantly higher than those of ct influenced by crop yield and aboveground biomass the harvest index of different planting patterns under different hydrothermal conditions was significantly different fig 7 c the harvest index of rc continued to increase with the hydrothermal gradient whereas that under rr and ct increased initially and then decreased in areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions such as yangling yongshou and changwu the increase in aboveground biomass in rfms was higher than the grain yield resulting in an average reduction in harvest index of 2 2 2 4 compared with that of ct among them rc increased the grain yield and aboveground biomass in all treatments and its harvest index decreased significantly by 3 5 4 9 in addition the harvest index of rr only decreased by 0 1 1 0 which was not significant conversely in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding the harvest index increased by an average of 3 1 6 7 the rc treatment harvest index increased significantly by an average of 4 3 9 3 whereas that of rr treatment increased by 1 9 4 1 which was significant in yuanzhou and anding 3 3 precipitation use efficiency and water use efficiency rfms improved the pue fig 9 a under different hydrothermal conditions the pue decreased in the following order rc rr ct from yangling to anding the pue showed a gradual increase under rfms and the increase improved with the hydrothermal gradient in yangling yongshou and changwu where hydrothermal conditions are less limited rfms increased the pue by an average of 11 5 22 6 specifically the pue of rc and rr increased by an average of 14 7 29 0 and 8 4 16 1 respectively compared with that of ct but the difference was not significant in zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding where the hydrothermal conditions are more limited the annual pue of the rfms increased significantly by 37 3 49 5 the pue of rc increased by 10 9 18 7 compared with that of rr and there was no significant difference the average annual pue of rc and rr was the lowest in yuanzhou which was 26 6 and 24 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the highest in anding which was 30 9 and 26 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively crop wue was affected by grain yield and evapotranspiration during growth period the wue showed the same trend as the pue in different planting modes fig 9 b that is rc rr ct under less limited hydrothermal conditions the annual average wue in rfms with hydrothermal gradient increased by 15 4 25 8 and 16 7 respectively compared with ct among them the wue of rc increased by 1 3 9 2 compared with the average annual wue of rr and the difference did not reach a significant level in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions rfms increased by an average of 35 8 57 5 compared with that of ct and the average annual wue of rc was the lowest in yongshou and the highest in anding 25 1 and 31 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively the wue of rr was the lowest in yangling which was 24 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the highest in zhenyuan 26 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 3 4 economic benefits the agricultural input cost of rc and rr was 23 42 2102 rmb ha 1 and 14 22 1276 rmb ha 1 higher than that of ct respectively although rfms increased the cost of agricultural inputs table 2 the economic benefits were significantly improved in areas where hydrothermal conditions were less limited the difference in synergy between rc and rr was negligible which was 6 28 42 69 495 2162 rmb ha 1 and 2 43 32 56 191 1156 rmb ha 1 respectively but in areas with more hydrothermally limited conditions each treatment was considerably different the synergy was the most obvious under rc treatment which was 14 89 43 13 875 1344 rmb ha 1 and 142 64 200 84 2977 3969 rmb ha 1 higher than that under rr and ct respectively in addition rfms also increased the ratio of production to investment in more hydrothermally limited areas with an increase of 17 30 22 86 and 11 91 20 10 under rc and rr treatments respectively compared with ct 4 discussion 4 1 hydrothermal conditions at present ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms increased soil temperature has become the consensus of experts compared to traditional flat cropping and there have been many studies on the use of the ridge furrow mulching system to improve soil temperature some articles with similar or identical experimental areas and treatments showed that rfms hydrothermal conditions to regulate the growth environment of maize zhang et al 2019 li et al 2020 yin et al 2019 qin et al 2018 in short it can be concluded that rfms increased soil temperature to regulate the growth environment of maize in the present study the effect of ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms on crop production varied with soil type climatic conditions and crop growth period previous studies have shown that rfms has the following advantages over traditional flat planting shortening the growth period of maize and increasing yield and wue li et al 2017 qin et al 2018 ren et al 2010 similar to the results of previous studies in areas where hydrothermal conditions are less limited the temperature was relatively high and the evapotranspiration was high soil water storage after maturity was lower than that before sowing and therefore the difference in soil water storage during the growing period of crops was positive and with the precipitation gradient the evapotranspiration of crops showed a decreasing trend in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding the application of rfms is more extensive gao et al 2012 li et al 2016 rfms increases the amount of crop evapotranspiration wang et al 2015a 2008 in the present study the evapotranspiration of crops under the same hydrothermal condition was the lowest in the rc treatment because rc collected rainwater and rc presented the best water storage and preservation effect among all treatments in addition owing to the surface coverage with the plastic film ineffective evaporation of soil water was reduced therefore the soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer during the mature period was higher than that in other treatments furthermore the difference in soil water storage during the growth period was negative thus under different hydrothermal conditions the evapotranspiration of crops was lower than that under ct which was the lowest at 6 57 mm in anding and the highest at 25 mm in zhenyuan and with increasing hydrothermal gradient the evapotranspiration of crops showed a decreasing trend 4 2 maize yield and water use efficiency rfms has a greater potential to increase production and alleviate the effects of low temperature in spring and drought stress in maize production especially at the primary stage of its growth and development as well as in the period in which reproductive organs are established zhang et al 2018 recent studies have shown that rfms has been actively promoted and widely used in high altitude areas of the loess plateau to exploit its advantages to achieve higher yield liu et al 2009 2014a wang et al 2016b ye and liu 2012 zhou et al 2015 in our experiment the grain yield of ct was greatly affected by hydrothermal conditions showing a general downward trend along with hydrothermal gradient and yields corresponded to hydrothermal conditions with the highest in yangling and the lowest in anding the maize grain yield of ct in different areas was significantly different and the difference was more evident in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions compared to rfms treatments rfms continued to increase production in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions and less limited hydrothermal conditions but increased production in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions gong et al 2015 li et al 2004a 2016 liu et al 2014b 2014c wang et al 2016b among them rc presented improved hydrothermal conditions and adjusted plant growth ability increasing grain yield and aboveground biomass compared with those of ct which were greater than those of rr and the difference between rc and rr increased with the increase in hydrothermal gradient the results showed that when the annual precipitation was 196 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 15 c 18 c rc had a higher yield potential than that of rr and with increasing precipitation and temperature the difference between rc and ct gradually reduced however the difference between rr and ct was significantly greater than that of rc when the annual precipitation was 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 18 c indicating that temperature is no longer a key factor limiting crop growth furthermore the effect of uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation on crop production was mitigated by rr the current study found that rc had no obvious effect on increasing grain yield under hydrothermally more limited conditions owing to the temperature not favoring maize flower bud differentiation and pollination because of occasionally persistent high temperature and dry weather consequently rc had a direct effect on grain filling and yield formation in the later stage but this situation rarely occurred in the other areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions and rc showed a greater potential for increased production in addition rfms promoted the growth of shoots above and belowground by improving soil hydrothermal conditions wang et al 2016 the increasing trend of biomass under different hydrothermal conditions was consistent with the grain yield trend however the increase in aboveground biomass was 2 3 times higher than that of grain yield when the annual precipitation was 196 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 15 c 18 c the increase in rc harvest index was higher than rr and rr showed a strong advantage when the annual precipitation was 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 18 c these results indicate that rc has a greater yield increasing potential than rr in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions 4 3 precipitation use efficiency and water use efficiency the pue and crop wue are important indicators to evaluate whether crops can use water efficiently in ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms previous studies have shown that rfms can improve pue and wue compared with those of ct dang and qi 2008 liu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhao et al 2012 similarly in the present study the pue increased with hydrothermal gradients in areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions while that in more limited hydrothermal conditions peaked in anding and zhenyuan which indicated that rfms can significantly improve the pue and wue in arid and semi arid regions the above results can be explained by the increase in grain yield due to rfms under different hydrothermal conditions which increased by 23 1 in changwu compared with that in ct and 44 9 and 42 4 in zhenyuan and pengyang respectively and 37 6 and 39 1 in yuanzhou and anding respectively additionally the precipitation during the growth period of each region gradually decreased with the hydrothermal gradient which resulted in the change in pue with the change in hydrothermal conditions ren et al 2010 showed that when the precipitation was 230 340 and 440 mm the wue distribution in furrow planting increased by 82 8 43 1 and 9 5 compared with that in traditional flat cropping crop wue is affected by grain yield and crop evaporation the results of the present study show that the wue under the same hydrothermal conditions decreased in the following order rc rr ct among them rc presented the highest increase in the pue and wue under various hydrothermal conditions especially in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions and the increase was 1 4 1 8 times higher than that of rr in areas with low spring temperatures and uneven precipitation rc presented a great potential for efficient use of more limited precipitation in areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions the pue and wue of rfms increased by 11 5 22 6 and 15 4 25 8 respectively compared with those of ct similar to the results of previous studies ren et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 and increased by 37 3 49 5 and 35 8 57 5 respectively in areas with limited hydrothermal conditions 4 4 economic benefits more than 1276 2102 rmb ha 1 has been invested in labor and machinery as well as plastic film for rfms however in the present study especially in the area with lower precipitation and temperature rfms could have a positive effect on crop grain yield with apparent economic benefits in addition economic benefits are indicators of what farmers are concerned about which makes it easier for local farmers and government agencies to adopt and promote new planting patterns zhang et al 2012 in the present study there were differences in investments between rc and rr mainly due to plastic film cost and the cost of rc was more than half that of rr but rc can result in higher yields and the economic benefits increased compared with that of rr in the area that was more hydrothermally limited although this indicates that the rfms has a higher potential for increasing yield than the traditional bare land there is a lack of attention on plastic film residue due to the large scale use of mulch film to follow the policy to strive for environmentally friendly sustainable green agriculture future studies should consider the biodegradable biofilm and recyclable plastic film to alleviate soil degradation as long term mulching is adopted steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016b 5 conclusions ridge furrow plastic mulching management successfully improved the attainable grain yield economic benefits and wue in rainfed areas that are more hydrothermally limited but was less effective in areas that are less hydrothermally limited in arid and semi arid rainfed agriculture areas the yield increasing effect of rfms in maize varied with hydrothermal conditions rc showed a higher yield potential in areas with more hydrothermally limited conditions whereas there was no significant difference compared with rr in areas under less hydrothermally limited conditions different rfms treatments have different levels of ability for regulating soil hydrothermal conditions based on the results of the present study we can recommend the most suitable rfms in the area by different hydrothermal conditions during the crop growing period we recommend using rc in rainfed agricultural areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions and rr in rainfed agricultural areas where the hydrothermal conditions are less limited our results combine the rfms with hydrothermal conditions optimize the rfms and provide technical support for producing high and

10681,the ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms is considered an effective strategy to improve grain yield and has been widely used in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural areas however the key mechanism by which rfms increases yield and efficiency under different hydrothermal conditions remains unclear understanding this mechanism and the interaction between different rfmss and hydrothermal conditions could provide a practical reference for optimizing cultivation we aimed to investigate the yield increase potential of different planting systems under the same hydrothermal conditions and evaluate the effects of rfms treatments on drought resistance and yield increase under different hydrothermal conditions the following planting treatments were carried out in ridge furrow prepared fields under seven different hydrothermal conditions in a representative rainfed agricultural area for four consecutive years 1 ridge furrow mulching system with complete coverage rc 2 ridge furrow mulching system with ridge coverage rr and 3 planting without mulching control treatment ct compared with ct rfms improved field hydrothermal conditions and reduced evapotranspiration of crops in more hydrothermally limited areas precipitation 196 320 mm temperature 18 c the grain yield and water use efficiency wue with rc significantly increased by 49 95 and 57 12 compared with that of ct respectively however rr and rc had no significant difference in grain yield and wue in areas less hydrothermally limited precipitation 320 460 mm temperature 18 6 c 23 6 c but increased by 13 51 and 22 19 compared with that of ct additionally rfms improved economic benefits especially in hydrothermally limited areas with rc increasing benefits by 142 64 200 84 compared with that of ct therefore rc can be used as the optimal technique to overcome simultaneous drought and cold weather in rainfed agricultural areas under hydrothermally limited conditions keywords ridge furrow mulching system hydrothermal conditions maize yield aboveground biomass water use economic benefit 1 introduction in recent years the atmospheric concentration of co2 globally has been rapidly increasing owing to industrialization and field crop production the atmospheric co2 concentration is expected to reach 550 μmol mol 1 in the mid 21st century prentice et al 2001 increasing atmospheric co2 concentration has exacerbated global warming affecting the amount and patterns of precipitation resulting in increased water demand for ecological and agricultural production qin 2002 with increasing population and the continuous development of industrial and agricultural production water shortages will become a global problem and the gap between supply and demand of agricultural water will further increase shen and su 1998 under the dual pressure of water shortage and population growth ensuring food security will be a major issue in the future parry et al 2005 currently grain production in irrigated areas has reached high and stable levels thus it is difficult to further increase the total grain yield by increasing per unit area yield of districts with only traditional irrigation wang et al 2015a b besides semiarid and arid rainfed agricultural areas comprise 41 of all global land area and provide food to 38 of the global population reynolds et al 2007 therefore the development of rainfed agriculture will be the main approach and it is of great significance to ensure future food security in china and worldwide in rainfed agricultural production natural precipitation is the main source of water available for crops decreasing production of several crops has been attributed to relatively scarce water resources uneven spatial and temporal distribution of natural precipitation and even altered precipitation period and crop water demand period consequently most of the precipitation is lost through surface runoff and ineffective evaporation in most rainfed areas with less precipitation chen et al 2012 ren et al 2016 2017 to effectively overcome these problems several farming practices and water storage technologies have been developed and applied to restrict water loss improve precipitation utilization and water production efficiency reduce inefficient evaporation in the field and thereby enhance crop drought resistance and grain yield in water scarce areas bu et al 2013 li et al 2013 zhou et al 2009 ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms has received global attention owing to the advantages of enhancing natural precipitation especially in areas with 5 mm rainfall and increasing infiltration and maintaining moisture furthermore rfms has the potential to improve soil temperature mo et al 2017 ren et al 2016 van der werf et al 2010 zhang et al 2017a although several field studies have confirmed that the ridge furrow plastic mulching technique can increase the yield and water use efficiency wue of crops there is yet to be conclusive evidence suggesting that this technique reflects a better strategy for significantly improving yield and wue under different hydrothermal conditions currently it is difficult to implement cross regional multi year and multi point field trials owing to human and material constraints and unpredictable climatic conditions in addition to greenhouse studies different studies have been conducted with artificial setups of different rainfall conditions ren et al 2008 2010 a few studies have compared water harvesting effects and mechanisms in regions under different hydrothermal conditions however the relationship between the yield increase of different crops and regional hydrothermal conditions remains unclear ren et al 2017 therefore in the present study we established spring maize crops in seven typical rainfed agricultural areas with different hydrothermal gradients in northwest china from 2014 to 2017 and hypothesized that different rfms would have different effects on maize production under different hydrothermal conditions the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the potential to increase yield among different planting systems under the same hydrothermal conditions 2 evaluate the effects of rfms treatments on drought resistance and yield increase under different hydrothermal conditions and 3 suggest promising patterns for dryland maize production in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural areas under different hydrothermal conditions as well as other areas with similar climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of experimental sites field experiments were conducted in seven sites in shaanxi gansu and ningxia provinces china varying in altitude temperature and precipitation namely yangling yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding fig 1 table 1 the altitude of these seven sites increased from yangling 521 m through yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang and yuanzhou to anding 1970 m fig 1 a the mean annual precipitation fig 1 b mean temperature fig 1 c and forest free period fig 1 d 1980 2010 decreased from yangling 660 mm 12 90 c and 210 d through yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang and yuanzhou to anding 400 mm 6 20 c and 150 d based on previous research zhang et al 2018 ye and liu 2012 30 years of mean annual precipitation and air temperature data from various regions yangling yongshou and changwu were divided into areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions i e conditions that limited crop growth less under traditional planting hydrothermal refers to the temperature and precipitation in different areas working together in the environment to affect crop growth zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding were divided into areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions i e conditions that limited crop growth more under traditional planting to unify the time of analysis and progress a 1 year ripe cropping system was used in the different areas in each site the experiments were conducted in a flat field at the same level of fertility with similar loamy texture soil that had been cropped for several years the soil physical and chemical properties in the seven regions in 2014 are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized complete block design was employed in the study three treatments with three replicates were used 1 ridge furrow mulching systems with complete coverage rc fig 2 a 2 ridge furrow mulching systems with ridge coverage rr fig 2 b 3 planting without mulching as the control treatment ct fig 2 c the experiment was conducted in a ridge furrow field with a relatively uniform base fertility basal fertilizers n 300 kg ha 1 p2o5 150 kg ha 1 and k2o 150 kg ha 1 were broadcasted over the soil and turned over by plowing to transfer it to the subsurface and then the rfms was set up as shown in fig 2 rfms was formed by alternating ridges 0 6 m wide and 0 15 m high and furrows 0 6 m wide with film mulching a transparent polyethylene sheet 0 8 m wide and 0 008 mm thick was applied to cover the entire soil surface of a plot before sowing nine plots 3 planting patterns 3 replications were established each of which was 30 m 10 m in dimension the study was carried out continuously for 4 years 2014 2017 the annual sowing time was in late april according to the water temperature conditions in different regions the harvest time was early september and late september the higher the altitude the later the harvest the seeds of xianyu 335 a local variety with strong resistance and adaptability were sown using hole sowing machine at a planting density of 75 000 plant ha 1 an additional n fertilizer pure n at 150 kg ha 1 concentration was applied as top dressing by a hole fertilizing machine between two maize plants approximately 40 days after the sowing after the annual harvest plowing was carried out and ridge furrow film mulching was carried out in the spring of the subsequent year during the whole growth process of spring maize no irrigation was applied but weeding and pest control were carried out at various growth stages of crop growth precipitation and mean air temperature data of each experimental site were obtained daily from the nearest weather station 10 km away from the experimental field in each site 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 soil water content swc soil water storage

origin lab northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 hydrothermal conditions during the study period precipitation varied significantly among years in each site fig 3 and the average annual precipitation during the growing period was 370 363 351 348 315 343 and 268 mm in yangling yongshou changwu zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding respectively the proportion of effective precipitation and contribution of effective precipitation to average precipitation during the growing period were the highest in yangling 31 3 and 78 7 respectively which were 4 3 10 1 and 3 4 19 8 higher than those in the other regions however the proportion of micro effect and ineffective precipitation was larger than that of effective precipitation but its contribution in each experimental site was only 21 3 27 5 among the sites ineffective precipitation in anding accounted for a large proportion of the precipitation 41 1 the differences in soil moisture effects varied with different rfms treatments which showed different trends during the growth period of crops under different hydrothermal conditions from sowing in 2014 to harvest in 2017 fig 4 the soil moisture before sowing in each site gradually decreased with the hydrothermal gradient it was higher in yangling yongshou and changwu where the hydrothermal conditions are not restricted and the difference in soil water storage during the growing period soil moisture before sowing soil moisture after harvest was positive the soil moisture in the other sites with more limited hydrothermal conditions pengyang yuanzhou and anding showed negative values and the evapotranspiration of crops during each treatment period was the lowest in the rc treatment maize was planted throughout the year in yangling and yongshou however in areas such as pengyang yuanzhou and anding the cultivation of maize has been widely promoted the average annual temperature of the experimental sites in 2014 2017 was consistent fig 5 both average daily minimum temperature and average temperature from 0 to 30 days after sowing decreased with increasing altitude in each site with an average of 12 03 c and 17 38 c respectively in yangling which was 2 5 c 6 98 c and 1 11 c 5 9 c higher than that in the other regions and 9 53 c and 16 27 c in yongshou which was 1 68 4 48 c and 1 89 4 80 c higher than that in the other regions the total effective accumulated air temperature 10 c during the 4 year average maize growth period in each site showed a decreasing trend with increasing altitude fig 6 furthermore from 0 to 30 days after sowing the difference in total effective accumulated air temperature in each area was significant and it was significantly higher in yangling than in the other areas by 25 5 90 1 in pengyang yuanzhou and anding occasionally extreme temperatures affect seed germination emergence and seedling growth but the temperature does not become a major factor limiting the maize vegetative growth stage in yangling and yongshou as the growth period progresses the effective accumulated temperature difference in each site decreased after 90 120 days of sowing the maize entered the silking filling stage and the annual average daily maximum temperature and annual average temperature were 32 05 c and 27 45 c respectively in yangling which were higher than those in the other regions by 7 6 32 3 and 10 5 39 4 respectively 3 2 maize yield aboveground biomass and harvest index rfms increased maize grain yield and aboveground biomass significantly in this 4 year continuous study the grain yield and aboveground biomass changed similarly to the hydrothermal gradient under both more and less hydrothermally limited conditions fig 7 a and b moreover their increase in rfms treatments improved with the hydrothermal gradient fig 8 a and b compared with that of ct rc and rr treatments increased grain yield by 15 0 29 8 and 8 5 16 5 in areas where hydrothermal conditions are less limited respectively and it was increased by 45 5 52 3 and 28 3 37 5 in more hydrothermally limited areas similarly rc and rr treatments increased aboveground biomass by 19 2 36 4 and 9 7 17 0 in areas where hydrothermal conditions are less limited respectively and it was increased by 36 7 45 4 and 23 2 34 4 in more hydrothermally limited areas with increasing altitude the maize grain yield and aboveground biomass under rc treatment increased by 5 9 16 8 and 8 2 17 2 compared with that under the rr treatment respectively however the increase with each rfms treatment under the less hydrothermally limited conditions did not reach a significant level compared with that under more hydrothermally limited conditions but both were significantly higher than those of ct influenced by crop yield and aboveground biomass the harvest index of different planting patterns under different hydrothermal conditions was significantly different fig 7 c the harvest index of rc continued to increase with the hydrothermal gradient whereas that under rr and ct increased initially and then decreased in areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions such as yangling yongshou and changwu the increase in aboveground biomass in rfms was higher than the grain yield resulting in an average reduction in harvest index of 2 2 2 4 compared with that of ct among them rc increased the grain yield and aboveground biomass in all treatments and its harvest index decreased significantly by 3 5 4 9 in addition the harvest index of rr only decreased by 0 1 1 0 which was not significant conversely in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding the harvest index increased by an average of 3 1 6 7 the rc treatment harvest index increased significantly by an average of 4 3 9 3 whereas that of rr treatment increased by 1 9 4 1 which was significant in yuanzhou and anding 3 3 precipitation use efficiency and water use efficiency rfms improved the pue fig 9 a under different hydrothermal conditions the pue decreased in the following order rc rr ct from yangling to anding the pue showed a gradual increase under rfms and the increase improved with the hydrothermal gradient in yangling yongshou and changwu where hydrothermal conditions are less limited rfms increased the pue by an average of 11 5 22 6 specifically the pue of rc and rr increased by an average of 14 7 29 0 and 8 4 16 1 respectively compared with that of ct but the difference was not significant in zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding where the hydrothermal conditions are more limited the annual pue of the rfms increased significantly by 37 3 49 5 the pue of rc increased by 10 9 18 7 compared with that of rr and there was no significant difference the average annual pue of rc and rr was the lowest in yuanzhou which was 26 6 and 24 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the highest in anding which was 30 9 and 26 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively crop wue was affected by grain yield and evapotranspiration during growth period the wue showed the same trend as the pue in different planting modes fig 9 b that is rc rr ct under less limited hydrothermal conditions the annual average wue in rfms with hydrothermal gradient increased by 15 4 25 8 and 16 7 respectively compared with ct among them the wue of rc increased by 1 3 9 2 compared with the average annual wue of rr and the difference did not reach a significant level in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions rfms increased by an average of 35 8 57 5 compared with that of ct and the average annual wue of rc was the lowest in yongshou and the highest in anding 25 1 and 31 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively the wue of rr was the lowest in yangling which was 24 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the highest in zhenyuan 26 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 3 4 economic benefits the agricultural input cost of rc and rr was 23 42 2102 rmb ha 1 and 14 22 1276 rmb ha 1 higher than that of ct respectively although rfms increased the cost of agricultural inputs table 2 the economic benefits were significantly improved in areas where hydrothermal conditions were less limited the difference in synergy between rc and rr was negligible which was 6 28 42 69 495 2162 rmb ha 1 and 2 43 32 56 191 1156 rmb ha 1 respectively but in areas with more hydrothermally limited conditions each treatment was considerably different the synergy was the most obvious under rc treatment which was 14 89 43 13 875 1344 rmb ha 1 and 142 64 200 84 2977 3969 rmb ha 1 higher than that under rr and ct respectively in addition rfms also increased the ratio of production to investment in more hydrothermally limited areas with an increase of 17 30 22 86 and 11 91 20 10 under rc and rr treatments respectively compared with ct 4 discussion 4 1 hydrothermal conditions at present ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms increased soil temperature has become the consensus of experts compared to traditional flat cropping and there have been many studies on the use of the ridge furrow mulching system to improve soil temperature some articles with similar or identical experimental areas and treatments showed that rfms hydrothermal conditions to regulate the growth environment of maize zhang et al 2019 li et al 2020 yin et al 2019 qin et al 2018 in short it can be concluded that rfms increased soil temperature to regulate the growth environment of maize in the present study the effect of ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms on crop production varied with soil type climatic conditions and crop growth period previous studies have shown that rfms has the following advantages over traditional flat planting shortening the growth period of maize and increasing yield and wue li et al 2017 qin et al 2018 ren et al 2010 similar to the results of previous studies in areas where hydrothermal conditions are less limited the temperature was relatively high and the evapotranspiration was high soil water storage after maturity was lower than that before sowing and therefore the difference in soil water storage during the growing period of crops was positive and with the precipitation gradient the evapotranspiration of crops showed a decreasing trend in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions zhenyuan pengyang yuanzhou and anding the application of rfms is more extensive gao et al 2012 li et al 2016 rfms increases the amount of crop evapotranspiration wang et al 2015a 2008 in the present study the evapotranspiration of crops under the same hydrothermal condition was the lowest in the rc treatment because rc collected rainwater and rc presented the best water storage and preservation effect among all treatments in addition owing to the surface coverage with the plastic film ineffective evaporation of soil water was reduced therefore the soil water storage in the 0 200 cm layer during the mature period was higher than that in other treatments furthermore the difference in soil water storage during the growth period was negative thus under different hydrothermal conditions the evapotranspiration of crops was lower than that under ct which was the lowest at 6 57 mm in anding and the highest at 25 mm in zhenyuan and with increasing hydrothermal gradient the evapotranspiration of crops showed a decreasing trend 4 2 maize yield and water use efficiency rfms has a greater potential to increase production and alleviate the effects of low temperature in spring and drought stress in maize production especially at the primary stage of its growth and development as well as in the period in which reproductive organs are established zhang et al 2018 recent studies have shown that rfms has been actively promoted and widely used in high altitude areas of the loess plateau to exploit its advantages to achieve higher yield liu et al 2009 2014a wang et al 2016b ye and liu 2012 zhou et al 2015 in our experiment the grain yield of ct was greatly affected by hydrothermal conditions showing a general downward trend along with hydrothermal gradient and yields corresponded to hydrothermal conditions with the highest in yangling and the lowest in anding the maize grain yield of ct in different areas was significantly different and the difference was more evident in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions compared to rfms treatments rfms continued to increase production in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions and less limited hydrothermal conditions but increased production in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions gong et al 2015 li et al 2004a 2016 liu et al 2014b 2014c wang et al 2016b among them rc presented improved hydrothermal conditions and adjusted plant growth ability increasing grain yield and aboveground biomass compared with those of ct which were greater than those of rr and the difference between rc and rr increased with the increase in hydrothermal gradient the results showed that when the annual precipitation was 196 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 15 c 18 c rc had a higher yield potential than that of rr and with increasing precipitation and temperature the difference between rc and ct gradually reduced however the difference between rr and ct was significantly greater than that of rc when the annual precipitation was 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 18 c indicating that temperature is no longer a key factor limiting crop growth furthermore the effect of uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation on crop production was mitigated by rr the current study found that rc had no obvious effect on increasing grain yield under hydrothermally more limited conditions owing to the temperature not favoring maize flower bud differentiation and pollination because of occasionally persistent high temperature and dry weather consequently rc had a direct effect on grain filling and yield formation in the later stage but this situation rarely occurred in the other areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions and rc showed a greater potential for increased production in addition rfms promoted the growth of shoots above and belowground by improving soil hydrothermal conditions wang et al 2016 the increasing trend of biomass under different hydrothermal conditions was consistent with the grain yield trend however the increase in aboveground biomass was 2 3 times higher than that of grain yield when the annual precipitation was 196 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 15 c 18 c the increase in rc harvest index was higher than rr and rr showed a strong advantage when the annual precipitation was 320 mm and the annual average temperature was 18 c these results indicate that rc has a greater yield increasing potential than rr in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions 4 3 precipitation use efficiency and water use efficiency the pue and crop wue are important indicators to evaluate whether crops can use water efficiently in ridge furrow mulching system with plastic film rfms previous studies have shown that rfms can improve pue and wue compared with those of ct dang and qi 2008 liu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 zhang et al 2017a zhao et al 2012 similarly in the present study the pue increased with hydrothermal gradients in areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions while that in more limited hydrothermal conditions peaked in anding and zhenyuan which indicated that rfms can significantly improve the pue and wue in arid and semi arid regions the above results can be explained by the increase in grain yield due to rfms under different hydrothermal conditions which increased by 23 1 in changwu compared with that in ct and 44 9 and 42 4 in zhenyuan and pengyang respectively and 37 6 and 39 1 in yuanzhou and anding respectively additionally the precipitation during the growth period of each region gradually decreased with the hydrothermal gradient which resulted in the change in pue with the change in hydrothermal conditions ren et al 2010 showed that when the precipitation was 230 340 and 440 mm the wue distribution in furrow planting increased by 82 8 43 1 and 9 5 compared with that in traditional flat cropping crop wue is affected by grain yield and crop evaporation the results of the present study show that the wue under the same hydrothermal conditions decreased in the following order rc rr ct among them rc presented the highest increase in the pue and wue under various hydrothermal conditions especially in areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions and the increase was 1 4 1 8 times higher than that of rr in areas with low spring temperatures and uneven precipitation rc presented a great potential for efficient use of more limited precipitation in areas with less limited hydrothermal conditions the pue and wue of rfms increased by 11 5 22 6 and 15 4 25 8 respectively compared with those of ct similar to the results of previous studies ren et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 and increased by 37 3 49 5 and 35 8 57 5 respectively in areas with limited hydrothermal conditions 4 4 economic benefits more than 1276 2102 rmb ha 1 has been invested in labor and machinery as well as plastic film for rfms however in the present study especially in the area with lower precipitation and temperature rfms could have a positive effect on crop grain yield with apparent economic benefits in addition economic benefits are indicators of what farmers are concerned about which makes it easier for local farmers and government agencies to adopt and promote new planting patterns zhang et al 2012 in the present study there were differences in investments between rc and rr mainly due to plastic film cost and the cost of rc was more than half that of rr but rc can result in higher yields and the economic benefits increased compared with that of rr in the area that was more hydrothermally limited although this indicates that the rfms has a higher potential for increasing yield than the traditional bare land there is a lack of attention on plastic film residue due to the large scale use of mulch film to follow the policy to strive for environmentally friendly sustainable green agriculture future studies should consider the biodegradable biofilm and recyclable plastic film to alleviate soil degradation as long term mulching is adopted steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016b 5 conclusions ridge furrow plastic mulching management successfully improved the attainable grain yield economic benefits and wue in rainfed areas that are more hydrothermally limited but was less effective in areas that are less hydrothermally limited in arid and semi arid rainfed agriculture areas the yield increasing effect of rfms in maize varied with hydrothermal conditions rc showed a higher yield potential in areas with more hydrothermally limited conditions whereas there was no significant difference compared with rr in areas under less hydrothermally limited conditions different rfms treatments have different levels of ability for regulating soil hydrothermal conditions based on the results of the present study we can recommend the most suitable rfms in the area by different hydrothermal conditions during the crop growing period we recommend using rc in rainfed agricultural areas with more limited hydrothermal conditions and rr in rainfed agricultural areas where the hydrothermal conditions are less limited our results combine the rfms with hydrothermal conditions optimize the rfms and provide technical support for producing high and stable grain yields in arid and semi arid rainfed farming areas which can contribute to ensuring food security in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10682,intensive agricultural activities especially in artificially drained agricultural landscapes generate a considerable amount of nutrient export which has been identified as a primary cause of water quality impairment several management practices have been developed and installed in agricultural watersheds to reduce nutrient export e g nitrate nitrogen no3 n although published research reported considerable water quality benefits of these practices there exist many unanswered questions regarding the inherent processes and mechanisms that control nitrate fate and transport from drained agricultural landscape to advance our understanding of processes and mechanisms we deployed two high frequency sampling systems in a drained agricultural field to investigate the relationship between agricultural drainage and nitrate concentrations c q relationship results indicated that the high frequency measuring system was able to capture the rapidly changing c q relationships at the experimental site e g hysteresis patterns the 22 identified storm events exhibited anti clockwise behavior with high variability of flushing dilution effects in addition high drainage flows contributed far more nitrate loading compared with lower flows for instance the top 10 of drainage flow exported more than 50 of the nitrate lost via subsurface drainage during the monitoring period additionally we observed that animal waste application was the most influential practice to change the c q relationship by increasing the size of soil nitrogen pools the insights obtained from the high frequency water quality measurements could help provide practical suggestions regarding the design and management of conservation practices such as controlled drainage bioreactors and saturated buffers to improve their nitrogen removal efficiencies this subsequently leads to better nutrient management in drained agricultural lands keywords animal waste application c q relationship agricultural water management practices 1 introduction nutrient export from drained agricultural fields especially nitrate nitrogen no3 n has been widely recognized as one of the major causes of surface water quality impairment christianson and harmel 2015 goolsby et al 2000 king et al 2015 poole et al 2018 rabalais et al 2014 skaggs et al 1994 zhao et al 2019 researchers have been extensively investigating the fate and transport of nitrate at spatial scales varying from field to river basin baffaut et al 2015 basu et al 2011 g arnold et al 2015 moatar et al 2017 thompson et al 2011 management practices have been developed to reduce nitrate loading from artificially drained agricultural landscapes including controlled drainage e g evans and skaggs 2004 denitrifying bioreactors e g schipper et al 2010 saturated buffers e g jaynes and isenhart 2014 and drainage water recycling e g reinhart et al 2016 although considerable progress has been made towards understanding the effect of these conservation practices on nitrogen fate and transport in artificially drained cropland there still exist many unanswered questions youssef et al 2018 researchers reported large variations in the performance of these practices for reducing nitrate export the relationship between the performance of these practices and field conditions e g climate patterns soil type drainage system design and management are not clearly understood addy et al 2016 saadat et al 2018 skaggs et al 2010 in addition because of the complicated processes and mechanisms at play the integrated effects of multiple management practices require further analysis christianson et al 2018 with the emerging use of in situ water quality sensors researchers gained more access to high frequency water quality measurements in riverine systems blaen et al 2016 butturini et al 2006 rode et al 2016 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 high frequency measurements have generated data that provided insights of the hydro biochemical processes controlling nitrate export from agricultural watersheds williams et al 2018 additionally high frequency sampling with well calibrated equipment enabled researchers to more accurately determine the nutrient export to receiving water bodies ockenden et al 2017 pellerin et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 using high frequency in situ measurements from a headwater agricultural catchment in uk blaen et al 2017 identified precipitation intensity and antecedent condition as key drivers for the mechanisms and transport of nitrogen during storm events additionally blaen et al 2017 reported that the different active zones for nitrogen sources were highly dynamic depending on event based conditions based on high frequency measurements of discharge and nitrate nitrogen concentration no3 n at multiple locations in the stream networks jones et al 2018 found that the majority of nitrate entering the streams was transported to downstream water bodies due to the limited capacity of nitrate removal by microbes or aquatic organisms in addition to the insights from data analysis of high frequency measurements cooper et al 2018 developed conceptual models to infer the effects of hydrogeological processes on water pollution and thus implied the effects of agricultural management practices e g winter cover crops and reduced tillage on reducing negative impacts of agricultural activities clearly the use of high frequency water quality monitoring approaches in riverine systems generated data that advanced our understanding of unanswered questions about nutrient dynamics at watershed scale jomaa et al 2018 reynolds et al 2016 the successful application of high frequency monitoring in river systems suggests that it can be used in field scale investigations in this paper we aim to demonstrate the use of high frequency monitoring to advance the understanding of hydro biogeochemical processes in a drained agricultural field by investigating the no3 n coupled with drainage flow measurements at a high temporal resolution an hourly interval high frequency measurements are analyzed to evaluate the temporal evolution of nitrate export processes we discuss the practical implications of our study regarding the performance of agricultural management practices for reducing nitrogen loss from drained agricultural landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental procedure the 14 month january 2017 march 2018 experimental study was conducted at an artificially drained pasture field located in the north carolina lower coastal plain united states latitude 35 853143 longitude 76 658643 the soil on the field is a cape fear loam fine mixed semiactive typical umbraquualt which is poorly drained under natural conditions subsurface drainage pipes were installed at a depth of 1 0 m and spacing of 12 5 m the drain outlet was operated in free drainage the pasture field was irrigated by hog wastewater from an adjacent lagoon fig 1 prior to the beginning of the study january 2017 wastewater had been applied to the field at agronomic levels liu et al 2019 for the first ten months of the study wastewater was not applied to the field later wastewater was applied four times in november 2017 no other wastewater application occurred until the end of the study in march 2018 rainfall was measured using two tipping bucket automatic rain gauges which were regularly calibrated using a manual rain gauge as a reference two water table monitoring wells equipped with water level sensors hobo u20 onset at bourne ma u s were installed midway between two subsurface drains to determine nutrient loads in drainage water a teledyne isco auto sampler was installed at the outlet of each instrumented drain line to take flow proportional composite drainage water quality samples water samples were collected roughly every two weeks and sent to laboratory for chemical analysis in addition two high frequency sampling systems were installed to monitor no3 n in drainage water at the edge of the field and in shallow groundwater between two subsurface drain lines fig 1 further information regarding the high frequency measurement including the calibration of the in situ sensor is provided by liu 2019 and liu et al 2020 the experimental site is described in detail by liu 2017 liu et al 2019 and youssef et al 2016 2 1 1 high frequency measurement of drainage flow and drainage water quality sampling at the field edge drainage flow and nitrate concentration were measured at fine temporal resolutions of 15 and 45 min respectively a 22 5 v notch weir was installed along with a pressure transducer cs451 campbell at logan ut u s inside a water level control structure located at the outlet of each drain line to measure drainage flux fig 1 we also implemented a high frequency sampling system by coupling a multi point sampler mps with an in situ spectrophotometer spectro lysertm s can at vienna austria to monitor no3 n birgand et al 2016 every 45 min at each measuring event the mps pumped water to rinse the whole sampling system fed fresh water for water quality sensor to take measurements and then purged the water to disposal after each sampling event an oxalic acid solution from an acid rinse container was pumped to fill the quartz cuvette to help reduce the optical fouling of the spectrophotometer caused by high iron concentration null air measurements and acid rising were employed for quality assurance quality control further details regarding high frequency measurement equipment are available in liu et al 2020 2 1 2 high frequency water quality sampling of shallow groundwater similar to the high frequency sampling system at the field edge we installed an mps coupled with an in situ spectrophotometer to take high frequency shallow groundwater quality measurements from different locations in the field and at different depths nine groundwater quality sampling wells were installed at three depths 0 8 m 1 0 m 1 2 m and three distances from the experimental drain line 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m a 10th groundwater well was installed at a depth of 1 7 m and a distance of 0 5 m each groundwater well had a short screened length 7 cm at the specified well depth to enable drawing point water samples the mps was set to take a measurement every six minutes and thus each groundwater well was measured at the interval of one hour the system for high frequency monitoring of no3 n in shallow groundwater is described in detail in s1 of supplemental materials i sm i and by liu et al 2020 2 2 analysis of no3 n and drainage flow relationship c q relationship at event scale 2 2 1 event delineation we defined events as the time period with rapid change in drainage flow after a rainfall event or animal waste irrigation event the starting point of an event was defined as the point in time at which an abrupt increase in drainage flow occurred at least 20 increase compared with baseflow the event ended either when the drainage flow returned to the initial value or when another event identified by another abrupt change of flow started during an event there should exist at least three data points in the rising limb otherwise data from the event were discarded furthermore qualified events should have more than 1 0 cm d 1 of peak flow except when this event was triggered by an animal waste irrigation applying these criteria we identified 22 events with high frequency hydrological and no3 n measurements to analyze the event based c q relationships of the 22 events nine occurred before the starting of the animal waste application and eleven occurred after the application 2 2 2 quantifying the hysteresis patterns of nitrate c q relationship to compare event based c q relationships among different events the measurements of drainage flow and no3 n were normalized into 0 1 within the event equation s 1 s 2 in sm i with normalized measurements we calculated the storm hysteresis index hi to quantify the direction and strength of hysteresis effect as follows c e m lloyd et al 2016a b 1 h i i 1 n c i r i s i n g c i f a l l i n g n where h i is the storm hysteresis index c i r i s i n g and c i f a l l i n g are the normalized no3 n at the i t h segments of rising and falling limbs respectively n is the scaling factor to separate the segments of rising or falling limbs of actual measurements n 12 in this study if there is no data point for a certain segment a concentration value is estimated for this segment by linear interpolation of concentration values associated with neighboring segments since hi calculations are based on normalized concentration values 0 1 the resulting values of hi range from 1 to 1 the sign of hi indicates the direction of hysteresis loops while the absolute value of hi represents the strength of hysteresis loops positive hysteresis loops mean that the peak of no3 n occurs before the peak of drainage flow and vice versa in addition to storm hysteresis index we calculated storm flushing index fi to quantify the flushing dilution effects of events as follows vaughan et al 2017 2 f i c q p e a k r i s i n g c 0 r i s i n g where f i is the storm flushing index c 0 r i s i n g and c q p e a k r i s i n g are the normalized no3 n at the beginning of the event and at the peak flow of the rising limb respectively as the no3 n was normalized the values of flushing index ranged from 1 to 1 depending on the slope of the hysteresis loops a positive flushing index represents flushing effect that is identified by higher no3 n in drainage flow during the event compared with baseflow conversely a negative value of fi indicates a dilution effect of the event in addition to the hi and fi metrics we calculated other metrics that characterize event hydrographs and chemographs table s1 these metrics describe antecedent conditions prior to the event as well as the hydrological and biogeochemical features of the event the correlation between these metrics and hysteresis metrics were analyzed using spearman s rho correlation analysis 2 3 quantifying the contribution of nitrate export at different drainage flow with the high frequency measurements of drainage flow and no3 n over 8000 data points we were able to divide the instantaneous discharge values non normalized into equal range segments of flow rates and estimate the frequency at which every measured drainage flow range segment occurred we generated an empirical frequency distribution efd of drainage flow measurements we also calculated the nitrate export for every drainage flow measurement equation s 3 s 4 in sm i by compiling the overall nitrate export from all flow measurements we quantified the contribution of different flow segments to the overall nitrate export from the field further details of the analysis are given in s3 of sm i 2 4 statistical analysis in this study we used kruskal wallis to test whether the hysteresis metrics hi and fi are identical or not before and after the starting of animal waste application in november 2017 kruskal wallis test k w test is a non parametric method to test identical populations when the dataset does not meet the assumption of normality breslow 1970 we also conducted spearman s rho test to evaluate the correlation between hysteresis metrics and other descriptors table s1 to provide insights on key processes controlling the nitrate c q relationship for this drained agricultural field spearman s rho ρ test is a non parametric rank based method to quantify the correlation relationship of two variables a descriptor with a stronger and significant correlation coefficient would show more influence on hysteresis patterns revelle 2017 3 results 3 1 overall description of field measurements fig 2 shows the measured precipitation water table depth wtd subsurface drainage flow and no3 n in drainage water during the monitoring period spanning january 2017 march 2018 the total precipitation was 155 6 cm long term normal 161 3 cm nearly half of the precipitation 68 6 cm compared to normal of 53 3 cm happened in the four months from may to august 2017 in november 2017 there was 2 4 cm of precipitation during the whole month normal for november is 9 0 cm while there was 38 5 cm rainfall in the four months from december 2017 to march 2018 normal for period is 37 8 cm the research field had a rapid hydrologic response to precipitation characterized by a quick rise in the groundwater table and drainage flow generation measured water table depth ranged from nearly at the soil surface 0 02 m to 1 1 m the mean value and standard deviation of water table depths were 0 83 0 15 m subsurface drainage flow increased shortly after precipitation and then returned to baseflow in 2 3 days the recorded mean drainage flow was 0 22 cm day 1 while the median flow was 0 13 cm day 1 our results showed high variability in measured hourly no3 n the hourly no3 n in drainage water measured by the in situ sensor varied from 0 to 23 37 mg n l 1 with mean and median concentrations of 5 75 and 3 92 mg n l 1 respectively due to the malfunctioning of the in situ monitoring system some of the measurements were missing in spring and summer excluding the periods of missing data high frequency measurements of both hourly flow and no3 n were available in 78 of the 427 day monitoring period in november 2017 liquid animal manure from the nearby hog lagoon was applied to the research field four times adding a total of 6 27 cm of water orange bars in fig 2a most of the nitrogen in the applied manure was in organic form 152 93 mg n l 1 and nh4 n form 147 83 mg n l 1 as the average no3 n in applied manure was 1 11 mg n l 1 table s2 in this study the period before the first animal waste application on nov 2nd 2017 was referred to as pre irrigation period while the remaining period was referred to as post irrigation period during the monitoring period we delineated 22 events with enough drainage flow and no3 n measurements for further analysis events with at least three data points in rising or falling limbs see zuecco et al 2016 these drainage events were relatively flashy and occurred quickly in response to precipitation or irrigation precipitation triggered 19 of these events while the remaining three events occurred in november 2017 after animal waste applications denoted in fig 2a the mean duration of events was 38 3 h with the rising limb occurring on average over approximately 6 h duration in addition to flashiness the events showed considerable differences in hydrogeochemical characteristics such as drainage flow no3 n and nitrate mass loading table 1 and supplemental material for example the average value of mean no3 n within each event was 8 36 mg n l 1 while the corresponding range was 2 30 13 76 mg n l 1 additionally the event based nitrate loading varied from 0 003 to 1 36 kg n ha 1 with the median and mean values of 0 07 and 0 23 kg n ha 1 respectively 3 2 hysteresis patterns observed from in situ high frequency measurements anti clockwise hysteresis patterns negative hi values were mostly observed in the relationships between no3 n and subsurface drainage c q relationship during events however the flushing dilution effects were more dynamic table 1 fig 3 and supplemental materials ii the mean and median values of hi were 0 28 and 0 31 respectively only event 5 e5 in fig 3 exhibited positive hi a clockwise loop while the remaining events exhibited either non hysteresis or anti clockwise behaviors the fi quantifying the flushing dilution effects ranged from 0 85 to 1 with a tendency to flush more nitrate during events e g mean fi 0 43 for event e4 we observe a positive slope in the c q hysteresis loop indicating a flushing effect during the rising limb fig 3 in contrast the fi of the hysteresis loop for event e20 was lower than zero indicating a dilution effect fig 3 3 3 high temporal variability in nitrate export via subsurface drainage 3 3 1 contribution of different drainage flow rates to nitrate export the analysis of the drainage and concentration data over the monitoring period clearly indicated that the majority of nitrate export from the field occurred during high drainage flow fig 4 as the drainage flow rate increases the nitrate export via drainage water increases the highest drainage flow drainage flow rate 1 93 cm day 1 representing only 1 4 of total drainage carried 25 of the total nitrate export during the monitoring period in contrast the lowest drainage flows mostly categorized as baseflow exported substantially less nitrate compared with high flows for example 25 of nitrate was carried off the field by drainage flows less than 1 cm day 1 which represent approximately 70 of the total drainage flow 3 3 2 double mass curve of cumulative water yield and nitrate export in the relationship between cumulative water yield and cumulative nitrate export fig 5 we observed two abrupt change points during the measuring period the first abrupt change happened in late april or early may of 2017 when the farm crew tilled the field and replanted grass in late spring may 1st 2017 the flow weighted no3 n changed from 3 9 to 5 5 mg n l 1 the second change point appeared in december 2017 after four animal waste irrigation events during the previous month the flow weighted no3 n increased to around 12 5 mg n l 1 and leveled off until the end of the measuring period late mar 2018 we observed a lag period three to four weeks between the first manure application and the second abrupt increase of the double mass curve 3 4 nitrate spatio temporal dynamics in shallow groundwater during storm events pre and post animal waste application on august 24 2017 and february 9 2018 we measured water table depth and nitrate dynamics from multiple locations in shallow groundwater in response to precipitation events fig 6 the august event precipitation 4 9 cm occurred during the pre irrigation period and the february event precipitation 2 3 cm occurred during the post irrigation period precipitation for the august event had two peaks within one day which resulted in two peaks in water table depth and nitrate dynamics in groundwater before the august 24 event the closest event happened on august 18 2017 with 1 5 cm precipitation for the february 9 event the closest precipitation event occurred on february 4 2018 with rainfall amount of 2 8 cm the february event e19 in fig 3 exhibited an anti clockwise hysteresis loop hi 0 49 and a dilution in the rising limb fi 0 28 there was no hysteresis data for august event due to malfunctioning of measuring device our high frequency measurements of no3 n at multiple points and different depths of shallow groundwater during storm events pre and post animal waste application showed large variation both temporally and spatially fig 6 the no3 n measured at shallower wells depth 0 8 m or 1 0 m exhibited a dynamic behavior and a rapid change in the concentration in response to precipitation while the deeper wells depth 1 2 m were significantly less responsive to precipitation for instance in response to the precipitation on aug 23rd 2017 no3 n at well 5 depth 0 8 m and distance from drain 1 5 m dropped from 18 mg n l 1 to 5 mg n l 1 and returned to 25 mg n l 1 after the event fig 6a similarly for the second event on aug 25th 2017 no3 n at well 1 depth 0 8 m and distance from drain 1 0 m decreased from 25 mg n l 1 to 15 mg n l 1 and then raised back to 25 mg n l 1 within 12 h however the no3 n at the 1 2 m deep wells varied much less from 0 to 10 mg n l 1 compared with shallower wells furthermore for those wells at the same depth e g depth 1 2 m in fig 6b no3 n in groundwater sampled from wells closer to the drain were more dynamic compared with no3 n in groundwater sampled from wells farther from the drain in addition to the high spatio temporal dynamics of nitrate no3 n measurements showed nitrate stratification in deeper soil profile despite the high variability in shallower wells depth 0 8 or 1 0 m most no3 n measurements were recorded higher than 10 mg n l 1 in shallower wells for both pre irrigation and post irrigation periods on the other hand based on the measurements from deepest wells depth 1 2 m no3 n ranged from 0 to 4 mg n l 1 in fig 6a and from 4 mg n l 1 to 10 mg n l 1 in fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 hysteresis patterns identified by high frequency measurements most of delineated events 16 out of 22 exhibited significant anti clockwise hysteresis in the no3 n drainage flow relationship fig 7 this finding agrees with previous investigations of hysteresis analysis for agricultural landscapes blaen et al 2017 kämäri et al 2018 williams et al 2018 generally anti clockwise loops indicate that groundwater with lower no3 n travels through the soil profile and reaches the subsurface drains faster than the groundwater with higher no3 n in artificially drained agricultural landscapes such phenomenon has been reported to be caused by the stratification of nitrate in the soil profile williams et al 2018 nitrogen input e g animal waste application in this study causes large and mobile nitrate pools to form in the soil profile especially in top soil layers due to high productivity of soil biota zhao et al 2019 when precipitation infiltrates and generates subsurface drainage the quick flow e g preferential flow or old water with low no3 n moves faster compared with matrix flow that carries more no3 n leached from the top soil layers visually demonstrated in liu et al 2020 therefore the vertical stratification of nitrate created a temporal lag between peaks of drainage flow and no3 n the identified events also expressed a mix of flushing and dilution effects during the measurement period fig 7 this event scale response e g flushing or dilution depends on the availability of soil nitrate pools compared with no3 n in pre event baseflow bieroza et al 2018 zhang 2018 in our study the animal waste application and decomposition of soil organic matter led to the formation of mobile nitrate pools in the top soil which enriched drainage flow with high no3 n this enrichment resulted in flushing of nitrate at the event scale in some cases however when the baseflow no3 n was relatively high the quick flow e g preferential flow with lower no3 n tended to dilute the no3 n in the drainage water during the rising limb and peak flow e18 19 22 in fig 3 similar studies on agricultural watersheds dominated by groundwater recharge reported different tendencies for dilution bowes et al 2015 ferrant et al 2013 lloyd et al 2016a b flushing enrichment or concentration or mixed effects huebsch et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 webb and walling 1985 4 2 key processes mechanisms affecting nitrate concentration drainage flow relationship 4 2 1 animal waste application our results showed that the application of animal waste dramatically changed the hysteresis patterns of storm events fig 7 and table s2 before animal waste irrigation most events exhibited weak hysteresis effects hi 0 5 and significant nitrate flushing fi 0 7 however the hysteresis patterns became more dynamic during the post irrigation period the storm events tended to cause stronger hysteresis effects hi range 0 0 73 for event scale c q relationship furthermore the dilution flushing of nitrate within storm events varied on a case by case basis fi range 0 85 0 85 by comparing the hysteresis patterns kruskal wallis tests indicated significant differences for both hi p 0 02 and fi p 0 005 before and after animal waste application animal waste irrigation could alter the size and spatial distribution of nitrate pools and thus influence event scale chemo dynamic status the flushing dilution effects of events became more dynamic after the beginning of animal waste application perhaps because it added a large amount of nitrogen to the subsurface drained field e g burkholder et al 2007 and table s2 and increased the size of nitrate pools in deeper soil layers e g sampling depth 1 2 m in fig 6 although the majority of nitrogen in animal waste water is in organic nitrogen and ammonia forms the nitrification and mineralization by soil micro organisms quickly produce nitrate in the soil profile the elevated mobile nitrate pools can be indicated by the differences between no3 n in the drainage water when the water table depth wtd is shallowest during each event for pre and post irrigation periods fig 8 after starting animal wastewater application the mean values of no3 n in the drainage water at shallowest wtd significantly increased from 6 47 to 11 70 mg n l 1 p 0 01 for t test in addition to increased nitrate availability higher no3 n in the groundwater around the drain depth indicated that at least a portion of mobile nitrate traveled to groundwater in the region near the subsurface drainage tiles unlike event scale chemo dynamic status the hysteresis effects for both pre and post irrigation periods showed similar anti clockwise behavior with a greater magnitude in post irrigation period fig 7 due to n rich and microbially active topsoil mobile nitrate pools were generally accumulated at a faster rate after animal waste application during storm events fresh drainage flow carrying high no3 n took longer travel time to reach the drain lines compared with old groundwater with relatively less no3 n such temporal lags between hydrograph peaks and chemograph peaks resulted in the hysteresis loops mostly anti clockwise in c q relationships in addition the size of soil nitrate pools increased because of increments of nitrogen sources therefore the magnitude of hysteresis effects increased after the animal waste application 4 2 2 hydrological factors the correlation analysis indicated that the hysteresis metrics hi fi were significantly correlated with some key hydrological factors and such correlation changed after the starting of animal waste application table 2 in post irrigation period the flashiness of storm events expressed as the duration of rising limbs trising became significantly correlated with both storm hi and fi elevated nitrate levels in the soil profile especially in topsoil increased the removal of nitrate from the soil profile with the increase in flashiness of storm events resulting in strong hysteresis effects for event scale c q relationships unlike flashiness of storm events the correlation between water yield w and fi remained relatively constant for both pre and post irrigation periods spearman s ρ of water yield w against fi was greater than 0 6 which means larger storm events tended to flush more nitrate from our site due to nutrient rich top soils in agricultural fields higher amounts of storm water carrying leached nitrate reach the groundwater near the subsurface drainage line during larger storms which result in more nitrate export the hydrological factors with significant correlation with hysteresis metrics were different before and after irrigation table 2 during pre irrigation period only one factor initial flow rate q 0 was significantly correlated with hi ρ 0 73 α 0 05 while four factors were significantly correlated with fi with ρ values ranging from 0 66 to 0 88 α 0 05 table 2 after applying animal wastewater the factors that significantly correlated with hysteresis metrics were very different except the overall water yields w in table 2 hi was significantly correlated with the duration ρ 0 76 and relative length of rising limbs ρ 0 85 similarly fi showed significant correlation with event water yield ρ 0 63 duration of rising limbs ρ 0 71 and initial no3 n ρ 0 85 4 2 3 biochemical processes many biochemical processes potentially affected the availability and size of nitrate pools and thus influenced the hysteresis patterns in the study site these processes include plant uptake mineralization nitrification and denitrification plant uptake was relatively low during the measurement period most identified storm events happened in two periods march july 2017 and november 2017 march 2018 fig 3 in the first period no plants or young grass existed as grass was planted in may 2017 fig 5 likewise grass growth was very slow in the cold conditions of the second period therefore the major pathways for nitrate removal were leaching and denitrification when conditions were favorable unlike the limited pathways for nitrate removal there existed considerable biochemical processes that increased the size and availability of nitrate pools soils in our site were highly organic with mean total organic carbon toc concentrations of 5 3 0 6 in topsoil 5 cm according to a soil survey conducted by liu 2017 mineralization of soil organic matter would considerably increase nitrate pool size in the soil profile in addition animal waste was applied four times in november 2017 which contained high concentrations of organic nitrogen and ammonia table s2 the mineralization of organic nitrogen and nitrification of ammonia would add a large amount of mobile nitrate in the soil profile which is supported by the change point in fig 5 due to the rapid updating of event scale c q relationships mean duration of six hours in the rising limbs table 1 the biochemical processes mainly altered hysteresis patterns by influencing the pre event conditions i e antecedent conditions in a study of three watersheds in u k with a mixed land use of arable and grassland outram et al 2014 reported that the antecedent conditions affected the hysteresis patterns especially during longer dry periods before storm events however our results indicated significant correlation between hysteresis metrics and only one factor related to antecedent conditions initial flow q0 in table 2 possibly due to the bypass of water flow caused by subsurface drainage system and the abundance of nitrate availability arenas amado et al 2017 gramlich et al 2018 schilling and helmers 2008 compared to natural conditions subsurface drainage systems serve as shortcuts of water flow in soil profile which could remove water quickly from the soil profile schilling et al 2015 williams et al 2018 the storm events were somewhat hydraulically isolated from each other unless separated by short time intervals therefore only q0 the initial flow rate showed significant correlations with the hysteresis metrics in addition to the subsurface drainage systems nitrate pools with large sizes maintained adequate nitrate availability during each event furthermore because of the limited temporal coverage of identified events in this study the information we obtained regarding antecedent conditions may not be sufficient to make sound conclusions more events with different durations are needed for a more robust analysis of the influence of antecedent conditions on hysteresis patterns 4 3 hot moments of nitrate export inferred by the intensive water quality sampling results demonstrated that hot moments of nitrate export were dominated by drainage flow events which matched well with previous investigations royer et al 2006 investigated nitrogen load from agricultural fields in illinois u s and reported that the top 10 of stream flow contributed more than 50 of nitrogen loading they also found that stream flows greater than median values were responsible for nearly all the nitrogen loading similarly gall et al 2015 observed that flow rates in the 80th percentile top 20 of high flow generated more than 75 of nitrogen export from an animal waste application field such phenomenon could be explained by the following reasons for one thing precipitation events are the triggers of high volume of water flow into receiving water bodies lloyd et al 2016a b in this case high flows fig 4 generated by storm events created massive carriers for nitrate export from soil profile furthermore since the nitrate availability in the soil profile was not limiting figs 6 8 higher drainage flow increased potential for flushing of mobile nitrate from soils fig s3 and moatar et al 2017 at the same time the monitored storm events were very flashy with the mean duration of 38 3 h table 1 at such a short temporal duration nitrate transport processes were more dominating compared with reaction processes gall et al 2015 p 20 williams et al 2018 e g denitrification if we extend the results from the event scale to larger temporal scales nitrate export patterns also changed after planting tilling and fertilization fig 5 the most influential practice identified in our study was animal waste application while tillage and planting also showed impacts to some extent flow weighted no3 n expressed as the slope of the double mass curve fig 5 increased dramatically after the four animal waste irrigation events fig 5 animal wastewater added excessive nitrogen sources into the field site in november 2017 when there was little grass growth to take up n in late fall and winter zhang et al 2017 hence nitrate leaching was the primary cause for nitrate loss from the field we also noticed a temporal lag between animal waste application and increased flow weighted no3 n as the majority of the wastewater n was in organic nitrogen and ammonia forms adeli et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 and table s1 it took time for microorganisms to transform organic nitrogen and ammonia to mobile nitrate via biochemical reaction processes e g decomposition and nitrification such time resulted in a temporal lag three to four weeks visible in the double mass curve fig 5 more interestingly after the abrupt change in december 2017 the flow weighted no3 n remained relatively constant until the end of measurement period fig 5 this could be attributed to the timing and rate of animal waste application in this study further analysis is needed to investigate the legacy effects of animal waste application and its interaction with plant growth temperature dynamics drying and wetting periods etc 4 4 insights gained from and implications of high frequency water quality measurements results demonstrated that flushing nitrate from the soil profile primarily occurred during large and flashy storm events fig 4 and table 1 therefore the findings could assist in advancing our understandings of the mechanisms and processes of existing management practices to reduce nitrate export e g controlled drainage and saturated buffers traditionally researchers reported that controlled drainage holds more water in soil profile creating favorable conditions for denitrification evans and skaggs 2004 liu 2017 ng et al 2002 saadat et al 2018 youssef et al 2018 additionally in highly organic soils or soils receiving n fertilizers or animal manure controlled drainage can also provide storage for large and flashy events to reduce the tendency of nitrate flushing from soil profile according to the results of high frequency measurements less flashy events could potentially generate less nitrate export from soil profile fig 4 hence our results suggest that more dynamic management of controlled drainage for better modulating drainage flow in response to large and flashy storm events could possibly increase the overall nitrate removal efficiency of the practice by identifying the hot moments of nitrate export our findings could improve the design and operation protocols for increasing the efficiency of management practices for instance denitrifying woodchip bioreactors have been installed at the field edge to reduce the nitrate export from agricultural fields schipper et al 2010 woodchip bioreactors can reduce the nitrate load and the removal rate varies depending up field conditions levels of influent no3 n and temperature addy et al 2016 bell et al 2015 christianson et al 2018 our results demonstrated that most nitrate loss was exported during sensitive periods e g top 27 of flow rates contributed 75 of nitrate loading in fig 4 by assuming constant nitrate removal rate of bioreactors during certain periods christianson et al 2012a 2012b woodchip bioreactors could be either inadequately functioning under baseflow or overwhelmed under event flow or even both in addition results of latest laboratory bioreactor experiments indicated that the efficiency of bioreactors can be enhanced by regularly draining and re wetting bioreactors instead of keeping the bioreactors saturated all the time maxwell et al 2019 therefore it is possible to increase the nitrate treatment efficiency of woodchip bioreactors if we bypass the baseflow to drain bioreactors and supply peak flow with abundant nitrate load to prompt the re wetting in bioreactors practically these bypass drain rewetting actions can be determined and fully automated according to the results from high frequency sampling techniques however the mechanisms of nitrate export from agricultural fields and denitrification in woodchip bioreactors are of great complexity and require further investigation to generate practical guidelines 5 summary and conclusions in order to better understand the hydrological and biochemical processes and mechanisms that control the fate and transport of nitrate in artificially drained agricultural fields we installed two high frequency water quality systems in a subsurface drained pasture field receiving liquid hog waste in eastern north carolina u s in situ hourly no3 n at both the field edge and multiple points in shallow groundwater between subsurface drain lines within the field were measured from january 2017 to late march 2018 with the high frequency measurements we analyzed the event scale relationships between no3 n and drainage flow as well as the temporal variations of nitrate export via subsurface drainage our high frequency measurement system was able to capture the rapidly changing c q relationships for the research site e g hysteresis patterns the identified storm events 22 events mostly exhibited anti clockwise behavior with high variability of flushing dilution effects in addition high drainage flows contributed far more nitrate export from the research field compared with low flows furthermore the application of animal wastewater was the most influential factor that affected the internal hydro biochemical processes possibly due to the altered availability and spatial distribution of nitrate pools in the soil profile by animal waste application based on the insights obtained from the analysis we provided practical suggestions for the design and management of conservation practices e g controlled drainage and bioreactors in order to improve the nitrate removal efficiencies of these

10682,intensive agricultural activities especially in artificially drained agricultural landscapes generate a considerable amount of nutrient export which has been identified as a primary cause of water quality impairment several management practices have been developed and installed in agricultural watersheds to reduce nutrient export e g nitrate nitrogen no3 n although published research reported considerable water quality benefits of these practices there exist many unanswered questions regarding the inherent processes and mechanisms that control nitrate fate and transport from drained agricultural landscape to advance our understanding of processes and mechanisms we deployed two high frequency sampling systems in a drained agricultural field to investigate the relationship between agricultural drainage and nitrate concentrations c q relationship results indicated that the high frequency measuring system was able to capture the rapidly changing c q relationships at the experimental site e g hysteresis patterns the 22 identified storm events exhibited anti clockwise behavior with high variability of flushing dilution effects in addition high drainage flows contributed far more nitrate loading compared with lower flows for instance the top 10 of drainage flow exported more than 50 of the nitrate lost via subsurface drainage during the monitoring period additionally we observed that animal waste application was the most influential practice to change the c q relationship by increasing the size of soil nitrogen pools the insights obtained from the high frequency water quality measurements could help provide practical suggestions regarding the design and management of conservation practices such as controlled drainage bioreactors and saturated buffers to improve their nitrogen removal efficiencies this subsequently leads to better nutrient management in drained agricultural lands keywords animal waste application c q relationship agricultural water management practices 1 introduction nutrient export from drained agricultural fields especially nitrate nitrogen no3 n has been widely recognized as one of the major causes of surface water quality impairment christianson and harmel 2015 goolsby et al 2000 king et al 2015 poole et al 2018 rabalais et al 2014 skaggs et al 1994 zhao et al 2019 researchers have been extensively investigating the fate and transport of nitrate at spatial scales varying from field to river basin baffaut et al 2015 basu et al 2011 g arnold et al 2015 moatar et al 2017 thompson et al

bioreactors e g schipper et al 2010 saturated buffers e g jaynes and isenhart 2014 and drainage water recycling e g reinhart et al 2016 although considerable progress has been made towards understanding the effect of these conservation practices on nitrogen fate and transport in artificially drained cropland there still exist many unanswered questions youssef et al 2018 researchers reported large variations in the performance of these practices for reducing nitrate export the relationship between the performance of these practices and field conditions e g climate patterns soil type drainage system design and management are not clearly understood addy et al 2016 saadat et al 2018 skaggs et al 2010 in addition because of the complicated processes and mechanisms at play the integrated effects of multiple management practices require further analysis christianson et al 2018 with the emerging use of in situ water quality sensors researchers gained more access to high frequency water quality measurements in riverine systems blaen et al 2016 butturini et al 2006 rode et al 2016 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 high frequency measurements have generated data that provided insights of the hydro biochemical processes controlling nitrate export from agricultural watersheds williams et al 2018 additionally high frequency sampling with well calibrated equipment enabled researchers to more accurately determine the nutrient export to receiving water bodies ockenden et al 2017 pellerin et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 using high frequency in situ measurements from a headwater agricultural catchment in uk blaen et al 2017 identified precipitation intensity and antecedent condition as key drivers for the mechanisms and transport of nitrogen during storm events additionally blaen et al 2017 reported that the different active zones for nitrogen sources were highly dynamic depending on event based conditions based on high frequency measurements of discharge and nitrate nitrogen concentration no3 n at multiple locations in the stream networks jones et al 2018 found that the majority of nitrate entering the streams was transported to downstream water bodies due to the limited capacity of nitrate removal by microbes or aquatic organisms in addition to the insights from data analysis of high frequency measurements cooper et al 2018 developed conceptual models to infer the effects of hydrogeological processes on water pollution and thus implied the effects of agricultural management practices e g winter cover crops and reduced tillage on reducing negative impacts of agricultural activities clearly the use of high frequency water quality monitoring approaches in riverine systems generated data that advanced our understanding of unanswered questions about nutrient dynamics at watershed scale jomaa et al 2018 reynolds et al 2016 the successful application of high frequency monitoring in river systems suggests that it can be used in field scale investigations in this paper we aim to demonstrate the use of high frequency monitoring to advance the understanding of hydro biogeochemical processes in a drained agricultural field by investigating the no3 n coupled with drainage flow measurements at a high temporal resolution an hourly interval high frequency measurements are analyzed to evaluate the temporal evolution of nitrate export processes we discuss the practical implications of our study regarding the performance of agricultural management practices for reducing nitrogen loss from drained agricultural landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental procedure the 14 month january 2017 march 2018 experimental study was conducted at an artificially drained pasture field located in the north carolina lower coastal plain united states latitude 35 853143 longitude 76 658643 the soil on the field is a cape fear loam fine mixed semiactive typical umbraquualt which is poorly drained under natural conditions subsurface drainage pipes were installed at a depth of 1 0 m and spacing of 12 5 m the drain outlet was operated in free drainage the pasture field was irrigated by hog wastewater from an adjacent lagoon fig 1 prior to the beginning of the study january 2017 wastewater had been applied to the field at agronomic levels liu et al 2019 for the first ten months of the study wastewater was not applied to the field later wastewater was applied four times in november 2017 no other wastewater application occurred until the end of the study in march 2018 rainfall was measured using two tipping bucket automatic rain gauges which were regularly calibrated using a manual rain gauge as a reference two water table monitoring wells equipped with water level sensors hobo u20 onset at bourne ma u s were installed midway between two subsurface drains to determine nutrient loads in drainage water a teledyne isco auto sampler was installed at the outlet of each instrumented drain line to take flow proportional composite drainage water quality samples water samples were collected roughly every two weeks and sent to laboratory for chemical analysis in addition two high frequency sampling systems were installed to monitor no3 n in drainage water at the edge of the field and in shallow groundwater between two subsurface drain lines fig 1 further information regarding the high frequency measurement including the calibration of the in situ sensor is provided by liu 2019 and liu et al 2020 the experimental site is described in detail by liu 2017 liu et al 2019 and youssef et al 2016 2 1 1 high frequency measurement of drainage flow and drainage water quality sampling at the field edge drainage flow and nitrate concentration were measured at fine temporal resolutions of 15 and 45 min respectively a 22 5 v notch weir was installed along with a pressure transducer cs451 campbell at logan ut u s inside a water level control structure located at the outlet of each drain line to measure drainage flux fig 1 we also implemented a high frequency sampling system by coupling a multi point sampler mps with an in situ spectrophotometer spectro lysertm s can at vienna austria to monitor no3 n birgand et al 2016 every 45 min at each measuring event the mps pumped water to rinse the whole sampling system fed fresh water for water quality sensor to take measurements and then purged the water to disposal after each sampling event an oxalic acid solution from an acid rinse container was pumped to fill the quartz cuvette to help reduce the optical fouling of the spectrophotometer caused by high iron concentration null air measurements and acid rising were employed for quality assurance quality control further details regarding high frequency measurement equipment are available in liu et al 2020 2 1 2 high frequency water quality sampling of shallow groundwater similar to the high frequency sampling system at the field edge we installed an mps coupled with an in situ spectrophotometer to take high frequency shallow groundwater quality measurements from different locations in the field and at different depths nine groundwater quality sampling wells were installed at three depths 0 8 m 1 0 m 1 2 m and three distances from the experimental drain line 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m a 10th groundwater well was installed at a depth of 1 7 m and a distance of 0 5 m each groundwater well had a short screened length 7 cm at the specified well depth to enable drawing point water samples the mps was set to take a measurement every six minutes and thus each groundwater well was measured at the interval of one hour the system for high frequency monitoring of no3 n in shallow groundwater is described in detail in s1 of supplemental materials i sm i and by liu et al 2020 2 2 analysis of no3 n and drainage flow relationship c q relationship at event scale 2 2 1 event delineation we defined events as the time period with rapid change in drainage flow after a rainfall event or animal waste irrigation event the starting point of an event was defined as the point in time at which an abrupt increase in drainage flow occurred at least 20 increase compared with baseflow the event ended either when the drainage flow returned to the initial value or when another event identified by another abrupt change of flow started during an event there should exist at least three data points in the rising limb otherwise data from the event were discarded furthermore qualified events should have more than 1 0 cm d 1 of peak flow except when this event was triggered by an animal waste irrigation applying these criteria we identified 22 events with high frequency hydrological and no3 n measurements to analyze the event based c q relationships of the 22 events nine occurred before the starting of the animal waste application and eleven occurred after the application 2 2 2 quantifying the hysteresis patterns of nitrate c q relationship to compare event based c q relationships among different events the measurements of drainage flow and no3 n were normalized into 0 1 within the event equation s 1 s 2 in sm i with normalized measurements we calculated the storm hysteresis index hi to quantify the direction and strength of hysteresis effect as follows c e m lloyd et al 2016a b 1 h i i 1 n c i r i s i n g c i f a l l i n g n where h i is the storm hysteresis index c i r i s i n g and c i f a l l i n g are the normalized no3 n at the i t h segments of rising and falling limbs respectively n is the scaling factor to separate the segments of rising or falling limbs of actual measurements n 12 in this study if there is no data point for a certain segment a concentration value is estimated for this segment by linear interpolation of concentration values associated with neighboring segments since hi calculations are based on normalized concentration values 0 1 the resulting values of hi range from 1 to 1 the sign of hi indicates the direction of hysteresis loops while the absolute value of hi represents the strength of hysteresis loops positive hysteresis loops mean that the peak of no3 n occurs before the peak of drainage flow and vice versa in addition to storm hysteresis index we calculated storm flushing index fi to quantify the flushing dilution effects of events as follows vaughan et al 2017 2 f i c q p e a k r i s i n g c 0 r i s i n g where f i is the storm flushing index c 0 r i s i n g and c q p e a k r i s i n g are the normalized no3 n at the beginning of the event and at the peak flow of the rising limb respectively as the no3 n was normalized the values of flushing index ranged from 1 to 1 depending on the slope of the hysteresis loops a positive flushing index represents flushing effect that is identified by higher no3 n in drainage flow during the event compared with baseflow conversely a negative value of fi indicates a dilution effect of the event in addition to the hi and fi metrics we calculated other metrics that characterize event hydrographs and chemographs table s1 these metrics describe antecedent conditions prior to the event as well as the hydrological and biogeochemical features of the event the correlation between these metrics and hysteresis metrics were analyzed using spearman s rho correlation analysis 2 3 quantifying the contribution of nitrate export at different drainage flow with the high frequency measurements of drainage flow and no3 n over 8000 data points we were able to divide the instantaneous discharge values non normalized into equal range segments of flow rates and estimate the frequency at which every measured drainage flow range segment occurred we generated an empirical frequency distribution efd of drainage flow measurements we also calculated the nitrate export for every drainage flow measurement equation s 3 s 4 in sm i by compiling the overall nitrate export from all flow measurements we quantified the contribution of different flow segments to the overall nitrate export from the field further details of the analysis are given in s3 of sm i 2 4 statistical analysis in this study we used kruskal wallis to test whether the hysteresis metrics hi and fi are identical or not before and after the starting of animal waste application in november 2017 kruskal wallis test k w test is a non parametric method to test identical populations when the dataset does not meet the assumption of normality breslow 1970 we also conducted spearman s rho test to evaluate the correlation between hysteresis metrics and other descriptors table s1 to provide insights on key processes controlling the nitrate c q relationship for this drained agricultural field spearman s rho ρ test is a non parametric rank based method to quantify the correlation relationship of two variables a descriptor with a stronger and significant correlation coefficient would show more influence on hysteresis patterns revelle 2017 3 results 3 1 overall description of field measurements fig 2 shows the measured precipitation water table depth wtd subsurface drainage flow and no3 n in drainage water during the monitoring period spanning january 2017 march 2018 the total precipitation was 155 6 cm long term normal 161 3 cm nearly half of the precipitation 68 6 cm compared to normal of 53 3 cm happened in the four months from may to august 2017 in november 2017 there was 2 4 cm of precipitation during the whole month normal for november is 9 0 cm while there was 38 5 cm rainfall in the four months from december 2017 to march 2018 normal for period is 37 8 cm the research field had a rapid hydrologic response to precipitation characterized by a quick rise in the groundwater table and drainage flow generation measured water table depth ranged from nearly at the soil surface 0 02 m to 1 1 m the mean value and standard deviation of water table depths were 0 83 0 15 m subsurface drainage flow increased shortly after precipitation and then returned to baseflow in 2 3 days the recorded mean drainage flow was 0 22 cm day 1 while the median flow was 0 13 cm day 1 our results showed high variability in measured hourly no3 n the hourly no3 n in drainage water measured by the in situ sensor varied from 0 to 23 37 mg n l 1 with mean and median concentrations of 5 75 and 3 92 mg n l 1 respectively due to the malfunctioning of the in situ monitoring system some of the measurements were missing in spring and summer excluding the periods of missing data high frequency measurements of both hourly flow and no3 n were available in 78 of the 427 day monitoring period in november 2017 liquid animal manure from the nearby hog lagoon was applied to the research field four times adding a total of 6 27 cm of water orange bars in fig 2a most of the nitrogen in the applied manure was in organic form 152 93 mg n l 1 and nh4 n form 147 83 mg n l 1 as the average no3 n in applied manure was 1 11 mg n l 1 table s2 in this study the period before the first animal waste application on nov 2nd 2017 was referred to as pre irrigation period while the remaining period was referred to as post irrigation period during the monitoring period we delineated 22 events with enough drainage flow and no3 n measurements for further analysis events with at least three data points in rising or falling limbs see zuecco et al 2016 these drainage events were relatively flashy and occurred quickly in response to precipitation or irrigation precipitation triggered 19 of these events while the remaining three events occurred in november 2017 after animal waste applications denoted in fig 2a the mean duration of events was 38 3 h with the rising limb occurring on average over approximately 6 h duration in addition to flashiness the events showed considerable differences in hydrogeochemical characteristics such as drainage flow no3 n and nitrate mass loading table 1 and supplemental material for example the average value of mean no3 n within each event was 8 36 mg n l 1 while the corresponding range was 2 30 13 76 mg n l 1 additionally the event based nitrate loading varied from 0 003 to 1 36 kg n ha 1 with the median and mean values of 0 07 and 0 23 kg n ha 1 respectively 3 2 hysteresis patterns observed from in situ high frequency measurements anti clockwise hysteresis patterns negative hi values were mostly observed in the relationships between no3 n and subsurface drainage c q relationship during events however the flushing dilution effects were more dynamic table 1 fig 3 and supplemental materials ii the mean and median values of hi were 0 28 and 0 31 respectively only event 5 e5 in fig 3 exhibited positive hi a clockwise loop while the remaining events exhibited either non hysteresis or anti clockwise behaviors the fi quantifying the flushing dilution effects ranged from 0 85 to 1 with a tendency to flush more nitrate during events e g mean fi 0 43 for event e4 we observe a positive slope in the c q hysteresis loop indicating a flushing effect during the rising limb fig 3 in contrast the fi of the hysteresis loop for event e20 was lower than zero indicating a dilution effect fig 3 3 3 high temporal variability in nitrate export via subsurface drainage 3 3 1 contribution of different drainage flow rates to nitrate export the analysis of the drainage and concentration data over the monitoring period clearly indicated that the majority of nitrate export from the field occurred during high drainage flow fig 4 as the drainage flow rate increases the nitrate export via drainage water increases the highest drainage flow drainage flow rate 1 93 cm day 1 representing only 1 4 of total drainage carried 25 of the total nitrate export during the monitoring period in contrast the lowest drainage flows mostly categorized as baseflow exported substantially less nitrate compared with high flows for example 25 of nitrate was carried off the field by drainage flows less than 1 cm day 1 which represent approximately 70 of the total drainage flow 3 3 2 double mass curve of cumulative water yield and nitrate export in the relationship between cumulative water yield and cumulative nitrate export fig 5 we observed two abrupt change points during the measuring period the first abrupt change happened in late april or early may of 2017 when the farm crew tilled the field and replanted grass in late spring may 1st 2017 the flow weighted no3 n changed from 3 9 to 5 5 mg n l 1 the second change point appeared in december 2017 after four animal waste irrigation events during the previous month the flow weighted no3 n increased to around 12 5 mg n l 1 and leveled off until the end of the measuring period late mar 2018 we observed a lag period three to four weeks between the first manure application and the second abrupt increase of the double mass curve 3 4 nitrate spatio temporal dynamics in shallow groundwater during storm events pre and post animal waste application on august 24 2017 and february 9 2018 we measured water table depth and nitrate dynamics from multiple locations in shallow groundwater in response to precipitation events fig 6 the august event precipitation 4 9 cm occurred during the pre irrigation period and the february event precipitation 2 3 cm occurred during the post irrigation period precipitation for the august event had two peaks within one day which resulted in two peaks in water table depth and nitrate dynamics in groundwater before the august 24 event the closest event happened on august 18 2017 with 1 5 cm precipitation for the february 9 event the closest precipitation event occurred on february 4 2018 with rainfall amount of 2 8 cm the february event e19 in fig 3 exhibited an anti clockwise hysteresis loop hi 0 49 and a dilution in the rising limb fi 0 28 there was no hysteresis data for august event due to malfunctioning of measuring device our high frequency measurements of no3 n at multiple points and different depths of shallow groundwater during storm events pre and post animal waste application showed large variation both temporally and spatially fig 6 the no3 n measured at shallower wells depth 0 8 m or 1 0 m exhibited a dynamic behavior and a rapid change in the concentration in response to precipitation while the deeper wells depth 1 2 m were significantly less responsive to precipitation for instance in response to the precipitation on aug 23rd 2017 no3 n at well 5 depth 0 8 m and distance from drain 1 5 m dropped from 18 mg n l 1 to 5 mg n l 1 and returned to 25 mg n l 1 after the event fig 6a similarly for the second event on aug 25th 2017 no3 n at well 1 depth 0 8 m and distance from drain 1 0 m decreased from 25 mg n l 1 to 15 mg n l 1 and then raised back to 25 mg n l 1 within 12 h however the no3 n at the 1 2 m deep wells varied much less from 0 to 10 mg n l 1 compared with shallower wells furthermore for those wells at the same depth e g depth 1 2 m in fig 6b no3 n in groundwater sampled from wells closer to the drain were more dynamic compared with no3 n in groundwater sampled from wells farther from the drain in addition to the high spatio temporal dynamics of nitrate no3 n measurements showed nitrate stratification in deeper soil profile despite the high variability in shallower wells depth 0 8 or 1 0 m most no3 n measurements were recorded higher than 10 mg n l 1 in shallower wells for both pre irrigation and post irrigation periods on the other hand based on the measurements from deepest wells depth 1 2 m no3 n ranged from 0 to 4 mg n l 1 in fig 6a and from 4 mg n l 1 to 10 mg n l 1 in fig 6b 4 discussion 4 1 hysteresis patterns identified by high frequency measurements most of delineated events 16 out of 22 exhibited significant anti clockwise hysteresis in the no3 n drainage flow relationship fig 7 this finding agrees with previous investigations of hysteresis analysis for agricultural landscapes blaen et al 2017 kämäri et al 2018 williams et al 2018 generally anti clockwise loops indicate that groundwater with lower no3 n travels through the soil profile and reaches the subsurface drains faster than the groundwater with higher no3 n in artificially drained agricultural landscapes such phenomenon has been reported to be caused by the stratification of nitrate in the soil profile williams et al 2018 nitrogen input e g animal waste application in this study causes large and mobile nitrate pools to form in the soil profile especially in top soil layers due to high productivity of soil biota zhao et al 2019 when precipitation infiltrates and generates subsurface drainage the quick flow e g preferential flow or old water with low no3 n moves faster compared with matrix flow that carries more no3 n leached from the top soil layers visually demonstrated in liu et al 2020 therefore the vertical stratification of nitrate created a temporal lag between peaks of drainage flow and no3 n the identified events also expressed a mix of flushing and dilution effects during the measurement period fig 7 this event scale response e g flushing or dilution depends on the availability of soil nitrate pools compared with no3 n in pre event baseflow bieroza et al 2018 zhang 2018 in our study the animal waste application and decomposition of soil organic matter led to the formation of mobile nitrate pools in the top soil which enriched drainage flow with high no3 n this enrichment resulted in flushing of nitrate at the event scale in some cases however when the baseflow no3 n was relatively high the quick flow e g preferential flow with lower no3 n tended to dilute the no3 n in the drainage water during the rising limb and peak flow e18 19 22 in fig 3 similar studies on agricultural watersheds dominated by groundwater recharge reported different tendencies for dilution bowes et al 2015 ferrant et al 2013 lloyd et al 2016a b flushing enrichment or concentration or mixed effects huebsch et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 webb and walling 1985 4 2 key processes mechanisms affecting nitrate concentration drainage flow relationship 4 2 1 animal waste application our results showed that the application of animal waste dramatically changed the hysteresis patterns of storm events fig 7 and table s2 before animal waste irrigation most events exhibited weak hysteresis effects hi 0 5 and significant nitrate flushing fi 0 7 however the hysteresis patterns became more dynamic during the post irrigation period the storm events tended to cause stronger hysteresis effects hi range 0 0 73 for event scale c q relationship furthermore the dilution flushing of nitrate within storm events varied on a case by case basis fi range 0 85 0 85 by comparing the hysteresis patterns kruskal wallis tests indicated significant differences for both hi p 0 02 and fi p 0 005 before and after animal waste application animal waste irrigation could alter the size and spatial distribution of nitrate pools and thus influence event scale chemo dynamic status the flushing dilution effects of events became more dynamic after the beginning of animal waste application perhaps because it added a large amount of nitrogen to the subsurface drained field e g burkholder et al 2007 and table s2 and increased the size of nitrate pools in deeper soil layers e g sampling depth 1 2 m in fig 6 although the majority of nitrogen in animal waste water is in organic nitrogen and ammonia forms the nitrification and mineralization by soil micro organisms quickly produce nitrate in the soil profile the elevated mobile nitrate pools can be indicated by the differences between no3 n in the drainage water when the water table depth wtd is shallowest during each event for pre and post irrigation periods fig 8 after starting animal wastewater application the mean values of no3 n in the drainage water at shallowest wtd significantly increased from 6 47 to 11 70 mg n l 1 p 0 01 for t test in addition to increased nitrate availability higher no3 n in the groundwater around the drain depth indicated that at least a portion of mobile nitrate traveled to groundwater in the region near the subsurface drainage tiles unlike event scale chemo dynamic status the hysteresis effects for both pre and post irrigation periods showed similar anti clockwise behavior with a greater magnitude in post irrigation period fig 7 due to n rich and microbially active topsoil mobile nitrate pools were generally accumulated at a faster rate after animal waste application during storm events fresh drainage flow carrying high no3 n took longer travel time to reach the drain lines compared with old groundwater with relatively less no3 n such temporal lags between hydrograph peaks and chemograph peaks resulted in the hysteresis loops mostly anti clockwise in c q relationships in addition the size of soil nitrate pools increased because of increments of nitrogen sources therefore the magnitude of hysteresis effects increased after the animal waste application 4 2 2 hydrological factors the correlation analysis indicated that the hysteresis metrics hi fi were significantly correlated with some key hydrological factors and such correlation changed after the starting of animal waste application table 2 in post irrigation period the flashiness of storm events expressed as the duration of rising limbs trising became significantly correlated with both storm hi and fi elevated nitrate levels in the soil profile especially in topsoil increased the removal of nitrate from the soil profile with the increase in flashiness of storm events resulting in strong hysteresis effects for event scale c q relationships unlike flashiness of storm events the correlation between water yield w and fi remained relatively constant for both pre and post irrigation periods spearman s ρ of water yield w against fi was greater than 0 6 which means larger storm events tended to flush more nitrate from our site due to nutrient rich top soils in agricultural fields higher amounts of storm water carrying leached nitrate reach the groundwater near the subsurface drainage line during larger storms which result in more nitrate export the hydrological factors with significant correlation with hysteresis metrics were different before and after irrigation table 2 during pre irrigation period only one factor initial flow rate q 0 was significantly correlated with hi ρ 0 73 α 0 05 while four factors were significantly correlated with fi with ρ values ranging from 0 66 to 0 88 α 0 05 table 2 after applying animal wastewater the factors that significantly correlated with hysteresis metrics were very different except the overall water yields w in table 2 hi was significantly correlated with the duration ρ 0 76 and relative length of rising limbs ρ 0 85 similarly fi showed significant correlation with event water yield ρ 0 63 duration of rising limbs ρ 0 71 and initial no3 n ρ 0 85 4 2 3 biochemical processes many biochemical processes potentially affected the availability and size of nitrate pools and thus influenced the hysteresis patterns in the study site these processes include plant uptake mineralization nitrification and denitrification plant uptake was relatively low during the measurement period most identified storm events happened in two periods march july 2017 and november 2017 march 2018 fig 3 in the first period no plants or young grass existed as grass was planted in may 2017 fig 5 likewise grass growth was very slow in the cold conditions of the second period therefore the major pathways for nitrate removal were leaching and denitrification when conditions were favorable unlike the limited pathways for nitrate removal there existed considerable biochemical processes that increased the size and availability of nitrate pools soils in our site were highly organic with mean total organic carbon toc concentrations of 5 3 0 6 in topsoil 5 cm according to a soil survey conducted by liu 2017 mineralization of soil organic matter would considerably increase nitrate pool size in the soil profile in addition animal waste was applied four times in november 2017 which contained high concentrations of organic nitrogen and ammonia table s2 the mineralization of organic nitrogen and nitrification of ammonia would add a large amount of mobile nitrate in the soil profile which is supported by the change point in fig 5 due to the rapid updating of event scale c q relationships mean duration of six hours in the rising limbs table 1 the biochemical processes mainly altered hysteresis patterns by influencing the pre event conditions i e antecedent conditions in a study of three watersheds in u k with a mixed land use of arable and grassland outram et al 2014 reported that the antecedent conditions affected the hysteresis patterns especially during longer dry periods before storm events however our results indicated significant correlation between hysteresis metrics and only one factor related to antecedent conditions initial flow q0 in table 2 possibly due to the bypass of water flow caused by subsurface drainage system and the abundance of nitrate availability arenas amado et al 2017 gramlich et al 2018 schilling and helmers 2008 compared to natural conditions subsurface drainage systems serve as shortcuts of water flow in soil profile which could remove water quickly from the soil profile schilling et al 2015 williams et al 2018 the storm events were somewhat hydraulically isolated from each other unless separated by short time intervals therefore only q0 the initial flow rate showed significant correlations with the hysteresis metrics in addition to the subsurface drainage systems nitrate pools with large sizes maintained adequate nitrate availability during each event furthermore because of the limited temporal coverage of identified events in this study the information we obtained regarding antecedent conditions may not be sufficient to make sound conclusions more events with different durations are needed for a more robust analysis of the influence of antecedent conditions on hysteresis patterns 4 3 hot moments of nitrate export inferred by the intensive water quality sampling results demonstrated that hot moments of nitrate export were dominated by drainage flow events which matched well with previous investigations royer et al 2006 investigated nitrogen load from agricultural fields in illinois u s and reported that the top 10 of stream flow contributed more than 50 of nitrogen loading they also found that stream flows greater than median values were responsible for nearly all the nitrogen loading similarly gall et al 2015 observed that flow rates in the 80th percentile top 20 of high flow generated more than 75 of nitrogen export from an animal waste application field such phenomenon could be explained by the following reasons for one thing precipitation events are the triggers of high volume of water flow into receiving water bodies lloyd et al 2016a b in this case high flows fig 4 generated by storm events created massive carriers for nitrate export from soil profile furthermore since the nitrate availability in the soil profile was not limiting figs 6 8 higher drainage flow increased potential for flushing of mobile nitrate from soils fig s3 and moatar et al 2017 at the same time the monitored storm events were very flashy with the mean duration of 38 3 h table 1 at such a short temporal duration nitrate transport processes were more dominating compared with reaction processes gall et al 2015 p 20 williams et al 2018 e g denitrification if we extend the results from the event scale to larger temporal scales nitrate export patterns also changed after planting tilling and fertilization fig 5 the most influential practice identified in our study was animal waste application while tillage and planting also showed impacts to some extent flow weighted no3 n expressed as the slope of the double mass curve fig 5 increased dramatically after the four animal waste irrigation events fig 5 animal wastewater added excessive nitrogen sources into the field site in november 2017 when there was little grass growth to take up n in late fall and winter zhang et al 2017 hence nitrate leaching was the primary cause for nitrate loss from the field we also noticed a temporal lag between animal waste application and increased flow weighted no3 n as the majority of the wastewater n was in organic nitrogen and ammonia forms adeli et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 and table s1 it took time for microorganisms to transform organic nitrogen and ammonia to mobile nitrate via biochemical reaction processes e g decomposition and nitrification such time resulted in a temporal lag three to four weeks visible in the double mass curve fig 5 more interestingly after the abrupt change in december 2017 the flow weighted no3 n remained relatively constant until the end of measurement period fig 5 this could be attributed to the timing and rate of animal waste application in this study further analysis is needed to investigate the legacy effects of animal waste application and its interaction with plant growth temperature dynamics drying and wetting periods etc 4 4 insights gained from and implications of high frequency water quality measurements results demonstrated that flushing nitrate from the soil profile primarily occurred during large and flashy storm events fig 4 and table 1 therefore the findings could assist in advancing our understandings of the mechanisms and processes of existing management practices to reduce nitrate export e g controlled drainage and saturated buffers traditionally researchers reported that controlled drainage holds more water in soil profile creating favorable conditions for denitrification evans and skaggs 2004 liu 2017 ng et al 2002 saadat et al 2018 youssef et al 2018 additionally in highly organic soils or soils receiving n fertilizers or animal manure controlled drainage can also provide storage for large and flashy events to reduce the tendency of nitrate flushing from soil profile according to the results of high frequency measurements less flashy events could potentially generate less nitrate export from soil profile fig 4 hence our results suggest that more dynamic management of controlled drainage for better modulating drainage flow in response to large and flashy storm events could possibly increase the overall nitrate removal efficiency of the practice by identifying the hot moments of nitrate export our findings could improve the design and operation protocols for increasing the efficiency of management practices for instance denitrifying woodchip bioreactors have been installed at the field edge to reduce the nitrate export from agricultural fields schipper et al 2010 woodchip bioreactors can reduce the nitrate load and the removal rate varies depending up field conditions levels of influent no3 n and temperature addy et al 2016 bell et al 2015 christianson et al 2018 our results demonstrated that most nitrate loss was exported during sensitive periods e g top 27 of flow rates contributed 75 of nitrate loading in fig 4 by assuming constant nitrate removal rate of bioreactors during certain periods christianson et al 2012a 2012b woodchip bioreactors could be either inadequately functioning under baseflow or overwhelmed under event flow or even both in addition results of latest laboratory bioreactor experiments indicated that the efficiency of bioreactors can be enhanced by regularly draining and re wetting bioreactors instead of keeping the bioreactors saturated all the time maxwell et al 2019 therefore it is possible to increase the nitrate treatment efficiency of woodchip bioreactors if we bypass the baseflow to drain bioreactors and supply peak flow with abundant nitrate load to prompt the re wetting in bioreactors practically these bypass drain rewetting actions can be determined and fully automated according to the results from high frequency sampling techniques however the mechanisms of nitrate export from agricultural fields and denitrification in woodchip bioreactors are of great complexity and require further investigation to generate practical guidelines 5 summary and conclusions in order to better understand the hydrological and biochemical processes and mechanisms that control the fate and transport of nitrate in artificially drained agricultural fields we installed two high frequency water quality systems in a subsurface drained pasture field receiving liquid hog waste in eastern north carolina u s in situ hourly no3 n at both the field edge and multiple points in shallow groundwater between subsurface drain lines within the field were measured from january 2017 to late march 2018 with the high frequency measurements we analyzed the event scale relationships between no3 n and drainage flow as well as the temporal variations of nitrate export via subsurface drainage our high frequency measurement system was able to capture the rapidly changing c q relationships for the research site e g hysteresis patterns the identified storm events 22 events mostly exhibited anti clockwise behavior with high variability of flushing dilution effects in addition high drainage flows contributed far more nitrate export from the research field compared with low flows furthermore the application of animal wastewater was the most influential factor that affected the internal hydro biochemical processes possibly due to the altered availability and spatial distribution of nitrate pools in the soil profile by animal waste application based on the insights obtained from the analysis we provided practical suggestions for the design and management of conservation practices e g controlled drainage and bioreactors in order to improve the nitrate removal efficiencies of these

china potential evapotranspiration et p and reference crop evapotranspiration et o differ in their developments concepts equations and application fields however many researchers have mixed the utilization of the two terms thus it is necessary to clarify the terms to guide their proper usage the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the concepts developments equations and applications of et p and et o the review shows clearly that the concepts and developments of et p and et o have long histories the original concept of et p was proposed by thornthwaite and that core idea with various improvements has been used up to now the development of et o although initially confused with that of et p was formally defined as a standard method the et p equations were classified as mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination types while the et o equations were classified as being temperature based radiation based combination and pan evaporation based both terms are connected to evaporation and evapotranspiration and although there have been ambiguities et p has been applied mostly in hydrology meteorology and climatology while et o has been applied mostly in agronomy agriculture irrigation and ecology et p has been used to estimate drought indices and et o has been used in the single and dual crop coefficient methods and the shuttleworth wallace method for estimating actual field evapotranspiration this review serves to clarify the origins definitions and uses of et p and et o it addresses common ambiguities between the terms in order to aid the proper utilization of the terms abbreviations e evaporation e p potential evaporation et evapotranspiration et a actual evapotranspiration et p potential evapotranspiration

potential evapotranspiration reference crop evapotranspiration temperature based radiation based combination based 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration et a is an important component of the water balance and it is used widely in many fields such as agronomy hydrology climatology meteorology ecology and environmental science liu et al 2019 peng et al 2019 tasumi 2019 mcmahon et al 2013 two closely related concepts are potential evapotranspiration et p and reference crop evapotranspiration et o although both et p and et o provide estimates of atmospheric evaporative demand they are based on different concepts and have different equations which can help to differentiate the terms till present the utilization and application of et p and et o have been confused for decades some researchers clearly distinguished the two terms yates and strzepek 1994 allen et al 1998 irmak and haman 2003 peng et al 2017 but others treated et p and et o as identical concepts and used similar equations for their estimations tanner and pelton 1960 xu and singh 2002 mardikis et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2010 dinpashoh et al 2011 one typical example is that hargreaves and samani 1982 using potential while hargreaves and samani 1985 used the term reference crop thus there is a necessity to clarify et p and et o and reduce the ambiguity in using the terms early applications of et p were in meteorology and hydrology but later its applications were extended to other fields parajuli et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a b for example in agronomy it was related to crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling yao et al 2020 feng et al 2019 due to vagueness in the definition et p was not always applied properly development of the concept of et o helped to solve some et p misapplication problems because agronomists began to use the concept of et o in irrigation scheduling design and estimation of crop evapotranspiration et c by connecting single or dual crop coefficient method s specifically sammis et al 1985 bausch and neale 1987 allen et al 1998 gong et al 2019 there has not been a review to clearly differentiate et p and et o thus in this paper differences in the concepts and developments frequently used equations and the applications of et p and et o are systematically reviewed and differentiated this research provides useful references and clarifies the concepts to guide researchers on properly differentiating et p and et o in their future investigations 2 the concept and development of potential and reference crop evapotranspiration 2 1 evaporation originally evaporation e was used to obtain et a as to its estimation the dalton types of equations have been the mainstream formulas according to dalton 1802 windspeed and humidity are major factors that influence the rate of e and an open water evaporation mm formula has been established livingston 1909 1 e c a bu e s e a where e s is saturated vapor pressure kpa e a is actual vapor pressure kpa u is wind speed m s 1 a b and c are empirical coefficients equation 1 is simple and has been widely accepted later it was extended or modified to produce a variety of dalton mass transfer type equations for example by fitzgerald 1886 trabert 1896 meyer 1915 meyer 1926 horton 1919 and rohwer 1931 table 1 the modifications improved the accuracy of estimating e however the core part of e had not been touched and could not be explained clearly vapor pressure and wind speed do influence e but not exclusively the concept of e gradually extended into various kinds of evaporation from ranges of study areas including soil surface evaporation open water evaporation and vegetation transpiration from the 1940s researchers realized that it was insufficient to simply limit their research to e water vapor is produced not only on the ground and water surfaces but also from the transpiring plants penman 1948 pointed out that surface energy had a big impact on e penman 1948 studied e of different surfaces open water bare soil and grass included energy balance for the first time and further developed the mechanisms of dalton s theory but not the concepts 2 2 potential evapotranspiration the development of potential evapotranspiration et p endured for several decades to distinguish it from et a the term potential evapotranspiration was first put forward by thornthwaite 1948 after investigating the rainfall and water consumptive use for several states in the usa et p represents the atmospheric evaporation demand namely the amount of water that can be transferred to the air from land or water means the combined evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from plants represents the transport of water from the earth back to the atmosphere the reverse of precipitation thornthwaite 1948 it is the maximum value of e that would occur under ideal conditions the initial aim is to decide whether the study area is dry using an aridity index ai that incorporates et p ai p et p 1 where p donates precipitation thornthwaite 1948 where the negative positive ai value means dry wet this ai based index has been applied extensively till the present in drought related research huo et al 2013 zarch et al 2015 li et al 2017 penman 1948 gave a new formula to calculate the evaopration from different surfaces after several years experiments at rothamsted experimental station however he did not mention the terms potential or evapotranspiration in his paper he only mentioned evaporation several years later penman 1956 1963 provided a new concept to discuss the water consumed through vegetation called potential transpiration which was a measure of the transpiration rate from an extensive short green cover completely shading the ground and adequately supplied with water this description was referenced and redefined many times for example anon 1956 defined it as the rate of water vapor loss from a short grass canopy under the following conditions grown in a large surface during an active growth stage completely covering the soil of homogeneous height in optimal water and nutritional status and the world meteorological organization wmo 1963 defined it as the quantity of water vapor which could be emitted by a surface of pure water per unit surface area and unit time under the existing atmospheric conditions these descriptions along with a new term potential evaporation e p were similar to the penman 1956 1963 definition but had more specific requirements for vegetations somehow the term e p was mixed up with et p given by thornthwaite 1948 and used as such till now choudhury 1997 vörösmarty et al 1998 donohue et al 2010 therefore the estimation methods of both concepts were confused too one specific term which was suitable for descriptions given above was called crop potential evapotranspiration which was proposed by jensen 1968 and defined as the rate of evapotranspiration for a given crop at a given stage of growth when water is not limiting and other factors such as insects diseases and nutrients have not materially restricted plant development this definition considered the limitations that could influence evapotranspiration such as the evaporating surface and crop growth conditions as a supplement to the definition differences among several crops under different growing conditions were provided by jensen 1968 however this concept is rather complex and not enough information is available for enough crops to address global et and he also defined et p in his paper as the upper limit of evapotranspiration that occurs with a well watered agricultural crop that has an aerodynamically rough surface such as alfalfa with 30 50 cm of top growth so as to establish the relationship between et p and et c with a term called crop coefficient k c van wijk and de vries 1954 in fact both from the description and the calculation procedure the concept is more like the pre definition of et o this is the first description of et p in agronomy which is obviously different from the meaning of et p coined by thornthwaite 1948 and used popularly for example dingman 1992 gave a description of et p namely the rate at which evapotranspiration would occur from a large area completely and uniformly covered with growing vegetation which has access to an unlimited supply of soil water and without advection or heating effects apparently this description summarizes the ideal conditions which can allow the amount of water escaping from a crop to reach the maximum in other words it gets to the potential level from the different descriptions of et p given above the similarity of the concepts appeared after penman 1956 coined the term potential transpiration they were all descriptions that related to et c and included some limitations on the crop growth conditions or the evaporation transpiration surfaces obviously they were different from the original aim of et p which was given by thornthwaite 1948 the original aim of et p was to represent the water demand or maximum water at large scale regions and et was the actual amount of water evaporated from the entire region several later proposed new concepts of et p focused on the vegetation or crops with small surfaces under this premise et p inevitably meant the quantity or vapor rate of water escape only from leaves it was essential to study the water change among different plants by using a specific term but it was also necessary to assure that the term used was unique instead of having multiple meanings therefore inventing a new term to differentiate from et p was imperative 2 3 reference crop evapotranspiration the reference crop evapotranspiration et o term was proposed concerning the evaporating surfaces and other factors which could influence the rate of et c jensen et al 1971 wright and jensen 1972 jensen 1974 the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations summarized the studies about crop water requirements and defined et o as the rate of evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of 8 to 15 cm tall green grass cover of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water doorenbos and pruitt 1977 where reference crop was an ideal crop and represented one specific kind of surface grass and alfalfa were selected as short and tall reference crops initially although other different grasses could be considered such as ryegrass or fescue marsh et al 1980 biran et al 1981 frank 1981 beard 1985 snyder et al 1987 nevertheless alfalfa is difficult to grow in some tropical climates or regions that have severely cold winter temperatures it is therefore difficult to define a specific cultivar of alfalfa which will grow effectively worldwide in order to provide local validation of alfalfa et o methods allen et al 1989 allen et al 1994b reports that the ratio of alfalfa to grass et c estimated values is 1 37 therefore the accuracy of et o calculations is related to crop types besides variety of crops the situation of crop growth is also required for the et c determination for example the height of vegetation surrounding a lysimeter must be identical to that of the vegetation in the lysimeter van bavel et al 1963 perrier et al 1974 meyer et al 1990 allen and pruitt 1991 pruitt 1991 from this point of view it may be inappropriate to take natural vegetation as a reference crop allen et al 1994b suggested a new definition of et o that used a constant value of surface resistance could avoid the variations of other relevant climatic variables that counteracted one another in many situations the selection of constant height and surface resistance parameters was a compromise that might not represent reality in all climatic regimes and the fixed surface resistance implied a moderately dry soil surface resulting from about a weekly irrigation frequency allen et al 1998 later fao adopted this et o concept formally in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 and described the new definition clearly as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetic crop with an assumed crop height 12 cm and a fixed surface resistance 70 s m and albedo 0 23 which would closely resemble evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass cover of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water hereafter it is denoted as fao56 et o based on the relatively strict fao56 et o definition the american society of civil engineers asce added another alfalfa as the reference crop described as a tall crop with an approximate height of 0 5 m there are two evaporation surfaces with different canopy resistance aerodynamic resistance and timescale for the tall and short reference crops walter et al 2000 hereafter it is denoted as asce et o obviously the definition of et o is clearer and more specific than et p since to distinguish et of plants from a large region is one of the major objectives of et o with special and ideal constraints of plant conditions and the estimating equation it is convenient to estimate the amount of water evaporating from crop and vegetation surfaces helpful to solve water requirement issues and to provide useful irrigation plan information for agronomists and farmers 3 equations for estimating et p and et o 3 1 the classification of et p and et o equation types besides the ambiguities in the concepts and developments between et p and et o the biggest confusion involves the equations that are used to estimate et p and et o although a number of equations for computing et o or et p have been developed the formula types are not clearly classified singh and xu generalize and propose some simple classification rules for equations used in systematic studies and were used popularly tabari et al 2011 djaman et al 2018b song et al 2019 they conclude that the mass transfer aerodynamic based methods utilize the concept of eddy motion transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere singh and xu 1997 the estimation methods requiring only temperature as an input variable be considered as temperature based methods xu and singh 2001 and the empirical radiation based equations for estimating e p generally are based on the energy balance xu and singh 2000 as for combination based equations they take both aerodynamic theory and energy balance into account penman 1948 in this paper according to the previous classification the et p equations are classified as being dalton mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination types while the equations of et o are classified as being temperature based radiation based pan evaporation based and combination types the different types of et p and et o equations will be further examined moreover large number of models also are given to provide accurate ways to estimate them mcmahon et al 2016 3 2 equations for estimating et p 3 2 1 mass transfer type of et p equations the mass transfer type of et p equations originated from the dalton type equations of e and were similar in form table 2 these equations played important roles several decades ago in investigating variations and patterns of et p the application of this type of et p equation clearly showed the ambiguity between et p and e during the early stages of et p studies the mass transfer based equations from the 1950s to 1970s that have been applied frequently are presented in table 2 the mass transfer based et p equations were compared with other et p or et o methods by several researchers for example tabari and talaee 2011 compared the albrecht 1950 equation with 30 different equations including the fao56 penman monteith equation which strictly speaking is for estimating et o and pan evaporation for a humid climate it was found that the albrecht 1950 equation did not perform well when compared to other equations however the performance of the albrecht 1950 equation improved when it was compared with the brockamp and wenner 1963 equation for a humid climate djaman et al 2016 muniandy et al 2016 when the meteorological data were lacking these equations were useful to roughly estimate et p once the parameters were adjusted rim 2000 azhar and perera 2010 zhai et al 2010 jakimavičius et al 2013 valipour 2014 however most of the mass transfer based et p equations have been abandoned because the inherent mechanisms were quite different from those used in the current understanding of et p and the results estimated with these equations had large deviations bormann 2011 3 2 2 temperature based type of et p equations the temperature based et p equations date back to the 1920s jensen et al 1990 and they are some of the earliest methods for estimating evapotranspiration xu and singh 2001 thornthwaite 1948 proposed a temperature based et p equation after comparing the relationship between precipitation temperature and water change in several states of the united states since then additional temperature based et p equation were proposed and applied the temperature based type of et p equations which have been applied extensively in the world are presented in table 3 the thornthwaite 1948 equation is used and cited worldwide 9386 citations because it is simple and has the least data requirement camargo et al 1999 bautista et al 2009 chang et al 2018 pereira and pruitt 2004 it has also been compared with other equations by several researchers for example niaghi et al 2013 compare the thornthwaite 1948 equation with several other equations in northwestern iran where the terrestrial climate has mild dry summers and cold snowy winters valipour et al 2017 analyzed 16 different equations including the thornthwaite 1948 equation at 18 weather stations in iran under various climate conditions including arid semiarid very humid and mediterranean the thornthwaite 1948 equation generally underestimates et p in the study regions and linear regression does not improve its performance sentelhas et al 2010 also report that the thornthwaite 1948 equation underestimates et p in humid areas the thornthwaite 1948 equation is originally used for estimating et p but later researchers used it also for computing et o ahmadi and fooladmand 2008 bautista et al 2009 this confusion in use should be clarified because the background and the concept reflected by thornthwaite 1948 does not fit et o pereira and pruitt 2004 moeletsi et al 2013 chang et al 2018 the blaney and criddle 1950 equation has also been frequently used 1031 citations for estimating et p because it has generally good performance and easy data acquisition tabari et al 2011 rácz et al 2013 its original development is for humid areas where the advective effect is usually negligible ali and shui 2009 applications of the blaney and criddle 1950 equation in various climates are given in table 4 large differences in performance are found for different study areas or climate zones this variability in performance is not unique to the blaney and criddle 1950 equation it is common for other equations when applied to a wide range of climate areas and conditions in addition to studies on the thornthwaite 1948 and blaney and criddle 1950 equations the performances of other temperature based et p equations were also investigated for example liu et al 2017 compared the mccloud 1955 and hamon 1960 equations with lysimeter data at xiaotangshan a semi arid area in china muniandy et al 2016 compared the hamon 1960 schendel 1967 and romanenko 1961 equations with pan evaporation in humid areas of malaysia and found that the schendel 1967 equation had the worst performance among 26 different equations while the szász 1973 equation performed the best among the temperature based type equations in general the applications of the mccloud 1955 hamon 1960 romanenko 1961 baier and robertson 1965 schendel 1967 and szász 1973 equations were much fewer than the thornthwaite 1948 and blaney and criddle 1950 equations some of them were abandoned generally with bad performance and unreasonable or insufficient meteorological variables such as szász 1973 and mccloud 1955 3 2 3 radiation based type of etp equations the radiation based type of et p equations revealed the empirical relationship between the radiation and et p the radiation based equations could be looked upon as simplified forms of the penman 1948 equation and reasonably reliable estimates were expected for short periods jensen and haise 1963 some popularly used radiation based et p equations are presented in table 5 among the radiation based et p equations the priestley and taylor 1972 equation has been applied throughout the world 5645 citations ranking first among the radiation based et p equations the priestley and taylor 1972 equation was derived for saturated conditions and open water sites where wind effects were negligible the wind function multiplied by the vapor pressure deficit term which is an important term of the combination based equations was simplified and combined with the influence of land cover and site condition which was represented by α 0 gavin and agnew 2004 pereira 2004 arasteh and tajrishy 2008 more information about the modified α 0 can be found in cristea et al 2012 the priestley and taylor 1972 equation included the partial concept of equilibrium evaporation developed by bouchet 1963 the main idea of equilibrium evaporation is that with the increase of water supply the actual evaporation increases although the potential evaporation decreases the initial surface has saturated conditions where the actual and potential evaporation rates are equal this relationship is recognized as the complementary relationship szilagyi et al 2017 crago and qualls 2018 han and tian 2018 the priestley and taylor 1972 equation is useful for estimating et p under available energy limited conditions brutsaert and stricker 1979 still there may be a faulty basic premise in the priestley and taylor 1972 equation because it is not true that large scale advection is independent of the surface energy balance mcnaughton and spriggs 1989 the results are generally good but vary with regions for example li et al 2016 report that the priestley and taylor 1972 equation performs better than other equations when compared to eddy covariance measurements in wuwei china under an arid climate yoder et al 2005 report that it overestimates et p in tennessee usa when compared with lysimeter data berengena and gavilán 2005 consider the priestley and taylor 1972 equation to be unsuitable for southern spain when compared with pan evaporation measurements because it is very sensitive to wind speed cristea et al 2012 conclude that the coefficient may be the main reason for the varied results under different climates and evaporation surfaces the jensen and haise 1963 equation has the second largest number of citations 1039 times among the radiation based et p equations however tabari et al 2011 conclude it is the worst among the radiation based equations when comparing to the fao56 pm equation in rasht iran humid climate muniandy et al 2016 compare the jensen and haise 1963 equation to pan evaporation in malaysia and find it to be an inaccurate method trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 report that the jensen and haise 1963 equation performs at a moderate level in the balkan peninsula humid climate the makkink 1957 equation has also been frequently used 653 citations because of its low need for climate information yoder et al 2005 compare the makkink 1957 equation with lysimeter data in tennessee usa and find that the estimated et p values are lower than the measured values r 2 is 0 9 the result is similar when comparing the estimated et p values by the makkink 1957 equation to pan evaporation data at vaud switzerland xu and singh 2000 r 2 is 0 9 in south central nebraska usa a sub humid and semi arid area the makkink 1957 equation does not perform well when compared with 16 other equations irmak and irmak 2008 the turc 1961 equation 283 citations performed well in many studies under different climate conditions for example xu et al 2013 compared four equations including the turc 1961 fao56 pm priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves and samani 1985 with lysimeter data at the kunshan irrigation and drainage experiment station in the taihu region of china under a humid subtropical monsoon climate and found that the rmse value of the turc 1961 equation was the lowest among the four equations liu et al 2017 compared 16 equations including the turc 1961 equation and others with lysimeter data at xiaotangshan beijing in north china plain a semiarid zone the performance of the turc 1961 equation was moderate but it out performed other radiation based equations such as the priestley and taylor 1972 makkink 1957 and jensen and haise 1963 equations irmak and irmak 2008 compared 17 et p et o equations including 3 radiation type et p equations in a transition zone between sub humid and semiarid with strong winds in nebraska usa and found that the makkink 1957 equation had a larger r 2 value than the turc 1961 and priestley and taylor 1972 equations yoder et al 2005 compared 8 et p et o equations including 3 radiation type et p equations in a region of the usa where the weather is influenced by cold dry continental air and warm moist air with lysimeter data they found that the makkink 1957 equation had the same r 2 value 0 90 as the turc 1961 equation which was larger than that of the priestley and taylor 1972 equation r 2 0 86 djaman et al 2015 compared 16 et p et o equations including 2 radiation type et p equations at experimental sites with a typical sahelian climate with a short rainy season they found that the performance of the makkink 1957 equation was better than the priestley and taylor 1972 equation in general underestimation is the main characteristic of radiation based equations wind effects are not included which influences the aerodynamic resistance since increasing wind speed can lower it and this part of et is not counted appropriately irmak and irmak 2008 thus it is only recommended to use this kind of equations in low wind regions 3 2 4 combination type of et p equations the combination type of et p equation includes both energy balance and aerodynamic aspects because et is a process by which liquid water is converted to vapor phase and then the vapor moves the aerodynamic part is related to dalton 1802 mass transfer theory the velocity term and vapor pressure term are two core terms of it penman 1948 presents a typical combination type of et p equation which considers impacts of not only air temperature but also other climatic factors it is the first combination type equation for estimating the amount of water escape from humid surfaces although it had an initial aim to calculate e some combination type of et p equations are presented in table 6 the penman 1948 penman 1963 and monteith 1965 equations have been the most commonly used combination type et p equations cited 8108 1075 and 6148 times respectively the penman 1948 and penman 1963 equations have not only been studied for different objectives but they have also been modified for different conditions by various researchers such as wright and jensen 1972 thom and oliver 1977 linacre 1977 and jensen et al 1970 the penman 1963 equation was a modified form of the penman 1948 equation which included wind velocity and monteith 1965 added a new coefficient r s to represent the crop surface roughness initially the penman 1948 and penman 1963 equations were used to estimate et p but they were combined with the monteith 1965 equation for different crop surface conditions the so called penman monteith equation was later recommended by fao as a standardized method for estimating et o allen et al 1998 during this stage especially from 1965 to 1998 the penman monteith equation was used with great ambiguity because some scientists used it to estimate et p and others to estimate et o even after 1998 this has happened the combination type of et o equations are not discussed in further detail here because they are presented in section 4 3 3 unsteadiness emerged when comparing the penman 1948 equation with other methods it was the best one among 6 et p et o equations when all were compared to eddy covariance values in wuwei china li et al 2016 but it did not perform well in kharagpur india from kashyap and panda 2001 or in iran from valipour et al 2017 irmak and irmak 2008 conducted a comparison of 11 combination based et p equations among 17 et p et o equations with the criterion of the asce pm equation allen et al 2005 and showed that among the combination type et p equations the penman 1963 equation had the best performance with a rmse of 0 3 mm day 1 followed by the penman 1948 wright and jensen 1972 and van bavel 1966 equations with rmse values of 0 39 0 48 and 1 04 mm day 1 respectively kashyap and panda 2001 compared 10 et p et o equations five of which were combination type et p equations and showed that the monteith 1965 equation gave the best performance under a sub humid climate condition with a rmse of 0 08 mm day 1 the thom and oliver 1977 van bavel 1966 and linacre 1977 equations were also applied many times cited 543 511 and 446 times respectively the van bavel 1966 and rijtema 1966 equations are essentially based on the original penman 1948 formula with modified individual coefficients according to the specific conditions of the study area however all of the penman type equations need several observed meteorological variables which can be difficult to attain in some developing countries lacking widespread meteorological information so it is common to use other types of equations as alternative in these regions and low accuracy of et p is reasonably a predictable consequence 3 3 different types of equations for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration 3 3 1 temperature based type of et o equations the temperature based et o equations are basically similar in structure to those of et p because both represent quantities of atmospheric evaporation demand most et o equations have several different coefficients more or less like a modification of et p some popularly used temperature based et o equations are given in table 7 actually it can be somewhat difficult to distinguish these temperature based et o equations in table 7 from those for et p this is also true for the other types of et o equations the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation 2791 citations improved upon the hargreaves 1975 equation 274 citations hargreaves and samani 1982 equation 1464 citations and the hargreaves et al 1985 equation 435 citations it is the most popularly used temperature based et o equation this equation has been calibrated with eight years of alta fescue grass lysimeter data from davis california because the accuracy of the hargreaves equation varies with the climatic conditions of study regions moeletsi et al 2013 gafurov et al 2018 the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation mainly the three main coefficients in the equations is modified several times by using lysimeter data for example by droogers and allen 2002 trajkovic 2007 ravazzani et al 2011 tabari and talaee 2011 berti et al 2014 dorji et al 2016 feng et al 2017 lobit et al 2017 and tang et al 2019 see details in table 7 hargreaves and allen 2003 provide details on the development history of the hargreaves series equations allen et al 1998 recommend the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation as a way to estimate et o when solar radiation wind speed and or relative humidity data are lacking because it requires little weather data and has good agreement with measured values the doorenbos and pruitt 1977 equation which is commonly noted as the fao24 blaney criddle equation is widely used 1811 citations because it has small data requirement the good performance may stem from its original development for humid areas where the advective effect is usually negligible irmak et al 2003a ali and shui 2009 hargreaves and samani 1982 indicate that the fao24 blaney criddle equation gives similar et o estimates as the fao56 pm method at 16 australian locations under a wide range of climate conditions rizaiza and al osaimy 1996 indicate that irrigation water requirements for vegetables and perennial crops are similar to the values estimated by the fao24 blaney criddle equation in the western region of saudi arabia the results of george et al 2002 show that the fao24 blaney criddle equation provides the best results for davis california and jagdalpur india with humid climates however the unsuitableness of the equation in arid climates also is indicated for example bakhtiari et al 2011 apply 6 different et o et p equations and compare them with lysimeter measurement data at the iranian academic center iran under a semiarid climate and find that the fao24 blaney criddle equation has a moderate ranking among the 6 equations lópez urrea et al 2006 compare 7 different et o et p equations with lysimeter data under a semiarid climate in spain and the fao24 blaney criddle equation has the worst performance the other temperature based equations mentioned in table 7 do not have widespread use because of their complexity and low accuracy for example the kharrufa 1985 equation performs poorly and it either overestimates or underestimates et o in several studies under different climate types chen et al 2005 rosenberry et al 2007 paiva et al 2012 zhang 2018 süheri et al 2019 3 3 2 radiation based type of et o equations similar to the temperature based et o equations there are also many radiation based et o equations some of them have been commonly applied in the world the frequently used radiation based et o equations are presented in table 8 the ritchie 1972 equation was the most cited 2447 citations among the radiation based et o equations although it was initially proposed to estimate et p ritchie 1972 introduced a model to compute daily soil water evaporation and plant transpiration which was used in dssat v3 5 crop models as part of the soil water balance module jones et al 2003 it also has been applied to estimate water use by way of water balances in hydrological and agricultural studies aggarwal et al 2017 carson et al 2017 yang et al 2017 lópez lópez et al 2018 or in other crop models keating et al 2003 jones et al 2017 however sometimes it performed poorly for example berengena and gavilán 2005 compared 10 et o et p equations and the ritchie 1972 equation performed worse than the priestley and taylor 1972 equation with r 2 values of 0 797 and 0 830 respectively researchers have compared equations under various climate conditions and the results varied greatly xystrakis and matzarakis 2010 chose 13 et o et p equations and compared their performance at crete in southern greece a semiarid zone against the fao56 pm equation as the standard method their results showed that among the radiation based equations the hansen 1984 equation performed best the modified turc 1961 equation by xu and singh 2000 ranked second best although it had a more complicated formula for requiring rh data which rendered the hansen 1984 equation more favorable but modified makkink 1957 equation by xu and singh 2000 had great bias and was not recommended in the study region tomar 2015 compared 19 et o et p equations including 5 et p equations against the fao56 pm equation in pantanagar udham singh nagar and the results showed that the modified priestley and taylor 1972 equation by xu and singh 2000 underestimated et o values r 2 was 0 87 the two equations from irmak et al 2003b overestimated values r 2 values were 0 89 and 0 87 respectively while the castaneda and rao 2005 modified makkink 1957 equation gave better estimates of et o r 2 was 0 93 gabriela and irmak 2015 studied the influence of the climate variables on the estimates of 13 equations including 7 et p and 6 et o equations at five different regions under different climate conditions they found that the doorenbos and pruitt 1977 equation fao24 radiation equation ranked first in the three regions where the climate conditions were mediterranean type subhumid and semiarid and semiarid but performed poorly in a humid subtropical climate the two equations from irmak et al 2003b ranked moderately overall in all study areas except that the second equation et o 0 289r n 0 023t a 0 489 performed well in subhumid and semiarid climates the variability and instability are still major characteristics of this type of equations but from the research results the radiation based equations have good performance in semiarid or semi humid climate regions where the speed velocity data are lacking so the term is ignored in this type of equations 3 3 3 combination type of et o equations similar to the combination type et p equations the combination type of et o equations have been applied extensively in different parts of the world when the required geological and weather data are available of these the fao 56 pm equation was found to be the most accurate method to estimate et o at daily or monthly timescales and was recommended as the standard method by the fao some frequently used combination type et o equations including the fao 56 pm are given in table 9 the combination type equations for estimating et o have been modified several times based on penman 1963 valiantzas 2006 2012 2013a contributed significantly to the modification process valiantzas simplified the penman 1963 equation by indirectly computing the radiation and aerodynamic terms using the standardized calculation procedure recommended by shuttleworth and maidment 1993 and allen et al 1998 and by using calibrations with meteorological data obtained from the climwat global database smith 1993 the equations that valiantzas 2006 2012 2013a proposed have generally performed well ahooghalandari et al 2017 djaman et al 2017 the fao56 pm et o equation allen et al 1998 is a modified monteith 1965 equation it has been used widely for many purposes because of a strong theoretical basis allen et al 1994b and rigorous model description allen et al 1994a mostly this equation is used as the standard method against several other et o equations for example li et al 2018a compared 13 et o et p equations including 5 et p equations of 4 different types against the fao56 pm equation and found that when the comprehensive climatic datasets were available the valiantzas 2013b was the best equation because it had a simple computation procedure and correlated well linearly to the fao56 pm equation song et al 2019 analyzed the performance of 12 et o et p including 3 et p equations in different sub regions and different time periods of northeastern china against the fao 56 pm equation they found that the valiantzas 2006 equation was the best alternative method to fao56 pm equation during the crop growing period ahmad and choi 2018 koudahe et al 2018 and mokhtari et al 2018 considered that the radiation term was the main factor influencing estimation accuracy followed by temperature and wind speed therefore alternatives to the fao 56 pm that require little weather data are important in some regions where the climatic data are insufficient the asce pm equation allen et al 2005 included alfalfa as another reference crop and proposed two coefficients c n and c d for reference type and calculation time step respectively to distinguish alfalfa and grass djaman et al 2018a analyzed the ratio of et o alfalfa to et o grass and their correlations in new mexico usa calculated with the asce pm equation showed that there was a strong correlation between et o alfalfa and et o grass 0 96 r 2 0 98 at 6 sites lopez urrea et al 2006 compared the fao56 pm and asce pm equations under semiarid conditions in spain with lysimeter data the average values estimated by the fao56 pm et o were equal to the mean measured values but the average values estimated by the asce pm equation were 4 higher 0 45 mm h than the mean measured lysimeter values and simple linear regression and error analysis statistics indicated that agreement between the two estimation methods and lysimeter was quite good in the study area gavilán et al 2008 compared the asce and fao56 pm equations at 31 weather stations for hourly and daily timescales in andalusia southern spain they found that differences between the two estimates were greater when evaporative demand increased and results of the fao56 pm equation were 6 smaller than those of the asce pm equation for hourly et o the suitability of each equation depended on the specific conditions in different studies which implied that the same results for equations might not be obtained in different studies and different conclusions could be acquired from similar study conditions generally the asce pm and fao56 pm equations are accepted as standard methods djaman et al 2018b gurski et al 2018 quej et al 2018 it is necessary to point out that various et p equations have been compared with the fao56 pm equation although in this paper we tried to strictly distinguish between et o and et p this was not important in the previous studies which mixed up the terms for example trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 compared the hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite 1948 turc 1961 priestley and taylor 1972 and jensen and haise 1963 equations under humid climate conditions zarch et al 2015 compared hargreaves and samani 1985 priestley and taylor 1972 makkink 1957 turc 1961 jensen and haise 1963 blaney and criddle 1950 thornthwaite 1948 and penman 1948 equations under arid climate conditions among various equations only the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation estimated et o there were more cases that mixed the et o and et p equations and the two items have been compared frequently winter et al 1995 xing et al 2008 tabari 2010 poyen et al 2016 3 3 4 pan evaporation based type of et o equations besides the above mentioned temperature based radiation based and combination types of equations et o can also be estimated by observed pan evaporation data measuring evaporation by pans has a long history because measuring evaporation with a pan is simple and has low cost but there is no unified standard of pan use it is applicable in determining et o or crop water requirements for irrigation scheduling wmo recommends the adoption of the us class a evaporation pan 1 21 m in diameter 25 5 cm in depth and mounted on a wooden open frame platform set on the ground as the standard instrument after comparing measurements from three evaporimeters that are widely used in the two largest national networks stanhill 1976 fao adopts it as a method to estimate et o called pan evaporation method which is described as 2 et o k pan e pan where e pan is pan evaporation mm day 1 k pan is a pan evaporation coefficient the coefficient k pan can be estimated from some climatic variables and some k pan equations are listed in table 10 heydari et al 2014 compared all of the k pan equations given in table 10 except for allen et al 1998 to estimate et o with the observed e pan data and the fao56 pm equation in qom region north central iran under arid climate the results showed that all k pan equations overestimated et o compared to the fao56 pm r 2 0 86 and the heydari and heydari 2014 coefficient method had the best adaptation rmse 0 49 mm day gundekar et al 2008 compared the k pan equations of cuenca 1989 snyder 1992 pereira et al 1995 and orang 1998 in the semiarid climate region of iran and concluded that the performance ranking of the different approaches were snyder 1992 orang 1998 cuenca 1989 and the percentage errors were 4 9 6 2 and 14 4 respectively the pereira et al 1995 method had the worst performance and was eliminated from further analysis sentelhas and folegatti 2003 estimated et o values from class a e pan data using different k pan equations in a semi arid region in brazil and compared et o values with measured weighing lysimeter values they found that the best k pan model was cuenca 1989 with an agreement index value of 0 927 aschonitis et al 2012 estimated the et o values based on k pan equations of cuenca 1989 snyder 1992 pereira et al 1995 orang 1998 and allen et al 1998 and compared the et o results with asce pm in thessalonik greece under a semi arid mediterranean climate the results showed that the pereira et al 1995 equation had the best performance r 2 0 875 followed by the allen et al 1998 r 2 0 870 cuenca 1989 r 2 0 855 and orang 1998 methods r 2 846 respectively while the snyder 1992 equation had the worst performance r 2 0 638 although there were some differences between the et o values predicted by pan evaporation based methods and other types of et o equations stanhill 2002 and pan evaporation data required cost of the equipment time stanhill 1965 both could be used to estimate et o except for the methods that introduced a pan coefficient k pan researchers also developed quantitative et o relationships directly from e pan data snyder et al 2005 reviewed the equations for estimating et o from e pan and provided a simple method to convert e pan to et o for arid climatic conditions written as follows 3 et o 10sin 0 5π epan 0 79 0 0035 lnf 2 0 0622lnf 19 2 equation 3 accounts for fetch differences by first adjusting the e pan rates to values expected for 100 m of grass fetch however the method requires calibration in more humid or windier climates in order to eliminate the need for rh and u data that are often unavailable snyder et al 2005 rotstayn et al 2006 combined the models of thom et al 1981 and linacre 1994 and proposed a pan evaporation model later called the penpan equation written as follows 4 lepan δrn 2 4lγf u es ea δ 2 4γ where l is the latent heat of vaporization of water j kg 1 in recent years the penpan model has been widely applied in many locations around the world and it has performed satisfactorily padmakumari et al 2013 azorin molina et al 2015 liu and sun 2016 li et al 2018b 4 the differences and connections between et p and et o 4 1 from the concepts and developments of et p and et o a connection could be found among the concepts of et p after penman 1956 gave a description of potential transpiration the et p descriptions anon 1956 penman 1956 penman 1963 wmo 1963 jensen 1968 dingman 1992 mainly emphasized the conditions that could influence the et rates of crops including 1 vegetation characteristics such as completely shading the ground homogeneous height 2 the situation of evaporating transpiration surface such as aerodynamically rough surface 3 the growth condition of crops such as adequately supplied with water in optimal water and nutritional status so it was more like a description of crop potential evapotranspiration which was given by jensen 1963 rather than potential evapotranspiration which was given by thornthwaite 1948 the description of et p given by thornthwaite 1948 attempted to describe the maximum amount of water vapor occurring in a region including the et from crops and the e from water surfaces such as rivers lakes or reservoirs in order to determine whether some region was dry or not the standard definition and estimation procedures for et o are given by fao 56 and asce it should be noticed that this new term is invented to distinguish the ambiguous meaning from et p though the rigorous definition of this term actually comes from several confusing descriptions of et p as mentioned above the term et o has been widely used in hydrology mojid et al 2015 pham et al 2018 agronomy ismail and el nakhlawy 2018 samuel et al 2018 wu et al 2019 irrigation science ali et al 2018 srivastava et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 and meteorology lin et al 2018 paredes and pereira 2019 zhang et al 2019a b et o is mixed up with et p to some extent helm et al 2016 because for a long time the two have shared concepts and equations but it is clear that et p and et o are different a clearer description of et p was given by granger 1989 although granger 1989 considered potential evaporation to be the same as potential evapotranspiration and did not differentiate them there were several definitions of et p which considered a variety of evaporating surfaces the variables that could influence the process of et p included radiation temperature vapor pressure relative humidity and wind based on the influential terms granger 1989 identified five definitions of et p namely evaporation rates which could occur if i the surface was brought to saturation ep 1 the surface was brought to saturation and the energy supplied to the surface was held constant ep 2 iii the surface was brought to saturation and the atmospheric parameters and the energy supplied to the surface was held constant ep 3 iv the surface was brought to saturation and the energy supplied and the surface temperature were held constant ep 4 and v the surface was brought to saturation and the atmospheric parameters and the surface temperature were held constant ep 5 only ep 2 ep 3 and ep 5 were useful of which ep 5 was the most proper summary of et p because the conditions were ideal to let the value of et reach the maximum or potential valueand the numerical relationship among these three terms is ep 5 ep 3 ep 2 katerji and rana 2011 discussed the relationship between et p et c and et o by comparing the different kinds of resistances including the aerodynamic resistance the crop structure resistance and the crop stomatal resistance they pointed out that et o and et p were not equivalent et p aimed at defining the maximum evaporation demand for a given climate however this concept was proven to be inappropriate because the evaporation climatic demand was not only linked to the climate but also to the kind of evaporative surface e g bare soil water surface crop so et o was suggested as an alternative concept to be used only in the studies of crop water requirements based on the development history of et p and et o shown in fig 1 it is not surprising that the concept of et p overlaps with et o in fact et o can be considered to be a specific form of et p mckenney and rosenberg 1993 suggest that et o is similar to et p with the exception that the leaf surfaces are typically not wet and a reference crop is specified the reference crop is a kind of ideal hypothetical and non existing crop so that et o also is a kind of theoretical result which can not occur in reality and that is similar with the basis of et p the subordinate relationships of et c et a et p and et o to et are shown in fig 2 et contains several related subconcepts including et c et a et p and et o both et p and et o can be connected to et a so they have a certain commonality as well et c is a part of et a because it reduces the scope of et a to crops to distinguish it from such as forest et a 4 2 applications of et p and et o ambiguity in applications of et o and et p equations were common because the formulas were selected arbitrarily in many cases although et o and et p originated from evaporation or evapotranspiration and were used ambiguously et p has been applied more frequently in hydrology environmental science and meteorology while et o has been applied more frequently in agronomy agriculture and irrigation for example et p is a very important input variable for estimating some meteorological drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi for which the thornthwaite 1948 equation is used to calculate et p however after the fao56 pm equation is selected as the standard et o equation allen et al 1998 it is frequently used to estimate et p for pdsi oudin et al 2010 li et al 2014 tao and xu 2015 zhang et al 2016 in another drought index ai aridity index et p is a useful variable various equations of ai involve et p which is estimated by the thornthwaite 1948 barrow 1992 budyko et al 1974 or holdridge 1947 united nations educational 1979 in some hydrological models such as variable infiltration capacity vic cao et al 2018 chen and xie 2018 mizukami et al 2018 mike system hydrological european mike she asyhari et al 2018 torres et al 2018 waseem et al 2018 et p is also an important variable for simulating precipitation and runoff in agronomy accurate calculations of et o are the prerequisite for obtaining crop water requirements or et c and also the fundamental basis for formulating agricultural irrigation system and other measures tyagi et al 2000 lewis and allen 2017 the calculations of et c from et o are the common method with a dimensionless reduction coefficient namely a crop coefficient k c to represent comprehensive effects of various kinds of resistance including surface resistance stomatal resistance and diffusion resistance ding et al 2015 marin et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the single crop coefficient the dual crop coefficient and the shuttleworth and wallace 1985 are the three most popular et c methods that apply et o as a key variable in the single crop coefficient approach the coefficient integrates differences of the soil water evaporation and crop transpiration rates between the crop and the grass reference surface the k c is basically the ratio of et c to et o it represents an integration of the effects of four primary characteristics that distinguish a crop from the reference grass the relationship of the single coefficient method is described as 5 et c k c et o in the dual crop coefficient approach two crop coefficients are used one is the basal crop coefficient kcb to describe plant transpiration and the other is soil water evaporation coefficient k e to describe evaporation from the soil surface allen et al 1998 the dual crop coefficient relationship is described as follows 6 et c k c et o k cb k e et o similar to the dual crop coefficient approach the shuttleworth wallace model considers plant transpiration and soil water evaporation separately based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 the two components are weighted by a set of coefficients that represent the combination of soil and canopy resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 5 conclusions the confusion between et o and et p has existed for a long time to distinguish their meanings properly and to use them appropriately provides an opportunity to improve the accuracy of specific et estimates et o and et p are related to each other both terms are used to refer to changes in water and energy and both are derived from the concept of e however by nature they are different choosing appropriate terms according to different research content is necessary to improve the rigor of the research and understanding these two different concepts separately is also a prerequisite for their correct usage et o and et p are developed for different timescales and have different meanings and definitions et p is more applied to large areas such as open water land reservoir and atmosphere while et o aims to obtain the water quantity needs of a specific crop with its standard equation and k c thus the definition of et o is stricter and more specific than that of et p the et o and et p equations were regularly mixed up at early dates but they were classified into different types in the 1980s the et p equations included the dalton temperature based radiation based and combination types the et o equations included the temperature based radiation based combination types and pan evaporation based types generally the concept of et p is broad and covers a wide range while the concept of et o is specific and clear with matching equations or alternatives et p is more suitable than et o for describing et in large areas while et o is more suitable for studying water demands of a particular crop although et o and et p were not used clearly in the past the two terms should be used with more clear distinction in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

china potential evapotranspiration et p and reference crop evapotranspiration et o differ in their developments concepts equations and application fields however many researchers have mixed the utilization of the two terms thus it is necessary to clarify the terms to guide their proper usage the aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive review of the concepts developments equations and applications of et p and et o the review shows clearly that the concepts and developments of et p and et o have long histories the original concept of et p was proposed by thornthwaite and that core idea with various improvements has been used up to now the development of et o although initially confused with that of et p was formally defined as a standard method the et p equations were classified as mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination types while the et o equations were classified as being temperature based radiation based combination and pan evaporation based both terms are connected to evaporation and evapotranspiration and although there have been ambiguities et p has been applied mostly in hydrology meteorology and climatology while et o has been applied mostly in agronomy agriculture irrigation and ecology et p has been used to estimate drought indices and et o has been used in the single and dual crop coefficient methods and the shuttleworth wallace method for estimating actual field evapotranspiration this review serves to clarify the origins definitions and uses of et p and et o it addresses common ambiguities between the terms in order to aid the proper utilization of the terms abbreviations e evaporation e p potential evaporation et evapotranspiration et a actual evapotranspiration et p potential evapotranspiration

potential evapotranspiration reference crop evapotranspiration temperature based radiation based combination based 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration et a is an important component of the water balance and it is used widely in many fields such as agronomy hydrology climatology meteorology ecology and environmental science liu et al 2019 peng et al 2019 tasumi 2019 mcmahon et al 2013 two closely related concepts are potential evapotranspiration et p and reference crop evapotranspiration et o although both et p and et o provide estimates of atmospheric evaporative demand they are based on different concepts and have different equations which can help to differentiate the terms till present the utilization and application of et p and et o have been confused for decades some researchers clearly distinguished the two terms yates and strzepek 1994 allen et al 1998 irmak and haman 2003 peng et al 2017 but others treated et p and et o as identical concepts and used similar equations for their estimations tanner and pelton 1960 xu and singh 2002 mardikis et al 2005 vicente serrano et al 2010 dinpashoh et al 2011 one typical example is that hargreaves and samani 1982 using potential while hargreaves and samani 1985 used the term reference crop thus there is a necessity to clarify et p and et o and reduce the ambiguity in using the terms early applications of et p were in meteorology and hydrology but later its applications were extended to other fields parajuli et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a b for example in agronomy it was related to crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling yao et al 2020 feng et al 2019 due to vagueness in the definition et p was not always applied properly development of the concept of et o helped to solve some et p misapplication problems because agronomists began to use the concept of et o in irrigation scheduling design and estimation of crop evapotranspiration et c by connecting single or dual crop coefficient method s specifically sammis et al 1985 bausch and neale 1987 allen et al 1998 gong et al 2019 there has not been a review to clearly differentiate et p and et o thus in this paper differences in the concepts and developments frequently used equations and the applications of et p and et o are systematically reviewed and differentiated this research provides useful references and clarifies the concepts to guide researchers on properly differentiating et p and et o in their future investigations 2 the concept and development of potential and reference crop evapotranspiration 2 1 evaporation originally evaporation e was used to obtain et a as to its estimation the dalton types of equations have been the mainstream formulas according to dalton 1802 windspeed and humidity are major factors that influence the rate of e and an open water evaporation mm formula has been established livingston 1909 1 e c a bu e s e a where e s is saturated vapor pressure kpa e a is actual vapor pressure kpa u is wind speed m s 1 a b and c are empirical coefficients equation 1 is simple and has been widely accepted later it was extended or modified to produce a variety of dalton mass transfer type equations for example by fitzgerald 1886 trabert 1896 meyer 1915 meyer 1926 horton 1919 and rohwer 1931 table 1 the modifications improved the accuracy of estimating e however the core part of e had not been touched and could not be explained clearly vapor pressure and wind speed do influence e but not exclusively the concept of e gradually extended into various kinds of evaporation from ranges of study areas including soil surface evaporation open water evaporation and vegetation transpiration from the 1940s researchers realized that it was insufficient to simply limit their research to e water vapor is produced not only on the ground and water surfaces but also from the transpiring plants penman 1948 pointed out that surface energy had a big impact on e penman 1948 studied e of different surfaces open water bare soil and grass included energy balance for the first time and further developed the mechanisms of dalton s theory but not the concepts 2 2 potential evapotranspiration the development of potential evapotranspiration et p endured for several decades to distinguish it from et a the term potential evapotranspiration was first put forward by thornthwaite 1948 after investigating the rainfall and water consumptive use for several states in the usa et p represents the atmospheric evaporation demand namely the amount of water that can be transferred to the air from land or water means the combined evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from plants represents the transport of water from the earth back to the atmosphere the reverse of precipitation thornthwaite 1948 it is the maximum value of e that would occur under ideal conditions the initial aim is to decide whether the study area is dry using an aridity index ai that incorporates et p ai p et p 1 where p donates precipitation thornthwaite 1948 where the negative positive ai value means dry wet this ai based index has been applied extensively till the present in drought related research huo et al 2013 zarch et al 2015 li et al 2017 penman 1948 gave a new formula to calculate the evaopration from different surfaces after several years experiments at rothamsted experimental station however he did not mention the terms potential or evapotranspiration in his paper he only mentioned evaporation several years later penman 1956 1963 provided a new concept to discuss the water consumed through vegetation called potential transpiration which was a measure of the transpiration rate from an extensive short green cover completely shading the ground and adequately supplied with water this description was referenced and redefined many times for example anon 1956 defined it as the rate of water vapor loss from a short grass canopy under the following conditions grown in a large surface during an active growth stage completely covering the soil of homogeneous height in optimal water and nutritional status and the world meteorological organization wmo 1963 defined it as the quantity of water vapor which could be emitted by a surface of pure water per unit surface area and unit time under the existing atmospheric conditions these descriptions along with a new term potential evaporation e p were similar to the penman 1956 1963 definition but had more specific requirements for vegetations somehow the term e p was mixed up with et p given by thornthwaite 1948 and used as such till now choudhury 1997 vörösmarty et al 1998 donohue et al 2010 therefore the estimation methods of both concepts were confused too one specific term which was suitable for descriptions given above was called crop potential evapotranspiration which was proposed by jensen 1968 and defined as the rate of evapotranspiration for a given crop at a given stage of growth when water is not limiting and other factors such as insects diseases and nutrients have not materially restricted plant development this definition considered the limitations that could influence evapotranspiration such as the evaporating surface and crop growth conditions as a supplement to the definition differences among several crops under different growing conditions were provided by jensen 1968 however this concept is rather complex and not enough information is available for enough crops to address global et and he also defined et p in his paper as the upper limit of evapotranspiration that occurs with a well watered agricultural crop that has an aerodynamically rough surface such as alfalfa with 30 50 cm of top growth so as to establish the relationship between et p and et c with a term called crop coefficient k c van wijk and de vries 1954 in fact both from the description and the calculation procedure the concept is more like the pre definition of et o this is the first description of et p in agronomy which is obviously different from the meaning of et p coined by thornthwaite 1948 and used popularly for example dingman 1992 gave a description of et p namely the rate at which evapotranspiration would occur from a large area completely and uniformly covered with growing vegetation which has access to an unlimited supply of soil water and without advection or heating effects apparently this description summarizes the ideal conditions which can allow the amount of water escaping from a crop to reach the maximum in other words it gets to the potential level from the different descriptions of et p given above the similarity of the concepts appeared after penman 1956 coined the term potential transpiration they were all descriptions that related to et c and included some limitations on the crop growth conditions or the evaporation transpiration surfaces obviously they were different from the original aim of et p which was given by thornthwaite 1948 the original aim of et p was to represent the water demand or maximum water at large scale regions and et was the actual amount of water evaporated from the entire region several later proposed new concepts of et p focused on the vegetation or crops with small surfaces under this premise et p inevitably meant the quantity or vapor rate of water escape only from leaves it was essential to study the water change among different plants by using a specific term but it was also necessary to assure that the term used was unique instead of having multiple meanings therefore inventing a new term to differentiate from et p was imperative 2 3 reference crop evapotranspiration the reference crop evapotranspiration et o term was proposed concerning the evaporating surfaces and other factors which could influence the rate of et c jensen et al 1971 wright and jensen 1972 jensen 1974 the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations summarized the studies about crop water requirements and defined et o as the rate of evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of 8 to 15 cm tall green grass cover of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water doorenbos and pruitt 1977 where reference crop was an ideal crop and represented one specific kind of surface grass and alfalfa were selected as short and tall reference crops initially although other different grasses could be considered such as ryegrass or fescue marsh et al 1980 biran et al 1981 frank 1981 beard 1985 snyder et al 1987 nevertheless alfalfa is difficult to grow in some tropical climates or regions that have severely cold winter temperatures it is therefore difficult to define a specific cultivar of alfalfa which will grow effectively worldwide in order to provide local validation of alfalfa et o methods allen et al 1989 allen et al 1994b reports that the ratio of alfalfa to grass et c estimated values is 1 37 therefore the accuracy of et o calculations is related to crop types besides variety of crops the situation of crop growth is also required for the et c determination for example the height of vegetation surrounding a lysimeter must be identical to that of the vegetation in the lysimeter van bavel et al 1963 perrier et al 1974 meyer et al 1990 allen and pruitt 1991 pruitt 1991 from this point of view it may be inappropriate to take natural vegetation as a reference crop allen et al 1994b suggested a new definition of et o that used a constant value of surface resistance could avoid the variations of other relevant climatic variables that counteracted one another in many situations the selection of constant height and surface resistance parameters was a compromise that might not represent reality in all climatic regimes and the fixed surface resistance implied a moderately dry soil surface resulting from about a weekly irrigation frequency allen et al 1998 later fao adopted this et o concept formally in fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 and described the new definition clearly as the rate of evapotranspiration from a hypothetic crop with an assumed crop height 12 cm and a fixed surface resistance 70 s m and albedo 0 23 which would closely resemble evapotranspiration from an extensive surface of green grass cover of uniform height actively growing completely shading the ground and not short of water hereafter it is denoted as fao56 et o based on the relatively strict fao56 et o definition the american society of civil engineers asce added another alfalfa as the reference crop described as a tall crop with an approximate height of 0 5 m there are two evaporation surfaces with different canopy resistance aerodynamic resistance and timescale for the tall and short reference crops walter et al 2000 hereafter it is denoted as asce et o obviously the definition of et o is clearer and more specific than et p since to distinguish et of plants from a large region is one of the major objectives of et o with special and ideal constraints of plant conditions and the estimating equation it is convenient to estimate the amount of water evaporating from crop and vegetation surfaces helpful to solve water requirement issues and to provide useful irrigation plan information for agronomists and farmers 3 equations for estimating et p and et o 3 1 the classification of et p and et o equation types besides the ambiguities in the concepts and developments between et p and et o the biggest confusion involves the equations that are used to estimate et p and et o although a number of equations for computing et o or et p have been developed the formula types are not clearly classified singh and xu generalize and propose some simple classification rules for equations used in systematic studies and were used popularly tabari et al 2011 djaman et al 2018b song et al 2019 they conclude that the mass transfer aerodynamic based methods utilize the concept of eddy motion transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface to the atmosphere singh and xu 1997 the estimation methods requiring only temperature as an input variable be considered as temperature based methods xu and singh 2001 and the empirical radiation based equations for estimating e p generally are based on the energy balance xu and singh 2000 as for combination based equations they take both aerodynamic theory and energy balance into account penman 1948 in this paper according to the previous classification the et p equations are classified as being dalton mass transfer based temperature based radiation based and combination types while the equations of et o are classified as being temperature based radiation based pan evaporation based and combination types the different types of et p and et o equations will be further examined moreover large number of models also are given to provide accurate ways to estimate them mcmahon et al 2016 3 2 equations for estimating et p 3 2 1 mass transfer type of et p equations the mass transfer type of et p equations originated from the dalton type equations of e and were similar in form table 2 these equations played important roles several decades ago in investigating variations and patterns of et p the application of this type of et p equation clearly showed the ambiguity between et p and e during the early stages of et p studies the mass transfer based equations from the 1950s to 1970s that have been applied frequently are presented in table 2 the mass transfer based et p equations were compared with other et p or et o methods by several researchers for example tabari and talaee 2011 compared the albrecht 1950 equation with 30 different equations including the fao56 penman monteith equation which strictly speaking is for estimating et o and pan evaporation for a humid climate it was found that the albrecht 1950 equation did not perform well when compared to other equations however the performance of the albrecht 1950 equation improved when it was compared with the brockamp and wenner 1963 equation for a humid climate djaman et al 2016 muniandy et al 2016 when the meteorological data were lacking these equations were useful to roughly estimate et p once the parameters were adjusted rim 2000 azhar and perera 2010 zhai et al 2010 jakimavičius et al 2013 valipour 2014 however most of the mass transfer based et p equations have been abandoned because the inherent mechanisms were quite different from those used in the current understanding of et p and the results estimated with these equations had large deviations bormann 2011 3 2 2 temperature based type of et p equations the temperature based et p equations date back to the 1920s jensen et al 1990 and they are some of the earliest methods for estimating evapotranspiration xu and singh 2001 thornthwaite 1948 proposed a temperature based et p equation after comparing the relationship between precipitation temperature and water change in several states of the united states since then additional temperature based et p equation were proposed and applied the temperature based type of et p equations which have been applied extensively in the world are presented in table 3 the thornthwaite 1948 equation is used and cited worldwide 9386 citations because it is simple and has the least data requirement camargo et al 1999 bautista et al 2009 chang et al 2018 pereira and pruitt 2004 it has also been compared with other equations by several researchers for example niaghi et al 2013 compare the thornthwaite 1948 equation with several other equations in northwestern iran where the terrestrial climate has mild dry summers and cold snowy winters valipour et al 2017 analyzed 16 different equations including the thornthwaite 1948 equation at 18 weather stations in iran under various climate conditions including arid semiarid very humid and mediterranean the thornthwaite 1948 equation generally underestimates et p in the study regions and linear regression does not improve its performance sentelhas et al 2010 also report that the thornthwaite 1948 equation underestimates et p in humid areas the thornthwaite 1948 equation is originally used for estimating et p but later researchers used it also for computing et o ahmadi and fooladmand 2008 bautista et al 2009 this confusion in use should be clarified because the background and the concept reflected by thornthwaite 1948 does not fit et o pereira and pruitt 2004 moeletsi et al 2013 chang et al 2018 the blaney and criddle 1950 equation has also been frequently used 1031 citations for estimating et p because it has generally good performance and easy data acquisition tabari et al 2011 rácz et al 2013 its original development is for humid areas where the advective effect is usually negligible ali and shui 2009 applications of the blaney and criddle 1950 equation in various climates are given in table 4 large differences in performance are found for different study areas or climate zones this variability in performance is not unique to the blaney and criddle 1950 equation it is common for other equations when applied to a wide range of climate areas and conditions in addition to studies on the thornthwaite 1948 and blaney and criddle 1950 equations the performances of other temperature based et p equations were also investigated for example liu et al 2017 compared the mccloud 1955 and hamon 1960 equations with lysimeter data at xiaotangshan a semi arid area in china muniandy et al 2016 compared the hamon 1960 schendel 1967 and romanenko 1961 equations with pan evaporation in humid areas of malaysia and found that the schendel 1967 equation had the worst performance among 26 different equations while the szász 1973 equation performed the best among the temperature based type equations in general the applications of the mccloud 1955 hamon 1960 romanenko 1961 baier and robertson 1965 schendel 1967 and szász 1973 equations were much fewer than the thornthwaite 1948 and blaney and criddle 1950 equations some of them were abandoned generally with bad performance and unreasonable or insufficient meteorological variables such as szász 1973 and mccloud 1955 3 2 3 radiation based type of etp equations the radiation based type of et p equations revealed the empirical relationship between the radiation and et p the radiation based equations could be looked upon as simplified forms of the penman 1948 equation and reasonably reliable estimates were expected for short periods jensen and haise 1963 some popularly used radiation based et p equations are presented in table 5 among the radiation based et p equations the priestley and taylor 1972 equation has been applied throughout the world 5645 citations ranking first among the radiation based et p equations the priestley and taylor 1972 equation was derived for saturated conditions and open water sites where wind effects were negligible the wind function multiplied by the vapor pressure deficit term which is an important term of the combination based equations was simplified and combined with the influence of land cover and site condition which was represented by α 0 gavin and agnew 2004 pereira 2004 arasteh and tajrishy 2008 more information about the modified α 0 can be found in cristea et al 2012 the priestley and taylor 1972 equation included the partial concept of equilibrium evaporation developed by bouchet 1963 the main idea of equilibrium evaporation is that with the increase of water supply the actual evaporation increases although the potential evaporation decreases the initial surface has saturated conditions where the actual and potential evaporation rates are equal this relationship is recognized as the complementary relationship szilagyi et al 2017 crago and qualls 2018 han and tian 2018 the priestley and taylor 1972 equation is useful for estimating et p under available energy limited conditions brutsaert and stricker 1979 still there may be a faulty basic premise in the priestley and taylor 1972 equation because it is not true that large scale advection is independent of the surface energy balance mcnaughton and spriggs 1989 the results are generally good but vary with regions for example li et al 2016 report that the priestley and taylor 1972 equation performs better than other equations when compared to eddy covariance measurements in wuwei china under an arid climate yoder et al 2005 report that it overestimates et p in tennessee usa when compared with lysimeter data berengena and gavilán 2005 consider the priestley and taylor 1972 equation to be unsuitable for southern spain when compared with pan evaporation measurements because it is very sensitive to wind speed cristea et al 2012 conclude that the coefficient may be the main reason for the varied results under different climates and evaporation surfaces the jensen and haise 1963 equation has the second largest number of citations 1039 times among the radiation based et p equations however tabari et al 2011 conclude it is the worst among the radiation based equations when comparing to the fao56 pm equation in rasht iran humid climate muniandy et al 2016 compare the jensen and haise 1963 equation to pan evaporation in malaysia and find it to be an inaccurate method trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 report that the jensen and haise 1963 equation performs at a moderate level in the balkan peninsula humid climate the makkink 1957 equation has also been frequently used 653 citations because of its low need for climate information yoder et al 2005 compare the makkink 1957 equation with lysimeter data in tennessee usa and find that the estimated et p values are lower than the measured values r 2 is 0 9 the result is similar when comparing the estimated et p values by the makkink 1957 equation to pan evaporation data at vaud switzerland xu and singh 2000 r 2 is 0 9 in south central nebraska usa a sub humid and semi arid area the makkink 1957 equation does not perform well when compared with 16 other equations irmak and irmak 2008 the turc 1961 equation 283 citations performed well in many studies under different climate conditions for example xu et al 2013 compared four equations including the turc 1961 fao56 pm priestley and taylor 1972 and hargreaves and samani 1985 with lysimeter data at the kunshan irrigation and drainage experiment station in the taihu region of china under a humid subtropical monsoon climate and found that the rmse value of the turc 1961 equation was the lowest among the four equations liu et al 2017 compared 16 equations including the turc 1961 equation and others with lysimeter data at xiaotangshan beijing in north china plain a semiarid zone the performance of the turc 1961 equation was moderate but it out performed other radiation based equations such as the priestley and taylor 1972 makkink 1957 and jensen and haise 1963 equations irmak and irmak 2008 compared 17 et p et o equations including 3 radiation type et p equations in a transition zone between sub humid and semiarid with strong winds in nebraska usa and found that the makkink 1957 equation had a larger r 2 value than the turc 1961 and priestley and taylor 1972 equations yoder et al 2005 compared 8 et p et o equations including 3 radiation type et p equations in a region of the usa where the weather is influenced by cold dry continental air and warm moist air with lysimeter data they found that the makkink 1957 equation had the same r 2 value 0 90 as the turc 1961 equation which was larger than that of the priestley and taylor 1972 equation r 2 0 86 djaman et al 2015 compared 16 et p et o equations including 2 radiation type et p equations at experimental sites with a typical sahelian climate with a short rainy season they found that the performance of the makkink 1957 equation was better than the priestley and taylor 1972 equation in general underestimation is the main characteristic of radiation based equations wind effects are not included which influences the aerodynamic resistance since increasing wind speed can lower it and this part of et is not counted appropriately irmak and irmak 2008 thus it is only recommended to use this kind of equations in low wind regions 3 2 4 combination type of et p equations the combination type of et p equation includes both energy balance and aerodynamic aspects because et is a process by which liquid water is converted to vapor phase and then the vapor moves the aerodynamic part is related to dalton 1802 mass transfer theory the velocity term and vapor pressure term are two core terms of it penman 1948 presents a typical combination type of et p equation which considers impacts of not only air temperature but also other climatic factors it is the first combination type equation for estimating the amount of water escape from humid surfaces although it had an initial aim to calculate e some combination type of et p equations are presented in table 6 the penman 1948 penman 1963 and monteith 1965 equations have been the most commonly used combination type et p equations cited 8108 1075 and 6148 times respectively the penman 1948 and penman 1963 equations have not only been studied for different objectives but they have also been modified for different conditions by various researchers such as wright and jensen 1972 thom and oliver 1977 linacre 1977 and jensen et al 1970 the penman 1963 equation was a modified form of the penman 1948 equation which included wind velocity and monteith 1965 added a new coefficient r s to represent the crop surface roughness initially the penman 1948 and penman 1963 equations were used to estimate et p but they were combined with the monteith 1965 equation for different crop surface conditions the so called penman monteith equation was later recommended by fao as a standardized method for estimating et o allen et al 1998 during this stage especially from 1965 to 1998 the penman monteith equation was used with great ambiguity because some scientists used it to estimate et p and others to estimate et o even after 1998 this has happened the combination type of et o equations are not discussed in further detail here because they are presented in section 4 3 3 unsteadiness emerged when comparing the penman 1948 equation with other methods it was the best one among 6 et p et o equations when all were compared to eddy covariance values in wuwei china li et al 2016 but it did not perform well in kharagpur india from kashyap and panda 2001 or in iran from valipour et al 2017 irmak and irmak 2008 conducted a comparison of 11 combination based et p equations among 17 et p et o equations with the criterion of the asce pm equation allen et al 2005 and showed that among the combination type et p equations the penman 1963 equation had the best performance with a rmse of 0 3 mm day 1 followed by the penman 1948 wright and jensen 1972 and van bavel 1966 equations with rmse values of 0 39 0 48 and 1 04 mm day 1 respectively kashyap and panda 2001 compared 10 et p et o equations five of which were combination type et p equations and showed that the monteith 1965 equation gave the best performance under a sub humid climate condition with a rmse of 0 08 mm day 1 the thom and oliver 1977 van bavel 1966 and linacre 1977 equations were also applied many times cited 543 511 and 446 times respectively the van bavel 1966 and rijtema 1966 equations are essentially based on the original penman 1948 formula with modified individual coefficients according to the specific conditions of the study area however all of the penman type equations need several observed meteorological variables which can be difficult to attain in some developing countries lacking widespread meteorological information so it is common to use other types of equations as alternative in these regions and low accuracy of et p is reasonably a predictable consequence 3 3 different types of equations for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration 3 3 1 temperature based type of et o equations the temperature based et o equations are basically similar in structure to those of et p because both represent quantities of atmospheric evaporation demand most et o equations have several different coefficients more or less like a modification of et p some popularly used temperature based et o equations are given in table 7 actually it can be somewhat difficult to distinguish these temperature based et o equations in table 7 from those for et p this is also true for the other types of et o equations the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation 2791 citations improved upon the hargreaves 1975 equation 274 citations hargreaves and samani 1982 equation 1464 citations and the hargreaves et al 1985 equation 435 citations it is the most popularly used temperature based et o equation this equation has been calibrated with eight years of alta fescue grass lysimeter data from davis california because the accuracy of the hargreaves equation varies with the climatic conditions of study regions moeletsi et al 2013 gafurov et al 2018 the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation mainly the three main coefficients in the equations is modified several times by using lysimeter data for example by droogers and allen 2002 trajkovic 2007 ravazzani et al 2011 tabari and talaee 2011 berti et al 2014 dorji et al 2016 feng et al 2017 lobit et al 2017 and tang et al 2019 see details in table 7 hargreaves and allen 2003 provide details on the development history of the hargreaves series equations allen et al 1998 recommend the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation as a way to estimate et o when solar radiation wind speed and or relative humidity data are lacking because it requires little weather data and has good agreement with measured values the doorenbos and pruitt 1977 equation which is commonly noted as the fao24 blaney criddle equation is widely used 1811 citations because it has small data requirement the good performance may stem from its original development for humid areas where the advective effect is usually negligible irmak et al 2003a ali and shui 2009 hargreaves and samani 1982 indicate that the fao24 blaney criddle equation gives similar et o estimates as the fao56 pm method at 16 australian locations under a wide range of climate conditions rizaiza and al osaimy 1996 indicate that irrigation water requirements for vegetables and perennial crops are similar to the values estimated by the fao24 blaney criddle equation in the western region of saudi arabia the results of george et al 2002 show that the fao24 blaney criddle equation provides the best results for davis california and jagdalpur india with humid climates however the unsuitableness of the equation in arid climates also is indicated for example bakhtiari et al 2011 apply 6 different et o et p equations and compare them with lysimeter measurement data at the iranian academic center iran under a semiarid climate and find that the fao24 blaney criddle equation has a moderate ranking among the 6 equations lópez urrea et al 2006 compare 7 different et o et p equations with lysimeter data under a semiarid climate in spain and the fao24 blaney criddle equation has the worst performance the other temperature based equations mentioned in table 7 do not have widespread use because of their complexity and low accuracy for example the kharrufa 1985 equation performs poorly and it either overestimates or underestimates et o in several studies under different climate types chen et al 2005 rosenberry et al 2007 paiva et al 2012 zhang 2018 süheri et al 2019 3 3 2 radiation based type of et o equations similar to the temperature based et o equations there are also many radiation based et o equations some of them have been commonly applied in the world the frequently used radiation based et o equations are presented in table 8 the ritchie 1972 equation was the most cited 2447 citations among the radiation based et o equations although it was initially proposed to estimate et p ritchie 1972 introduced a model to compute daily soil water evaporation and plant transpiration which was used in dssat v3 5 crop models as part of the soil water balance module jones et al 2003 it also has been applied to estimate water use by way of water balances in hydrological and agricultural studies aggarwal et al 2017 carson et al 2017 yang et al 2017 lópez lópez et al 2018 or in other crop models keating et al 2003 jones et al 2017 however sometimes it performed poorly for example berengena and gavilán 2005 compared 10 et o et p equations and the ritchie 1972 equation performed worse than the priestley and taylor 1972 equation with r 2 values of 0 797 and 0 830 respectively researchers have compared equations under various climate conditions and the results varied greatly xystrakis and matzarakis 2010 chose 13 et o et p equations and compared their performance at crete in southern greece a semiarid zone against the fao56 pm equation as the standard method their results showed that among the radiation based equations the hansen 1984 equation performed best the modified turc 1961 equation by xu and singh 2000 ranked second best although it had a more complicated formula for requiring rh data which rendered the hansen 1984 equation more favorable but modified makkink 1957 equation by xu and singh 2000 had great bias and was not recommended in the study region tomar 2015 compared 19 et o et p equations including 5 et p equations against the fao56 pm equation in pantanagar udham singh nagar and the results showed that the modified priestley and taylor 1972 equation by xu and singh 2000 underestimated et o values r 2 was 0 87 the two equations from irmak et al 2003b overestimated values r 2 values were 0 89 and 0 87 respectively while the castaneda and rao 2005 modified makkink 1957 equation gave better estimates of et o r 2 was 0 93 gabriela and irmak 2015 studied the influence of the climate variables on the estimates of 13 equations including 7 et p and 6 et o equations at five different regions under different climate conditions they found that the doorenbos and pruitt 1977 equation fao24 radiation equation ranked first in the three regions where the climate conditions were mediterranean type subhumid and semiarid and semiarid but performed poorly in a humid subtropical climate the two equations from irmak et al 2003b ranked moderately overall in all study areas except that the second equation et o 0 289r n 0 023t a 0 489 performed well in subhumid and semiarid climates the variability and instability are still major characteristics of this type of equations but from the research results the radiation based equations have good performance in semiarid or semi humid climate regions where the speed velocity data are lacking so the term is ignored in this type of equations 3 3 3 combination type of et o equations similar to the combination type et p equations the combination type of et o equations have been applied extensively in different parts of the world when the required geological and weather data are available of these the fao 56 pm equation was found to be the most accurate method to estimate et o at daily or monthly timescales and was recommended as the standard method by the fao some frequently used combination type et o equations including the fao 56 pm are given in table 9 the combination type equations for estimating et o have been modified several times based on penman 1963 valiantzas 2006 2012 2013a contributed significantly to the modification process valiantzas simplified the penman 1963 equation by indirectly computing the radiation and aerodynamic terms using the standardized calculation procedure recommended by shuttleworth and maidment 1993 and allen et al 1998 and by using calibrations with meteorological data obtained from the climwat global database smith 1993 the equations that valiantzas 2006 2012 2013a proposed have generally performed well ahooghalandari et al 2017 djaman et al 2017 the fao56 pm et o equation allen et al 1998 is a modified monteith 1965 equation it has been used widely for many purposes because of a strong theoretical basis allen et al 1994b and rigorous model description allen et al 1994a mostly this equation is used as the standard method against several other et o equations for example li et al 2018a compared 13 et o et p equations including 5 et p equations of 4 different types against the fao56 pm equation and found that when the comprehensive climatic datasets were available the valiantzas 2013b was the best equation because it had a simple computation procedure and correlated well linearly to the fao56 pm equation song et al 2019 analyzed the performance of 12 et o et p including 3 et p equations in different sub regions and different time periods of northeastern china against the fao 56 pm equation they found that the valiantzas 2006 equation was the best alternative method to fao56 pm equation during the crop growing period ahmad and choi 2018 koudahe et al 2018 and mokhtari et al 2018 considered that the radiation term was the main factor influencing estimation accuracy followed by temperature and wind speed therefore alternatives to the fao 56 pm that require little weather data are important in some regions where the climatic data are insufficient the asce pm equation allen et al 2005 included alfalfa as another reference crop and proposed two coefficients c n and c d for reference type and calculation time step respectively to distinguish alfalfa and grass djaman et al 2018a analyzed the ratio of et o alfalfa to et o grass and their correlations in new mexico usa calculated with the asce pm equation showed that there was a strong correlation between et o alfalfa and et o grass 0 96 r 2 0 98 at 6 sites lopez urrea et al 2006 compared the fao56 pm and asce pm equations under semiarid conditions in spain with lysimeter data the average values estimated by the fao56 pm et o were equal to the mean measured values but the average values estimated by the asce pm equation were 4 higher 0 45 mm h than the mean measured lysimeter values and simple linear regression and error analysis statistics indicated that agreement between the two estimation methods and lysimeter was quite good in the study area gavilán et al 2008 compared the asce and fao56 pm equations at 31 weather stations for hourly and daily timescales in andalusia southern spain they found that differences between the two estimates were greater when evaporative demand increased and results of the fao56 pm equation were 6 smaller than those of the asce pm equation for hourly et o the suitability of each equation depended on the specific conditions in different studies which implied that the same results for equations might not be obtained in different studies and different conclusions could be acquired from similar study conditions generally the asce pm and fao56 pm equations are accepted as standard methods djaman et al 2018b gurski et al 2018 quej et al 2018 it is necessary to point out that various et p equations have been compared with the fao56 pm equation although in this paper we tried to strictly distinguish between et o and et p this was not important in the previous studies which mixed up the terms for example trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 compared the hargreaves and samani 1985 thornthwaite 1948 turc 1961 priestley and taylor 1972 and jensen and haise 1963 equations under humid climate conditions zarch et al 2015 compared hargreaves and samani 1985 priestley and taylor 1972 makkink 1957 turc 1961 jensen and haise 1963 blaney and criddle 1950 thornthwaite 1948 and penman 1948 equations under arid climate conditions among various equations only the hargreaves and samani 1985 equation estimated et o there were more cases that mixed the et o and et p equations and the two items have been compared frequently winter et al 1995 xing et al 2008 tabari 2010 poyen et al 2016 3 3 4 pan evaporation based type of et o equations besides the above mentioned temperature based radiation based and combination types of equations et o can also be estimated by observed pan evaporation data measuring evaporation by pans has a long history because measuring evaporation with a pan is simple and has low cost but there is no unified standard of pan use it is applicable in determining et o or crop water requirements for irrigation scheduling wmo recommends the adoption of the us class a evaporation pan 1 21 m in diameter 25 5 cm in depth and mounted on a wooden open frame platform set on the ground as the standard instrument after comparing measurements from three evaporimeters that are widely used in the two largest national networks stanhill 1976 fao adopts it as a method to estimate et o called pan evaporation method which is described as 2 et o k pan e pan where e pan is pan evaporation mm day 1 k pan is a pan evaporation coefficient the coefficient k pan can be estimated from some climatic variables and some k pan equations are listed in table 10 heydari et al 2014 compared all of the k pan equations given in table 10 except for allen et al 1998 to estimate et o with the observed e pan data and the fao56 pm equation in qom region north central iran under arid climate the results showed that all k pan equations overestimated et o compared to the fao56 pm r 2 0 86 and the heydari and heydari 2014 coefficient method had the best adaptation rmse 0 49 mm day gundekar et al 2008 compared the k pan equations of cuenca 1989 snyder 1992 pereira et al 1995 and orang 1998 in the semiarid climate region of iran and concluded that the performance ranking of the different approaches were snyder 1992 orang 1998 cuenca 1989 and the percentage errors were 4 9 6 2 and 14 4 respectively the pereira et al 1995 method had the worst performance and was eliminated from further analysis sentelhas and folegatti 2003 estimated et o values from class a e pan data using different k pan equations in a semi arid region in brazil and compared et o values with measured weighing lysimeter values they found that the best k pan model was cuenca 1989 with an agreement index value of 0 927 aschonitis et al 2012 estimated the et o values based on k pan equations of cuenca 1989 snyder 1992 pereira et al 1995 orang 1998 and allen et al 1998 and compared the et o results with asce pm in thessalonik greece under a semi arid mediterranean climate the results showed that the pereira et al 1995 equation had the best performance r 2 0 875 followed by the allen et al 1998 r 2 0 870 cuenca 1989 r 2 0 855 and orang 1998 methods r 2 846 respectively while the snyder 1992 equation had the worst performance r 2 0 638 although there were some differences between the et o values predicted by pan evaporation based methods and other types of et o equations stanhill 2002 and pan evaporation data required cost of the equipment time stanhill 1965 both could be used to estimate et o except for the methods that introduced a pan coefficient k pan researchers also developed quantitative et o relationships directly from e pan data snyder et al 2005 reviewed the equations for estimating et o from e pan and provided a simple method to convert e pan to et o for arid climatic conditions written as follows 3 et o 10sin 0 5π epan 0 79 0 0035 lnf 2 0 0622lnf 19 2 equation 3 accounts for fetch differences by first adjusting the e pan rates to values expected for 100 m of grass fetch however the method requires calibration in more humid or windier climates in order to eliminate the need for rh and u data that are often unavailable snyder et al 2005 rotstayn et al 2006 combined the models of thom et al 1981 and linacre 1994 and proposed a pan evaporation model later called the penpan equation written as follows 4 lepan δrn 2 4lγf u es ea δ 2 4γ where l is the latent heat of vaporization of water j kg 1 in recent years the penpan model has been widely applied in many locations around the world and it has performed satisfactorily padmakumari et al 2013 azorin molina et al 2015 liu and sun 2016 li et al 2018b 4 the differences and connections between et p and et o 4 1 from the concepts and developments of et p and et o a connection could be found among the concepts of et p after penman 1956 gave a description of potential transpiration the et p descriptions anon 1956 penman 1956 penman 1963 wmo 1963 jensen 1968 dingman 1992 mainly emphasized the conditions that could influence the et rates of crops including 1 vegetation characteristics such as completely shading the ground homogeneous height 2 the situation of evaporating transpiration surface such as aerodynamically rough surface 3 the growth condition of crops such as adequately supplied with water in optimal water and nutritional status so it was more like a description of crop potential evapotranspiration which was given by jensen 1963 rather than potential evapotranspiration which was given by thornthwaite 1948 the description of et p given by thornthwaite 1948 attempted to describe the maximum amount of water vapor occurring in a region including the et from crops and the e from water surfaces such as rivers lakes or reservoirs in order to determine whether some region was dry or not the standard definition and estimation procedures for et o are given by fao 56 and asce it should be noticed that this new term is invented to distinguish the ambiguous meaning from et p though the rigorous definition of this term actually comes from several confusing descriptions of et p as mentioned above the term et o has been widely used in hydrology mojid et al 2015 pham et al 2018 agronomy ismail and el nakhlawy 2018 samuel et al 2018 wu et al 2019 irrigation science ali et al 2018 srivastava et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 and meteorology lin et al 2018 paredes and pereira 2019 zhang et al 2019a b et o is mixed up with et p to some extent helm et al 2016 because for a long time the two have shared concepts and equations but it is clear that et p and et o are different a clearer description of et p was given by granger 1989 although granger 1989 considered potential evaporation to be the same as potential evapotranspiration and did not differentiate them there were several definitions of et p which considered a variety of evaporating surfaces the variables that could influence the process of et p included radiation temperature vapor pressure relative humidity and wind based on the influential terms granger 1989 identified five definitions of et p namely evaporation rates which could occur if i the surface was brought to saturation ep 1 the surface was brought to saturation and the energy supplied to the surface was held constant ep 2 iii the surface was brought to saturation and the atmospheric parameters and the energy supplied to the surface was held constant ep 3 iv the surface was brought to saturation and the energy supplied and the surface temperature were held constant ep 4 and v the surface was brought to saturation and the atmospheric parameters and the surface temperature were held constant ep 5 only ep 2 ep 3 and ep 5 were useful of which ep 5 was the most proper summary of et p because the conditions were ideal to let the value of et reach the maximum or potential valueand the numerical relationship among these three terms is ep 5 ep 3 ep 2 katerji and rana 2011 discussed the relationship between et p et c and et o by comparing the different kinds of resistances including the aerodynamic resistance the crop structure resistance and the crop stomatal resistance they pointed out that et o and et p were not equivalent et p aimed at defining the maximum evaporation demand for a given climate however this concept was proven to be inappropriate because the evaporation climatic demand was not only linked to the climate but also to the kind of evaporative surface e g bare soil water surface crop so et o was suggested as an alternative concept to be used only in the studies of crop water requirements based on the development history of et p and et o shown in fig 1 it is not surprising that the concept of et p overlaps with et o in fact et o can be considered to be a specific form of et p mckenney and rosenberg 1993 suggest that et o is similar to et p with the exception that the leaf surfaces are typically not wet and a reference crop is specified the reference crop is a kind of ideal hypothetical and non existing crop so that et o also is a kind of theoretical result which can not occur in reality and that is similar with the basis of et p the subordinate relationships of et c et a et p and et o to et are shown in fig 2 et contains several related subconcepts including et c et a et p and et o both et p and et o can be connected to et a so they have a certain commonality as well et c is a part of et a because it reduces the scope of et a to crops to distinguish it from such as forest et a 4 2 applications of et p and et o ambiguity in applications of et o and et p equations were common because the formulas were selected arbitrarily in many cases although et o and et p originated from evaporation or evapotranspiration and were used ambiguously et p has been applied more frequently in hydrology environmental science and meteorology while et o has been applied more frequently in agronomy agriculture and irrigation for example et p is a very important input variable for estimating some meteorological drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi for which the thornthwaite 1948 equation is used to calculate et p however after the fao56 pm equation is selected as the standard et o equation allen et al 1998 it is frequently used to estimate et p for pdsi oudin et al 2010 li et al 2014 tao and xu 2015 zhang et al 2016 in another drought index ai aridity index et p is a useful variable various equations of ai involve et p which is estimated by the thornthwaite 1948 barrow 1992 budyko et al 1974 or holdridge 1947 united nations educational 1979 in some hydrological models such as variable infiltration capacity vic cao et al 2018 chen and xie 2018 mizukami et al 2018 mike system hydrological european mike she asyhari et al 2018 torres et al 2018 waseem et al 2018 et p is also an important variable for simulating precipitation and runoff in agronomy accurate calculations of et o are the prerequisite for obtaining crop water requirements or et c and also the fundamental basis for formulating agricultural irrigation system and other measures tyagi et al 2000 lewis and allen 2017 the calculations of et c from et o are the common method with a dimensionless reduction coefficient namely a crop coefficient k c to represent comprehensive effects of various kinds of resistance including surface resistance stomatal resistance and diffusion resistance ding et al 2015 marin et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the single crop coefficient the dual crop coefficient and the shuttleworth and wallace 1985 are the three most popular et c methods that apply et o as a key variable in the single crop coefficient approach the coefficient integrates differences of the soil water evaporation and crop transpiration rates between the crop and the grass reference surface the k c is basically the ratio of et c to et o it represents an integration of the effects of four primary characteristics that distinguish a crop from the reference grass the relationship of the single coefficient method is described as 5 et c k c et o in the dual crop coefficient approach two crop coefficients are used one is the basal crop coefficient kcb to describe plant transpiration and the other is soil water evaporation coefficient k e to describe evaporation from the soil surface allen et al 1998 the dual crop coefficient relationship is described as follows 6 et c k c et o k cb k e et o similar to the dual crop coefficient approach the shuttleworth wallace model considers plant transpiration and soil water evaporation separately based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 the two components are weighted by a set of coefficients that represent the combination of soil and canopy resistances shuttleworth and wallace 1985 5 conclusions the confusion between et o and et p has existed for a long time to distinguish their meanings properly and to use them appropriately provides an opportunity to improve the accuracy of specific et estimates et o and et p are related to each other both terms are used to refer to changes in water and energy and both are derived from the concept of e however by nature they are different choosing appropriate terms according to different research content is necessary to improve the rigor of the research and understanding these two different concepts separately is also a prerequisite for their correct usage et o and et p are developed for different timescales and have different meanings and definitions et p is more applied to large areas such as open water land reservoir and atmosphere while et o aims to obtain the water quantity needs of a specific crop with its standard equation and k c thus the definition of et o is stricter and more specific than that of et p the et o and et p equations were regularly mixed up at early dates but they were classified into different types in the 1980s the et p equations included the dalton temperature based radiation based and combination types the et o equations included the temperature based radiation based combination types and pan evaporation based types generally the concept of et p is broad and covers a wide range while the concept of et o is specific and clear with matching equations or alternatives et p is more suitable than et o for describing et in large areas while et o is more suitable for studying water demands of a particular crop although et o and et p were not used clearly in the past the two terms should be used with more clear distinction in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10684,sugarcane is a major agro industrial crop in semiarid regions and generally has high evapotranspiration standardized reference evapotranspiration et and location specific crop coefficients are used to estimate crop evapotranspiration however precise information on crop coefficient kc is a major impediment in semiarid environments field studies were conducted during two seasons of 2015 and 2016 in clay soils to determine crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients kc of sugarcane for semiarid india the experimental area was cultivated with irrigation applied at 7 10 days interval by a drip irrigation system in addition to rainfall and the irrigation scheduling was based on field water balance approach the crop evapotranspiration was determined by field water balance reference evapotranspiration eto by the penman monteith approach while crop coefficient were computed through the standard fao 56 methodology on an annual basis the total reference evapotranspiration eto and crop evapotranspiration etc were 1318 1426 mm and 1291 1388 mm respectively two years average sugarcane crop evapotranspiration estimated by field water balance method was 1339 mm year 1 the irrigation water requirement andeffective rainfall was 991 mm year 1 and 424 mm year 1 respectively two years results showed that there was a notable symmetry between kc obtained from field water balance measurements and fao 56 reported kc the determined kc values for tillering grand growth and maturity stages of sugarcane were 0 70 1 20 and 0 78 respectively the kc values were found 25 5 4 and 20 4 less during the tillering grand growth and maturity stage respectively over the fao 56 kc values the 2nd order polynomial equation was fitted with crop coefficient as the dependent variables and ratio of days after transplanting to total crop period as the independent variable the daily values of kc from equation is very useful towards efficient management of irrigation water in terms of making a decision support system soil moisture based crop yield modeling crop water requirement based computer programme or mobile application automation of irrigation system in the major sugarcane growing countries of semi arid regions keywords crop coefficient kc crop evapotraspiration etc days after planting dap fao 56 field water balance growth stage sugarcane 1 introduction globally agriculture contributes to more than 80 share of available water in many countries especially for developing countries this share is reducing continuously due to realization of increased need of water for industries and domestic urban and rural water supply on the other hand there is limitation on developing new water resources due to technical and economic reasons reduced availability of appropriate sites for the storage reservoir as we have utilized almost all the sites increased cost of developing new water resources and social and environmental concerns the climate change and variability also contribute reduced water availability due to increased frequency of extreme events thus in context of global water scarcity for agriculture the precise management of available water for irrigation is important sugarcane is the crop that contributes immensely to the regional economics of many countries including brazil india china pakistan mexico and in many of these regions water is the limiting factor for agriculture incidentally in these countries water consumption for sugarcane is disproportionate compared to other crops for example in the western state of india maharashtra sugarcane is cultivated over 6 of the total cropped area and consumes almost 70 of the total water available commission for cost and prices cacp 2015 thus there is large inequality in water utilization for sugarcane compared with other crops ironically around 80 of the sugarcane is grown in regions that have a history of water scarcity on an average 3000 4000 mm of water is applied to sugarcane depending on the method of irrigation while water requirement based on evapotranspiration is less than 2000 mm shrivastava et al 2011 flood irrigation is mostly adopted to irrigate sugarcane in canal command areas providing 2 3 times excess water than required this is mainly due to the beliefs among farmers that more the water is applied to sugarcane more yield is obtained of course this is not true therefore there is a need to provide the information to sugarcane farmers on precise water measurement on other hand the improved irrigation methods such as drip irrigation are being increasingly adopted but the lack of knowledge on the periodical water requirement for which the information such as crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficient is needed the knowledge of crop evapotranspiration etc and periodical or stagewise crop coefficients is important to improve water use efficiency in sugarcane inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 a variety of approaches are available for estimating crop evapotranspiration the most widely accepted two step approaches which includes the quantification of the atmospheric demand through the calculation of reference evapotranspiration eto and the incorporation of the surface characteristics through a crop factor called as crop coefficient kc is generally followed in the estimation of crop evapotranspiration doorenbose and pruitt 1979 doorenbos and kassam 1979 suggested kc value of 0 50 1 00 1 30 0 80 and 0 60 for establishment crop development mid season late season and at harvest for sugarcane however these values are based on global averages of kc and that too mostly from temperate regions they emphasized the strong need for local calibration of crop coefficients since the climatic conditions encountered in the field differ from the standard conditions omary and izuno 1995 in the south florida usa derived crop coefficients by penman eo estimate 1948 version with a peak mid season value of 1 27 allen et al 1998 further proposed kc values for sugarcane in the range 0 40 1 25 for the initial low canopy and mid full canopy periods of crop development to 0 75 for the end harvest of development without providing the information on the derivation of these values inman bamber and mcglinchey 2005 inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 determined kc for sugarcane as 0 40 1 25 and 0 70 during the initial stage mid season and at harvestusing the bowen ratio energy balance method in australia and swaziland in lysimeter studies at tropical brazil cardoso et al 2015 obtained sugarcane crop coefficients values as 0 31 1 15 1 25 and 0 90 for initial development mid and late sugarcane growth stages respectively however for similar study in myanmar win et al 2014 reported these kc values as 0 53 0 81 1 25 and 1 27 respectively silva et al 2012 derived crop coefficients from field water balance measurements at tropical brazil and reported kc values for initial mid season and late stages as 0 56 1 43 and 1 32 respectively on the whole all above studies emphasized the strong need for determination of crop coefficients since the climatic conditions and its interaction with crop vary in their spatial temporal scale the crop coefficients for calculating sugarcane evapotranspiration have not been developed for semi arid environments hence this study taken the field water balance method was used for this purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characterization the field experiment was carried out during the annual seasons of 2015 and 2016 at experimental farm of department of irrigation and drainage engineering mahatma phule krishi vidyapeeth rahuri located in the western region of maharashtra state india latitude 19 48 n longitude 19 57 e altitude 657 m the average annual precipitation is 555 mm out of total annual rainfall about 80 percent rains are during south west monsoon june to september while the rest is from north east monsoon october november the distribution of rain is erratic uneven and ill distributed over 15 37 rainy days the annual mean maximum and minimum temperature range between 21 2 c 41 8 c and 3 0 c 24 6 c respectively the annual mean maximum and minimum relative humidity range from 59 to 90 and 21 61 respectively the annual mean pan evaporation ranges from 2 3 14 9 mm day 1 while the sunshine hours range from 7 to 9 day 1 the annual mean wind speed ranges from 3 2 13 09 kmhr 1 agro climatically the area falls under the scarcity zone of country the local climate is semiarid with subtropical sugarcane cultivation 2 2 soil measurements a trench was opened in the experimental site for extracting soil samples that were used to determine the textural class bulk density field capacity and wilting point the groundwater level at the experimental site dropped down to 2 0 m during the growing season the experimental area was cultivated with irrigations applied at 7 10 days interval by a drip irrigation system in addition to rainfall table 1 shows the main soil moisture constant of experimental soil the textural class of the soil of experimental site was clay the soil was medium alkaline in reaction ph 8 36 with electrical conductivity of 0 40 ds m 1 the depth of soil was 1 8 m the average field capacity and permanent wilting point were 41 4 and 17 respectively and bulk density was 1 27 mg m 3 doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported a maximum root penetration of the sugarcane plant of 100 cm whereas most of the roots were concentrated in the top 75 80 cm of soil with only few roots below 20 cm therefore a root zone depth of 75 cm was considered for planning the observations 2 3 root zone depth the observations of root length were recorded by destructive method upto tillering stage or development stage 135 days after planting for each moisture content observation the effective root zone was determined by carefully uprooting one healthy plant before uprooting the soil surrounding the plant was fully made saturated and then removed slowly fao 24 the root length was measured with tape and approximately the soil depth in which 80 of the water intake takes place was taken as the effective root zone for irrigation purpose michael 2010 for further measurements five root study plots were prepared by growing sugarcane in closed soil filled plastic tanks above the ground and effective root zone was measured directly by noting the root length in different soil layers 2 4 soil moisture content soil moisture content were measured prior to every irrigation and in between two irrigations approximately at midpoint of irrigation interval during the entire crop season gravimetric method was used for determination of the soil moisture content the soil samples were collected upto root zone depth at the depths of 15 30 45 60 and 75 cm the soil moisture was also monitored whenever the soil profile was recharged by precipitation 2 5 application of irrigation water the scheduling of irrigation was based on soil moisture content in the root zone the irrigation was done to reﬁll the proﬁle to field capacity the irrigation was initiated when soil water in the root zone approached but never depleted more than 65 fao 56 of available soil water the depth of water applied for irrigation was calculated by equation formulated as below w h e n r e θ f t z t b d t θ t z t b d t d t i 1 n θ f t z t b d t θ t z t b d t r e w h

contents at 33 kpa and 1500 kpa were worked out for different soil layers of experimentation with pressure plate apparatus 2 6 soil moisture storage the changes in soil moisture storage δs were determined by considering the soil layers from soil surface down to the depth of effective root zone the depth of moisture depleted from each layer viz 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 75 cm during each soil moisture measurement were computed the change in soil moisture storage δs was determined for successive observation days i e soil moisture storage at the previous observation day minus soil moisture storage at next observation day as δ s s 1 s 2 or δ s t θ t 1 z t 1 θ t z t 1 b d t 1 θ t 1 i 1 n θ i z t 1 i 1 n z i b d t 1 i 1 n b d i where s 1 and s 2 are the soil moisture storage at previous observation day and soil moisture storage at next observation day respectively θ t 1 and θ t are the soil moisture storages between two consecutive observation days in other means t 1 and t are the previous and successive day of observation t followed by t 1 z t 1 is the depth of effective root zone at t 1 day mm i the incremental root depth 150 mm and n is number of i layers b d t 1 is bulk density of effective root zone at t 1 day mg m 3 the fao 56 has suggested that soil water balance method can only give evapotranspiration estimates over long periods of the order of week long or ten day periods therefore the interval between two successive soil moisture measurements was maintained between 7 10 days however during rainy days it was extended to 15 days allen et al 1998 2 7 crop evapotranspiration the simplified soil moisture balance method was used to estimate crop evapotranspiration etc in root zone between consecutive soil moisture measurement days for this water content in root zone depletion was calculated which essentially involves adding and subtracting of losses and gains of various parameters of the soil water budget expressed in terms of water depth rainfall irrigation and capillary rise of groundwater towards the root zone was considered to decrease the root zone depletion in root zone whereas crop evapotranspiration and percolation losses were considered to increase depletion in root zone the moisture balance expressed in terms of depletion at the end consecutive soil moisture measurement days was calculated by following equation fao 56 e t c i r e r o d p c r δ s f δ s where e t c is crop evapotranspiration i is depth of irrigation applied r e is effective portion of rainfall ro is runoff from the soil surface dpis deep percolation below the root zone cr is capillary rise in case of a shallow water table δsf is horizontal subsurface flow in or out of the root zone and δsis change in soil proﬁle water storage respectively all parameters were expressed in mm the soil water balance equation based on the above stated simplified equation was formulated as below θ t z t 1 b d t 1 θ t 1 z t 1 b d t 1 i t 1 t 1 t r e t 1 t e t c σ t 1 t e t c θ t 1 θ t z t 1 b d t 1 i t 1 σ t 1 t r e where e t c is the crop evapotranspiration from in the active root zone mm between t 1 and t th day time interval r e the effective rainfall mm

measured between two successive moisture content observation events from t 1to t mis the total number of two successive events in entire growth period the effective rainfall was computed by criteria mentioned in fao document no 25 dastane 1974 surface runoff was considered nil as experimental site had flat topography and no runoff was observed during the periods of irrigation or precipitation in addition to overcome runoff problem in irrigation process drip irrigation system was used which did not produced surface runoff in irrigation process no shallow water table existed at the study site thus only percolation below the root zone was of concern however to attain this purpose drip irrigation system was used for irrigation water supply as it has distinct advantage of slow water supply rate which produced no deep percolation and equaling it as zero for analysis capillary rise was assumed to be zero because moisture table was more than 1 m below the bottom of root zone at experimental site for prevention entry of subsurface flow a 1 m deep interceptor drain was dug around the entire periphery of experimental plot in addition to this the mole drains were laid at 4 5 m lateral distance in entire experimental field 2 8 reference evapotranspiration daily measurements of air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity for estimating eto as well as rainfall were made from automatic weather station observatory situated at sugarcane experimental site for period from 12thdecember 2014 to 23rd december 2015 and 24th december 2015 to 31st december

crop coefficients were computed for different growth stages of sugarcane the growth period was divided into four stages establishment 0 45 days after planting tillering 60 135 dap grand growth 135 300 dap and maturity 300 360 dap the initial stage was assumed from the beginning of planted sugarcane to the full expansion of root volume in nursery tillering stage is just after 15 days of transplanting the seedlings when tillers are starts to emerge from mother shoot and ends when tiller starts to elongate at the beginning of grand growth the grand growth stage is from then upto the timing when cane has achieved its full growth the maturity stage continues from then until harvest these four growth stages correspond to those defined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 respectively as initial development mid season and end season in this investigation later three stages were considered and initial stage i e initial stage was skipped with a view that all the farmers of this region essentially raised nursery to attain good germination at initial stage further nursery planting of sugarcane has distinct advantages like spare time for field preparation saving of three irrigations and healthy plant selection etc the crop evapotranspiration values obtained by monitoring the soil moisture balance in the crop root zone and eto values estimated using climatic data for specified periods the crop coefficient kc were computed as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration etc eto for the respective period 7 10 daysinterval the polynomial equation was

particular equation using best fit equation the daily kc values were estimated for both seasons and average daily kc values from 50 dap i e from 10 days after transplanting were then estimated by taking the average of estimated daily kc values of 2015 and 2016 2 10 agronomic practices the sugarcane seedlings rose in nursery and transplanted after 35 days in a 6 27 m field sugarcane seedlings transplanted at the spacing of 1 5 m 0 6 m during nursery irrigations applied at 2 days interval as per measured crop evapotranspiration etc values through climatological method allen et al 1998 after transplanting the common irrigation was applied continued upto15 days until the seedling was established the value of crop coefficient for common irrigation was referred as 0 40 fao 56 the other agronomic practice viz weeding off barring earthing up fertigation schedule and operation to prevent lodging were followed as per recommended by parent agricultural university 3 results and discussion 3 1 root zone depth the root zone depth at the time of transplanting was 50 mm at 53 and 47 dap in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 1 during both the years the root length of sugarcane increased linearly with advancement in age of crop the rate of root length expedites at the end of tillering stage 115 125 dap thereafter effective root zone increased approximately up to 204 days and 217 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively and then root zone becomes constant at 750 mm and subsequent samples were taken up to 750 mm 3 2 soil moisture the soil moisture content increased with crop evapotranspiration during the growth period the moisture content found increased with increase in soil layer depth upto 45 cm and thereafter it slightly decreased at 60 cm and lowest moisture content was observed at 75 cm depth fig 2 during tillering stage more soil moisture depletion was observed however when plant canopy fully developed after tillering the soil moisture depletion was uniform in all layers singh and mohan 1994 raghuvanshi and wallender 1998 the particular growth stage and incident of rainfall greatly influenced the soil moisture content invariably of growth stages and barring rainfall events the moisture content was closer to field capacity 3 3 field water balance 3 3 1 irrigation water applied the irrigation depth differed for a particular growth stage in a season due to differences in crop water use and duration of stage table 2 this was probably caused mostly by differences in annual weather conditions wiedenfeld 2004 invariably in both seasons grand growth stage identified as high water requirement stage due to its long duration 165 170 days this followed by tillering stage 75 80 days and maturity stage 65 70 days the irrigation water applied in grand growth stage of 2016 was less than half 372 4 mm compared to 2015 799 mm because of the higher contribution of rainfall in crop water use in 2016 however irrigation water amount in tillering stage 277 6 mm was higher in 2016 than in 2015 211 1 mm because of the higher evaporative demands in both the seasons the lowest irrigation water was required during the maturity stage this happened because of decline in crop water use etc with crop maturity during this period and may also indicate that the crop was taking advantage of moisture stored in the soil profile from off season rainfall wiedenfeld robert 2000 3 3 2 effective rainfall the rainfall received during 2015 and 2016 was 313 2 mm 38 rainy days and 534 3 mm 40 rainy days respectively in both the years all rainfall received was effective table 2 the occurrence of rainfall affected the depth of irrigation in different growth stages in 2015 the effective rainfall was 43 6 less than average rainfall 555 mm therefore more irrigation water applied in that season however in 2016 effective rainfall 534 3 mm contributed almost 41 of crop consumptive use and therefore demands of irrigation water reduced to half in 2016 among different growth stages more irrigation applied in tillering stage february mid may in 2016 due to high evaporative demand the respective years grand growth stages coincided with rains that contributed consumptive use and therefore demand of irrigation water was differed in 2015 and 2016 season in maturity stage no rainfall received in both the season and thus irrigation amounts for both the seasons were almost for this stage 3 3 3 crop evapotranspiration the total depths of water use during 2015 2016 and average of two seasons were 1386 8 mm 1291 mm and 1338 9 mm respectively table 2 the sugarcane evapotranspiration etc varies considerably from place to place depending on weather conditions texture of soil and duration of the crop numerous approaches have been used by different researchers to measure or estimate sugarcane evapotranspiration thompson and boyce 1967 omary and izuno 1995 allen et al 1998 wiedenfeld robert 2000 wiedenfeld 2004 chabot et al 2005 silva et al 2012 win et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 cardoso et al 2015 nevertheless its estimate largely depends upon type of approach used by researchers in some studies evaporation from a uswb class a pan allen et al 1998 is common reference for measuring evapotranspiration in many crops including sugarcane using this method wiedenfeld 2004 reported crop evapotranspiration of sugarcane as 1021 mm including annual effective rainfall in semiarid south texas whereas wiedenfeld robert 2000 obtained its value as 968 mm using jensen haise equation for same region in few lysimetric studies thompson and boyce 1967 at pongola south africa found sugarcane evapotranspiration similar to uswb class pan evaporation suggesting a pan factor i e the ratio of etc to pan evaporation of 1 0 likewise win et al 2014 at myanmar and cardoso et al 2015 at tropical brazil reported sugarcane evapotranspiration as 1369 84 mm and 1438 23 mm respectively omary and izuno 1995 in south florida usa used a novel way of measuring actual sugarcane evapotranspiration by monitoring daily changes in the height of the water table and estimated annual etc of sugarcane as 1060 mm differently chabot et al 2005 measured transpiration of sugarcane in gharb plain morocco using the sap flow technique and found that sugarcane evapotranspiration were 30 more than those predicted from the penman monteith equation however they believed that the sap flow technique is an inappropriate method for determining transpiration rates from a heterogeneous canopy like that of sugarcane because of uncertainties in the methodology anderson et al 2015 measured sugarcane evapotranspiration at two irrigated sugarcane fields 1191 mm and 1389 mm of maui hawaii usa in contrasting climates by eddy covariance towers they used the short et0 and tall etr vegetation versions of the american society for civil engineers asce equation the only field water balance study reported sugarcane evapotranspiration as 1686 7 mm for tropical condition of brazil silva et al 2012 thus on an annual basis the sugarcane evapotranspiration ranges from 950 to 1700 mm depending on the location from different parts of the world therefore sugarcane evapotranspiration amounting 1339 mm derived by field water balance in this study seems to be appropriate for semiarid conditions 3 4 crop coefficients of sugarcane the kc values with confidence bounds for both the years are shown graphically in the form of polynomial equation with respect to the ratio of days to total crop period fig 3 the average kc of two years ranged from 0 31 to 1 29 table 3 in both the seasons kc consistently increased from 0 43 to 1 03 during 50 130 days after planting dap thereafter it showed gradual increases due to crop development in form of cane elongation mid season stage during the mid season i e 130 300 dap kc increased from 1 08 and then remain same in the range of 1 13 1 04 with peak value as 1 29 the highest kc value occurred during 200 220 dap the kc values during the late season 300 360 dap decreased gradually from 1 04 to 0 56 thompson and boyce 1971 in a lysimeter study observed that etc rates declined by about 30 after crops lodged an effect that lasted upto crop maturity the two years average kc values are represented in the form of following second order polynomial equation the variation of kc is shown in fig 4 k c t 4 695 t t 2 5 566 t t 0 360 3 4 1 comparison with fao 56 the crop coefficient values derived from field soil water balance during the tillering grand growth and maturity stages for sugarcane in a semi arid region were 0 70 1 20 and 0 78 respectively the corresponding values of fao 56 are 0 90 1 25 and 0 98 respectively table 4 it is pointed out that at 60 dap low kc value 0 43 was attained as against 0 65 of fao 56 however it hiked up after 25 30 days i e at 90 dap the average kc value for tillering stage was found lower 0 70 than fao 56 value 0 94 earlier win et al 2014 also reported the lower kc value for development stage as 0 81 estimated from lysimeters for myanmar the trend of curves for mid season of both the seasons showed very close association with fao 56 kc curve however average kc value for grand growth mid season stage was estimated slight lower 1 20 over 1 25 fao 56 the lower kc obtained in this investigation may be due to different climatic conditions of semi arid region which primarily altered the reference crop evapotranspiration i e eto differently inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 and cardoso et al 2015 confirmed the current 1 25 value whereas omary and izuno 1995 and silva et al 2012 reported higher value over 1 25 nevertheless this difference was mainly to due to variation in et measurement approaches weather conditions duration of the crop methodological assumptions and accuracy the decline phase of estimated kc curve showed early fall with lower kc values 0 78 over fao 56 values 0 98 overall there was a good association between kc developed and kc fao in average of both seasons however some variations observed along the growth stages in both seasons it was revealed that reduction observed between fao kc and developed kc was 25 5 4 and 20 4 for tillering stage grand growth stage and maturity stage respectively table 2 the average reduction was 16 6 this may be due to the conditions of the study area soil conditions and crop variety etc whereas fao kc equation is developed for global climatic conditions pereira luis et al 2015 also reported the advances in adopted kc research included techniques to estimate kc based on the architecture of crops notably height and fraction of ground cover in practice results reported here showed that fao kc could lead to over estimation in irrigation scheduling of sugarcane in semi arid conditions and the use of kc values developed in this study would lead in correction of water requirement for sugarcane further in this study the kc value measured over the growth period of sugarcane have been converted in the equation form leading to estimation of kc for any specific day and its use in decision support system 4 conclusion sugarcane have immense role in economy of sugarcane growing countries but its water consumption scenario represents the unfavorable perspective in irrigated agriculture underestimation of its crop evapotranspiration etc can lead to suboptimal yield due to water stress whereas overestimation can lead to excessive applied water thus reducing water available for other uses or additional acreage and decreasing economic competitiveness the crop coefficient kc is the important parameter influencing the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc of any crop and knowledge of periodical or stagewise crop coefficients of sugarcane is important this investigation addressed the important issue of irrigation scheduling provided the information of crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for sugarcane by field water balance method under semi arid conditions the crop evapotranspiration of sugarcane was 1339 4 mm including irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall as 991 mm and 424 mm respectively the determined sugarcane kc values for tillering development stage grand growth mid season and maturity stage end season was 0 70 1 20 and 0 78 respectively the kc values are 16 6 lesser than those suggested by fao 56 for sugarcane the study pointed out that fao kc could lead to over estimation in irrigation scheduling of sugarcane in semi arid conditions and the use of kc values developed in this study would lead in correction of water requirement the sugarcane kc values converted in 2nd order polynomial equation form leading to estimation of kc for any specific day the daily values of kc from equation is very useful to researchers working in area of sugarcane water management especially making a decision support system soil moisture based crop yield modeling crop water requirement based computer programme or mobile application automation of irrigation system etc overall this study provided the adoptable information for sugarcane toward efficient management of irrigation water leading to proportionalities appropriately the imbalance of sugarcane cultivated area and use of irrigation water in the major sugarcane growing countries of semi arid regions declaration of competing interest

10684,sugarcane is a major agro industrial crop in semiarid regions and generally has high evapotranspiration standardized reference evapotranspiration et and location specific crop coefficients are used to estimate crop evapotranspiration however precise information on crop coefficient kc is a major impediment in semiarid environments field studies were conducted during two seasons of 2015 and 2016 in clay soils to determine crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients kc of sugarcane for semiarid india the experimental area was cultivated with irrigation applied at 7 10 days interval by a drip irrigation system in addition to rainfall and the irrigation scheduling was based on field water balance approach the crop evapotranspiration was determined by field water balance reference evapotranspiration eto by the penman monteith approach while crop coefficient were computed through the standard fao 56 methodology on an annual basis the total reference evapotranspiration eto and crop evapotranspiration etc were 1318 1426 mm and 1291 1388 mm respectively two years average sugarcane crop evapotranspiration estimated by field water balance method was 1339 mm year 1 the irrigation water requirement andeffective rainfall was 991 mm year 1 and 424 mm year 1 respectively two years results showed that there was a notable symmetry between kc obtained from field water balance measurements and fao 56 reported kc the determined kc values for tillering grand growth and maturity stages of sugarcane were 0 70 1 20 and 0 78 respectively the kc values were found 25 5 4 and 20 4 less during the tillering grand growth and maturity stage respectively over the fao 56 kc values the 2nd order polynomial equation was fitted with crop coefficient as the dependent variables and ratio of days after transplanting to total crop period as the independent variable the daily values of kc from equation is very useful towards efficient management of irrigation water in terms of making a decision support system soil moisture based crop yield modeling crop water requirement based computer programme or mobile application automation of irrigation system in the major sugarcane growing countries of semi arid regions keywords crop coefficient kc crop evapotraspiration etc days after planting dap fao 56 field water balance growth stage sugarcane 1 introduction globally agriculture contributes to more than 80 share of available water in many countries especially for developing countries this share is reducing continuously due to realization of increased need of water for industries and domestic urban and rural water supply on the other hand there is limitation on developing new water resources due to technical and economic reasons reduced availability of appropriate sites for the storage reservoir as we have utilized almost all the sites increased cost of developing new water resources and social and environmental concerns the climate change and variability also contribute reduced water availability due to increased frequency of extreme events thus in context of global water scarcity for agriculture the precise management of available water for irrigation is important sugarcane is the crop that contributes immensely to the regional economics of many countries including brazil india china pakistan mexico and in many of these regions water is the limiting factor for agriculture incidentally in these countries water consumption for sugarcane is disproportionate compared to other crops for example in the western state of india maharashtra sugarcane is cultivated over 6 of the total cropped area and consumes almost 70 of the total water available commission for cost and prices cacp 2015 thus there is large inequality in water utilization for sugarcane compared with other crops ironically around 80 of the sugarcane is grown in regions that have a history of water scarcity on an average 3000 4000 mm of water is applied to sugarcane depending on the method of irrigation while water requirement based on evapotranspiration is less than 2000 mm shrivastava et al 2011 flood irrigation is mostly adopted to irrigate sugarcane in canal command areas providing 2 3 times excess water than required this is mainly due to the beliefs among farmers that more the water is applied to sugarcane more yield is obtained of course this is not true therefore there is a need to provide the information to sugarcane farmers on precise water measurement on other hand the improved irrigation methods such as drip irrigation are being increasingly adopted but the lack of knowledge on the periodical water requirement for which the information such as crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficient is needed the knowledge of crop evapotranspiration etc and periodical or stagewise crop coefficients is important to improve water use efficiency in sugarcane inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 a variety of approaches are available for estimating crop evapotranspiration the most widely accepted two step approaches which includes the quantification of the atmospheric demand through the calculation of reference evapotranspiration eto and the incorporation of the surface characteristics through a crop factor called as crop coefficient kc is generally followed in the estimation of crop evapotranspiration doorenbose and pruitt 1979 doorenbos and kassam 1979 suggested kc value of 0 50 1 00 1 30 0 80 and 0 60 for establishment crop development mid season late season and at harvest for sugarcane however these values are based on global averages of kc and that too mostly from temperate regions they emphasized the strong need for local calibration of crop coefficients since the climatic conditions encountered in the field differ from the standard conditions omary and izuno 1995 in the south florida usa derived crop coefficients by penman eo estimate 1948 version with a peak mid season value of 1 27 allen et al 1998 further proposed kc values for sugarcane in the range 0 40 1 25 for the initial low canopy and mid full canopy periods of crop development to 0 75 for the end harvest of development without providing the information on the derivation of these values inman bamber and mcglinchey 2005 inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 determined kc for sugarcane as 0 40 1 25 and 0 70 during the initial stage mid season and at harvestusing the bowen ratio energy balance method in australia and swaziland in lysimeter studies at tropical brazil cardoso et al 2015 obtained sugarcane crop coefficients values as 0 31 1 15 1 25 and 0 90 for initial development mid and late sugarcane growth stages respectively however for similar study in myanmar win et al 2014 reported these kc values as 0 53 0 81 1 25 and 1 27 respectively silva et al 2012 derived crop coefficients from field water balance measurements at tropical brazil and reported kc values for initial mid season and late stages as 0 56 1 43 and 1 32 respectively on the whole all above studies emphasized the strong need for determination of crop coefficients since the climatic conditions and its interaction with crop vary in their spatial temporal scale the crop coefficients for calculating sugarcane evapotranspiration have not been developed for semi arid environments hence this study taken the field water balance method was used for this purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characterization the field experiment was carried out during the annual seasons of 2015 and 2016 at experimental farm of department of irrigation and drainage engineering mahatma phule krishi vidyapeeth rahuri located in the western region of maharashtra state india latitude 19 48 n longitude 19 57 e altitude 657 m the average annual precipitation is 555 mm out of total annual rainfall about 80 percent rains are during south west monsoon june to september while the rest is from north east monsoon october november the distribution of rain is erratic uneven and ill distributed over 15 37 rainy days the annual mean maximum and minimum temperature range between 21 2 c 41 8 c and 3 0 c 24 6 c respectively the annual mean maximum and minimum relative humidity range from 59 to 90 and 21 61 respectively the annual mean pan evaporation ranges from 2 3 14 9 mm day 1 while the sunshine hours range from 7 to 9 day 1 the annual mean wind speed ranges from 3 2 13 09 kmhr 1 agro climatically the area falls under the scarcity zone of country the local climate is semiarid with subtropical sugarcane cultivation 2 2 soil measurements a trench was opened in the experimental site for extracting soil samples that were used to determine the textural class bulk density field capacity and wilting point the groundwater level at the experimental site dropped down to 2 0 m during the growing season the experimental area was cultivated with irrigations applied at 7 10 days interval by a drip irrigation system in addition to rainfall table 1 shows the main soil moisture constant of experimental soil the textural class of the soil of experimental site was clay the soil was medium alkaline in reaction ph 8 36 with electrical conductivity of 0 40 ds m 1 the depth of soil was 1 8 m the average field capacity and permanent wilting point were 41 4 and 17 respectively and bulk density was 1 27 mg m 3 doorenbos and kassam 1979 reported a maximum root penetration of the sugarcane plant of 100 cm whereas most of the roots were concentrated in the top 75 80 cm of soil with only few roots below 20 cm therefore a root zone depth of 75 cm was considered for planning the observations 2 3 root zone depth the observations of root length were recorded by destructive method upto tillering stage or development stage 135 days after planting for each moisture content observation the effective root zone was determined by carefully uprooting one healthy plant before uprooting the soil surrounding the plant was fully made saturated and then removed slowly fao 24 the root length was measured with tape and approximately the soil depth in which 80 of the water intake takes place was taken as the effective root zone for irrigation purpose michael 2010 for further measurements five root study plots were prepared by growing sugarcane in closed soil filled plastic tanks above the ground and effective root zone was measured directly by noting the root length in different soil layers 2 4 soil moisture content soil moisture content were measured prior to every irrigation and in between two irrigations approximately at midpoint of irrigation interval during the entire crop season gravimetric method was used for determination of the soil moisture content the soil samples were collected upto root zone depth at the depths of 15 30 45 60 and 75 cm the soil moisture was also monitored whenever the soil profile was recharged by precipitation 2 5 application of irrigation water the scheduling of irrigation was based on soil moisture content in the root zone the irrigation was done to reﬁll the proﬁle to field capacity the irrigation was initiated when soil water in the root zone approached but never depleted more than 65 fao 56 of available soil water the depth of water applied for irrigation was calculated by equation formulated as below w h e n r e θ f t z t b d t θ t z t b d t d t i 1 n θ f t z t b d t θ t z t b d t r e w h e n r e θ f t z t b d t θ t z t b d t d t 0 θ f t i 1 n θ f i θ t i 1 n θ i z t i 1 n z i b d t i 1 n b d i where d t is depth of irrigation water to be required in the active root zone at t th is the day of irrigation event mm θ f t and θ t is soil watercontentsat field capacity and at before irrigation for i th layer of the root zone at t th day respectively z t is the depth of effective root

contents at 33 kpa and 1500 kpa were worked out for different soil layers of experimentation with pressure plate apparatus 2 6 soil moisture storage the changes in soil moisture storage δs were determined by considering the soil layers from soil surface down to the depth of effective root zone the depth of moisture depleted from each layer viz 0 15 15 30 30 45 45 60 60 75 cm during each soil moisture measurement were computed the change in soil moisture storage δs was determined for successive observation days i e soil moisture storage at the previous observation day minus soil moisture storage at next observation day as δ s s 1 s 2 or δ s t θ t 1 z t 1 θ t z t 1 b d t 1 θ t 1 i 1 n θ i z t 1 i 1 n z i b d t 1 i 1 n b d i where s 1 and s 2 are the soil moisture storage at previous observation day and soil moisture storage at next observation day respectively θ t 1 and θ t are the soil moisture storages between two consecutive observation days in other means t 1 and t are the previous and successive day of observation t followed by t 1 z t 1 is the depth of effective root zone at t 1 day mm i the incremental root depth 150 mm and n is number of i layers b d t 1 is bulk density of effective root zone at t 1 day mg m 3 the fao 56 has suggested that soil water balance method can only give evapotranspiration estimates over long periods of the order of week long or ten day periods therefore the interval between two successive soil moisture measurements was maintained between 7 10 days however during rainy days it was extended to 15 days allen et al 1998 2 7 crop evapotranspiration the simplified soil moisture balance method was used to estimate crop evapotranspiration etc in root zone between consecutive soil moisture measurement days for this water content in root zone depletion was calculated which essentially involves adding and subtracting of losses and gains of various parameters of the soil water budget expressed in terms of water depth rainfall irrigation and capillary rise of groundwater towards the root zone was considered to decrease the root zone depletion in root zone whereas crop evapotranspiration and percolation losses were considered to increase depletion in root zone the moisture balance expressed in terms of depletion at the end consecutive soil moisture measurement days was calculated by following equation fao 56 e t c i r e r o d p c r δ s f δ s where e t c is crop evapotranspiration i is depth of irrigation applied r e is effective portion of rainfall ro is runoff from the soil surface dpis deep percolation below the root zone cr is capillary rise in case of a shallow water table δsf is horizontal subsurface flow in or out of the root zone and δsis change in soil proﬁle water storage respectively all parameters were expressed in mm the soil water balance equation based on the above stated simplified equation was formulated as below θ t z t 1 b d t 1 θ t 1 z t 1 b d t 1 i t 1 t 1 t r e t 1 t e t c σ t 1 t e t c θ t 1 θ t z t 1 b d t 1 i t 1 σ t 1 t r e where e t c is the crop evapotranspiration from in the active root zone mm between t 1 and t th day time interval r e the effective rainfall mm betweent 1 and t th day time interval i t 1 the supplemental irrigation mm given on t 1 day the total evapotranspiration was expressed as e t c j 1 m e t c j where jis the period for which etc measured between two successive moisture content observation events from t 1to t mis the total number of two successive events in entire growth period the effective rainfall was computed by criteria mentioned in fao document no 25 dastane 1974 surface runoff was considered nil as experimental site had flat topography and no runoff was observed during the periods of irrigation or precipitation in addition to overcome runoff problem in irrigation process drip irrigation system was used which did not produced surface runoff in irrigation process no shallow water table existed at the study site thus only percolation below the root zone was of concern however to attain this purpose drip irrigation system was used for irrigation water supply as it has distinct advantage of slow water supply rate which produced no deep percolation and equaling it as zero for analysis capillary rise was assumed to be zero because moisture table was more than 1 m below the bottom of root zone at experimental site for prevention entry of subsurface flow a 1 m deep interceptor drain was dug around the entire periphery of experimental plot in addition to this the mole drains were laid at 4 5 m lateral distance in entire experimental field 2 8 reference evapotranspiration daily measurements of air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity for estimating eto as well as rainfall were made from automatic weather station observatory situated at sugarcane experimental site for period from 12thdecember 2014 to 23rd december 2015 and 24th december 2015 to 31st december

crop coefficients were computed for different growth stages of sugarcane the growth period was divided into four stages establishment 0 45 days after planting tillering 60 135 dap grand growth 135 300 dap and maturity 300 360 dap the initial stage was assumed from the beginning of planted sugarcane to the full expansion of root volume in nursery tillering stage is just after 15 days of transplanting the seedlings when tillers are starts to emerge from mother shoot and ends when tiller starts to elongate at the beginning of grand growth the grand growth stage is from then upto the timing when cane has achieved its full growth the maturity stage continues from then until harvest these four growth stages correspond to those defined in fao 56 allen et al 1998 respectively as initial development mid season and end season in this investigation later three stages were considered and initial stage i e initial stage was skipped with a view that all the farmers of this region essentially raised nursery to attain good germination at initial stage further nursery planting of sugarcane has distinct advantages like spare time for field preparation saving of three irrigations and healthy plant selection etc the crop evapotranspiration values obtained by monitoring the soil moisture balance in the crop root zone and eto values estimated using climatic data for specified periods the crop coefficient kc were computed as the ratio of crop evapotranspiration and reference evapotranspiration etc eto for the respective period 7 10 daysinterval the polynomial equation was fitted with kct as the dependent variables and t t as the independent variables k c t a o t t 0 a 1 t t 1 a 2 t t 2 where kct is crop coefficient of t th day a0 a1 a2 are constants of equations t is day considered t is total period of crop growth from planting to harvesting days the regression coefficients were estimated and tested for its significance to decide upon the validity of the particular equation using best fit equation the daily kc values were estimated for both seasons and average daily kc values from 50 dap i e from 10 days after transplanting were then estimated by taking the average of estimated daily kc values of 2015 and 2016 2 10 agronomic practices the sugarcane seedlings rose in nursery and transplanted after 35 days in a 6 27 m field sugarcane seedlings transplanted at the spacing of 1 5 m 0 6 m during nursery irrigations applied at 2 days interval as per measured crop evapotranspiration etc values through climatological method allen et al 1998 after transplanting the common irrigation was applied continued upto15 days until the seedling was established the value of crop coefficient for common irrigation was referred as 0 40 fao 56 the other agronomic practice viz weeding off barring earthing up fertigation schedule and operation to prevent lodging were followed as per recommended by parent agricultural university 3 results and discussion 3 1 root zone depth the root zone depth at the time of transplanting was 50 mm at 53 and 47 dap in 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 1 during both the years the root length of sugarcane increased linearly with advancement in age of crop the rate of root length expedites at the end of tillering stage 115 125 dap thereafter effective root zone increased approximately up to 204 days and 217 days in 2015 and 2016 respectively and then root zone becomes constant at 750 mm and subsequent samples were taken up to 750 mm 3 2 soil moisture the soil moisture content increased with crop evapotranspiration during the growth period the moisture content found increased with increase in soil layer depth upto 45 cm and thereafter it slightly decreased at 60 cm and lowest moisture content was observed at 75 cm depth fig 2 during tillering stage more soil moisture depletion was observed however when plant canopy fully developed after tillering the soil moisture depletion was uniform in all layers singh and mohan 1994 raghuvanshi and wallender 1998 the particular growth stage and incident of rainfall greatly influenced the soil moisture content invariably of growth stages and barring rainfall events the moisture content was closer to field capacity 3 3 field water balance 3 3 1 irrigation water applied the irrigation depth differed for a particular growth stage in a season due to differences in crop water use and duration of stage table 2 this was probably caused mostly by differences in annual weather conditions wiedenfeld 2004 invariably in both seasons grand growth stage identified as high water requirement stage due to its long duration 165 170 days this followed by tillering stage 75 80 days and maturity stage 65 70 days the irrigation water applied in grand growth stage of 2016 was less than half 372 4 mm compared to 2015 799 mm because of the higher contribution of rainfall in crop water use in 2016 however irrigation water amount in tillering stage 277 6 mm was higher in 2016 than in 2015 211 1 mm because of the higher evaporative demands in both the seasons the lowest irrigation water was required during the maturity stage this happened because of decline in crop water use etc with crop maturity during this period and may also indicate that the crop was taking advantage of moisture stored in the soil profile from off season rainfall wiedenfeld robert 2000 3 3 2 effective rainfall the rainfall received during 2015 and 2016 was 313 2 mm 38 rainy days and 534 3 mm 40 rainy days respectively in both the years all rainfall received was effective table 2 the occurrence of rainfall affected the depth of irrigation in different growth stages in 2015 the effective rainfall was 43 6 less than average rainfall 555 mm therefore more irrigation water applied in that season however in 2016 effective rainfall 534 3 mm contributed almost 41 of crop consumptive use and therefore demands of irrigation water reduced to half in 2016 among different growth stages more irrigation applied in tillering stage february mid may in 2016 due to high evaporative demand the respective years grand growth stages coincided with rains that contributed consumptive use and therefore demand of irrigation water was differed in 2015 and 2016 season in maturity stage no rainfall received in both the season and thus irrigation amounts for both the seasons were almost for this stage 3 3 3 crop evapotranspiration the total depths of water use during 2015 2016 and average of two seasons were 1386 8 mm 1291 mm and 1338 9 mm respectively table 2 the sugarcane evapotranspiration etc varies considerably from place to place depending on weather conditions texture of soil and duration of the crop numerous approaches have been used by different researchers to measure or estimate sugarcane evapotranspiration thompson and boyce 1967 omary and izuno 1995 allen et al 1998 wiedenfeld robert 2000 wiedenfeld 2004 chabot et al 2005 silva et al 2012 win et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 cardoso et al 2015 nevertheless its estimate largely depends upon type of approach used by researchers in some studies evaporation from a uswb class a pan allen et al 1998 is common reference for measuring evapotranspiration in many crops including sugarcane using this method wiedenfeld 2004 reported crop evapotranspiration of sugarcane as 1021 mm including annual effective rainfall in semiarid south texas whereas wiedenfeld robert 2000 obtained its value as 968 mm using jensen haise equation for same region in few lysimetric studies thompson and boyce 1967 at pongola south africa found sugarcane evapotranspiration similar to uswb class pan evaporation suggesting a pan factor i e the ratio of etc to pan evaporation of 1 0 likewise win et al 2014 at myanmar and cardoso et al 2015 at tropical brazil reported sugarcane evapotranspiration as 1369 84 mm and 1438 23 mm respectively omary and izuno 1995 in south florida usa used a novel way of measuring actual sugarcane evapotranspiration by monitoring daily changes in the height of the water table and estimated annual etc of sugarcane as 1060 mm differently chabot et al 2005 measured transpiration of sugarcane in gharb plain morocco using the sap flow technique and found that sugarcane evapotranspiration were 30 more than those predicted from the penman monteith equation however they believed that the sap flow technique is an inappropriate method for determining transpiration rates from a heterogeneous canopy like that of sugarcane because of uncertainties in the methodology anderson et al 2015 measured sugarcane evapotranspiration at two irrigated sugarcane fields 1191 mm and 1389 mm of maui hawaii usa in contrasting climates by eddy covariance towers they used the short et0 and tall etr vegetation versions of the american society for civil engineers asce equation the only field water balance study reported sugarcane evapotranspiration as 1686 7 mm for tropical condition of brazil silva et al 2012 thus on an annual basis the sugarcane evapotranspiration ranges from 950 to 1700 mm depending on the location from different parts of the world therefore sugarcane evapotranspiration amounting 1339 mm derived by field water balance in this study seems to be appropriate for semiarid conditions 3 4 crop coefficients of sugarcane the kc values with confidence bounds for both the years are shown graphically in the form of polynomial equation with respect to the ratio of days to total crop period fig 3 the average kc of two years ranged from 0 31 to 1 29 table 3 in both the seasons kc consistently increased from 0 43 to 1 03 during 50 130 days after planting dap thereafter it showed gradual increases due to crop development in form of cane elongation mid season stage during the mid season i e 130 300 dap kc increased from 1 08 and then remain same in the range of 1 13 1 04 with peak value as 1 29 the highest kc value occurred during 200 220 dap the kc values during the late season 300 360 dap decreased gradually from 1 04 to 0 56 thompson and boyce 1971 in a lysimeter study observed that etc rates declined by about 30 after crops lodged an effect that lasted upto crop maturity the two years average kc values are represented in the form of following second order polynomial equation the variation of kc is shown in fig 4 k c t 4 695 t t 2 5 566 t t 0 360 3 4 1 comparison with fao 56 the crop coefficient values derived from field soil water balance during the tillering grand growth and maturity stages for sugarcane in a semi arid region were 0 70 1 20 and 0 78 respectively the corresponding values of fao 56 are 0 90 1 25 and 0 98 respectively table 4 it is pointed out that at 60 dap low kc value 0 43 was attained as against 0 65 of fao 56 however it hiked up after 25 30 days i e at 90 dap the average kc value for tillering stage was found lower 0 70 than fao 56 value 0 94 earlier win et al 2014 also reported the lower kc value for development stage as 0 81 estimated from lysimeters for myanmar the trend of curves for mid season of both the seasons showed very close association with fao 56 kc curve however average kc value for grand growth mid season stage was estimated slight lower 1 20 over 1 25 fao 56 the lower kc obtained in this investigation may be due to different climatic conditions of semi arid region which primarily altered the reference crop evapotranspiration i e eto differently inman bamber and mcglinchey 2003 and cardoso et al 2015 confirmed the current 1 25 value whereas omary and izuno 1995 and silva et al 2012 reported higher value over 1 25 nevertheless this difference was mainly to due to variation in et measurement approaches weather conditions duration of the crop methodological assumptions and accuracy the decline phase of estimated kc curve showed early fall with lower kc values 0 78 over fao 56 values 0 98 overall there was a good association between kc developed and kc fao in average of both seasons however some variations observed along the growth stages in both seasons it was revealed that reduction observed between fao kc and developed kc was 25 5 4 and 20 4 for tillering stage grand growth stage and maturity stage respectively table 2 the average reduction was 16 6 this may be due to the conditions of the study area soil conditions and crop variety etc whereas fao kc equation is developed for global climatic conditions pereira luis et al 2015 also reported the advances in adopted kc research included techniques to estimate kc based on the architecture of crops notably height and fraction of ground cover in practice results reported here showed that fao kc could lead to over estimation in irrigation scheduling of sugarcane in semi arid conditions and the use of kc values developed in this study would lead in correction of water requirement for sugarcane further in this study the kc value measured over the growth period of sugarcane have been converted in the equation form leading to estimation of kc for any specific day and its use in decision support system 4 conclusion sugarcane have immense role in economy of sugarcane growing countries but its water consumption scenario represents the unfavorable perspective in irrigated agriculture underestimation of its crop evapotranspiration etc can lead to suboptimal yield due to water stress whereas overestimation can lead to excessive applied water thus reducing water available for other uses or additional acreage and decreasing economic competitiveness the crop coefficient kc is the important parameter influencing the estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc of any crop and knowledge of periodical or stagewise crop coefficients of sugarcane is important this investigation addressed the important issue of irrigation scheduling provided the information of crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for sugarcane by field water balance method under semi arid conditions the crop evapotranspiration of sugarcane was 1339 4 mm including irrigation water requirement and effective rainfall as 991 mm and 424 mm respectively the determined sugarcane kc values for tillering development stage grand growth mid season and maturity stage end season was 0 70 1 20 and 0 78 respectively the kc values are 16 6 lesser than those suggested by fao 56 for sugarcane the study pointed out that fao kc could lead to over estimation in irrigation scheduling of sugarcane in semi arid conditions and the use of kc values developed in this study would lead in correction of water requirement the sugarcane kc values converted in 2nd order polynomial equation form leading to estimation of kc for any specific day the daily values of kc from equation is very useful to researchers working in area of sugarcane water management especially making a decision support system soil moisture based crop yield modeling crop water requirement based computer programme or mobile application automation of irrigation system etc overall this study provided the adoptable information for sugarcane toward efficient management of irrigation water leading to proportionalities appropriately the imbalance of sugarcane cultivated area and use of irrigation water in the major sugarcane growing countries of semi arid regions declaration of competing interest
