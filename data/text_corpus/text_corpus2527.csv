12635,development of antibiotic resistance genes contributed by unregulated disposal of antibiotics to the environment has become an overwhelming risk worldwide an evolutionary technology photocatalytic membrane pm that integrates both photocatalysis and membrane separation in one unit is introduced to treat the antibiotics the ability of photocatalytic membrane to simultaneously degrade antibiotics while promoting handy recovery of photocatalysts from the wastewater dramatically enhances process sustainability and minimize treatment unit footprint to date reviews on antibiotics removal only focus on standalone photocatalysis and membrane process in this work a pioneer overview that focuses on treatment of one specific pollutant antibiotics by employing the hybrid pm technology was performed configurations of pm materials including ceramic and polymer used as the membrane base are summarized followed by factors influencing performance of the integrated process photocatalysts harnessed in photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics mainly focused on tio2 and g c3n4 regardless of the materials of membranes from energy consumption and economic evaluations of pm technology process parameters are reported to significantly influence the energy requirement and costing as light source is accounted for the highest portion of energy consumption harnessing natural sunlight to power the photocatalytic reaction would be a great direction to be ventured into future potential of sunlight powered photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in the escalating aquaculture industry is proposed keywords antibiotics photocatalytic membranes membrane materials energy consumption economic evaluation aquaculture data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the global concern over inadequacy of clean water has been overwhelming as a result of uncontrolled urbanization and industrialization quality of water was drastically deteriorated by reckless released of effluents from a myriad of industries hospitals and so on 1 one of the pollutants disposed the antibiotics have raised alarm of the public antibiotics are categorized as the contaminants of emerging concerns while antibiotics are efficient and are frequently used to treat infectious diseases in humans and animals its presence in the aqueous environment would cause adverse impacts trace amounts of antibiotics have been detected in ground water lakes reservoirs fish hatcheries and sediments 2 3 these antibiotics could potentially trigger development of antibiotics resistance genes arg subsequently leading to ineffective medical treatments aggravatedly global antibiotics consumption is reported to be escalating in an unusual rate to cope demand for animal proteins 4 besides utilizing antibiotics for medical treatment the antibiotics are administered into animals by means of growth booster in poultry production agriculture aquaculture and many more a remarkable high level of 95 of the antibiotics administered is undigested and unmetabolized by the animals hence secreting the residues with urine and faeces 5 to maintain aesthetic value of the nature various treatment technologies that are potentially beneficial for antibiotics removal have been introduced for examples anaerobic membrane bioreactors 6 adsorption 7 nanoparticles 8 electrochemical 9 advanced oxidation process 10 ion exchange 11 and many more these methods have high efficiency to treat antibiotics however they are associated with major drawbacks such as formation of secondary waste and difficult to be reused ion exchangers for instance could not be reproduced difficult to treat large amounts of effluents poor thermal and radiation stability 11 instead photocatalytic membrane pm a process integration of photocatalysis and membrane appears as a feasible treatment to alleviate these drawbacks unlike adsorption that merely removes antibiotics without degrading them and producing secondary pollution 12 photocatalysis is considered a green technology as it transforms harmful parental compounds into non toxic products like water and carbon dioxide 13 it is also known to be able to remove antibiotics at low concentration in a short time 14 there are quite a number of photocatalysts known and being employed to remove antibiotics some of the examples are tio2 15 graphitic carbon nitride 16 zno 17 wo3 18 bivo4 19 and biobr 20 many methods have also been introduced to improve their photocatalysts efficiency including to fabricate composite by coupling of noble metals doping with transition metals and non metals the photocatalyst composites often play main role in preventing rapid recombination of electron hole pairs 21 on the other hand membrane technology is employed for wastewater treatment attributed to their high productivity easy scaling less addition of chemical additive and no phase change involved 21 membranes could be synthesized using either ceramic or polymeric materials depending on desired membrane properties by introducing pm the benefits of both photocatalysis and membrane technologies are integrated meanwhile mitigating challenges faced by the single technology e g photocatalysts are difficult to be recovered from wastewater and membranes commonly suffered from fouling issue besides materials performances of pm are influenced by many other process parameters all these determining factors should be given attention as operation parameters impact the cost and energy consumption directly in a pm process 22 numerous review papers have been published to constructively discuss the progress of photocatalytic membranes in terms of fabrication and applications of tio2 23 and g c3n4 24 based photocatalytic membranes factors influencing performance of membrane 25 various applications of photocatalytic membrane for water treatment 26 and materials used to produce photocatalytic membrane 21 some of these papers mentioned pharmaceutical products as one of the critical pollutants to be treated however none of the papers reviews treatment of antibiotics using photocatalytic membrane in depth in view of the urgency to remove antibiotics from wastewater and the superiority of photocatalytic membrane the aim of this paper is to comprehensively review the feasibility of photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in effluent challenges associated with conventional photocatalysis and membrane filtration are summarized following that usage of photocatalytic membranes to remove antibiotics are reviewed in terms of configurations process influencing factors materials energy consumption and economic evaluation as well as the future prospect of pm in treating antibiotics from aquaculture wastewater 2 feasibility and challenges of photocatalysis and membrane separation to treat antibiotics in wastewater photocatalysis and membrane separation technologies have been utilized to treat antibiotics in wastewater a photocatalysis process is initiated by excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of photocatalysts upon absorption of sufficient light energy forming electron hole pairs the photocatalytic activity is a redox reaction the electrons and holes formed will then react with water molecules to generate reactive oxygen species ross such as oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 the ross subsequently degrade pollutants adsorbed on their surfaces via oxidization and reduction one of the key factors to determine efficiency of photocatalysts is whether the energy of the light absorbed is higher than the band gap energy of the photocatalyst so that photocarriers can be produced to degrade the antibiotics furthermore the photocatalyst must have conduction and valence band positions that can induce hydrogen evolution and generation of superoxide radical thermodynamically substantial amount of research works has been conducted to explore functionalities and performances of photocatalysts to disintegrate antibiotics 27 those photocatalysts can be classified into four types namely metal oxide sulfides polymeric carbon nitride and bismuth based photocatalysts 27 recombination of electron hole pairs of the photocatalysts hinders high photocatalysis efficiency to minimize e h recombination and to improve utilization of light energy many researches have been focusing on exploring the creations of heterojunction photocatalysts by combining distinct semiconductors that have unequal band structure which could generate band alignments to facilitate higher efficient redox reactions 28 for example chen et al 29 fabricated au cus tio2 nanobelts nb composite that exhibited superior photocatalytic properties the au cus tio2 nb could achieve much higher percentage of 96 oxytetracycline otc decomposition than pure tio2 nb 66 due to better absorption of light lower band gap higher separation efficiency of charge carriers in another research work by yan et al 30 p n junction photocatalysts nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots ngqds bioi mnnb2o6 was synthesized via hydrothermal method the pure mnnb2o6 and bioi demonstrated poor photocatalytic activity with only 7 2 and 30 5 of tetracycline degradation under 60 min 250 w xenon lamp irradiation on the contrary the ngqds bioi mnnb2o6 that improved reaction rate constant by 27 6 fold and 5 6 fold compared to pure mnnb2o6 and bioi escalated the degradation performance up to 87 2 when degrading tetracycline environmental remediation could also be realized as analysis results from hplc ms showed that the composite photocatalysts successfully transform the antibiotics into unharmful co2 and h2o and some tiny inorganic molecular compounds z scheme and s scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are also promising to remove antibiotics dual z scheme bi2zr2o7 g c3n4 ag3po4 photocatalysts was synthesized by qu et al 31 to reduce high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers by suppressing photo corrosion degradation efficiency of tetracycline was attained up to 86 2 under visible light similarly gong et al 32 established a z scheme cdte tio2 heterostructure photocatalyst to degrade tetracycline in wastewater it was found that the z scheme charge transfer mechanism facilitated generation of superoxide radicals subsequently contributing to high photocatalytic activity under 30 min of irradiation 78 of tetracycline was successfully removed on the other hand s scheme photocatalysts produced by sun et al 33 also exhibited strong redox capability by supplying effective charge migrating channels the s scheme photocatalysts synthesized was a composite of s gc3n4 tio2 sio2 pan aerogel which was capable to remove 84 2 of tetracycline and possesses advantages of prominent reusability light weight and efficiency recyclability furthermore by fabricating s scheme zno zn3 po4 2 via co precipitation method beshkar et al 34 removed tetracycline at 82 efficiency under visible light irradiation which was 1 5 times more than unmodified zn3 po4 2 nanostructure a few other examples of composite photocatalysts to effectively treat antibiotics are summarized in table 1 treatment of antibiotics with membranes is associated with several benefits such as does not involve additional chemicals antibiotics can be selectively removed the reusability of the membrane and membrane is handier for large scale continuous operations 42 separations of antibiotics by membranes are carried out under different mechanisms depend on the physicochemical properties of the antibiotics and solutions as well as characteristics of the membranes for antibiotics factors that would affect the mechanisms include their molecular weight cut off pk a hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity furthermore ph ionic strength of solutions and material surface morphology and pore size of membranes would also govern the separation mechanism while some hydrophobic antibiotics are removed by adsorbing to the membrane many other antibiotics are separated via size exclusion 43 several research works that utilized various kinds of membrane configurations to remove different types of antibiotics are summarized in table 2 though both photocatalysis and membrane are effective and feasible to treat antibiotics these treatment methods face sustainability challenges the main difference between photocatalysis and membrane is that photocatalysis is a chemical process while the latter is a physical process the main differences between photocatalysis and membrane filtration are clearly compared and compiled in table 3 3 photocatalytic membrane hybrid mitigation towards fouling and secondary treatment issues a process intensification technology namely photocatalytic membrane is introduced to provide a hybrid solution for problems faced by both photocatalysis and membrane separation a photocatalytic membrane consists of photocatalysts either surface coated or embedded in the membrane matrix the membrane simultaneously acts as a substrate that houses the photocatalysts and a selective separation barrier to remove unwanted pollutants in this case the secondary step to remove photocatalysts from the wastewater can be eliminated 52 the photocatalysts on the other hand improve hydrophilicity of membrane and break down pollutants attached to the membrane surface and pores thus alleviating membrane fouling therefore there is minimal extra burden imposed on the pump to pressurize permeate across the membrane and the membrane cleaning frequency is also reduced 52 in short the photocatalytic membrane is advantageous to be a more sustainable multimodal separation unit than the standalone photocatalysis and membrane technology 54 3 1 configurations of photocatalytic membranes integration of photocatalysis and membrane to purify wastewater containing antibiotics consists of two main configurations 1 suspended photocatalysts in membrane reactor 2 immobilized photocatalysts on in membrane the first configuration being the photocatalysts and membrane exist as two independent units in the setup in this configuration photocatalyst is suspended in the feed solution while the membrane serves as the separation unit between the feed and permeate the main purpose is to simultaneously separate the photocatalysts and to recover treated water from the feed the benefit of suspended photocatalyst are large surface area and direct contact with pollutant that promote great antibiotics degradation yield however the nano sized photocatalysts tend to agglomerate and compromise the degradation performance furthermore deposition of photocatalysts on membrane surface during treatment process would render member fouling an undesirable phenomenon 55 this phenomenon was depicted in wang et al s 56 study whereby suspended photocatalysts tio2 was found deposited on the cross flow microfiltration membrane surface when treating penicillin g the reduction of available photocatalyst in the feed resulted in degradation efficiency of merely 84 moreover cake layer was formed from the deposition of photocatalysts causing permeate flux decline for 7 25 in the 4 h treatment process when continuous backwashing was introduced to dislodge the deposited tio2 the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies improved to 95 furthermore the permeate flux recorded was constant with no obvious reduction throughout the separation application apart from that presence of photocatalysts dispersed in the water would also potentially restrict efficiency transmission and scattering of light to trigger photocatalytic reaction second configuration being the immobilization of photocatalysts either on the membrane surface by coating or by blending into the membrane matrix this configuration is implemented by majority of researches to degrade antibiotics in wastewater photocatalysts are immobilized on in the membrane thus preventing agglomeration of photocatalysts and photocatalysts recovery post treatment can be avoided 55 this configuration also aids in mitigating membrane fouling issue via disintegration of deposited pollutants on the membrane by the coated embedded photocatalysts 55 besides there are studies whereby the immobilized photocatalysts improve hydrophilicity of the membrane which also alleviated membrane fouling and increased permeate flux 57 nevertheless despite immobilized photocatalysts is more advantageous than suspended photocatalysts in many aspects immobilization of photocatalyst resulted in reduction of contact area and active sites for antibiotics degradation apart from that photocatalysts might leach from the membrane overtime due to abrasion during the separation process amount of photocatalysts is also fixed and cannot be altered in the treatment system a research conducted by espindola et al 58 to degrade 5 mg l oxytetracycline otc using tio2 p25 and ceramic microfiltration mf membrane provides a clear comparison between the two configurations fig 1 in the evaluation the mf membrane did not reject otc molecules but served its function to separate suspended tio2 p25 from passing to the permeate and as the substrate to immobilized tio2 p25 the investigation reported that slurry tio2 p25 contributed to higher otc removal efficiency 90 after 30 min due to higher photocatalytic area but causing a drastic 66 permeate flux decline after 5 h of treatment a dense tio2 p25 cake layer was observed on the mf membrane on the contrary when the tio2 p25 was loaded on the membrane otc removal could also reach 90 but the duration needed was prolonged to 150 min however a mere 8 of flux declined were observed showing substantial improvement as compared to the slurry membrane photoreactor in addition the recyclability of tio2 p25 loaded membrane was proven as its performance was maintained after 3 cycles of treatments 3 2 factors affecting efficacies of photocatalytic membrane performances of photocatalytic membranes are governed concomitantly by degradation efficacies of antibiotics as well as sustainability of the photocatalytic membranes to enhance photocatalytic redox reactions efforts have been devoted to increase light utilization rate and reduce electron hole recombination rate of the photocatalysts 54 as reviewed in section 2 in the case of membrane filtrations fouling is a critical challenge that reduces membrane productivity and sustainability common fouling mechanisms include the clogging of pores partially or completely internal pore blocking and formation of cake layer on the membrane surfaces 59 incorporation of photocatalysts that could improve hydrophilicity of the membranes is yet another method to alleviate photocatalytic membrane performances furthermore initial concentration of antibiotics in the treatment system was reported to affect degradation efficacies 60 other than the factors mentioned some other parameters that would affect the treatment process are discussed in the following paragraphs the amount of photocatalysts suspended or loaded on in membrane would influence the degradation performance it is undeniable that higher amount of photocatalysts suspended in feed solution or loaded on in membrane would provide more photocatalytic sites for antibiotics degradation however excessive photocatalysts causes negative effect as they tend to agglomerate hence impeded contact between internal ros and the antibiotics 61 presence of excess amount of suspended photocatalysts would also restrict light scattering to induce photocatalytic reaction and foul the membrane which subsequently reduce permeate flux as demonstrated in li et al 62 and espindola et al s 58 works respectively in wang et al s 60 study it was found that while degrading tc 10 mg l the degradation efficiency increased from 0 to 50 when increasing zno n g c3n4 photocatalysts loading from 0 to 1 12 mg cm2 on pvdf membrane further increment of photocatalysts loading deteriorate the degradation efficiency espindola et al 58 also reported increment in otc degradation up to 90 when coating layers of tio2 p25 on al2o3 membrane increased to 3 layers further layering of photocatalysts resulted in insignificant enhancement of otc degradation this is a phenomenon governed by front side illumination mechanism reaction efficiency would escalate with thicker photocatalysts film until a point where the film absorbed the light completely this point forward effect of further rising the film thickness was negligible to the reaction efficiency as there would not be any changes to the diffusional length of charge carriers to the catalyst liquid interface 63 membrane pore size and transmembrane pressure tmp mainly affect photocatalytic membrane s permeate flux production subsequently the efficiency of antibiotics disintegration with narrower pore size and lower tmp permeate flux would be reduced nevertheless reduction in permeate flux contributes positively towards breaking down of antibiotics due to longer retention time thus longer reaction time for the photocatalysts to degrade the retained antibiotics the evidence was shown in wang et al s 60 research at which best degradation efficiencies of tetracycline tc at 55 was achieved using the ga zno n g c3n4 up050 photocatalyst membrane with the smallest pore size at 50 kda degradation of tc utilizing the same membrane was then alleviated to 71 7 when applying the lowest tmp in the study at 0 005 mpa despite that in both cases narrowest pore size and lowest tmp the membrane had the lowest permeate flux compared to its counterpart with larger pore sizes and higher tmp ph influences generation of ros zwitterion form of antibiotics and repulsion force between antibiotics and the photocatalytic membranes for example cf c3n4 bi2moo6 cloth was used to degrade tetracycline in solution across ph 3 5 7 9 11 in shen et al s 64 study the highest degradation activity at 86 was attained at ph 5 as a result of formation of h which could combine with o2 to generate oh that could take part in the redox reaction when ph increased from 5 to 11 the tetracycline degradation rate dropped to 61 reason being adsorption between tetracycline and the photocatalysts was hindered due to electrostatic repulsion force the effect of ph on degradation efficiency of antibiotics was also highlighted in li et al s 62 investigation in the research removal efficiency of amoxicillin with suspended tio2 in ceramic membrane photoreactor was attained at 61 6 ph 2 7 reaching the highest at 83 3 ph 6 5 then dropped at increasing ph at 80 3 ph 9 0 and 31 6 ph 11 5 after 180 min the efficiency is highly influenced by the states of tio2 at different ph at ph lower than point of zero charge pzc of tio2 ph 6 8 which is an acidic condition the amoxicillin does not favor adsorption on the tio2 additionally tio2 has high tendency to agglomerate reducing adsorption and reactive sites and photon absorption when the solution is acidic as ph increased the tio2 surface contains more oh ions thus improving removal efficiency until reaching a limit at ph 9 in highly alkali condition the excess oh ions would fill the holes generated by photocatalysis of tio2 hence resulted in decline of photocatalytic efficiency the same photocatalyst may result in different degradation efficiencies on different antibiotics as photocatalytic activity is a redox reaction the ability of the photocatalysts in the photocatalytic system to oxidize and reduce antibiotics is one of the factors governing the efficiency of photocatalytic membranes different antibiotics have different oxidization potential in this case the valence band position of the photocatalysts becomes a determining factor on whether the photogenerated holes are able to oxidize the antibiotics directly apart from the parental antibiotics oxidation potential of intermediates formed along the degradation process is also a critical aspect to be examined to ensure complete degradation of the antibiotics 27 besides molecular structures of antibiotics also dictate the redox reactions polysulfone poly acrylic acid cadmium sulfide pes paa cds membrane was fabricated by chen et al 65 then degradations of three different antibiotics namely tetracycline hydrochloride tc ciprofloxacin cip and sulfamethoxazole smx with the same concentration 10 mg l and volume 25 ml was investigated using the pes paa cds removal percentage for tc was the highest at 60 6 followed by cip 24 1 and smx 12 8 the antibiotics structural analysis revealed that tc has the highest number of biphenyl and many side groups followed by cip while smx has no biphenyl and side group structures the ros generated by pes paa cds tend to oxidize and degrade biphenyl and side chain structures therefore explaining the degradation percentage of the different antibiotics 3 3 materials of photocatalytic membranes undoubtedly the photocatalytic efficiency of antibiotics degradation can be maximized by adjusting process parameters as discussed in section 3 2 however being the backbone of antibiotics treatment unit the choice of materials for the photocatalytic membrane is the key pre requisite to ensure excellent robust and sustainable antibiotic treatment processes the materials used as the membrane base are categorized into two groups which are inorganic ceramics and organic polymers for photocatalytic membranes mxene is the most commonly adopted ceramic materials mxene is synthesized via chemical etching of max ti3alc2 phase in hcl and lif mixed solution 66 on the contrary many types of polymers are employed to fabricate photocatalytic membranes some of the polymer examples are polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polyethersulfone pes polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe some of the fabrication techniques for polymeric membranes are thermally or non solvent phase inversion melt extrusion stretching sintering and electrospinning due to different natures of the polymers the fabrication techniques varied for example as a non polar polymer ptfe membranes are commonly synthesized via sintering or melt extrusion processes pvdf on the other hand is versatile dissolvable in common solvents and can be prepared via various methods 67 considering the fact that the photocatalytic membrane has to be able to withstand reactive species attacks during the photocatalytic reaction ceramic membranes appear to be a better choice of material due to its robustness the hydrophilicity of ceramic membrane also renders it good anti fouling ability in spite of that usage of polymeric membranes is significantly more prevalent than the ceramic membranes attributed by the cheaper price and more readily tunable properties comparisons of the advantages and disadvantages of ceramic and polymeric membranes are summarized in table 4 semiconductor photocatalysts are commonly used to couple with the base membranes to fabricate photocatalytic membranes regardless of ceramic or polymeric membranes the most popular photocatalysts are tio2 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 while tio2 is favored for its high chemical and thermal stability low toxicity high quantum yield and relatively low cost 52 g c3n4 is popular for its ability to utilize visible light metal free relatively narrow band gap tailorable structures and excellent stability 24 pure tio2 and g c3n4 suffered from several drawbacks that compromise their degradation efficacies thus both of these catalysts are usually combined with other metals or materials via a wide range of methods to create doped or heterojunction photocatalysts to enhance photocatalytic performances 3 3 1 tio2 based photocatalytic membranes tio2 go fe3o4 composite was used by li and the colleagues 70 in a submerged magnetic separation ceramic membrane photocatalytic reactor smsmpr to concomitantly degrade amoxicillin amx and recover photocatalysts in slurry with the aid of 20 mm h2o2 degradation of amx could reach 90 1 under visible light irradiation the incorporation of go into the photocatalyst creates heterojunction that promotes fast separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs contributing to amx degradation by the h leaving in the valence band meanwhile go also enhanced fe iii fe ii reduction cycle which played vital role to activate h2o2 to generate oh as mentioned in section 3 1 slurry photoreactor is prone to membrane fouling due to the dense cake layer formed by photocatalyst deposition the drawback is innovatively eliminated in this study by synergically implementing backwashing treatment by air compressor and external magnetic field schematic diagram of the process flow is illustrated in fig 2 while the backwashing was applied via the unique hollow structure of the ceramic membrane to wash off the deposited layer external magnetic field induced photocatalysts separation through magnetism provided by fe3o4 after analyzing intermediates formed during degradation of amoxicillin by a q tof lc ms system it was confirmed that the intermediates were mineralized to carbon dioxide water and inorganic ions electrospun ceramic nanofibers are known to have finer structures and larger specific surface area for better photocatalytic activities with that pascariu et al 71 examined the degradation functionalities of la3 tio2 nanofibers with diverse la3 composition ratios 0 025 1 and calcination temperatures 400 700 c on antibiotics ciprofloxacin successful combination of la3 tio2 was observed under tem eds and xrd results depicted that 0 1 la3 doping level and 600 c are the most optimal parameters to provide desired optical properties nanofibers morphologies and crystallinities after 300 min of irradiation under 400 w halogen lamp a drastic decrease of ciprofloxacin was reached at 99 5 by degradation of 0 1 la3 tio2 with kinetic rate constant of 1 981 10 2 min 1 the nanofiber was also able to maintain the ciprofloxacin degradation at 99 after 5 consecutive cycles of treatments showing its reusability another photocatalytic nanofiber namely the flexible ag zno tio2 fibrous membranes were fabricated by song et al 72 unlike fragility of traditional ceramic fibers the ag zno tio2 fibrous membranes could be bent to 180 then recovered to the original state without any damage the good mechanical flexibility might be due to the continuous fiber networks and lesser breakages of fibers fig 3 this flexibility has huge benefits that the fibrous membrane could be used directly in liquid phase system without needing to be fixed by any binders and is readily recycled from water via direct extracting from fig 3 it could also be observed that the modified nanofibers have ag and zno depositing uniformly on the tio2 electrospun membrane the homogeneous binding of an and zno resulted in effective heterojunction and large specific area for excellent catalytic performance as proven by hrtem and bet analysis while degrading tetracycline hydrochloride a remarkable 91 6 removal rate was successfully achieved after 60 min of irradiation on the other hand though more susceptible to ros attacks attributed to the lower cost polymeric membranes especially polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes are more popular to be used as the membrane base pvdf has major advantage of high thermal stability excellent chemical resistance and mechanical properties due to the presence of fluoride groups examined by chin et al 73 pvdf membranes are able to withstand prolonged exposure to uv illumination up to 30 days some of the studies that reported efficacies of tio2 based polymeric photocatalytic membranes to treat antibiotics in wastewater are summarized in table 5 3 3 2 g c3n4 based photocatalytic membranes g c3n4 is a metal free photocatalysts that can utilize visible light more readily than tio2 owing to its extended light absorption band towards the visible light region however fast recombination of electron hole pairs is a disadvantage of g c3n4 mxene a ceramic material with excellent metallic conductivity energy storage and surface rich with oh o and other functional groups endow it fantastic reactivity and hydrophilicity by combining mxene with g c3n4 a shorter electron transport channel could be attained to speed up electrons movement and a heterojunction is created to alleviate challenge of electron hole separations in pure g c3n4 besides mxene also provides nano scaled channels for mass transfer and it also has easily tunable layer spacing and composition the hydroxyl functional groups and large specific area of mxene could also adsorb antibiotics further promoting reactive activities 66 when using g c3n4 mxene pes composite membrane to separate tetracycline hydrochloride tch via dead end filtration zeng et al 66 reported 86 of tch degradation the tch removal was mainly contributed by photocatalytic degradation the physical sieving of tch by membrane only accounted for 14 of the removal due to relatively low molecular weight of tch at 480 9 da furthermore lin et al 81 constructed mxene chitosan g c3n4 pvdf membrane via a dual regulation strategy that was capable to remove tch almost completely under observation of tem and sem the g c3n4 exhibited typical sheet like structure as illustrated in fig 4 g c3n4 was blended into pvdf to fabricate a support layer then chitosan cs decorated mxene nanosheets were stacked on top as the separation layer cs not only regulated layer spacing of mxene but also enhanced adsorption capacity and stability of the composite membrane an interfacial heterojunction was also generated between the support g c3n4 pvdf and separation layer mxene chitosan according to the density functional theory it was confirmed that efficient charge transfer between photocatalytic support layer g c3n4 pvdf and the mxene separation layer plays the main role in strong photocatalytic activity similar to tio2 most of the g c3n4 research works focused on harnessing polymeric materials as the base of the photocatalytic membranes various antibiotics have been embraced as the pollutant models such as tetracycline sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and so on in those studies the g c3n4 photocatalysts composites are either layered on the polymeric membrane supports mostly via vacuum filtration method or intercalated into the membrane structure besides improving antibiotics degradation efficiency merging of photocatalyst with the membranes also enhance the membranes hydrophilicity and pore channels for more effective mass transfer results and findings of the research works are summarized in detailed in table 6 3 3 3 graphene based photocatalytic membrane graphene based materials have exhibited intrinsic photocatalytic properties and are usually used as support or co catalysts due to its large surface area robust and excellent light absorption ability as pure graphene is a zero band gap semiconductor it is not suitable to be used directly as a photocatalyst because electrons and holes would recombine instantaneously rather graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are usually adopted as they could behave as semiconductor due to availability of oxygen functionalities 89 a novel graphene oxide prussian blue covalent triazine framework go pb ctf heterogenous membrane was synthesized by li et al 90 to degrade amoxicillin the go pb ctf composite being described as the active mega cube was vacuum filtered through polymeric cellulose acetate support to produce the photocatalytic membrane that facilitates ultrafast water transport and solar cleaning the ultrafast water transport was resulted by the enlarged channels between go nanosheets and mega cube faces as illustrated in fig 5 leading to 40 fold improvement of flux 170 l m2h in vacuum assisted dead end filtration as compared to the pure go membrane an in situ heating environment was also offered by the heterogeneous interface inhibiting recombination of e h pairs hence promoting excellent amoxicillin degradation 95 besides separating pollutants via molecular sieving the active mega cubes also efficiently alleviate membrane fouling in addition the novel composite membrane exhibited good sustainability with stable solar cleaning and the membrane integrity was remained after 3 days continuous operation to obtain antifouling membranes for membrane distillation md process rgo bi2wo6 photocatalysts were immobilized on pvdf membranes by li et al 91 the successful immobilization and concentration changes of the photocatalysts were proven by atr ftir and xrd analysis the photocatalytic membrane was fabricated via a double layer coating method through non solvent induced phase separation after embedding the composite photocatalyst water contact angle of the modified membrane was enhanced by about 30 from the pristine membrane which was beneficial to promote hydrophobicity to improve md performance while the photocatalytic membrane recorded high desalination rate the removal rates for 10 mg l aqueous ciprofloxacin under visible light for 7 5 h were in the range of 26 26 to 59 95 also the embedded rgo bi2wo6 photocatalysts could eliminate strongly bound foulants and recover permeation flux of membrane demonstrating its high potential in fouling mitigation also using rgo li et al 92 investigated degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride in photocatalysis assisted microbial fuel cell membrane bioreactor mfc mbr system harnessing photocatalytic composite membrane coated with cofe2o4 rgo and pvdf on carbon fiber cloth while conventional mfc mbr system was not able to decompose pollutants the coupling of photocatalysis allows efficient simultaneous waste separation and degradation uv vis absorption results showed that the composited cofe2o4 rgo photocatalyst had a red shift and widened absorption wavelength compared to the pristine cofe2o4 signifying enhanced usage of visible light under synergy effect of mfc mbr and cofe2o4 rgo the highest removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride achieved 98 3 3 4 miscellaneous photocatalysts coupled photocatalytic membranes apart from tio2 c3n4 and graphene based photocatalysts there are also other photocatalysts that are proven to effectively ameliorate performances of photocatalytic membranes pvdf membrane is a hydrophobic polymeric membrane to promote water affinity to the membrane so as to facilitate antibiotics adsorption popa et al 93 rendered the pvdf membrane hydrophilic by deposition of zno nanoparticles first the pvdf membrane was functionalized by l dopa which subsequently provide anchors for in situ growth of zno from the contact angle measurement the pvdf p l dopa zno hybrid membranes exhibited reduced contact angle up to 55 from 103 recorded by the pristine pvdf membrane apart from improving hydrophilicity the p l dopa zno z scheme photocatalyst effectively prevented recombination of photogenerated e h pairs while there are several ros generated in the photocatalytic system the radical spin trapping experiment suggested that h is the main contributor for the photodegradation process after 5 h of uv light irradiation only a satisfactory level of 71 of oxytetracycline otc was degraded from the feed solution as photocatalytic degradation pathways involve scissions of various types of bonds via deamination dehydroxylation demethylation and ring opening reactions it was justified that otc that has a complex structure makes it more difficult to be degraded using tetracycline hydrochloride tc as the pollutant model cheng and the co workers 57 examined degradation and permeation performances of biocl mxene pes composite membrane the incorporation of mxene a ceramic material induced 2d membrane structure creating micron scale membrane pore channels that eased molecular transport due to small molecular size of tc only around 10 of tc was separated via physical membrane separation after initiating photocatalytic reaction degradation of tc was enhanced drastically to 96 under simultaneous effects of physical sieving and photocatalytic degradation besides escalating photocatalytic activity due to oxygen vacancies formed by the strong interaction between polypyrrole ppy and biocl the biocl ppy photocatalysts composite also significantly reduced the water contact angle of membrane from 70 8 to 19 8 under synergy effect of highly enhanced hydrophilicity and presence of membrane pore channels permeate flux as high as 3680 2 l m2h was achieved there is another research work that utilized ceramic materials decorated photocatalysts to degrade fluoroquinolone antibiotics levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin 94 when operating independently agi based catalysts could efficiently degrade pollutants with good stability however it suffers from several drawbacks such as low adsorption capacity and poor recyclability due to the powdery form therefore in this study to mitigate the drawbacks agi was combined with uio 66 nh2 to form heterojunction photocatalysts supported on carbon filter cloth cfc to treat levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin under visible light irradiation the uio 66 nh2 provides large surface area for adsorption while the cfc acts as substrate to immobilized the photocatalysts the cfc uio 66 nh2 agi showed broader light absorption edge 440 nm than the cfc uio 66 nh2 proving functionality of agi in enhancing photo response rate the cfc uio 66 nh2 agi also demonstrated degradation kinetics of 0 01211 min 1 which is around 9 2 fold and 1 5 fold higher than uio 66 nh2 and cfc agi respectively when exploring degradation capability of the synthesized photocatalysts membrane composite removal rate of 84 5 and 79 6 were successfully attained by the cfc uio 66 nh2 agi when degrading levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin respectively in a batch mode reactor 3 4 energy consumption and economic evaluation of the photocatalytic membrane technology economic aspects of a treatment process involve both capital cost capex and operating costs opex the capex comprises of land purchase construction and decommissioning costs while the opex are directly affected by energy and chemical consumption as well as manpower required for operations and maintenances 95 hence minimizing or optimizing these determining factors would definitely contributes to cost reduction economic evaluation studies for photocatalytic membrane are extremely scarce and there is no available economic assessment for photocatalytic membrane treatment using antibiotics as the pollutant model for the time being nonetheless costing breakdown of photocatalytic membrane process examined using other pollutants in several research works may provide insights for more economically efficient antibiotics degradation process for a slurry type photocatalytic membrane reactor rani and karthikeyan 96 investigated cost of photocatalysis and membrane filtration separately as they are two different processes a flat sheet pes uf membrane was rolled into a cylinder with a 16 w uv c lamp at the center being installed together in a reactor in this study only 16 5m2 of area was needed which is half of the area when membrane was applied as pre or post treatment as photocatalytic reaction and membrane separation happened in the same reactor simultaneously based on the investigation the treatment cost for 1 m3 of wastewater containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ranged from 10 4 to 13 6 for the photocatalytic process reactor cost which took photocatalytic degradation kinetics and energy supply to the uv lamp into account composed of the highest amount of the overall costing this result shows the importance of harnessing photocatalysts with high degradation kinetics to shorten reaction time hence preventing prolonged energy consumption on the other hand the necessity of frequent membrane replacement and pressure requirement are challenges to keep the filtration costing low from the cost calculation it was reported that membrane filtration cost is 1 5 times higher than that of photocatalytic reaction alone however when considering photocatalysts reusability and recovery removal of compound and efficiency of mineralization membrane filtration is more advantageous than photocatalytic oxidation this statement was proven by the result in the research by coupling photocatalysis and membrane separation in one unit the same catalysts can be recovered and reused for 7 cycles whereas for standalone photocatalytic process fresh catalysts have to be applied for each cycle which drastically increase the treatment cost operating time for photocatalytic membrane is also merely half of the conventional photocatalysis process therefore rani and karthikeyan 96 concluded that the process integration of photocatalysis and membrane filtration is more superior than the standalone treatment processes energy usage directly impacts the cost required for a photocatalytic membrane process another slurry photoreactor combined with polytetrafluoroethylene microfiltration membrane by damodar et al 22 to remove reactive black 5 dye was evaluated for its energy consumption ec using eq 1 1 ec kwh l w hrt v whereby w is the wattage of the light source hrt is the hydraulic retention time and v is the volume based on the equation the ec was substantially influenced by operating parameters thus determining optimum operating conditions is essential to ensure a cost effective and sustainable treatment process also degrading reactive black 5 dye in a slurry membrane reactor and using eq 1 laohaprapanon et al 97 reported energy consumption of 0 12 kw l or 1 62 kwh g dye removed based on electricity cost in taiwan 0 09 usd kwh it is estimated that the electricity cost for dye removal in this study is 0 15 usd g the author emphasized that the cost could vary according to operating conditions higher energy requirement and operating cost would be required with the increment of initial dye concentration or presence of foreign pollutant in the effluent leading to requirement of higher light intensity and longer exposure time the economic feasibility of photocatalytic membrane is further demonstrated by examining photocatalysts immobilized photocatalytic reactors by using immobilized photocatalytic reactors rather than the slurry reactors economic efficiency is expected to be further improved since energy cost to disperse photocatalysts is eliminated the energy loss due to restricted light transmittance could also be minimized significantly 98 in fact it was proven in athanasekou et al 99 research that light source is the most energy consuming component in the hybrid photocatalysis membrane process the pollutants studied in the research were methyl orange and methylene blue removed by ultrafiltration mono channel monoliths with graphene oxide sheets decorated with tio2 nanoparticles deposited in the pores in short apart from other process parameters and advantages offered by photocatalytic membrane the economical sustainability of a photocatalytic membrane process is highly dependent on efficient usage of light source with this utilization of renewable natural solar energy stands out as a potential substitution to replace artificial light irradiation to minimize energy consumption and cost spent on the light source ps tio2 sio2 nanocomposite membrane was incorporated into solar photovoltaic semi industrial continuous flow photoreactor pv sicfp by isawi et al 69 the pv sicfp system was able to produce 0 5 m3 d of potable water for the local community by harvesting sunlight to power the treatment process cost of electricity was reduced by approximately 36 highlighting the importance to explore solar powered photocatalytic membrane system 4 feasibility of photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in aquaculture effluent harnessing solar energy aquaculture has become a rising industry to provide food source to the world population this is because the catch fishery production has reached ceiling and became relatively stagnant since late 1980s 67 in year 2000 aquaculture production is accounted for a mere 26 3 share of total fishery production however the percentage increases dramatically across the decades escalating to 67 7 53 million tons in year 2017 100 by year 2050 the world population size is projected to enlarge to 9 billion at which aquaculture is expected to grow further simultaneously to support the food needs 101 despite aquaculture succeeds to bridge food supply and demand its effluent that contains various organic and inorganic components could harm the environment when releasing to the surrounding water bodies other than the common constituents such as ammonia nitrogen phosphorus and miscellaneous inorganic salt components aquaculture water also contains antibiotics in order to maintain fish health a study about aquaculture antibiotics by lulijwa et al 102 on the top 15 major countries of aquaculture production shows that 14 classes of antibiotics which comprises of a total of 66 antibiotics were detected in the aquaculture water of these countries among the antibiotics detected the most popular ones are oxytetracycline sulfadiazine and florfenicol followed by amoxicillin erythromycin sulphadimethoxine enrofloxacin and so on several studies have utilized membrane technologies to separate antibiotics from aquaculture wastewater for example peng et al 103 introduced an algal biofilm membrane photobioreactor bf mpbr with the cultivation of microalgae chlorella vulgaris to degrade antibiotics sulfadiazine sdz sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx in real marine aquaculture wastewater the culture of microalgae in a continuous process in bf mpbr successfully reduced sdz smz and smx by 61 0 79 2 50 0 76 7 and 60 8 82 1 respectively based on the different initial antibiotic concentrations ranging from 0 041 to 0 145 mg l another study by farid et al 104 who treated oxytetracycline in synthetic aquaculture effluent containing 3 5 wt nacl and 10 ppm humic acid achieved efficiency 90 in a 24 h forward osmosis operation the high otc degradation efficiency is mainly attributed to the coupled effect of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion between the forward osmosis membrane surface and the otc molecules in the same research work the introduction of nano bubbles into the fo process dramatically alleviated flux decline issue by 40 with minimal effect on the otc degradation also experimenting with synthetic aquaculture wastewater the removal of florfenicol flo antibiotic was accomplished using a thin film composite polyamide nanofilter by esmaili et al 105 by optimizing florfenicol concentration solution ph and transmembrane pressure complete removal of flo at 100 was achieved currently there is no research work published that employs photocatalytic membrane to remove antibiotics in real aquaculture effluent nonetheless as mentioned in section 2 despite membrane technologies have capabilities to separate antibiotics from wastewater the antibiotics still remain in their harmful original forms in this case the potential of the integrated photocatalytic membranes to simultaneously separate and degrade antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater to non toxic compounds is highly anticipated the treated clean water could also be recovered directly and recycled for other usages to further review the feasibility and sustainability of photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater energy consumption and efficiency should be taken into account electricity consumption is inevitable in a photocatalytic membrane wastewater treatment unit to power the circulation of water and to supply light energy for the photocatalytic reaction on top of the electricity cost to acquire power supply in the fish farms is a challenge considering aquaculture farms occupied huge land areas locating outskirt with no comprehensive and readily accessible electricity supply this challenge is even critical for marine aquaculture farms that are built on sea disconnected from getting direct resources from the land nevertheless topographies of aquaculture farms render them the advantage to harvest natural solar energy to power the operations as the farms are usually uncovered by terrestrial plants and urban structures hence extensively exposed to the sunlight the practicability of harnessing natural sunlight to purify wastewater containing antibiotics in photocatalytic membrane processes were assessed in thi thanh nhi et al 106 and augugliaro et al s 107 works thi thanh nhi and the coworkers innovatively fabricate cu2o rgo on flexible and highly porous vietnamese traditional paper vtp for photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin under solar light the microfibrillated cellulose of vtp contributed to the adsorption of ciprofloxacin bringing the pollutant close to the reactive sites of photocatalysts after 1 5 h of solar light irradiation with 10 mg l of ciprofloxacin the photodegradation efficiency successfully reached 80 and the cu2o rgo vtp membrane demonstrated excellent reusability up to 5 cycles 106 on the other hand augugliaro group examined degradation ability of commercial nanofiltration membrane modules coupled with photocatalysts tio2 on antibiotics lincomycin at ph 6 3 pressure of 4 bar temperature of 298 k and initial lincomycin concentration of 75 μm the highest degradation percentage achieved was 97 78 under sunlight irradiation 107 in short implementing solar assisted photocatalytic membranes to treat aquaculture wastewater containing antibiotics is probable more researches could be anticipated towards this direction to achieve real life application of sustainable photocatalytic membrane treatment unit in aquaculture farms 5 conclusion with the rising of antibiotics usage and uncontrolled antibiotics disposal the environment is exposed to the risk of development of arg integrating advantages and mitigating drawbacks of both photocatalysis and membrane filtration photocatalytic membrane is introduced to efficiently treat antibiotics in wastewater two pm configurations namely the slurry pm and immobilized photocatalysts pm are available for antibiotics treatment each having their pros and cons to improve performances of pm several process parameters such as light utilization concentration of initial antibiotics in wastewater amount of photocatalysts ph membrane pore size and tmp as well as simultaneous presence of organic and inorganic pollutant in the wastewater should be scrutinized tio2 and g c3n4 are the most commonly used photocatalysts to be integrated with either ceramic or polymeric based membranes to created pm although ceramic membranes have more superior properties than polymeric membranes in terms of utilization in pm system its usage is significantly compromised by the high cost and harsh synthesis and modification environments the process integration contributes to efficient degradation of antibiotics concomitantly promote reusability and recyclability of the separation unit energy and economic evaluation elucidated that energy required are significantly influenced by process parameters hence the optimization of process conditions is essential to ensure a cost effective pm process as a fast rising industry usage of antibiotics in aquaculture surged to prevent diseases in aquatic animals conventional treatment of antibiotics in the aquaculture water is hindered by geographical limitations as it is difficult to supply high amount of electricity to aquaculture platforms located outskirt or offshore since the aquaculture platforms are at open area and would receive abundance of natural sunlight irradiation pm which has potential to function harnessing sunlight sees its future potential in treating antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater powered by solar energy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

12635,development of antibiotic resistance genes contributed by unregulated disposal of antibiotics to the environment has become an overwhelming risk worldwide an evolutionary technology photocatalytic membrane pm that integrates both photocatalysis and membrane separation in one unit is introduced to treat the antibiotics the ability of photocatalytic membrane to simultaneously degrade antibiotics while promoting handy recovery of photocatalysts from the wastewater dramatically enhances process sustainability and minimize treatment unit footprint to date reviews on antibiotics removal only focus on standalone photocatalysis and membrane process in this work a pioneer overview that focuses on treatment of one specific pollutant antibiotics by employing the hybrid pm technology was performed configurations of pm materials including ceramic and polymer used as the membrane base are summarized followed by factors influencing performance of the integrated process photocatalysts harnessed in photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics mainly focused on tio2 and g c3n4 regardless of the materials of membranes from energy consumption and economic evaluations of pm technology process parameters are reported to significantly influence the energy requirement and costing as light source is accounted for the highest portion of energy consumption harnessing natural sunlight to power the photocatalytic reaction would be a great direction to be ventured into future potential of sunlight powered photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in the escalating aquaculture industry is proposed keywords antibiotics photocatalytic membranes membrane materials energy consumption economic evaluation aquaculture data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the global concern over inadequacy of clean water has been overwhelming as a result of uncontrolled urbanization and industrialization quality of water was drastically deteriorated by reckless released of effluents from a myriad of industries hospitals and so on 1 one of the pollutants disposed the antibiotics have raised alarm of the public antibiotics are categorized as the contaminants of emerging concerns while antibiotics are efficient and are frequently used to treat infectious diseases in humans and animals its presence in the aqueous environment would cause adverse impacts trace amounts of antibiotics have been detected in ground water lakes reservoirs fish hatcheries and sediments 2 3 these antibiotics could potentially trigger development of antibiotics resistance genes arg subsequently leading to ineffective medical treatments aggravatedly global antibiotics consumption is reported to be escalating in an unusual rate to cope demand for animal proteins 4 besides utilizing antibiotics for medical treatment the antibiotics are administered into animals by means of growth booster in poultry production agriculture aquaculture and many more a remarkable high level of 95 of the antibiotics administered is undigested and unmetabolized by the animals hence secreting the residues with urine and faeces 5 to maintain aesthetic value of the nature various treatment technologies that are potentially beneficial for antibiotics removal have been introduced for examples anaerobic membrane bioreactors 6 adsorption 7 nanoparticles 8 electrochemical 9 advanced oxidation process 10 ion exchange 11 and many more these methods have high efficiency to treat antibiotics however they are associated with major drawbacks such as formation of secondary waste and difficult to be reused ion exchangers for instance could not be reproduced difficult to treat large amounts of effluents poor thermal and radiation stability 11 instead photocatalytic membrane pm a process integration of photocatalysis and membrane appears as a feasible treatment to alleviate these drawbacks unlike adsorption that merely removes antibiotics without degrading them and producing secondary pollution 12 photocatalysis is considered a green technology as it transforms harmful parental compounds into non toxic products like water and carbon dioxide 13 it is also known to be able to remove antibiotics at low concentration in a short time 14 there are quite a number of photocatalysts known and being employed to remove antibiotics some of the examples are tio2 15 graphitic carbon nitride 16 zno 17 wo3 18 bivo4 19 and biobr 20 many methods have also been introduced to improve their photocatalysts efficiency including to fabricate composite by coupling of noble metals doping with transition metals and non metals the photocatalyst composites often play main role in preventing rapid recombination of electron hole pairs 21 on the other hand membrane technology is employed for wastewater treatment attributed to their high productivity easy scaling less addition of chemical additive and no phase change involved 21 membranes could be synthesized using either ceramic or polymeric materials depending on desired membrane properties by introducing pm the benefits of both photocatalysis and membrane technologies are integrated meanwhile mitigating challenges faced by the single technology e g photocatalysts are difficult to be recovered from wastewater and membranes commonly suffered from fouling issue besides materials performances of pm are influenced by many other process parameters all these determining factors should be given attention as operation parameters impact the cost and energy consumption directly in a pm process 22 numerous review papers have been published to constructively discuss the progress of photocatalytic membranes in terms of fabrication and applications of tio2 23 and g c3n4 24 based photocatalytic membranes factors influencing performance of membrane 25 various applications of photocatalytic membrane for water treatment 26 and materials used to produce photocatalytic membrane 21 some of these papers mentioned pharmaceutical products as one of the critical pollutants to be treated however none of the papers reviews treatment of antibiotics using photocatalytic membrane in depth in view of the urgency to remove antibiotics from wastewater and the superiority of photocatalytic membrane the aim of this paper is to comprehensively review the feasibility of photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in effluent challenges associated with conventional photocatalysis and membrane filtration are summarized following that usage of photocatalytic membranes to remove antibiotics are reviewed in terms of configurations process influencing factors materials energy consumption and economic evaluation as well as the future prospect of pm in treating antibiotics from aquaculture wastewater 2 feasibility and challenges of photocatalysis and membrane separation to treat antibiotics in wastewater photocatalysis and membrane separation technologies have been utilized to treat antibiotics in wastewater a photocatalysis process is initiated by excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of photocatalysts upon absorption of sufficient light energy forming electron hole pairs the photocatalytic activity is a redox reaction the electrons and holes formed will then react with water molecules to generate reactive oxygen species ross such as oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 the ross subsequently degrade pollutants adsorbed on their surfaces via oxidization and reduction one of the key factors to determine efficiency of photocatalysts is whether the energy of the light absorbed is higher than the band gap energy of the photocatalyst so that photocarriers can be produced to degrade the antibiotics furthermore the photocatalyst must have conduction and valence band positions that can induce hydrogen evolution and generation of superoxide radical thermodynamically substantial amount of research works has been conducted to explore functionalities and performances of photocatalysts to disintegrate antibiotics 27 those photocatalysts can be classified into four types namely metal oxide sulfides polymeric carbon nitride and bismuth based photocatalysts 27 recombination of electron hole pairs of the photocatalysts hinders high photocatalysis efficiency to minimize e h recombination and to improve utilization of light energy many researches have been focusing on exploring the creations of heterojunction photocatalysts by combining distinct semiconductors that have unequal band structure which could generate band alignments to facilitate higher efficient redox reactions 28 for example chen et al 29 fabricated au cus tio2 nanobelts nb composite that exhibited superior photocatalytic properties the au cus tio2 nb could achieve much higher percentage of 96 oxytetracycline otc decomposition than pure tio2 nb 66 due to better absorption of light lower band gap higher separation efficiency of charge carriers in another research work by yan et al 30 p n junction photocatalysts nitrogen doped graphene quantum dots ngqds bioi mnnb2o6 was synthesized via hydrothermal method the pure mnnb2o6 and bioi demonstrated poor photocatalytic activity with only 7 2 and 30 5 of tetracycline degradation under 60 min 250 w xenon lamp irradiation on the contrary the ngqds bioi mnnb2o6 that improved reaction rate constant by 27 6 fold and 5 6 fold compared to pure mnnb2o6 and bioi escalated the degradation performance up to 87 2 when degrading tetracycline environmental remediation could also be realized as analysis results from hplc ms showed that the composite photocatalysts successfully transform the antibiotics into unharmful co2 and h2o and some tiny inorganic molecular compounds z scheme and s scheme heterojunction photocatalysts are also promising to remove antibiotics dual z scheme bi2zr2o7 g c3n4 ag3po4 photocatalysts was synthesized by qu et al 31 to reduce high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers by suppressing photo corrosion degradation efficiency of tetracycline was attained up to 86 2 under visible light similarly gong et al 32 established a z scheme cdte tio2 heterostructure photocatalyst to degrade tetracycline in wastewater it was found that the z scheme charge transfer mechanism facilitated generation of superoxide radicals subsequently contributing to high photocatalytic activity under 30 min of irradiation 78 of tetracycline was successfully removed on the other hand s scheme photocatalysts produced by sun et al 33 also exhibited strong redox capability by supplying effective charge migrating channels the s scheme photocatalysts synthesized was a composite of s gc3n4 tio2 sio2 pan aerogel which was capable to remove 84 2 of tetracycline and possesses advantages of prominent reusability light weight and efficiency recyclability furthermore by fabricating s scheme zno zn3 po4 2 via co precipitation method beshkar et al 34 removed tetracycline at 82 efficiency under visible light irradiation which was 1 5 times more than unmodified zn3 po4 2 nanostructure a few other examples of composite photocatalysts to effectively treat antibiotics are summarized in table 1 treatment of antibiotics with membranes is associated with several benefits such as does not involve additional chemicals antibiotics can be selectively removed the reusability of the membrane and membrane is handier for large scale continuous operations 42 separations of antibiotics by membranes are carried out under different mechanisms depend on the physicochemical properties of the antibiotics and solutions as well as characteristics of the membranes for antibiotics factors that would affect the mechanisms include their molecular weight cut off pk a hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity furthermore ph ionic strength of solutions and material surface morphology and pore size of membranes would also govern the separation mechanism while some hydrophobic antibiotics are removed by adsorbing to the membrane many other antibiotics are separated via size exclusion 43 several research works that utilized various kinds of membrane configurations to remove different types of antibiotics are summarized in table 2 though both photocatalysis and membrane are effective and feasible to treat antibiotics these treatment methods face sustainability challenges the main difference between photocatalysis and membrane is that photocatalysis is a chemical process while the latter is a physical process the main differences between photocatalysis and membrane filtration are clearly compared and compiled in table 3 3 photocatalytic membrane hybrid mitigation towards fouling and secondary treatment issues a process intensification technology namely photocatalytic membrane is introduced to provide a hybrid solution for problems faced by both photocatalysis and membrane separation a photocatalytic membrane consists of photocatalysts either surface coated or embedded in the membrane matrix the membrane simultaneously acts as a substrate that houses the photocatalysts and a selective separation barrier to remove unwanted pollutants in this case the secondary step to remove photocatalysts from the wastewater can be eliminated 52 the photocatalysts on the other hand improve hydrophilicity of membrane and break down pollutants attached to the membrane surface and pores thus alleviating membrane fouling therefore there is minimal extra burden imposed on the pump to pressurize permeate across the membrane and the membrane cleaning frequency is also reduced 52 in short the photocatalytic membrane is advantageous to be a more sustainable multimodal separation unit than the standalone photocatalysis and membrane technology 54 3 1 configurations of photocatalytic membranes integration of photocatalysis and membrane to purify wastewater containing antibiotics consists of two main configurations 1 suspended photocatalysts in membrane reactor 2 immobilized photocatalysts on in membrane the first configuration being the photocatalysts and membrane exist as two independent units in the setup in this configuration photocatalyst is suspended in the feed solution while the membrane serves as the separation unit between the feed and permeate the main purpose is to simultaneously separate the photocatalysts and to recover treated water from the feed the benefit of suspended photocatalyst are large surface area and direct contact with pollutant that promote great antibiotics degradation yield however the nano sized photocatalysts tend to agglomerate and compromise the degradation performance furthermore deposition of photocatalysts on membrane surface during treatment process would render member fouling an undesirable phenomenon 55 this phenomenon was depicted in wang et al s 56 study whereby suspended photocatalysts tio2 was found deposited on the cross flow microfiltration membrane surface when treating penicillin g the reduction of available photocatalyst in the feed resulted in degradation efficiency of merely 84 moreover cake layer was formed from the deposition of photocatalysts causing permeate flux decline for 7 25 in the 4 h treatment process when continuous backwashing was introduced to dislodge the deposited tio2 the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies improved to 95 furthermore the permeate flux recorded was constant with no obvious reduction throughout the separation application apart from that presence of photocatalysts dispersed in the water would also potentially restrict efficiency transmission and scattering of light to trigger photocatalytic reaction second configuration being the immobilization of photocatalysts either on the membrane surface by coating or by blending into the membrane matrix this configuration is implemented by majority of researches to degrade antibiotics in wastewater photocatalysts are immobilized on in the membrane thus preventing agglomeration of photocatalysts and photocatalysts recovery post treatment can be avoided 55 this configuration also aids in mitigating membrane fouling issue via disintegration of deposited pollutants on the membrane by the coated embedded photocatalysts 55 besides there are studies whereby the immobilized photocatalysts improve hydrophilicity of the membrane which also alleviated membrane fouling and increased permeate flux 57 nevertheless despite immobilized photocatalysts is more advantageous than suspended photocatalysts in many aspects immobilization of photocatalyst resulted in reduction of contact area and active sites for antibiotics degradation apart from that photocatalysts might leach from the membrane overtime due to abrasion during the separation process amount of photocatalysts is also fixed and cannot be altered in the treatment system a research conducted by espindola et al 58 to degrade 5 mg l oxytetracycline otc using tio2 p25 and ceramic microfiltration mf membrane provides a clear comparison between the two configurations fig 1 in the evaluation the mf membrane did not reject otc molecules but served its function to separate suspended tio2 p25 from passing to the permeate and as the substrate to immobilized tio2 p25 the investigation reported that slurry tio2 p25 contributed to higher otc removal efficiency 90 after 30 min due to higher photocatalytic area but causing a drastic 66 permeate flux decline after 5 h of treatment a dense tio2 p25 cake layer was observed on the mf membrane on the contrary when the tio2 p25 was loaded on the membrane otc removal could also reach 90 but the duration needed was prolonged to 150 min however a mere 8 of flux declined were observed showing substantial improvement as compared to the slurry membrane photoreactor in addition the recyclability of tio2 p25 loaded membrane was proven as its performance was maintained after 3 cycles of treatments 3 2 factors affecting efficacies of photocatalytic membrane performances of photocatalytic membranes are governed concomitantly by degradation efficacies of antibiotics as well as sustainability of the photocatalytic membranes to enhance photocatalytic redox reactions efforts have been devoted to increase light utilization rate and reduce electron hole recombination rate of the photocatalysts 54 as reviewed in section 2 in the case of membrane filtrations fouling is a critical challenge that reduces membrane productivity and sustainability common fouling mechanisms include the clogging of pores partially or completely internal pore blocking and formation of cake layer on the membrane surfaces 59 incorporation of photocatalysts that could improve hydrophilicity of the membranes is yet another method to alleviate photocatalytic membrane performances furthermore initial concentration of antibiotics in the treatment system was reported to affect degradation efficacies 60 other than the factors mentioned some other parameters that would affect the treatment process are discussed in the following paragraphs the amount of photocatalysts suspended or loaded on in membrane would influence the degradation performance it is undeniable that higher amount of photocatalysts suspended in feed solution or loaded on in membrane would provide more photocatalytic sites for antibiotics degradation however excessive photocatalysts causes negative effect as they tend to agglomerate hence impeded contact between internal ros and the antibiotics 61 presence of excess amount of suspended photocatalysts would also restrict light scattering to induce photocatalytic reaction and foul the membrane which subsequently reduce permeate flux as demonstrated in li et al 62 and espindola et al s 58 works respectively in wang et al s 60 study it was found that while degrading tc 10 mg l the degradation efficiency increased from 0 to 50 when increasing zno n g c3n4 photocatalysts loading from 0 to 1 12 mg cm2 on pvdf membrane further increment of photocatalysts loading deteriorate the degradation efficiency espindola et al 58 also reported increment in otc degradation up to 90 when coating layers of tio2 p25 on al2o3 membrane increased to 3 layers further layering of photocatalysts resulted in insignificant enhancement of otc degradation this is a phenomenon governed by front side illumination mechanism reaction efficiency would escalate with thicker photocatalysts film until a point where the film absorbed the light completely this point forward effect of further rising the film thickness was negligible to the reaction efficiency as there would not be any changes to the diffusional length of charge carriers to the catalyst liquid interface 63 membrane pore size and transmembrane pressure tmp mainly affect photocatalytic membrane s permeate flux production subsequently the efficiency of antibiotics disintegration with narrower pore size and lower tmp permeate flux would be reduced nevertheless reduction in permeate flux contributes positively towards breaking down of antibiotics due to longer retention time thus longer reaction time for the photocatalysts to degrade the retained antibiotics the evidence was shown in wang et al s 60 research at which best degradation efficiencies of tetracycline tc at 55 was achieved using the ga zno n g c3n4 up050 photocatalyst membrane with the smallest pore size at 50 kda degradation of tc utilizing the same membrane was then alleviated to 71 7 when applying the lowest tmp in the study at 0 005 mpa despite that in both cases narrowest pore size and lowest tmp the membrane had the lowest permeate flux compared to its counterpart with larger pore sizes and higher tmp ph influences generation of ros zwitterion form of antibiotics and repulsion force between antibiotics and the photocatalytic membranes for example cf c3n4 bi2moo6 cloth was used to degrade tetracycline in solution across ph 3 5 7 9 11 in shen et al s 64 study the highest degradation activity at 86 was attained at ph 5 as a result of formation of h which could combine with o2 to generate oh that could take part in the redox reaction when ph increased from 5 to 11 the tetracycline degradation rate dropped to 61 reason being adsorption between tetracycline and the photocatalysts was hindered due to electrostatic repulsion force the effect of ph on degradation efficiency of antibiotics was also highlighted in li et al s 62 investigation in the research removal efficiency of amoxicillin with suspended tio2 in ceramic membrane photoreactor was attained at 61 6 ph 2 7 reaching the highest at 83 3 ph 6 5 then dropped at increasing ph at 80 3 ph 9 0 and 31 6 ph 11 5 after 180 min the efficiency is highly influenced by the states of tio2 at different ph at ph lower than point of zero charge pzc of tio2 ph 6 8 which is an acidic condition the amoxicillin does not favor adsorption on the tio2 additionally tio2 has high tendency to agglomerate reducing adsorption and reactive sites and photon absorption when the solution is acidic as ph increased the tio2 surface contains more oh ions thus improving removal efficiency until reaching a limit at ph 9 in highly alkali condition the excess oh ions would fill the holes generated by photocatalysis of tio2 hence resulted in decline of photocatalytic efficiency the same photocatalyst may result in different degradation efficiencies on different antibiotics as photocatalytic activity is a redox reaction the ability of the photocatalysts in the photocatalytic system to oxidize and reduce antibiotics is one of the factors governing the efficiency of photocatalytic membranes different antibiotics have different oxidization potential in this case the valence band position of the photocatalysts becomes a determining factor on whether the photogenerated holes are able to oxidize the antibiotics directly apart from the parental antibiotics oxidation potential of intermediates formed along the degradation process is also a critical aspect to be examined to ensure complete degradation of the antibiotics 27 besides molecular structures of antibiotics also dictate the redox reactions polysulfone poly acrylic acid cadmium sulfide pes paa cds membrane was fabricated by chen et al 65 then degradations of three different antibiotics namely tetracycline hydrochloride tc ciprofloxacin cip and sulfamethoxazole smx with the same concentration 10 mg l and volume 25 ml was investigated using the pes paa cds removal percentage for tc was the highest at 60 6 followed by cip 24 1 and smx 12 8 the antibiotics structural analysis revealed that tc has the highest number of biphenyl and many side groups followed by cip while smx has no biphenyl and side group structures the ros generated by pes paa cds tend to oxidize and degrade biphenyl and side chain structures therefore explaining the degradation percentage of the different antibiotics 3 3 materials of photocatalytic membranes undoubtedly the photocatalytic efficiency of antibiotics degradation can be maximized by adjusting process parameters as discussed in section 3 2 however being the backbone of antibiotics treatment unit the choice of materials for the photocatalytic membrane is the key pre requisite to ensure excellent robust and sustainable antibiotic treatment processes the materials used as the membrane base are categorized into two groups which are inorganic ceramics and organic polymers for photocatalytic membranes mxene is the most commonly adopted ceramic materials mxene is synthesized via chemical etching of max ti3alc2 phase in hcl and lif mixed solution 66 on the contrary many types of polymers are employed to fabricate photocatalytic membranes some of the polymer examples are polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polyethersulfone pes polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe some of the fabrication techniques for polymeric membranes are thermally or non solvent phase inversion melt extrusion stretching sintering and electrospinning due to different natures of the polymers the fabrication techniques varied for example as a non polar polymer ptfe membranes are commonly synthesized via sintering or melt extrusion processes pvdf on the other hand is versatile dissolvable in common solvents and can be prepared via various methods 67 considering the fact that the photocatalytic membrane has to be able to withstand reactive species attacks during the photocatalytic reaction ceramic membranes appear to be a better choice of material due to its robustness the hydrophilicity of ceramic membrane also renders it good anti fouling ability in spite of that usage of polymeric membranes is significantly more prevalent than the ceramic membranes attributed by the cheaper price and more readily tunable properties comparisons of the advantages and disadvantages of ceramic and polymeric membranes are summarized in table 4 semiconductor photocatalysts are commonly used to couple with the base membranes to fabricate photocatalytic membranes regardless of ceramic or polymeric membranes the most popular photocatalysts are tio2 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 while tio2 is favored for its high chemical and thermal stability low toxicity high quantum yield and relatively low cost 52 g c3n4 is popular for its ability to utilize visible light metal free relatively narrow band gap tailorable structures and excellent stability 24 pure tio2 and g c3n4 suffered from several drawbacks that compromise their degradation efficacies thus both of these catalysts are usually combined with other metals or materials via a wide range of methods to create doped or heterojunction photocatalysts to enhance photocatalytic performances 3 3 1 tio2 based photocatalytic membranes tio2 go fe3o4 composite was used by li and the colleagues 70 in a submerged magnetic separation ceramic membrane photocatalytic reactor smsmpr to concomitantly degrade amoxicillin amx and recover photocatalysts in slurry with the aid of 20 mm h2o2 degradation of amx could reach 90 1 under visible light irradiation the incorporation of go into the photocatalyst creates heterojunction that promotes fast separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs contributing to amx degradation by the h leaving in the valence band meanwhile go also enhanced fe iii fe ii reduction cycle which played vital role to activate h2o2 to generate oh as mentioned in section 3 1 slurry photoreactor is prone to membrane fouling due to the dense cake layer formed by photocatalyst deposition the drawback is innovatively eliminated in this study by synergically implementing backwashing treatment by air compressor and external magnetic field schematic diagram of the process flow is illustrated in fig 2 while the backwashing was applied via the unique hollow structure of the ceramic membrane to wash off the deposited layer external magnetic field induced photocatalysts separation through magnetism provided by fe3o4 after analyzing intermediates formed during degradation of amoxicillin by a q tof lc ms system it was confirmed that the intermediates were mineralized to carbon dioxide water and inorganic ions electrospun ceramic nanofibers are known to have finer structures and larger specific surface area for better photocatalytic activities with that pascariu et al 71 examined the degradation functionalities of la3 tio2 nanofibers with diverse la3 composition ratios 0 025 1 and calcination temperatures 400 700 c on antibiotics ciprofloxacin successful combination of la3 tio2 was observed under tem eds and xrd results depicted that 0 1 la3 doping level and 600 c are the most optimal parameters to provide desired optical properties nanofibers morphologies and crystallinities after 300 min of irradiation under 400 w halogen lamp a drastic decrease of ciprofloxacin was reached at 99 5 by degradation of 0 1 la3 tio2 with kinetic rate constant of 1 981 10 2 min 1 the nanofiber was also able to maintain the ciprofloxacin degradation at 99 after 5 consecutive cycles of treatments showing its reusability another photocatalytic nanofiber namely the flexible ag zno tio2 fibrous membranes were fabricated by song et al 72 unlike fragility of traditional ceramic fibers the ag zno tio2 fibrous membranes could be bent to 180 then recovered to the original state without any damage the good mechanical flexibility might be due to the continuous fiber networks and lesser breakages of fibers fig 3 this flexibility has huge benefits that the fibrous membrane could be used directly in liquid phase system without needing to be fixed by any binders and is readily recycled from water via direct extracting from fig 3 it could also be observed that the modified nanofibers have ag and zno depositing uniformly on the tio2 electrospun membrane the homogeneous binding of an and zno resulted in effective heterojunction and large specific area for excellent catalytic performance as proven by hrtem and bet analysis while degrading tetracycline hydrochloride a remarkable 91 6 removal rate was successfully achieved after 60 min of irradiation on the other hand though more susceptible to ros attacks attributed to the lower cost polymeric membranes especially polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes are more popular to be used as the membrane base pvdf has major advantage of high thermal stability excellent chemical resistance and mechanical properties due to the presence of fluoride groups examined by chin et al 73 pvdf membranes are able to withstand prolonged exposure to uv illumination up to 30 days some of the studies that reported efficacies of tio2 based polymeric photocatalytic membranes to treat antibiotics in wastewater are summarized in table 5 3 3 2 g c3n4 based photocatalytic membranes g c3n4 is a metal free photocatalysts that can utilize visible light more readily than tio2 owing to its extended light absorption band towards the visible light region however fast recombination of electron hole pairs is a disadvantage of g c3n4 mxene a ceramic material with excellent metallic conductivity energy storage and surface rich with oh o and other functional groups endow it fantastic reactivity and hydrophilicity by combining mxene with g c3n4 a shorter electron transport channel could be attained to speed up electrons movement and a heterojunction is created to alleviate challenge of electron hole separations in pure g c3n4 besides mxene also provides nano scaled channels for mass transfer and it also has easily tunable layer spacing and composition the hydroxyl functional groups and large specific area of mxene could also adsorb antibiotics further promoting reactive activities 66 when using g c3n4 mxene pes composite membrane to separate tetracycline hydrochloride tch via dead end filtration zeng et al 66 reported 86 of tch degradation the tch removal was mainly contributed by photocatalytic degradation the physical sieving of tch by membrane only accounted for 14 of the removal due to relatively low molecular weight of tch at 480 9 da furthermore lin et al 81 constructed mxene chitosan g c3n4 pvdf membrane via a dual regulation strategy that was capable to remove tch almost completely under observation of tem and sem the g c3n4 exhibited typical sheet like structure as illustrated in fig 4 g c3n4 was blended into pvdf to fabricate a support layer then chitosan cs decorated mxene nanosheets were stacked on top as the separation layer cs not only regulated layer spacing of mxene but also enhanced adsorption capacity and stability of the composite membrane an interfacial heterojunction was also generated between the support g c3n4 pvdf and separation layer mxene chitosan according to the density functional theory it was confirmed that efficient charge transfer between photocatalytic support layer g c3n4 pvdf and the mxene separation layer plays the main role in strong photocatalytic activity similar to tio2 most of the g c3n4 research works focused on harnessing polymeric materials as the base of the photocatalytic membranes various antibiotics have been embraced as the pollutant models such as tetracycline sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and so on in those studies the g c3n4 photocatalysts composites are either layered on the polymeric membrane supports mostly via vacuum filtration method or intercalated into the membrane structure besides improving antibiotics degradation efficiency merging of photocatalyst with the membranes also enhance the membranes hydrophilicity and pore channels for more effective mass transfer results and findings of the research works are summarized in detailed in table 6 3 3 3 graphene based photocatalytic membrane graphene based materials have exhibited intrinsic photocatalytic properties and are usually used as support or co catalysts due to its large surface area robust and excellent light absorption ability as pure graphene is a zero band gap semiconductor it is not suitable to be used directly as a photocatalyst because electrons and holes would recombine instantaneously rather graphene oxide go and reduced graphene oxide rgo are usually adopted as they could behave as semiconductor due to availability of oxygen functionalities 89 a novel graphene oxide prussian blue covalent triazine framework go pb ctf heterogenous membrane was synthesized by li et al 90 to degrade amoxicillin the go pb ctf composite being described as the active mega cube was vacuum filtered through polymeric cellulose acetate support to produce the photocatalytic membrane that facilitates ultrafast water transport and solar cleaning the ultrafast water transport was resulted by the enlarged channels between go nanosheets and mega cube faces as illustrated in fig 5 leading to 40 fold improvement of flux 170 l m2h in vacuum assisted dead end filtration as compared to the pure go membrane an in situ heating environment was also offered by the heterogeneous interface inhibiting recombination of e h pairs hence promoting excellent amoxicillin degradation 95 besides separating pollutants via molecular sieving the active mega cubes also efficiently alleviate membrane fouling in addition the novel composite membrane exhibited good sustainability with stable solar cleaning and the membrane integrity was remained after 3 days continuous operation to obtain antifouling membranes for membrane distillation md process rgo bi2wo6 photocatalysts were immobilized on pvdf membranes by li et al 91 the successful immobilization and concentration changes of the photocatalysts were proven by atr ftir and xrd analysis the photocatalytic membrane was fabricated via a double layer coating method through non solvent induced phase separation after embedding the composite photocatalyst water contact angle of the modified membrane was enhanced by about 30 from the pristine membrane which was beneficial to promote hydrophobicity to improve md performance while the photocatalytic membrane recorded high desalination rate the removal rates for 10 mg l aqueous ciprofloxacin under visible light for 7 5 h were in the range of 26 26 to 59 95 also the embedded rgo bi2wo6 photocatalysts could eliminate strongly bound foulants and recover permeation flux of membrane demonstrating its high potential in fouling mitigation also using rgo li et al 92 investigated degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride in photocatalysis assisted microbial fuel cell membrane bioreactor mfc mbr system harnessing photocatalytic composite membrane coated with cofe2o4 rgo and pvdf on carbon fiber cloth while conventional mfc mbr system was not able to decompose pollutants the coupling of photocatalysis allows efficient simultaneous waste separation and degradation uv vis absorption results showed that the composited cofe2o4 rgo photocatalyst had a red shift and widened absorption wavelength compared to the pristine cofe2o4 signifying enhanced usage of visible light under synergy effect of mfc mbr and cofe2o4 rgo the highest removal rate of tetracycline hydrochloride achieved 98 3 3 4 miscellaneous photocatalysts coupled photocatalytic membranes apart from tio2 c3n4 and graphene based photocatalysts there are also other photocatalysts that are proven to effectively ameliorate performances of photocatalytic membranes pvdf membrane is a hydrophobic polymeric membrane to promote water affinity to the membrane so as to facilitate antibiotics adsorption popa et al 93 rendered the pvdf membrane hydrophilic by deposition of zno nanoparticles first the pvdf membrane was functionalized by l dopa which subsequently provide anchors for in situ growth of zno from the contact angle measurement the pvdf p l dopa zno hybrid membranes exhibited reduced contact angle up to 55 from 103 recorded by the pristine pvdf membrane apart from improving hydrophilicity the p l dopa zno z scheme photocatalyst effectively prevented recombination of photogenerated e h pairs while there are several ros generated in the photocatalytic system the radical spin trapping experiment suggested that h is the main contributor for the photodegradation process after 5 h of uv light irradiation only a satisfactory level of 71 of oxytetracycline otc was degraded from the feed solution as photocatalytic degradation pathways involve scissions of various types of bonds via deamination dehydroxylation demethylation and ring opening reactions it was justified that otc that has a complex structure makes it more difficult to be degraded using tetracycline hydrochloride tc as the pollutant model cheng and the co workers 57 examined degradation and permeation performances of biocl mxene pes composite membrane the incorporation of mxene a ceramic material induced 2d membrane structure creating micron scale membrane pore channels that eased molecular transport due to small molecular size of tc only around 10 of tc was separated via physical membrane separation after initiating photocatalytic reaction degradation of tc was enhanced drastically to 96 under simultaneous effects of physical sieving and photocatalytic degradation besides escalating photocatalytic activity due to oxygen vacancies formed by the strong interaction between polypyrrole ppy and biocl the biocl ppy photocatalysts composite also significantly reduced the water contact angle of membrane from 70 8 to 19 8 under synergy effect of highly enhanced hydrophilicity and presence of membrane pore channels permeate flux as high as 3680 2 l m2h was achieved there is another research work that utilized ceramic materials decorated photocatalysts to degrade fluoroquinolone antibiotics levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin 94 when operating independently agi based catalysts could efficiently degrade pollutants with good stability however it suffers from several drawbacks such as low adsorption capacity and poor recyclability due to the powdery form therefore in this study to mitigate the drawbacks agi was combined with uio 66 nh2 to form heterojunction photocatalysts supported on carbon filter cloth cfc to treat levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin under visible light irradiation the uio 66 nh2 provides large surface area for adsorption while the cfc acts as substrate to immobilized the photocatalysts the cfc uio 66 nh2 agi showed broader light absorption edge 440 nm than the cfc uio 66 nh2 proving functionality of agi in enhancing photo response rate the cfc uio 66 nh2 agi also demonstrated degradation kinetics of 0 01211 min 1 which is around 9 2 fold and 1 5 fold higher than uio 66 nh2 and cfc agi respectively when exploring degradation capability of the synthesized photocatalysts membrane composite removal rate of 84 5 and 79 6 were successfully attained by the cfc uio 66 nh2 agi when degrading levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin respectively in a batch mode reactor 3 4 energy consumption and economic evaluation of the photocatalytic membrane technology economic aspects of a treatment process involve both capital cost capex and operating costs opex the capex comprises of land purchase construction and decommissioning costs while the opex are directly affected by energy and chemical consumption as well as manpower required for operations and maintenances 95 hence minimizing or optimizing these determining factors would definitely contributes to cost reduction economic evaluation studies for photocatalytic membrane are extremely scarce and there is no available economic assessment for photocatalytic membrane treatment using antibiotics as the pollutant model for the time being nonetheless costing breakdown of photocatalytic membrane process examined using other pollutants in several research works may provide insights for more economically efficient antibiotics degradation process for a slurry type photocatalytic membrane reactor rani and karthikeyan 96 investigated cost of photocatalysis and membrane filtration separately as they are two different processes a flat sheet pes uf membrane was rolled into a cylinder with a 16 w uv c lamp at the center being installed together in a reactor in this study only 16 5m2 of area was needed which is half of the area when membrane was applied as pre or post treatment as photocatalytic reaction and membrane separation happened in the same reactor simultaneously based on the investigation the treatment cost for 1 m3 of wastewater containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ranged from 10 4 to 13 6 for the photocatalytic process reactor cost which took photocatalytic degradation kinetics and energy supply to the uv lamp into account composed of the highest amount of the overall costing this result shows the importance of harnessing photocatalysts with high degradation kinetics to shorten reaction time hence preventing prolonged energy consumption on the other hand the necessity of frequent membrane replacement and pressure requirement are challenges to keep the filtration costing low from the cost calculation it was reported that membrane filtration cost is 1 5 times higher than that of photocatalytic reaction alone however when considering photocatalysts reusability and recovery removal of compound and efficiency of mineralization membrane filtration is more advantageous than photocatalytic oxidation this statement was proven by the result in the research by coupling photocatalysis and membrane separation in one unit the same catalysts can be recovered and reused for 7 cycles whereas for standalone photocatalytic process fresh catalysts have to be applied for each cycle which drastically increase the treatment cost operating time for photocatalytic membrane is also merely half of the conventional photocatalysis process therefore rani and karthikeyan 96 concluded that the process integration of photocatalysis and membrane filtration is more superior than the standalone treatment processes energy usage directly impacts the cost required for a photocatalytic membrane process another slurry photoreactor combined with polytetrafluoroethylene microfiltration membrane by damodar et al 22 to remove reactive black 5 dye was evaluated for its energy consumption ec using eq 1 1 ec kwh l w hrt v whereby w is the wattage of the light source hrt is the hydraulic retention time and v is the volume based on the equation the ec was substantially influenced by operating parameters thus determining optimum operating conditions is essential to ensure a cost effective and sustainable treatment process also degrading reactive black 5 dye in a slurry membrane reactor and using eq 1 laohaprapanon et al 97 reported energy consumption of 0 12 kw l or 1 62 kwh g dye removed based on electricity cost in taiwan 0 09 usd kwh it is estimated that the electricity cost for dye removal in this study is 0 15 usd g the author emphasized that the cost could vary according to operating conditions higher energy requirement and operating cost would be required with the increment of initial dye concentration or presence of foreign pollutant in the effluent leading to requirement of higher light intensity and longer exposure time the economic feasibility of photocatalytic membrane is further demonstrated by examining photocatalysts immobilized photocatalytic reactors by using immobilized photocatalytic reactors rather than the slurry reactors economic efficiency is expected to be further improved since energy cost to disperse photocatalysts is eliminated the energy loss due to restricted light transmittance could also be minimized significantly 98 in fact it was proven in athanasekou et al 99 research that light source is the most energy consuming component in the hybrid photocatalysis membrane process the pollutants studied in the research were methyl orange and methylene blue removed by ultrafiltration mono channel monoliths with graphene oxide sheets decorated with tio2 nanoparticles deposited in the pores in short apart from other process parameters and advantages offered by photocatalytic membrane the economical sustainability of a photocatalytic membrane process is highly dependent on efficient usage of light source with this utilization of renewable natural solar energy stands out as a potential substitution to replace artificial light irradiation to minimize energy consumption and cost spent on the light source ps tio2 sio2 nanocomposite membrane was incorporated into solar photovoltaic semi industrial continuous flow photoreactor pv sicfp by isawi et al 69 the pv sicfp system was able to produce 0 5 m3 d of potable water for the local community by harvesting sunlight to power the treatment process cost of electricity was reduced by approximately 36 highlighting the importance to explore solar powered photocatalytic membrane system 4 feasibility of photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in aquaculture effluent harnessing solar energy aquaculture has become a rising industry to provide food source to the world population this is because the catch fishery production has reached ceiling and became relatively stagnant since late 1980s 67 in year 2000 aquaculture production is accounted for a mere 26 3 share of total fishery production however the percentage increases dramatically across the decades escalating to 67 7 53 million tons in year 2017 100 by year 2050 the world population size is projected to enlarge to 9 billion at which aquaculture is expected to grow further simultaneously to support the food needs 101 despite aquaculture succeeds to bridge food supply and demand its effluent that contains various organic and inorganic components could harm the environment when releasing to the surrounding water bodies other than the common constituents such as ammonia nitrogen phosphorus and miscellaneous inorganic salt components aquaculture water also contains antibiotics in order to maintain fish health a study about aquaculture antibiotics by lulijwa et al 102 on the top 15 major countries of aquaculture production shows that 14 classes of antibiotics which comprises of a total of 66 antibiotics were detected in the aquaculture water of these countries among the antibiotics detected the most popular ones are oxytetracycline sulfadiazine and florfenicol followed by amoxicillin erythromycin sulphadimethoxine enrofloxacin and so on several studies have utilized membrane technologies to separate antibiotics from aquaculture wastewater for example peng et al 103 introduced an algal biofilm membrane photobioreactor bf mpbr with the cultivation of microalgae chlorella vulgaris to degrade antibiotics sulfadiazine sdz sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx in real marine aquaculture wastewater the culture of microalgae in a continuous process in bf mpbr successfully reduced sdz smz and smx by 61 0 79 2 50 0 76 7 and 60 8 82 1 respectively based on the different initial antibiotic concentrations ranging from 0 041 to 0 145 mg l another study by farid et al 104 who treated oxytetracycline in synthetic aquaculture effluent containing 3 5 wt nacl and 10 ppm humic acid achieved efficiency 90 in a 24 h forward osmosis operation the high otc degradation efficiency is mainly attributed to the coupled effect of size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion between the forward osmosis membrane surface and the otc molecules in the same research work the introduction of nano bubbles into the fo process dramatically alleviated flux decline issue by 40 with minimal effect on the otc degradation also experimenting with synthetic aquaculture wastewater the removal of florfenicol flo antibiotic was accomplished using a thin film composite polyamide nanofilter by esmaili et al 105 by optimizing florfenicol concentration solution ph and transmembrane pressure complete removal of flo at 100 was achieved currently there is no research work published that employs photocatalytic membrane to remove antibiotics in real aquaculture effluent nonetheless as mentioned in section 2 despite membrane technologies have capabilities to separate antibiotics from wastewater the antibiotics still remain in their harmful original forms in this case the potential of the integrated photocatalytic membranes to simultaneously separate and degrade antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater to non toxic compounds is highly anticipated the treated clean water could also be recovered directly and recycled for other usages to further review the feasibility and sustainability of photocatalytic membrane to treat antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater energy consumption and efficiency should be taken into account electricity consumption is inevitable in a photocatalytic membrane wastewater treatment unit to power the circulation of water and to supply light energy for the photocatalytic reaction on top of the electricity cost to acquire power supply in the fish farms is a challenge considering aquaculture farms occupied huge land areas locating outskirt with no comprehensive and readily accessible electricity supply this challenge is even critical for marine aquaculture farms that are built on sea disconnected from getting direct resources from the land nevertheless topographies of aquaculture farms render them the advantage to harvest natural solar energy to power the operations as the farms are usually uncovered by terrestrial plants and urban structures hence extensively exposed to the sunlight the practicability of harnessing natural sunlight to purify wastewater containing antibiotics in photocatalytic membrane processes were assessed in thi thanh nhi et al 106 and augugliaro et al s 107 works thi thanh nhi and the coworkers innovatively fabricate cu2o rgo on flexible and highly porous vietnamese traditional paper vtp for photocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin under solar light the microfibrillated cellulose of vtp contributed to the adsorption of ciprofloxacin bringing the pollutant close to the reactive sites of photocatalysts after 1 5 h of solar light irradiation with 10 mg l of ciprofloxacin the photodegradation efficiency successfully reached 80 and the cu2o rgo vtp membrane demonstrated excellent reusability up to 5 cycles 106 on the other hand augugliaro group examined degradation ability of commercial nanofiltration membrane modules coupled with photocatalysts tio2 on antibiotics lincomycin at ph 6 3 pressure of 4 bar temperature of 298 k and initial lincomycin concentration of 75 μm the highest degradation percentage achieved was 97 78 under sunlight irradiation 107 in short implementing solar assisted photocatalytic membranes to treat aquaculture wastewater containing antibiotics is probable more researches could be anticipated towards this direction to achieve real life application of sustainable photocatalytic membrane treatment unit in aquaculture farms 5 conclusion with the rising of antibiotics usage and uncontrolled antibiotics disposal the environment is exposed to the risk of development of arg integrating advantages and mitigating drawbacks of both photocatalysis and membrane filtration photocatalytic membrane is introduced to efficiently treat antibiotics in wastewater two pm configurations namely the slurry pm and immobilized photocatalysts pm are available for antibiotics treatment each having their pros and cons to improve performances of pm several process parameters such as light utilization concentration of initial antibiotics in wastewater amount of photocatalysts ph membrane pore size and tmp as well as simultaneous presence of organic and inorganic pollutant in the wastewater should be scrutinized tio2 and g c3n4 are the most commonly used photocatalysts to be integrated with either ceramic or polymeric based membranes to created pm although ceramic membranes have more superior properties than polymeric membranes in terms of utilization in pm system its usage is significantly compromised by the high cost and harsh synthesis and modification environments the process integration contributes to efficient degradation of antibiotics concomitantly promote reusability and recyclability of the separation unit energy and economic evaluation elucidated that energy required are significantly influenced by process parameters hence the optimization of process conditions is essential to ensure a cost effective pm process as a fast rising industry usage of antibiotics in aquaculture surged to prevent diseases in aquatic animals conventional treatment of antibiotics in the aquaculture water is hindered by geographical limitations as it is difficult to supply high amount of electricity to aquaculture platforms located outskirt or offshore since the aquaculture platforms are at open area and would receive abundance of natural sunlight irradiation pm which has potential to function harnessing sunlight sees its future potential in treating antibiotics in aquaculture wastewater powered by solar energy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

12636,an efficient material is required to develop effective removal systems with high flexibility and low cost for capturing toxic ions in this study a synthesized lanthanum oxide modified bentonite b la adsorbent was used for the adsorption of as v and pb ii the prepared material b la shows a feather shape surface with a 25 nm average particle size and was also confirmed by sem and tem texture and chemical composition confirmed by xrd and ftir from the xps investigation the underlying mechanism for pb ii and as v removal was investigated and the production of b la as v and b la pb ii inner sphere complexation was shown to be the dominating pathway as per the ph effect studies it was observed that b la efficiently adsorbed pb ii and as v over a ph range of 6 0 pb ii adsorption was not substantially impacted by ionic strength or coexisting ions however as v adsorption was influenced by phosphate and fluoride showing that b la has a strong affinity towards pb ii and as v a pseudo second order model could well fit pb ii and as v adsorption and langmuir equilibrium adsorption describes pb ii and as v adsorption the adsorption capacity was 147 05 mg of pb ii g and 156 26 mg of as v g reflected at the dosage of 0 2 g l at 25 c ph 6 0 using the response surface methodology the optimum values for process parameters such as initial concentration temperature ph and time for both pb ii and as v removal are identified desorption studies were also performed to confirm the presented b la adsorbents environmental suitability the pb ii and as v were completely desorbed with 0 2 m hno3 and 0 2 m naoh after washing with water it is ready to reuse in the next cycle and can be reused in several cycles of pb ii and as v adsorption operations the identified data driven quadratic model strongly correlated with the experimental values machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis based on results ann predicted model shows high correlation r 2 value for both metal ions all the findings indicated that porous b la was a promising material for pb ii and as v removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heavy metals machine learning techniques mathematical evaluations artificial neural networks water remediation xps analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as industrialization and population growth continue the problem of massive waste generation and toxic effluent creation leads to massive water pollution this has garnered more attention in the last decade and the demand for freshwater for various applications is growing as v and pb ii are carcinogenic heavy metals that can enter the food chain and endanger living creatures including humans 1 2 such metals cause serious human ailments and disorders like the renal reproductive central nervous system liver and brain geogenic and human activities are the primary causes of heavy metal pollution in natural water supplies 3 4 therefore it is unavoidable to remediate the heavy metal contaminated water with inexpensive and eco friendly strategies owing to its acute and chronic poisoning ion exchange reverse osmosis coagulation flocculation precipitation and adsorption are the methods used to remove pb ii and as v from aqueous solutions because of its ease of use field practicability and moderate installation cost adsorption has been found to be the most effective method for removing heavy metals 5 6 several materials both natural and synthetic have been reported to be effective at removing environmental pollutnats 7 8 pb ii 9 10 and as v 11 12 from aqueous media however developing cost effective eco friendly materials with high removal capacity is of greater interest in the adsorption process clay minerals are widely used in environmental applications such as water treatment 13 moreover clay minerals have been recognised as ideal adsorbent materials because of their outstanding textural features availability and low cost 14 15 because of its eco friendly chemical and mechanical stability vast surface area enormous abundance and good adsorption performance bentonite is frequently utilized for removing heavy metal ions 16 18 bentonite is primarily made up of an octahedral alumina sheet sandwiched between two layers of tetrahedral silica because of this structure some inorganic and or organic polycations can intercalate with bentonite resulting in a large specific surface area ssa and enhanced adsorption of anionic cationic and organic pollutants 19 20 however bentonite has several drawbacks such as being less effective against certain heavy metals especially anions due to the persistent negative charges induced by the isomorphous substitution effect as well as restricted ssa 21 22 as a result modification of this clay with inorganic metal oxide is a viable option for overcoming the shortcomings of bentonite recently researchers have synthesized bentonite granular 22 bentonite fe3o4 mno2 17 composite bentonite zno cuo 23 poly methyl methacrylate grafted alginate cys bentonite 24 and guar gum bentonite bionanocomposite 25 to improve the removal of pollutants from the water however most of the above reported bentonite based composites show low removal capacity for target pollutants and most deal with cationic type heavy metals removal the above literature survey prompts us to develop a novel bentonite based material that will help to remove both anion as v and cation pb ii with high adsorption cost effective and eco friendly material in this study it is known that lanthanum belongs to the lanthanide class of rare earth elements and is one of the most important and versatile fluorescent devices catalysts superalloys and other superconductor applications use them in comparison lanthanum compounds are less costly and can be economically feasible apart from that they are non toxic and have been used in water treatment 26 27 lanthanum oxide la2o3 is a stable form of lanthanum compound that occurs as a white amorphous powder which is insoluble in water and has a good adsorption affinity towards several heavy metals especially for anionic arsenic species removal 28 29 thus in this research la2o3 was used to modify the surface of bentonite in order to develop a novel material bentonite loaded la2o3 b la that will avoid the above limitations of bentonite alone and improve adsorptive removal for both anion as v and cation pb ii from water with cost effective and eco friendly with the advent of computing techniques the number of experiments to be carried out is optimized and the optimal values of process parameters that result in maximum removal efficiency are easily identified in this direction prominent response surface methodology rsm with a central composite design ccd approach is implemented to identify the design of the experimental matrix further based on the available experimental values a data driven method is applied to identify the trend and predict the removal efficiency at different process conditions this research study investigated the properties and kinetics of pb ii and as v adsorption by b la in batch experiments to the best of our knowledge this study is the first where b la is used for both anion and cationic heavy metals removal the inherent adsorption mechanisms were identified through the characterization finally various modelling and data driven methods like rsm artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis were applied to predict the removal efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the materials used in this study are all analytical reagent grade junsei chemicals co ltd japan supplied the reagents na2haso4 7h2o and bentonite samchun pure chemicals co ltd pyeongtaek korea supplied the reagents pb no3 2 6h2o 37 hcl and 95 naoh lanthanum iii nitrate hex hydrate was purchased from daejung chemicals co ltd korea 2 2 preparation of adsorbent materials the ion exchange technique in aqueous solutions was used to make lanthanum oxide modified bentonite b la the clay and lanthanum oxide solution were combined in a 1 0 5 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 mass ratio bentonite clay lanthanum oxide and magnetically agitated at room temperature 25 c for 24 h the reaction was completed and the obtained material was filtered and washed with deionized water and dried at 80 c among the above prepared compsoites the 1 1 mass ratio of bentonite clay lanthanum oxide exhibit high adsorptive removal of target metal ions as v and pb ii thus this study chose a 1 1 ratio of bentonite lanthanum oxide composite 2 3 pb ii and as v batch adsorption experiment batch adsorption studies were carried out to evaluate the removal of pb ii and as v from b la all experiments were carried out at 25 c with a constant stirring rate of 180 rpm the stock solution of pb ii and as v was produced at a concentration of 1000 mg l unless otherwise stated the original ph of pb ii and as v solutions was set to 6 0 the adsorption kinetics was studied using an initial concentration of 10 and 25 mg l of both metal ions isotherms and thermodynamic adsorption studies were carried out with varying initial concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg l to explore the influence of ph on pb ii and as v adsorption a series of pb ii and as v solutions with varying ph values i e 2 0 10 0 were made and utilized for further adsorption experiments by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution na2 k ca2 mg2 so4 2 po4 3 f and no3 were used as the competing cation and anions the cation and anions concentration was 10 100 mg l in a typical adsorption experiment 0 2 g l of b la was added to 50 ml of a specific concentration of pb ii and as v solution after reaching equilibrium 5 ml of the pb ii and as v solution was filtered through 0 45 μm membrane syringe filters and the filtrate was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes usa for the determination of equilibrium metal ions concentration the removal efficiency of pb ii and as v is calculated as follows 1 removal efficiency c 0 c f c 0 100 where c0 mg l and cf mg l are the concentrations of pb ii and as v at an initial and a final respectively the adsorption capacity qe of pb ii and as v adsorbed onto the b la was calculated as following eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where ce mg l denote metal concentration at equilibrium time v l is the volume of the testing solution and m g is the weight of the adsorbent to understand the adsorption mechanism various isotherm and kinetic models are investigated among the isotherm models well known models like langmuir freundlich and temkin models were adopted to describe the

desorption cycles towards pb ii and as v were carried out as follows 0 2 g l mg of b la were added in 100 ml of pb ii and as v solution 10 mg l the solution was collected to achieve equilibrium in order to assess removal efficiency and adsorption capacity the utilized adsorbent was then removed and submerged in various concentrations of 0 1 0 5 m hno3 for pb ii and 0 1 0 5 m naoh for as v solutions for 6 h to desorb the adsorbed pb ii and as v followed by washing with deionized water until the ph reached neutral among them 0 2 m hno3 for pb ii and 0 2 m naoh for as v show high desorption efficiency which are used as optimum conditions for desorption experiments for respective metal ions the regenerated adsorbent was employed for the subsequent pb ii and as v adsorption this adsorption desorption cycle was repeated four times to test the b la regeneration capabilities 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the adsorbent s specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution b la composite were measured by n2adsorption desorption isotherm fig s1 fig s1 shows a type iv isotherm with h2 hysteresis exhibits mesoporosity according to iupac classification 10 30 according to bet analysis the b la composite s ssa total pore volume and average pore diameter were 124 02 m2 g 0 242 cm3 g and 21 02 nm respectively pores smaller than 25 nm dominate the pore size distribution showing that the compound was a mesoporous material with an ssa the prepared material b la morphology was measured by sem fig 1 a c and tem fig 1 d f and images were exhibited from the sem image it can be observed that the b la demonstrated a feather shape surface further sem edx fig s2 found that the 49 0 wt of la loaded on bentonite along with o 20 59 wt si 15 28 wt and al 15 13 wt this result confirms the formation b la composites tem images show very few aggregates with feather morphology and rough edges the individual particle size range around 25 nm the ft ir spectra of b and b la are compared in fig 1g the stretching peaks around 3691 80 3601 cm 1 correspond to the oh bond while the 911 cm 1 band corresponds to al al oh sio bending vibration causes very significant band absorption at 1031 cm 1 the band at 647 cm 1 is caused by the sio bond deformation and bending modes the bands at 566 cm 1 are caused by al o si bending vibrations 31 32 the strength of the oh stretching peaks rapidly reduced after lanthanum oxide modification symbolizing physically adsorbed water loss and partial structural destruction 33 at 520 cm 1 the distinctive peak for the metal oxygen lao bond is evident in the presence of la2o3 34 on the bentonite surface the characteristic peaks at diffraction angles of 2θ 12 32 19 58 26 83 38 47 54 71 and 62 15o shows the crystalline bentonite 35 furthermore the diffraction peaks at 2θ 27 06o 31 44o 39 79 o and 55 13 o in the xrd pattern of the b la composite demonstrate the existence of lanthanum oxide accordingly jcpds 05 0602 further the xrd diffraction peaks are matched with the hexagonal phase of la2o3 by referring to the jcpds 05 0602 standard 34 in addition 36 0 is readily assigned to lanthanum hydroxide having jcpds no 36 1481 in bentonite 36 37 it is partially attributed to the transformation of lanthanum hydroxide to la2o3 during the calcination processes xps was used to determine the b and b la compositions and element valence states o al si and la were clearly established by the xps survey spectrum of the b and b la composite fig s3 as shown in fig s3 for the original b la which was attributed to the la3d peaks located at 835 ev and 855 2 ev were found typical patterns of la2o3 further the measured elemental composition by xps table s1 was consisting with sem edx results fig s1 from sem edx results confirms that 49 0 wt of lanthanum is present b la composite however the accurate concentration lanthanum loaded on b la composite was measured by leaching of lanthanum metal from 0 5 g of b la with aqua rigia method in this 100 ml of 1 3 m ratio of hno3 hcl solution aqua rigia used at 60 c 1 h for each cycle and repeat it for three times to completely leaching of lathanum measured lanthanum concentration of leachate using icp oes after dilution of the collected leachate solution this results concluded that the 0 445 g of lanthanum present in 1 g of b la composite which is consisting with sem edx results 3 2 adsorption mechanism to further understand the adsorption processes xps examinations were used the stability of synthesized adsorbents was validated before and after pb ii and as v removal using b la fig 2 the xps spectrum fig 2a displays o 1 s si 2p al 2p peaks which are consistent with the chemical compositions of the bentonite after lanthanum modification the intensities of la 3d were observed to have obvious differences between b and b la consistent with the lanthanum loading after pb ii and as v adsorption the new peaks which correspond to as 3d and pb 4f infer heavy metal s adsorption for the o 1 s spectrum fig 2b the two peaks at 531 53 and 532 86 ev can be assigned to la o and oh after adsorption of pb ii and as v the lao and oh bond shifted to lower binding energy after adsorption of 530 90 532 50 ev and 531 18 532 63 ev for pb ii and as v in fig 2c the broad peaks were allocated into four overlapped peaks corresponding to the primitive la3d5 2 834 81 ev 838 33 ev and la3d5 2 851 62 ev 855 17 ev respectively 38 40 after pb ii and as v adsorption the binding energies of the primary la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 bands were slightly shifted indicating the possible formation of la o pb la o as 41 42 the xps peak of pb 4f and as v showed in fig s4 a b a significant shift lower binding energy for pb4f7 2 at 138 33 ev and pb4f5 2 at 143 12 ev compared with standard samples pb no3 2 the pb4f7 2 at 139 9 ev and pb4f5 2 at 145 0 ev fig s4a 43 it also agrees with coulomb s law as the inner sphere complexation occurs over a much shorter atom distance 41 the findings revealed that selective sorption rather than electrostatic contact might explain the process of pb ii adsorption onto manufactured material particles with pbo binding being the interaction further fig s4b shows the appearance of the peak in xps spectra of as 3d due to the presence of as v 45 09ev in the form of arsenic oxide 44 these results indicated that lao should be involved in the as adsorption with the formation of la o as bonds further confirming that the adsorption followed the inner sphere complex mechanism these findings further strengthen the fact that la3 present in b la plays an imperative role for pb ii and as v by adsorption 3 3 kinetic and isotherms studies adsorption kinetics may be used to learn more about the mass transfer adsorption process and any rate limiting steps within it at ph 6 0 the adsorption kinetics of pb ii and as v onto b la were investigated using initial concentrations of 10 and 25 mg l pfo and pso kinetic models were fitted under the adsorption process fig 3a b and respective parameters were reported in table 1 the pso model fits b la better than the pfo model with higher correlation coefficient r 2 values implying that chemisorption is the rate controlling step for pb ii and as v adsorption the kinetic adsorption curves of b la for pb ii and as v uptake clearly show a very fast starting adsorption rate with equilibrium reached in 180 and 240 min respectively the findings show that as v has a significantly higher k value than pb ii implying that pb ii takes less time to reach equilibrium adsorption isotherm models of langmuir freundlich and temkin were used to explore the metal ion interaction with b la and the viability of the adsorption process the isotherm plots of pb ii and as v adsorption on the b la composite are shown in fig 3c and the respective isotherm parameters are shown in table 2 the results demonstrated that the langmuir isotherm model fits the experimental data better than the freundlich and temkin model owing to a lower χ 2 table s2 and higher r2 value this means that the reaction was monolayer adsorption on a structurally homogenous surface of b la adsorbent in removing pb ii and as v langmuir isotherm model showed a maximum adsorption capacity qm of 147 05 mg g and 156 26 mg g for pb ii and as v at a ph of 6 this performance shows that pb ii and as v adsorption capacity is comparable to similar works as shown in table 3 3 5 45 48 also the adsorption capacity b la was higher than compared to bentonite alone for both metal ions 5 mg g for pb ii and negligible as v removal furthermore when compared to other functionalized materials used for pb ii and as v removal the current b la exhibits high or near efficacy in terms of adsorption removal capacity stability and re usability while being low cost and eco friendly 11 49 51 pb ii adsorption capacity increased with the temperature rising from 25 c to 50 c it indicates that this was an endothermic reaction and that increasing temperature was beneficial for pb ii adsorption while in the case of as v the adsorption capacity decreased with the temperature rising from 25 c to 50 c it indicates that this was an exothermic reaction and that increasing temperature was not beneficial for as v adsorption 3 4 effects of ph and coexisting ions the ph of a solution affects the surface chemistry of adsorbents as well as the chemical speciation of heavy metals the capacity of b la to adsorb pb ii and as v is shown in fig 3d as a function of the ph of the solutions because alkaline ph might produce lead hydroxide precipitation the process of pb ii and as v adsorption was investigated at a ph range of 2 0 to 6 0 for pb ii pb ii and as v elimination were extremely ph dependent 41 the results revealed that in the ph range of 3 6 pb ii sorption increased progressively with increasing ph the highest pb ii removal by b la in this ph range is at ph 5 6 at ph 7 0 however as v sorption reduced progressively the point of zero charges of b la was calculated to be 6 67 fig s5 the decrease in as v adsorption with rising ph was attributed to a decrease in coulombic attraction caused by a lower b la positive charge suggesting that electrostatic interaction was important in adsorption at a ph of 3 0 the lowest adsorption of pb ii was observed which may be explained by the competition for adsorption sites between h and pb ii ions and partial dissolution of b la resulting in a reduction in binding sites in contrast as v adsorption peaked at a ph of 4 0 which might be attributed to a stronger attraction between protonated la sites on the surface of b la and negative arsenate species pb ii and as v ions in wastewater invariably interact with other electrolyte ions influencing heavy metal migration and competing with them at b la sorption sites the common coexisting ions like na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 po4 2 f and no3 anions were used according to fig 3e the existence of either cations or anions had no noticeable influence on the adsorption of pb ii suggesting that pb ii is mostly adsorbed through the inner sphere complex 52 their removal affinity was much lower than pb ii the presence of na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and no3 ions had no effect on as v adsorption even at the high concentration notably the po4 2 and f can significantly reduce as v ions adsorption fig 3f phosphate ions may negatively affect them because they compete with arsenate for adsorption sites to form similar inner sphere complexes arsenic and phosphorous are well known to belong to the same main group group v and have a very similar electronic structure they form similar physicochemical compounds in the aqueous chemistry of as v po4 2 also la3 had a good coordination ability for f 53 54 3 5 regeneration studies adsorbent regeneration is a significant economic element in the treatment process this procedure describes the mechanism of pb ii and as v loaded adsorbents for regeneration recycling and reusing spent adsorbents in order to cut costs and protect the environment from environmental pollutants adsorption tests were performed upto six cycles using 0 2 g l b la and 50 ml of 10 mg l pb ii and as v after the suspensions had been agitated at room temperature b la were collected by centrifugation and agitated with 50 ml of 0 2 m hno3 for pb ii and 0 2 m naoh for as v for recycling of adsorbent after three cycles of the adsorption desorption test the b la showed that the above 95 removal of both pb ii and as v fig s6 after the fourth cycle the removal percentage decreased as the number of cycles increased and reached above 70 due to the loss of adsorbent weight during centrifugation and washing caused a significant difference in the percentages of adsorption desorption pb ii and as v in the fourth cycle although the loss of b la during the process it shows 70 removal even at the 6th cycle this result demonstrated the high reusability of the developed b la composite for pb ii and as v upto three cycles 3 6 optimization of experimental conditions by mathematical modeling the discussed experiments in previous sections indicate that concluding an optimum condition to reach a high value of removal efficiency requires a cumbersome and costly experimental procedure to overcome this difficulty the response surface optimization method is employed to mathematically model the removal efficiency behaviour of pb ii and as v based on the influencing parameters of initial concentration ph temperature and elapsed time the dependency of the removal efficiency on the independent parameters is not clear from the experimental data thus to understand the dependency initially the study is initiated as a linear model and increases the degree of the model until reaching a satisfying model on the other hand lower degree models provide lower computational costs and avoid overfitting the data in this regard linear quadratic and cubic polynomials are utilized to fit the data obtained by the experiment in doing so the correlation between the removal efficiency values obtained by polynomial models and values given by experimental data would indicate the model s reliability fig 4 shows the correlations between the given experimental data and polynomial model prediction for ions removal the low value of the correlation factor in the linear model shows that this model is unfit for this problem on the other hand quadratic and cubic models seem to be suitable with r 2 0 7539 and r 2 0 9978 in the case of as v respectively the condition is better for pb ii and correlation factors are higher than 0 9 for nonlinear models in most cases a quadratic polynomial is considered suitable for predicting chemical models even having slightly lower correlation values than cubic models these polynomials are easier to handle and avoid overfitting data in the following all the calculations are based on the quadratic models analysis of variance anova of the quadratic model is presented in tables 4 and 5 table 4 shows the significance of each parameter in the quadratic model for pb ii removal it is observed that initial concentration ph and square of ph are the most effective parameters for the removal efficiency of pb ii removal with p values 0 0001 for the case of as v removal the most effective parameter is the initial concentration and square of ph as can be deduced from anova data provided in table 5 these data in tables 4 and 5 also indicate that the time is an important parameter in removing both ions as expected the longer the process the higher the removal efficiency fig 5 illustrates the effects of different parameters on pb ii removal efficiency using surface plots a surface peak is seen which is related to the numerical fitting of the data however higher ph results in better removal of pb ii at the same time the quadratic model suggests that a ph value close to 8 provides higher removals the effect of time is depicted in fig 5a increasing the processing time up to 320 min leads to increased pb ii removal afterwards it seems that elongated process time has no effect on the pb ii removal and as the polynomial model suggested it even reverses the removal process fig 5b presents the effect of temperature on the removal of pb ii as observed changing process temperature slightly affects the removal of pb ii favouring a higher temperature however in general the effect of temperature is insignificant in this process increasing the initial concentration decreases the removal of pb ii as observed in fig 5b as the initial concentration increases the ratio of removed pb ii to the initial concentration decreases within the same reaction time using the response surface optimization method the optimum value for maximizing the removal of pb ii removal is calculated the approximate values were deduced from fig 5 and the exact values obtained from the optimizing quadratic model are provided in table 6 it should be noted that these values are acquired using a quadratic model which has a correlation factor of r 2 0 9307 table 6 similar to the presented results for pb ii in the case of as v removal surfaces fitted with the quadratic model are given in fig 6 a completely different response from pb ii is seen for as v as the removal efficiency peaks in the middle range of ph in fig 6a removal surfaces are depicted as a function of initial concentration and ph in various time values in all values of initial concentrations there is a peak in the surfaces of removals indeed at a specific ph value the removal efficiency of as v reaches a maximum regardless of the time and initial concentration this indicates that ph plays an important role in obtaining the higher removal of as v which was also discussed in anova in the previous paragraphs as the processing time increases to 320 min as v removal increases however at higher time values it is seen that increasing process duration has no significant effects although in this figure a reverse behaviour is seen which can be associated with the quadratic fitted model in experiments this reverse behaviour of decreasing removal efficiency was not observed therefore the processing time of around 320 min could be considered an optimum time in lower initial concentrations i e 40 mg l even lower process time is sufficient to achieve maximum removal on the other hand as discussed in the case of pb ii increasing the initial concentration in fig 6b causes a reduction in removal efficiency moreover as predicted by the quadratic model increasing the temperature of the process decreases the removal of as v the effect of temperature is more noticeable in higher concentrations where an increase in temperature from 20 c to 50 c causes a 50 reduction in removal efficiency the temperature influence is trivial in lower concentrations which could be important regarding energy devoted to warming the solution therefore from these 3d surface plots of the quadratic model lower initial concentration temperature around 25 c and ph value near 6 are desirable for achieving high removal efficiency using the response surface optimization method the optimum value for maximizing the removal of as v removal is calculated the approximate values were deduced from fig 6 and the exact values obtained from the optimizing quadratic model are provided in table 6 it should be noted that these values are acquired using a quadratic model which has a correlation factor of r 2 0 9539 3 7 machine learning techniques artificial neural networks provide reliable and fast predictions in different problems from regression to classification in the case of the current study we encounter a regression problem in which polynomial models may not be adequate enough to predict the removal of the pb ii and as v therefore this section uses commonly used ann and anfis to predict the removal efficiency of the discussed processes a neural network in general consists of three different types of layers the first layer is the input layer in which the influential parameters of the reaction process should be fed into the network the second type of layer is the output layer which in the case of the present study is the removal efficiency the third layer is the hidden layer in which calculations are performed each layer has several cores of linear transformation called perceptrons at each perceptron i the respective input linearly transformed to its output by weights w i and biases b i a schematic of the network is shown in fig 7 which engages two hidden layers for the case of this study a supervised ann is utilized to predict the removal efficiency of the processes using temperature ph initial concentration and elapsed time the coefficients of all perceptrons are adjusted in several iterations epochs in the training process of the network using optimization algorithms to reduce the error between predicted results and actual values in the present study scikit learn 55 package in python is employed for ann analysis using the multi linear regression tool for optimizing the loss function or mse the adam solver is utilized which adopts a stochastic gradient descent algorithm this package provides several tools to split the dataset into different parts of the train validate and test categories moreover the activation function for the hidden layers is set to be logistic after some trials the number of hidden layers is set to two with 50 nodes each on the other hand different numbers of iterations from 1000 to 50 000 with 1000 steps are considered to find the best trained model in terms of the highest correlation between predicted and actual removal efficiency values it is obvious that an increase in the number of normal results in an increase in the accuracy of the results therefore it is necessary to prevent overfitting the training portion of the data in this regard a validation process is performed parallel to the training on 15 of the training data it was observed that after 25 000 iterations the error of validation increases determining the beginning of the overfitting data as shown in fig 8 fig 9 demonstrates the efficiency of using ann in predicting removal for both pb ii and as v cases as observed the trained networks with r 2 0 99 performed satisfactorily predicting new data as the test data correlation factor is above 0 94 therefore the ann could be confidently used in new experimental conditions alongside better fitting data anfis network is a specific type of neural network in which each input parameter is categorized based on its value and each category has its constant values for example ph values are categorized into acidic basic and neutral categories the network behaves differently for each of these categories the details of such networks can be found in jang 1993 56 anfis networks are generally more stable than ann and converge more rapidly the present study uses the neuro fuzzy designer app in matlab software to perform anfis analysis for each input of ph initial concentration time and temperature three categories are defined automatically by the software as determined by the user in a fully connected network membership functions that categorise each input parameter s values are selected to be triangular for all inputs the schematic of the anfis network is depicted in fig 10 utilized to predict the removal efficiency of the reactions in the inner layers after categorization and assigning membership value to each category the rules r i s combine the membershiop values the combining rule is a simple and function for all cases in our study in the next layers n i s the all the values are normalized to get firing strength a combination of all firing strengths generates the output moreover after approximately 50 iterations epochs the results become stable compared to 25 000 iterations of a neural network as depicted in fig 11 the predicted removal values for both pb ii and as v are presented in fig 12 as seen with a correlation factor higher than 0 9 in the case of train data the network performs acceptably compared to the quadratic model the correlation of test data also indicated the reliability of anfis 3 8 comparison of rsm ann and anfis and discussion on the modelling results the mathematical and artificial neural networks employed to predict the removal efficiency of the processes have different performances fig 13 compares the value of normalized root mean square errors nrmse of the different models used in the current study as observed in both cases ann performs exceptionally with very low nrmse the worst condition belongs to linear models although the cubic polynomial models have a low error value using neural networks in similar studies is suggested considering efforts and performance for each experimental run the obtained normalized errors are graphically depicted in fig 14 it can be observed that the values of normalized error for ann are negligible in comparison to other methods the error level of cubic polynomial and anfis is comparable with slightly higher errors in the cubic model the errors in the case of as v are generally higher than pb ii in all models indicating that the influencing factors in the experiment are the most important determining for the removal of pb ii on the other hand in the case of as v the responses to the change in the effective parameters did not result in a well defined model at least in the models discussed in the present paper however the results in both cases are satisfactory it is crucial to notice that artificial neural networks could generally reach a high accuracy during the training process given enough time perceptrons and epochs so that the predicted results could coincide with the provided outputs however caution should be exercised to avoid overfitting therefore a validation process is run parallel to the training on the other hand its accuracy may be slightly lower for a set of fresh new data as observed in the given examples the training process reaches a correlation factor 0 99 which is extremely desirable on the other hand the testing process reaches a correlation factor of 0 97 at its best it should be mentioned that several algorithm runs were conducted to find the best value of the correlation factor 4 conclusions in this study a functional b la is synthesized and applied for pb ii and as v adsorption in a single and coexisting aqueous solution under neutral ph the as prepared b la demonstrated excellent adsorption capability for pb ii and as v a pso model could well fit pb ii and as v adsorption and equilibrium adsorption demonstrated that the langmuir model was more suitable than the freundlich and temkin models for describing pb ii and as v adsorption the findings show that pb ii and as v which were 147 05 and 156 26 mg g at 25 c respectively were high in comparison to the available materials table 3 and bentonite alone also b la shows higher adsorptive removal and higher re usability compared to some other functionalized materials used for pb ii and as v removal 49 51 coexisting ions either anions or cations had no discernible influence on pb ii adsorption suggesting that pb ii is mostly adsorbed through the inner sphere complex but the po4 2 and f can significantly reduce as v adsorption by competitive and strong coordination effects respectively further the prepared b la can be re used upto six cycles without losing its removal efficacy of 70 different mathematical and artificial intelligence models were employed to find the best approach to predict optimal conditions for removing pb ii and as v the results indicated that linear models were unsuitable for the removal behaviour based on the effective parameters investigated in the current study moreover ann models seemed to predict the removal of pb ii and as v with high r2 and low computational costs the overall results concluded that they overcame the limitation of bentonite alone for anion heavy metals removal and increased the adsorption capacity of prepared b la by modifying the surface of bentonite with lanthanum oxide declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that they do not have any known competitive financial interests or personal relationships

12636,an efficient material is required to develop effective removal systems with high flexibility and low cost for capturing toxic ions in this study a synthesized lanthanum oxide modified bentonite b la adsorbent was used for the adsorption of as v and pb ii the prepared material b la shows a feather shape surface with a 25 nm average particle size and was also confirmed by sem and tem texture and chemical composition confirmed by xrd and ftir from the xps investigation the underlying mechanism for pb ii and as v removal was investigated and the production of b la as v and b la pb ii inner sphere complexation was shown to be the dominating pathway as per the ph effect studies it was observed that b la efficiently adsorbed pb ii and as v over a ph range of 6 0 pb ii adsorption was not substantially impacted by ionic strength or coexisting ions however as v adsorption was influenced by phosphate and fluoride showing that b la has a strong affinity towards pb ii and as v a pseudo second order model could well fit pb ii and as v adsorption and langmuir equilibrium adsorption describes pb ii and as v adsorption the adsorption capacity was 147 05 mg of pb ii g and 156 26 mg of as v g reflected at the dosage of 0 2 g l at 25 c ph 6 0 using the response surface methodology the optimum values for process parameters such as initial concentration temperature ph and time for both pb ii and as v removal are identified desorption studies were also performed to confirm the presented b la adsorbents environmental suitability the pb ii and as v were completely desorbed with 0 2 m hno3 and 0 2 m naoh after washing with water it is ready to reuse in the next cycle and can be reused in several cycles of pb ii and as v adsorption operations the identified data driven quadratic model strongly correlated with the experimental values machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis based on results ann predicted model shows high correlation r 2 value for both metal ions all the findings indicated that porous b la was a promising material for pb ii and as v removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heavy metals machine learning techniques mathematical evaluations artificial neural networks water remediation xps analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as industrialization and population growth continue the problem of massive waste generation and toxic effluent creation leads to massive water pollution this has garnered more attention in the last decade and the demand for freshwater for various applications is growing as v and pb ii are carcinogenic heavy metals that can enter the food chain and endanger living creatures including humans 1 2 such metals cause serious human ailments and disorders like the renal reproductive central nervous system liver and brain geogenic and human activities are the primary causes of heavy metal pollution in natural water supplies 3 4 therefore it is unavoidable to remediate the heavy metal contaminated water with inexpensive and eco friendly strategies owing to its acute and chronic poisoning ion exchange reverse osmosis coagulation flocculation precipitation and adsorption are the methods used to remove pb ii and as v from aqueous solutions because of its ease of use field practicability and moderate installation cost adsorption has been found to be the most effective method for removing heavy metals 5 6 several materials both natural and synthetic have been reported to be effective at removing environmental pollutnats 7 8 pb ii 9 10 and as v 11 12 from aqueous media however developing cost effective eco friendly materials with high removal capacity is of greater interest in the adsorption process clay minerals are widely used in environmental applications such as water treatment 13 moreover clay minerals have been recognised as ideal adsorbent materials because of their outstanding textural features availability and low cost 14 15 because of its eco friendly chemical and mechanical stability vast surface area enormous abundance and good adsorption performance bentonite is frequently utilized for removing heavy metal ions 16 18 bentonite is primarily made up of an octahedral alumina sheet sandwiched between two layers of tetrahedral silica because of this structure some inorganic and or organic polycations can intercalate with bentonite resulting in a large specific surface area ssa and enhanced adsorption of anionic cationic and organic pollutants 19 20 however bentonite has several drawbacks such as being less effective against certain heavy metals especially anions due to the persistent negative charges induced by the isomorphous substitution effect as well as restricted ssa 21 22 as a result modification of this clay with inorganic metal oxide is a viable option for overcoming the shortcomings of bentonite recently researchers have synthesized bentonite granular 22 bentonite fe3o4 mno2 17 composite bentonite zno cuo 23 poly methyl methacrylate grafted alginate cys bentonite 24 and guar gum bentonite bionanocomposite 25 to improve the removal of pollutants from the water however most of the above reported bentonite based composites show low removal capacity for target pollutants and most deal with cationic type heavy metals removal the above literature survey prompts us to develop a novel bentonite based material that will help to remove both anion as v and cation pb ii with high adsorption cost effective and eco friendly material in this study it is known that lanthanum belongs to the lanthanide class of rare earth elements and is one of the most important and versatile fluorescent devices catalysts superalloys and other superconductor applications use them in comparison lanthanum compounds are less costly and can be economically feasible apart from that they are non toxic and have been used in water treatment 26 27 lanthanum oxide la2o3 is a stable form of lanthanum compound that occurs as a white amorphous powder which is insoluble in water and has a good adsorption affinity towards several heavy metals especially for anionic arsenic species removal 28 29 thus in this research la2o3 was used to modify the surface of bentonite in order to develop a novel material bentonite loaded la2o3 b la that will avoid the above limitations of bentonite alone and improve adsorptive removal for both anion as v and cation pb ii from water with cost effective and eco friendly with the advent of computing techniques the number of experiments to be carried out is optimized and the optimal values of process parameters that result in maximum removal efficiency are easily identified in this direction prominent response surface methodology rsm with a central composite design ccd approach is implemented to identify the design of the experimental matrix further based on the available experimental values a data driven method is applied to identify the trend and predict the removal efficiency at different process conditions this research study investigated the properties and kinetics of pb ii and as v adsorption by b la in batch experiments to the best of our knowledge this study is the first where b la is used for both anion and cationic heavy metals removal the inherent adsorption mechanisms were identified through the characterization finally various modelling and data driven methods like rsm artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis were applied to predict the removal efficiency 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the materials used in this study are all analytical reagent grade junsei chemicals co ltd japan supplied the

chemicals co ltd korea 2 2 preparation of adsorbent materials the ion exchange technique in aqueous solutions was used to make lanthanum oxide modified bentonite b la the clay and lanthanum oxide solution were combined in a 1 0 5 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 mass ratio bentonite clay lanthanum oxide and magnetically agitated at room temperature 25 c for 24 h the reaction was completed and the obtained material was filtered and washed with deionized water and dried at 80 c among the above prepared compsoites the 1 1 mass ratio of bentonite clay lanthanum oxide exhibit high adsorptive removal of target metal ions as v and pb ii thus this study chose a 1 1 ratio of bentonite lanthanum oxide composite 2 3 pb ii and as v batch adsorption experiment batch adsorption studies were carried out to evaluate the removal of pb ii and as v from b la all experiments were carried out at 25 c with a constant stirring rate of 180 rpm the stock solution of pb ii and as v was produced at a concentration of 1000 mg l unless otherwise stated the original ph of pb ii and as v solutions was set to 6 0 the adsorption kinetics was studied using an initial concentration of 10 and 25 mg l of both metal ions isotherms and thermodynamic adsorption studies were carried out with varying initial concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg l to explore the influence of ph on pb ii and as v adsorption a series of pb ii and as v solutions with varying ph values i e 2 0 10 0 were made and utilized for further adsorption experiments by adding 0 1 m hcl or naoh solution na2 k ca2 mg2 so4 2 po4 3 f and no3 were used as the competing cation and anions the cation and anions concentration was 10 100 mg l in a typical adsorption experiment 0 2 g l of b la was added to 50 ml of a specific concentration of pb ii and as v solution after reaching equilibrium 5 ml of the pb ii and as v solution was filtered through 0 45 μm membrane syringe filters and the filtrate was analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes usa for the determination of equilibrium metal ions concentration the removal efficiency of pb ii and as v is calculated as follows 1 removal efficiency c 0 c f c 0 100 where c0 mg l and cf mg l are the concentrations of pb ii and as v at an initial and a final respectively the adsorption capacity qe of pb ii and as v adsorbed onto the b la was calculated as following eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where ce mg l denote metal concentration at equilibrium time v l is the volume of the testing solution and m g is the weight of the adsorbent to understand the adsorption mechanism various isotherm and kinetic models are investigated among the isotherm models well known models like langmuir freundlich and temkin models were adopted to describe the

8 χ 2 q exp q model 2 q model where q exp mg g and q model mg g is the equilibrium capacity derived from experimental data and model equation 2 4 regeneration experiments the b la adsorption desorption cycles towards pb ii and as v were carried out as follows 0 2 g l mg of b la were added in 100 ml of pb ii and as v solution 10 mg l the solution was collected to achieve equilibrium in order to assess removal efficiency and adsorption capacity the utilized adsorbent was then removed and submerged in various concentrations of 0 1 0 5 m hno3 for pb ii and 0 1 0 5 m naoh for as v solutions for 6 h to desorb the adsorbed pb ii and as v followed by washing with deionized water until the ph reached neutral among them 0 2 m hno3 for pb ii and 0 2 m naoh for as v show high desorption efficiency which are used as optimum conditions for desorption experiments for respective metal ions the regenerated adsorbent was employed for the subsequent pb ii and as v adsorption this adsorption desorption cycle was repeated four times to test the b la regeneration capabilities 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization the adsorbent s specific surface area ssa and pore size distribution b la composite were measured by n2adsorption desorption isotherm fig s1 fig s1 shows a type iv isotherm with h2 hysteresis exhibits mesoporosity according to iupac classification 10 30 according to bet analysis the b la composite s ssa total pore volume and average pore diameter were 124 02 m2 g 0 242 cm3 g and 21 02 nm respectively pores smaller than 25 nm dominate the pore size distribution showing that the compound was a mesoporous material with an ssa the prepared material b la morphology was measured by sem fig 1 a c and tem fig 1 d f and images were exhibited from the sem image it can be observed that the b la demonstrated a feather shape surface further sem edx fig s2 found that the 49 0 wt of la loaded on bentonite along with o 20 59 wt si 15 28 wt and al 15 13 wt this result confirms the formation b la composites tem images show very few aggregates with feather morphology and rough edges the individual particle size range around 25 nm the ft ir spectra of b and b la are compared in fig 1g the stretching peaks around 3691 80 3601 cm 1 correspond to the oh bond while the 911 cm 1 band corresponds to al al oh sio bending vibration causes very significant band absorption at 1031 cm 1 the band at 647 cm 1 is caused by the sio bond deformation and bending modes the bands at 566 cm 1 are caused by al o si bending vibrations 31 32 the strength of the oh stretching peaks rapidly reduced after lanthanum oxide modification symbolizing physically adsorbed water loss and partial structural destruction 33 at 520 cm 1 the distinctive peak for the metal oxygen lao bond is evident in the presence of la2o3 34 on the bentonite surface the characteristic peaks at diffraction angles of 2θ 12 32 19 58 26 83 38 47 54 71 and 62 15o shows the crystalline bentonite 35 furthermore the diffraction peaks at 2θ 27 06o 31 44o 39 79 o and 55 13 o in the xrd pattern of the b la composite demonstrate the existence of lanthanum oxide accordingly jcpds 05 0602 further the xrd diffraction peaks are matched with the hexagonal phase of la2o3 by referring to the jcpds 05 0602 standard 34 in addition 36 0 is readily assigned to lanthanum hydroxide having jcpds no 36 1481 in bentonite 36 37 it is partially attributed to the transformation of lanthanum hydroxide to la2o3 during the calcination processes xps was used to determine the b and b la compositions and element valence states o al si and la were clearly established by the xps survey spectrum of the b and b la composite fig s3 as shown in fig s3 for the original b la which was attributed to the la3d peaks located at 835 ev and 855 2 ev were found typical patterns of la2o3 further the measured elemental composition by xps table s1 was consisting with sem edx results fig s1 from sem edx results confirms that 49 0 wt of lanthanum is present b la composite however the accurate concentration lanthanum loaded on b la composite was measured by leaching of lanthanum metal from 0 5 g of b la with aqua rigia method in this 100 ml of 1 3 m ratio of hno3 hcl solution aqua rigia used at 60 c 1 h for each cycle and repeat it for three times to completely leaching of lathanum measured lanthanum concentration of leachate using icp oes after dilution of the collected leachate solution this results concluded that the 0 445 g of lanthanum present in 1 g of b la composite which is consisting with sem edx results 3 2 adsorption mechanism to further understand the adsorption processes xps examinations were used the stability of synthesized adsorbents was validated before and after pb ii and as v removal using b la fig 2 the xps spectrum fig 2a displays o 1 s si 2p al 2p peaks which are consistent with the chemical compositions of the bentonite after lanthanum modification the intensities of la 3d were observed to have obvious differences between b and b la consistent with the lanthanum loading after pb ii and as v adsorption the new peaks which correspond to as 3d and pb 4f infer heavy metal s adsorption for the o 1 s spectrum fig 2b the two peaks at 531 53 and 532 86 ev can be assigned to la o and oh after adsorption of pb ii and as v the lao and oh bond shifted to lower binding energy after adsorption of 530 90 532 50 ev and 531 18 532 63 ev for pb ii and as v in fig 2c the broad peaks were allocated into four overlapped peaks corresponding to the primitive la3d5 2 834 81 ev 838 33 ev and la3d5 2 851 62 ev 855 17 ev respectively 38 40 after pb ii and as v adsorption the binding energies of the primary la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 bands were slightly shifted indicating the possible formation of la o pb la o as 41 42 the xps peak of pb 4f and as v showed in fig s4 a b a significant shift lower binding energy for pb4f7 2 at 138 33 ev and pb4f5 2 at 143 12 ev compared with standard samples pb no3 2 the pb4f7 2 at 139 9 ev and pb4f5 2 at 145 0 ev fig s4a 43 it also agrees with coulomb s law as the inner sphere complexation occurs over a much shorter atom distance 41 the findings revealed that selective sorption rather than electrostatic contact might explain the process of pb ii adsorption onto manufactured material particles with pbo binding being the interaction further fig s4b shows the appearance of the peak in xps spectra of as 3d due to the presence of as v 45 09ev in the form of arsenic oxide 44 these results indicated that lao should be involved in the as adsorption with the formation of la o as bonds further confirming that the adsorption followed the inner sphere complex mechanism these findings further strengthen the fact that la3 present in b la plays an imperative role for pb ii and as v by adsorption 3 3 kinetic and isotherms studies adsorption kinetics may be used to learn more about the mass transfer adsorption process and any rate limiting steps within it at ph 6 0 the adsorption kinetics of pb ii and as v onto b la were investigated using initial concentrations of 10 and 25 mg l pfo and pso kinetic models were fitted under the adsorption process fig 3a b and respective parameters were reported in table 1 the pso model fits b la better than the pfo model with higher correlation coefficient r 2 values implying that chemisorption is the rate controlling step for pb ii and as v adsorption the kinetic adsorption curves of b la for pb ii and as v uptake clearly show a very fast starting adsorption rate with equilibrium reached in 180 and 240 min respectively the findings show that as v has a significantly higher k value than pb ii implying that pb ii takes less time to reach equilibrium adsorption isotherm models of langmuir freundlich and temkin were used to explore the metal ion interaction with b la and the viability of the adsorption process the isotherm plots of pb ii and as v adsorption on the b la composite are shown in fig 3c and the respective isotherm parameters are shown in table 2 the results demonstrated that the langmuir isotherm model fits the experimental data better than the freundlich and temkin model owing to a lower χ 2 table s2 and higher r2 value this means that the reaction was monolayer adsorption on a structurally homogenous surface of b la adsorbent in removing pb ii and as v langmuir isotherm model showed a maximum adsorption capacity qm of 147 05 mg g and 156 26 mg g for pb ii and as v at a ph of 6 this performance shows that pb ii and as v adsorption capacity is comparable to similar works as shown in table 3 3 5 45 48 also the adsorption capacity b la was higher than compared to bentonite alone for both metal ions 5 mg g for pb ii and negligible as v removal furthermore when compared to other functionalized materials used for pb ii and as v removal the current b la exhibits high or near efficacy in terms of adsorption removal capacity stability and re usability while being low cost and eco friendly 11 49 51 pb ii adsorption capacity increased with the temperature rising from 25 c to 50 c it indicates that this was an endothermic reaction and that increasing temperature was beneficial for pb ii adsorption while in the case of as v the adsorption capacity decreased with the temperature rising from 25 c to 50 c it indicates that this was an exothermic reaction and that increasing temperature was not beneficial for as v adsorption 3 4 effects of ph and coexisting ions the ph of a solution affects the surface chemistry of adsorbents as well as the chemical speciation of heavy metals the capacity of b la to adsorb pb ii and as v is shown in fig 3d as a function of the ph of the solutions because alkaline ph might produce lead hydroxide precipitation the process of pb ii and as v adsorption was investigated at a ph range of 2 0 to 6 0 for pb ii pb ii and as v elimination were extremely ph dependent 41 the results revealed that in the ph range of 3 6 pb ii sorption increased progressively with increasing ph the highest pb ii removal by b la in this ph range is at ph 5 6 at ph 7 0 however as v sorption reduced progressively the point of zero charges of b la was calculated to be 6 67 fig s5 the decrease in as v adsorption with rising ph was attributed to a decrease in coulombic attraction caused by a lower b la positive charge suggesting that electrostatic interaction was important in adsorption at a ph of 3 0 the lowest adsorption of pb ii was observed which may be explained by the competition for adsorption sites between h and pb ii ions and partial dissolution of b la resulting in a reduction in binding sites in contrast as v adsorption peaked at a ph of 4 0 which might be attributed to a stronger attraction between protonated la sites on the surface of b la and negative arsenate species pb ii and as v ions in wastewater invariably interact with other electrolyte ions influencing heavy metal migration and competing with them at b la sorption sites the common coexisting ions like na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 po4 2 f and no3 anions were used according to fig 3e the existence of either cations or anions had no noticeable influence on the adsorption of pb ii suggesting that pb ii is mostly adsorbed through the inner sphere complex 52 their removal affinity was much lower than pb ii the presence of na k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and no3 ions had no effect on as v adsorption even at the high concentration notably the po4 2 and f can significantly reduce as v ions adsorption fig 3f phosphate ions may negatively affect them because they compete with arsenate for adsorption sites to form similar inner sphere complexes arsenic and phosphorous are well known to belong to the same main group group v and have a very similar electronic structure they form similar physicochemical compounds in the aqueous chemistry of as v po4 2 also la3 had a good coordination ability for f 53 54 3 5 regeneration studies adsorbent regeneration is a significant economic element in the treatment process this procedure describes the mechanism of pb ii and as v loaded adsorbents for regeneration recycling and reusing spent adsorbents in order to cut costs and protect the environment from environmental pollutants adsorption tests were performed upto six cycles using 0 2 g l b la and 50 ml of 10 mg l pb ii and as v after the suspensions had been agitated at room temperature b la were collected by centrifugation and agitated with 50 ml of 0 2 m hno3 for pb ii and 0 2 m naoh for as v for recycling of adsorbent after three cycles of the adsorption desorption test the b la showed that the above 95 removal of both pb ii and as v fig s6 after the fourth cycle the removal percentage decreased as the number of cycles increased and reached above 70 due to the loss of adsorbent weight during centrifugation and washing caused a significant difference in the percentages of adsorption desorption pb ii and as v in the fourth cycle although the loss of b la during the process it shows 70 removal even at the 6th cycle this result demonstrated the high reusability of the developed b la composite for pb ii and as v upto three cycles 3 6 optimization of experimental conditions by mathematical modeling the discussed experiments in previous sections indicate that concluding an optimum condition to reach a high value of removal efficiency requires a cumbersome and costly experimental procedure to overcome this difficulty the response surface optimization method is employed to mathematically model the removal efficiency behaviour of pb ii and as v based on the influencing parameters of initial concentration ph temperature and elapsed time the dependency of the removal efficiency on the independent parameters is not clear from the experimental data thus to understand the dependency initially the study is initiated as a linear model and increases the degree of the model until reaching a satisfying model on the other hand lower degree models provide lower computational costs and avoid overfitting the data in this regard linear quadratic and cubic polynomials are utilized to fit the data obtained by the experiment in doing so the correlation between the removal efficiency values obtained by polynomial models and values given by experimental data would indicate the model s reliability fig 4 shows the correlations between the given experimental data and polynomial model prediction for ions removal the low value of the correlation factor in the linear model shows that this model is unfit for this problem on the other hand quadratic and cubic models seem to be suitable with r 2 0 7539 and r 2 0 9978 in the case of as v respectively the condition is better for pb ii and correlation factors are higher than 0 9 for nonlinear models in most cases a quadratic polynomial is considered suitable for predicting chemical models even having slightly lower correlation values than cubic models these polynomials are easier to handle and avoid overfitting data in the following all the calculations are based on the quadratic models analysis of variance anova of the quadratic model is presented in tables 4 and 5 table 4 shows the significance of each parameter in the quadratic model for pb ii removal it is observed that initial concentration ph and square of ph are the most effective parameters for the removal efficiency of pb ii removal with p values 0 0001 for the case of as v removal the most effective parameter is the initial concentration and square of ph as can be deduced from anova data provided in table 5 these data in tables 4 and 5 also indicate that the time is an important parameter in removing both ions as expected the longer the process the higher the removal efficiency fig 5 illustrates the effects of different parameters on pb ii removal efficiency using surface plots a surface peak is seen which is related to the numerical fitting of the data however higher ph results in better removal of pb ii at the same time the quadratic model suggests that a ph value close to 8 provides higher removals the effect of time is depicted in fig 5a increasing the processing time up to 320 min leads to increased pb ii removal afterwards it seems that elongated process time has no effect on the pb ii removal and as the polynomial model suggested it even reverses the removal process fig 5b presents the effect of temperature on the removal of pb ii as observed changing process temperature slightly affects the removal of pb ii favouring a higher temperature however in general the effect of temperature is insignificant in this process increasing the initial concentration decreases the removal of pb ii as observed in fig 5b as the initial concentration increases the ratio of removed pb ii to the initial concentration decreases within the same reaction time using the response surface optimization method the optimum value for maximizing the removal of pb ii removal is calculated the approximate values were deduced from fig 5 and the exact values obtained from the optimizing quadratic model are provided in table 6 it should be noted that these values are acquired using a quadratic model which has a correlation factor of r 2 0 9307 table 6 similar to the presented results for pb ii in the case of as v removal surfaces fitted with the quadratic model are given in fig 6 a completely different response from pb ii is seen for as v as the removal efficiency peaks in the middle range of ph in fig 6a removal surfaces are depicted as a function of initial concentration and ph in various time values in all values of initial concentrations there is a peak in the surfaces of removals indeed at a specific ph value the removal efficiency of as v reaches a maximum regardless of the time and initial concentration this indicates that ph plays an important role in obtaining the higher removal of as v which was also discussed in anova in the previous paragraphs as the processing time increases to 320 min as v removal increases however at higher time values it is seen that increasing process duration has no significant effects although in this figure a reverse behaviour is seen which can be associated with the quadratic fitted model in experiments this reverse behaviour of decreasing removal efficiency was not observed therefore the processing time of around 320 min could be considered an optimum time in lower initial concentrations i e 40 mg l even lower process time is sufficient to achieve maximum removal on the other hand as discussed in the case of pb ii increasing the initial concentration in fig 6b causes a reduction in removal efficiency moreover as predicted by the quadratic model increasing the temperature of the process decreases the removal of as v the effect of temperature is more noticeable in higher concentrations where an increase in temperature from 20 c to 50 c causes a 50 reduction in removal efficiency the temperature influence is trivial in lower concentrations which could be important regarding energy devoted to warming the solution therefore from these 3d surface plots of the quadratic model lower initial concentration temperature around 25 c and ph value near 6 are desirable for achieving high removal efficiency using the response surface optimization method the optimum value for maximizing the removal of as v removal is calculated the approximate values were deduced from fig 6 and the exact values obtained from the optimizing quadratic model are provided in table 6 it should be noted that these values are acquired using a quadratic model which has a correlation factor of r 2 0 9539 3 7 machine learning techniques artificial neural networks provide reliable and fast predictions in different problems from regression to classification in the case of the current study we encounter a regression problem in which polynomial models may not be adequate enough to predict the removal of the pb ii and as v therefore this section uses commonly used ann and anfis to predict the removal efficiency of the discussed processes a neural network in general consists of three different types of layers the first layer is the input layer in which the influential parameters of the reaction process should be fed into the network the second type of layer is the output layer which in the case of the present study is the removal efficiency the third layer is the hidden layer in which calculations are performed each layer has several cores of linear transformation called perceptrons at each perceptron i the respective input linearly transformed to its output by weights w i and biases b i a schematic of the network is shown in fig 7 which engages two hidden layers for the case of this study a supervised ann is utilized to predict the removal efficiency of the processes using temperature ph initial concentration and elapsed time the coefficients of all perceptrons are adjusted in several iterations epochs in the training process of the network using optimization algorithms to reduce the error between predicted results and actual values in the present study scikit learn 55 package in python is employed for ann analysis using the multi linear regression tool for optimizing the loss function or mse the adam solver is utilized which adopts a stochastic gradient descent algorithm this package provides several tools to split the dataset into different parts of the train validate and test categories moreover the activation function for the hidden layers is set to be logistic after some trials the number of hidden layers is set to two with 50 nodes each on the other hand different numbers of iterations from 1000 to 50 000 with 1000 steps are considered to find the best trained model in terms of the highest correlation between predicted and actual removal efficiency values it is obvious that an increase in the number of normal results in an increase in the accuracy of the results therefore it is necessary to prevent overfitting the training portion of the data in this regard a validation process is performed parallel to the training on 15 of the training data it was observed that after 25 000 iterations the error of validation increases determining the beginning of the overfitting data as shown in fig 8 fig 9 demonstrates the efficiency of using ann in predicting removal for both pb ii and as v cases as observed the trained networks with r 2 0 99 performed satisfactorily predicting new data as the test data correlation factor is above 0 94 therefore the ann could be confidently used in new experimental conditions alongside better fitting data anfis network is a specific type of neural network in which each input parameter is categorized based on its value and each category has its constant values for example ph values are categorized into acidic basic and neutral categories the network behaves differently for each of these categories the details of such networks can be found in jang 1993 56 anfis networks are generally more stable than ann and converge more rapidly the present study uses the neuro fuzzy designer app in matlab software to perform anfis analysis for each input of ph initial concentration time and temperature three categories are defined automatically by the software as determined by the user in a fully connected network membership functions that categorise each input parameter s values are selected to be triangular for all inputs the schematic of the anfis network is depicted in fig 10 utilized to predict the removal efficiency of the reactions in the inner layers after categorization and assigning membership value to each category the rules r i s combine the membershiop values the combining rule is a simple and function for all cases in our study in the next layers n i s the all the values are normalized to get firing strength a combination of all firing strengths generates the output moreover after approximately 50 iterations epochs the results become stable compared to 25 000 iterations of a neural network as depicted in fig 11 the predicted removal values for both pb ii and as v are presented in fig 12 as seen with a correlation factor higher than 0 9 in the case of train data the network performs acceptably compared to the quadratic model the correlation of test data also indicated the reliability of anfis 3 8 comparison of rsm ann and anfis and discussion on the modelling results the mathematical and artificial neural networks employed to predict the removal efficiency of the processes have different performances fig 13 compares the value of normalized root mean square errors nrmse of the different models used in the current study as observed in both cases ann performs exceptionally with very low nrmse the worst condition belongs to linear models although the cubic polynomial models have a low error value using neural networks in similar studies is suggested considering efforts and performance for each experimental run the obtained normalized errors are graphically depicted in fig 14 it can be observed that the values of normalized error for ann are negligible in comparison to other methods the error level of cubic polynomial and anfis is comparable with slightly higher errors in the cubic model the errors in the case of as v are generally higher than pb ii in all models indicating that the influencing factors in the experiment are the most important determining for the removal of pb ii on the other hand in the case of as v the responses to the change in the effective parameters did not result in a well defined model at least in the models discussed in the present paper however the results in both cases are satisfactory it is crucial to notice that artificial neural networks could generally reach a high accuracy during the training process given enough time perceptrons and epochs so that the predicted results could coincide with the provided outputs however caution should be exercised to avoid overfitting therefore a validation process is run parallel to the training on the other hand its accuracy may be slightly lower for a set of fresh new data as observed in the given examples the training process reaches a correlation factor 0 99 which is extremely desirable on the other hand the testing process reaches a correlation factor of 0 97 at its best it should be mentioned that several algorithm runs were conducted to find the best value of the correlation factor 4 conclusions in this study a functional b la is synthesized and applied for pb ii and as v adsorption in a single and coexisting aqueous solution under neutral ph the as prepared b la demonstrated excellent adsorption capability for pb ii and as v a pso model could well fit pb ii and as v adsorption and equilibrium adsorption demonstrated that the langmuir model was more suitable than the freundlich and temkin models for describing pb ii and as v adsorption the findings show that pb ii and as v which were 147 05 and 156 26 mg g at 25 c respectively were high in comparison to the available materials table 3 and bentonite alone also b la shows higher adsorptive removal and higher re usability compared to some other functionalized materials used for pb ii and as v removal 49 51 coexisting ions either anions or cations had no discernible influence on pb ii adsorption suggesting that pb ii is mostly adsorbed through the inner sphere complex but the po4 2 and f can significantly reduce as v adsorption by competitive and strong coordination effects respectively further the prepared b la can be re used upto six cycles without losing its removal efficacy of 70 different mathematical and artificial intelligence models were employed to find the best approach to predict optimal conditions for removing pb ii and as v the results indicated that linear models were unsuitable for the removal behaviour based on the effective parameters investigated in the current study moreover ann models seemed to predict the removal of pb ii and as v with high r2 and low computational costs the overall results concluded that they overcame the limitation of bentonite alone for anion heavy metals removal and increased the adsorption capacity of prepared b la by modifying the surface of bentonite with lanthanum oxide declaration of competing interest the authors confirm that they do not have any known competitive financial interests or personal relationships

12637,much oily wastewater containing emulsions are generated daily in various industrial processes such as petroleum and gas extraction petrochemical and mechanical processing if the oily wastewater is directly discharged it will issue a vast waste of water resources and increase environmental risks around the plant the efficient treatment and reuse of oily wastewater will achieve a win win situation of environmental protection and economy in the production of enterprises the pressure driven membrane separation technology can easily and quickly realize the separation of oil and water

difficulties that mof membranes will face when applied to oil containing membranes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oil water separation membrane separation technology metal organic framework membrane special wettability modification strategy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with the awakening of human environmental awareness more attention has been paid to the disposal of oily wastewater in production and life although the traditional oil water separation technology such as gravity separation flotation separation electrochemical adsorption separation biodegradation or a combination of multiple methods for multi stage processing affects oil water separation 1 5 however in the process of oily wastewater treatment the traditional separation technology has many difficulties ample floor space 6 high operational cost 7 long retention time and energy consumption 8 9 therefore improving the traditional oil water separation technology is of far reaching significance in improving its separation efficiency 10 membrane separation technology is recognized as one of the most promising oil water separation technologies based on the advantages of membrane separation technology such as simple equipment low energy consumption no phase change and good selectivity it stands out from all kinds of separation technologies remarkably the special wettability membrane exhibits extraordinary performance and it has attracted the attention of many scholars in oil water emulsions 11 the core of membrane separation technology is a membrane with selective permeation capability by applying a driving force such as concentration difference pressure difference or potential difference etc on both sides of the membrane the components on the raw material side selectively permeate the membrane to achieve the purpose of separation and purification 12 therefore the excellent membrane material is the key to the entire membrane separation process various types of membrane material such as polymer membranes inorganic ceramic membranes and new nano membranes have been thoroughly studied and applied to the treatment of oily wastewater 13 15 in the past ten years polymer membranes have been in a stage of rapid development various polymer membranes perform excellent gas separation seawater desalination and petrochemical separation although polymer membranes show higher permeability and selectivity there is still a gap compared with cutting edge ion and molecular channel membranes currently the evaluation of its performance is mainly in the laboratory under controlled conditions and its separation performance needs further research in the face of complex organic wastewater with high salt and ph compared with polymer membranes ceramic membranes have significant advantages such as high stability long service life and high flux but the high manufacturing cost of ceramic membranes has lost the price oriented market 16 in addition to the high cost ceramic membranes also have problems such as high brittleness and low elasticity of inorganic materials which bring certain difficulties to the molding and processing of membranes and component equipment 17 the new type of nano membrane is to incorporate nanoparticle materials such as mofs materials nanometer metal oxides etc on polymer membranes ceramic membranes or metal mesh membranes and adjust the microstructure and chemical composition of the membrane surface to obtain super wetting properties with the progress of nanotechnology the new nano membranes not only overcomes the shortcoming of poor anti fouling of polymer membranes and inorganic ceramic membranes but also constructs rough surface and graft hydrophilic or lipophilic groups on the membrane surface according to the unique structure and physical and chemical properties of nano materials which contributes to the improvement of oil water separation efficiency 18 the oil water separation membrane is based on the difference in the wettability of the oil phase and the water phase on the membrane surface in the wastewater compared with other kinds of separation membranes the new nano membrane has significant advantages in improving the wetting ability and selective permeability of the oil phase or water phase on the separation membrane surface by constructing the membrane surface with special surface wettability 19 in recent years the mof membrane has been considered a new vital nano membrane that has attracted much attention metal organic frameworks mofs are crystalline porous materials with a periodic network structure that are self assembled by central metal ions bridged by organic ligands 20 mofs have the advantages of large specific surface area tunable pores numerous exposed active sites and excellent optical properties so researchers have loaded mofs onto the surface of separation membranes or prepared pure mof membranes 21 23 the combination of mof material and membrane can be a good trade off between the choice of membrane permeability and membrane flux to obtain a separation membrane with excellent performance among the reviews in recent years some summarize the synthesis strategies of mof membranes some summarize the application of a single type of mof and its derivatives in oil water separation and some emphasize the relationship between the properties and structures of mofs 24 26 in this review we will briefly explain the mechanism of oil water separation summarize the latest preparation methods of metal organic framework membranes and discuss the modification strategies of metal organic framework membranes in detail to help solve the problems of membrane fouling and clogging it focuses on applying metal organic framework membranes in oil water separation especially the application status and development direction of metal organic framework membranes in difficult to separate oil water emulsions finally the aim is to provide a theoretical and feasible basis for the large scale application of mof membranes in oil water separation and the modification of mof membranes 2 oil water separation mechanism the premise of the efficient treatment of oily wastewater is to analyze the mechanism of membrane separation of oily wastewater and the physical and chemical properties the diameter of oil droplets in the oily wastewater can be divided into four categories free state dispersed state emulsified state and dissolved state as seen in table 1 the oil droplets in the free and dispersed states have large particle sizes and the oil and water phases are layered which are easy to separate and recycle however a mass of emulsified and dissolved oil which is a few microns or less is produced in the modern industry 27 the oil droplets and water phase form a stable homogeneous system which is difficult to separate by conventional means it is the key and difficult point that is separated the oil phase from stable emulsified and dissolved oil in the study of oil water separation 28 the separation of oil water emulsion and dissolved oil is a difficult point in the field of oil water separation and efficient oil water emulsion separation technology and dissolved oil separation technology need to be developed urgently the oil water mixture separates on the membrane surface which can be seen as a unique wetting behavior adjusting membrane surface porosity and structuring the unique wettability surface are considered the most promising approaches to achieving the purpose of efficient oil water separation 2 1 sieving principle the separation mechanism of the oil water separation membrane is similar to that of filtration therefore different types of separation membranes are selected according to the oil droplet size to deal with oily wastewater in different states at present according to the membrane pore size it can be divided into four types of separation membranes microfiltration membrane mf ultrafiltration uf membrane nanofiltration nf membrane and reverse osmosis ro membrane 26 in the process of oil water separation the particle size of the oil phase is the basis for selecting oil water separation membranes free and dispersed oils are usually separated using microfiltration membranes it is better to use an ultrafiltration membrane and nanofiltration membrane for emulsified oil separation dissolved oils must be treated with reverse osmosis membranes with smaller pore sizes the smaller the pore size of the membrane the lower the membrane flux but the stronger the membrane selectivity in one study they chose a ssm with a large pore size to handle a simple oil water mixture and a ssm with a small pore size as a substrate for the preparation of mof membranes to separate oil water emulsions 29 in general the flux of a separation membrane is negatively correlated with the selective separation capacity 30 balancing the contradiction between high flux and high selectivity is the key to solving the application barriers of oil water separation membranes according to the principle of membrane pore screening the oil droplet can be retained as long as the pore size of the oil water separation membrane is smaller than the diameter of the oil droplet when the oleophilic membrane achieves the separation effect the oily wastewater flows through the surface of the membrane and the oil droplets condense on the surface of the pore wall to form large droplets which pass through the membrane pores under the action of the driving force to achieve oil water separation the results of oil water separation only relying on the pores are not satisfactory 2 2 membrane wetting model it can be seen that membrane separation is mainly based on the wettability of the membrane surface to separate the oil phase and the water phases 31 wettability refers to the existence of two immiscible liquids the ability of the liquid to first wet the surface of the solid phase that is the ability or tendency of a liquid to spread on a solid surface the wettability of the membrane surface is usually measured by the liquid phase s static contact angle θ 32 when the contact angle of the droplet on the separation membrane surface satisfies the inequality 0 θ 90 the surface is hydrophilic or lipophilic if the droplets cannot wet the membrane surface the contact angle satisfies the inequality 90 θ 180 33 fig 1 two centuries ago scientist thomas young studied droplets on rigid solid surfaces with smooth surfaces uniform chemical composition and perfect ideals under the above conditions the contact angle is determined by the surface tension of the solid liquid gas three phase equilibrium point in the horizontal direction young s equation eq 1 is derived according to the mechanical equilibrium conditions 1 γ sg γ sl γ lg cos θ 1 2 derivative type cos θ 1 γ sl γ sg γ lg where is solid gas interface tension is solid liquid interface tension is liquid gas interface tension is contact angle from eq 2 it can be concluded that young s equation is the basic way to wet solid surfaces and the smaller the contact angle the better the wettability however since yang s equation does not consider the correction of the actual environment and condition parameters of the experiment it is only suitable for the plane under ideal conditions and the solid surfaces in practice are mostly rough and defective and the application of the yang s equation is limited in 1936 wenzel corrected young s equation taking into account the inherent defects of the solid surface and a certain roughness and adsorbed certain impurities introducing a roughness factor r to indicate the roughness size wenzel believes that when the liquid is in contact with the solid surface the liquid completely infiltrates the surface gap only the solid liquid contact and proposes a modified model according to the principle of free energy invariance and three phase tension virtual work is zero derived wenzel s equation eq 3 3 γ lg cos θ 2 r γ sg γ sl where r is roughness factor defined as the ratio of the true area of a rough surface to the projected area on the horizontal area antennae measurement of liquids on the surface of the rough surface is obstructed but can be deduced eq 4 4 cos θ 2 rcos θ 1 we can draw the following conclusions since r 1 when contact angle θ 1 90 rcosθ1 0 θ 2 increases with r meaning that for hydrophobic surfaces increasing roughness increases hydrophobicity conversely when θ 1 90 rcosθ1 0 θ 2 decreases with the increase of r which means that for hydrophilic surfaces the roughness increases and the hydrophilicity is also enhanced with the advancement of interface science it has been found that hydrophilic materials can also be used to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces and the wenzel model cannot give a reasonable explanation for its defects cassie and baxter further expanded and revised the wenzel model when the liquid wets the solid surface the liquid does not completely occupy the gap on the rough surface and there is still gas on the wet surface forming a solid liquid gas three phase composite interface also based on the principle that the total free energy of the system is invariant and the three phase interface tension is zero the cassie baxter equation eq 5 is derived 5 cos θ f 1 cos θ 1 f 2 cos θ 2 where θ is contact angle f 1 and f 2 represent the total surface area occupied by composite medium 1 and composite medium 2 f 1 f 2 1 θ 1 and θ 2 is corresponding media contact angle when the medium is air the liquid contact angle is 180 and eq 5 simplifies eq 6 6 cos θ f 1 cos θ 1 1 1 it is known that 0 f 1 1 so cosθ cos θ 1 when the f 1 approaches 0 the composite medium is mainly an air medium regardless of the positive and negative and magnitude of the cosθ 1 values cosθ intends to 1 the composite surface is in a superhydrophobic state when the f 1 approaches 1 the composite interface is mainly a solid medium cosθ close to cosθ 1 so f 1 has a decisive effect on the angle of contact similarly due to the rough surface of the solid it is necessary to introduce a roughness factor r to derive the eq 7 7 cos θ r f 1 cos θ 1 f 1 1 when f 1 approaches 1 the equation tends to wenzel s equation when f 1 approaches 0 the equation tends to the cassie baxter equation indicating that the two can be converted to each other the cassie baxter model reacts more realistically with the wetting of liquids and rough surfaces by analyzing the basic theoretical models of surface wettability such as young s model wenzel s model cassie baxter model it is shown that surface structures are significant for wettability of solid surfaces 34 many researchers follow the guidance of wetting models to design mof films with unique wetting surfaces 35 in dan zhao s research superhydrophobic surfaces were obtained by synthesizing zr mof on the surface of ssm in situ through a combination of simulation and experiment they proved that the nanostructure of mof on the membrane surface significantly enhances the hydrophobicity of the membrane 36 the selectivity of the separation membrane can be comprehended as special wettability the essence of oil water separation is to use the distinction in surface energy between the oil phase and the water phase fig 2 therefore the selective separation principle of oil water separation membranes can also be explained by the wettability of solid surfaces in the oil water separation process the liquid phase with a stronger affinity to the membrane will form a pure liquid layer on the membrane surface when the oily wastewater flows through the membrane surface if a hydrophilic membrane is used to separate oily wastewater the water phase will spread on the membrane surface inducing water droplets to pass through the membrane pores while the oil droplets aggregates on the membrane surface and cannot pass through to achieve the purpose of separation and vice versa 2 3 membrane permeation theory both the pore size and wettability control the oil water separation efficiency of the separation membrane if the liquid wants to immerse in the membrane a hydrostatic pressure must be applied to make it greater than the minimum feed liquid entry pressure to achieve oil water separation liquid entry pressure lep is an inherent feature of each membrane it can be determined to be lep associated with the surface tension of the liquid phase the size of the contact angle of the liquid phase at the porosity and the shape and size of the membrane pores lep values are usually described in the young laplace equation eq 8 8 p 2 σ cos θ r where σ is liquid tension θ is contact angle r is pore size of the membrane in general the lep value increases with the increase of the contact angle and surface tension and decreases with the decrease of the pore size however other factors may affect the lep value such as membrane surface adjustment of organic inorganic compounds thereby reducing the surface tension to reduce the lep value as can be seen from laplace s equation the separation efficiency is affected by both membrane wettability and membrane pore radius in conclusion membrane separation technology can realize the separation of various types of oily wastewater by adjusting the membrane s pore size or changing the membrane surface s affinity metal organic frameworks have tunable pore structures and surface ligand groups that can easily change wettability which have bright application prospects in oil water separation 3 synthesis of mof membranes metal framework materials compounds by yaghi s research group have attracted widespread attention since they were first synthesized and researchers have developed various mofs 38 compared with traditional materials mof materials have a larger specific surface area and more developed specific pore structure so they have more excellent separation ability however the application of powdered mof materials is minimal fisher s team loaded the powder onto the membrane s surface for the first time and successfully prepared a mof 5 membrane which opened the research on mof membranes 39 nowadays mof membranes have been widely used in separation 40 catalysis 41 sensing 42 metal protection and other fields 43 and an increased number of synthesis methods have been developed 26 modification strategies based on synthetic methods are the only way to obtain excellent separation membrane materials next we will analyze and compare the synthesis methods of mof membranes in recent years table 2 shows some of the research on applying mof membranes in oil water separation over the past five years the water stability of mofs is a critical factor in whether they can be applied to water treatment good water stability can maintain the continuous and efficient separation of the membrane while preventing secondary pollution leaching of metal ions table 2 shows that most of the main categories of mof in the field of oil water separation include uio 66 zif 8 mil 100 fe mil 101 fe or al mil 125 ti hkust 1 etc nowadays there are three strategies to improve mof water stability enhance coordination bond strength reduce water contact with mof subjects and increase ligand rigidity the highly charged metal ions can form strong coordination bonds with the carboxylate ligand and the resulting zr mof uio 66 which has exceptionally high stability and is modified by amination to obtain uio 66 nh2 for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces in order to reduce the contact of water with the mof body it is necessary to modify or directly introduce hydrophobic groups after synthesis zif 8 is a typical example using hydrophobic imidazole as a ligand so it is also often used to prepare hydrophobic interfaces compared with flexible ligands rigid ligands tend to maintain the configuration of mofs resulting in higher deformation barriers the commonly used or promising mof materials have one or more of the three types of conditions with good water stability used in the field of oil water separation 3 1 in situ growth method currently there are two ways to obtain mof membranes one is to grow the mof layer on the membrane substrate and the other is to mix the synthesized mof particles with organic matter to form the membrane 79 the in situ growth method uses the crystallization process of mof materials to immerse the porous substrate in a uniformly mixed reaction mother liquor to grow mofs on the surface of the substrate directly with the advancement of preparation technology to make up for the shortcomings of the in situ growth method the modified substrate synthesis and the same metal source method have been developed based on the direct synthesis method table 3 shows the advantages and disadvantages of the three original growth methods 3 2 second growth method the secondary growth method is also called the seed growth method the nucleation and growth of mof crystals are carried out separately during the synthesis process of the mof membranes first a seed layer is formed by seeding a crystal seed on the substrate by deposition coating etc and the substrate on which the seed is grown is placed in a solution of metal ions and organic ligands to grow a mof membrane this method can solve the complex problem of heterogeneous nucleation and settle the problem of low nucleation rate on the surface of the substrate thereby improving the membrane growth quality and the separation performance of the mof membrane the properties of the mof membranes prepared by secondary growth have apparent correlations with the seed crystal size the seed crystal thickness and the bonding strength between the seed crystal layer and the substrate seeding on the substrate material can be carried out by various means such as rubbing coating seeding dip coating thermal seeding distribution seeding electrospinning and the like fig 3 shows a typical seed layer preparation method for the base class 3 3 electrochemical growth method electrochemical fabrication methods usually include five strategies anodic deposition cathodic deposition conversion electro synthesized mof precursor electrophoretic deposition and electric displacement 80 the structure of the grown mof membrane can be adjusted by adjusting factors such as potential deposition temperature time substrate solvent ratio etc 79 both anodic deposition and cathodic deposition utilize the transfer of electrons in the electric field and the oxidation or reduction reaction occurs at the corresponding electrode to guide the growth of mofs crystals on the electrode fig 4 this method conversion electro synthesized mof precursor is advantageous to grow crystals of mofs in specific orientations electrophoretic deposition is a method to deposit charged mof crystals on a conductive substrate under the action of an electric field force to form a mof membrane electro displacement utilizes metal reducibility to displace the desired metal ion cross linking ligand on the substrate surface to form a mof membrane the electrochemical manufacturing method is easy to operate fast in reaction mild in reaction conditions and has the prospect of large scale preparation the reaction conditions for electrochemical manufacturing of mof membranes are mild and straightforward to operate which is conducive to scale up production however in the process of electrochemistry various by products will be formed and the complex reaction mechanism is challenging to control the growth direction such as the growth of mofs that can be directed will be highly beneficial to oil water separation 3 4 liquid phase epitaxy the epitaxial growth of mof onto surfaces provides a suitable means for mof deposition contacting 81 the substrate is repeatedly immersed in the metal solution and organic ligand solution required for mof crystal growth and the mof membrane is grown at room temperature the layer by layer growth method is similar to the step by step seeding method in the secondary growth method the substrate is repeatedly dipped into a solution of metal ions and organic ligands to precisely control the growth thickness of the membrane finally the excess reaction solution is washed away with a suitable solvent liquid phase epitaxy relies on discontinuous crystallization processes to precisely control the thickness of mof membranes and mild reaction conditions are ideal for large scale fabrication of mof membranes 3 5 synthetic mixed matrix membranes compared with a pure mof membrane a mixed matrix membrane can break through the choice of substrate and greatly enhance the separation performance of the membrane 82 the mixed matrix method is divided into the direct mixing method and the post synthesis modification method the direct mixing method is to disperse the synthesized powdery mof material into a polymer solution to form a stable suspension and coat it on the substrate to form mof membranes which can also be coated onto non porous substrates and peeled off after drying to form free standing mof membranes the post synthesis modification method reduces the agglomeration of mof powder or grafts and some other functional groups to obtain excellent performance by surface modification of the synthesized mof materials mixed matrix membranes greatly enrich the types of mof membranes and suitable substrate materials can be selected according to the environment to prepare functionalized separation membranes table 4 4 modification of mof membranes for oil water separation the basic membrane material has a particular oil water separation effect but to efficiently treat oily wastewater the membrane material needs to be modified it is well known that the substrates of mof membranes are various different modification methods will be used to achieve the goal for different base membranes or to obtain different wettability it is well known that the substrates of mof membranes are various and commonly used including metal meshes organic polymer membranes or other types of membrane like substrates nevertheless controlling the surface microstructure and chemical composition is the key to obtaining an efficient separation membrane different substrate materials require different modification methods to obtain the designed properties to separate oil and water next the modification measures adopted in recent years will be summarized 4 1 dip coating technique it is an objective fact that dip coating technology is the most widely used method in the surface modification of mof membranes usually some modification or purification of the membrane substrate itself is carried out prior to modification organosilanes are often used in dip coating modification techniques as hydrophobic coatings a typical instance is that du et al synthesized a hydrophilic hkust 1 coating on the surface of foamed copper mesh by electrochemical method and immersed it in a chloroform solution of 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane fas 17 to obtain a hydrophobic surface foamed copper mesh modified with organosilane realizes the rapid separation of the oil water mixture and obtains a separation efficiency of 96 which is still maintained after multiple cycles 64 modified copper foam mesh exhibits excellent reusability in addition to fas 17 polydimethylsiloxane pdms is one of the most widely used organosilane hydrophobic modifiers today and various substrates obtain low surface energy after being immersed in pdms solution for instance inspired by other researchers gao s research team developed a technology that can produce hydrophobic surfaces on different substrates 83 their preparation strategy requires no additional particles and is fluorine free and water rich they systematically explored the optimal ratio of tetrahydrofuran thf to water to obtain the best hydrophobic surface and explained the effect of material ratio on hydrophobic performance when only tetrahydrofuran was used as the pdms solvent the dip coating solution did not produce emulsion droplets with the increase of water content the emulsion droplets and particle size increased furthermore when the volume ratio of tetrahydrofuran to water is 3 7 the number of emulsion droplets reaches the maximum when the volume ratio of thf to water is 1 9 the emulsion is more dispersed and the droplets are larger fig 5 the results show that when more diminutive and more emulsion droplets are obtained greater roughness can be imparted to the substrate resulting in the best hydrophobic surface in addition zhu et al used a simple in situ growth process to grow a large number of cu mof particles on the surface of copper mesh and immersed them in pdms solution to obtain a superhydrophobic surface unlike others they used dibutyltin dilaurate and tetraethylorthosilicate as curing agents for pdms instead of the commonly used tetrahydrofuran however the modified copper mesh maintains a separation efficiency of about 96 for high viscosity oil water mixture and 99 for low viscosity oil 84 in brief dip coating technology is easy to operate without the use of expensive equipment and equipment to build surfaces with special wettability on a flat surface especially in the modification of organic polymer coatings 4 2 electrospinning technology electrospinning technology adjusts the structural characteristics of the prepared membranes including pore size thickness diameter and porosity by controlling the parameters of the spinning equipment 85 however there are many ways to modify membrane materials in the electrospinning process including direct electrospinning growth of mof crystals on the spinning membrane simultaneous electrospinning etc however direct electrospinning is the most widely used in modifying oil water separation membranes 86 in a study the team of jiang et al mixed uio 66 nh2 into a dmf solution of polyacrylonitrile pan with sufficient stirring and synthesized a mixed mechanism membrane by direct electrospinning 87 they also explored the effect of polymer concentration on the electrospinning process they found that low polymer concentrations caused disintegration and discontinuity in the electrospinning fiber process while when the polymer concentration was higher than 10 and above it would not happen furthermore with the increase of polymerization concentration the diameter of spun fibers also increases enhancing the whole membrane s mechanical strength the same year chen et al also loaded mof 808 onto pan fibers utilizing direct electrospinning 88 moreover disodium edetate edta was used to replace the formate in the mof crystal to endow the modified membrane with a more robust metal ion adsorption performance in addition zhu et al took another strategy to load mof crystals onto electrospun membranes 72 the nano sized mof crystals effectively enhance the membrane s superb wettability and underwater superoleophobicity the polyacrylonitrile fiber membrane was synthesized by electrospinning technology the pan membrane was hydrolyzed by sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid and the cyano groups in polyacrylonitrile were replaced with carboxyl groups fig 6 the pan membrane was hydrolyzed by sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid and the cyano groups in polyacrylonitrile were replaced to carboxyl groups to enhance antifouling ability of the separation membrane the development of electrospinning technology has broken through the barriers to mof crystal application membrane materials promoting the dispersion of mofs and maintaining high adsorption 89 in summary electrospinning technology breaks through the limitations of mof particles integrates the particle like mof into the fiber and further prepares a stable mof membrane under precise control to separate the oily wastewater the centralized management and modular arrangement of many electrospinning equipments can realize the unified control of mof membrane working conditions and processes which is conducive to large scale production 4 3 sol gel processing sol gel processing is widely used in ceramic materials and has been proven to be a general strategy to obtain controllable surface and organization structure which can be well used in the surface modification process of mof membranes 90 sol gel processing can provide new chemical reaction sites inside and outside the pores of mof help the grafted chemical functional groups add new chemical functions and localize the growth of mof crystals on the surface of inorganic materials 91 sol gel processing transforms powdered mofs into higher structures thin membranes or monoliths increasing their applicability and enhancing some of their properties the pore channel of mof crystal is a crucial structure to realize the functions of separation and catalysis it is an important method to adjust the performance of mof by regulating the pore structure of mof crystal 92 to not destroy the whole frame of mof material the modification after synthesis avoids the risk of modification sol gel processing can penetrate the pores based on preserving the original architecture adjusting the structure of the pores and providing functionalized reaction sites in one study the stability of mofs in water was improved with little impact on the pore specific surface area of mofs materials 93 using long aliphatic chains on oligomeric silsesquioxanes cu3 btc 2 was rendered hydrophobic and verified by depositing it on a flat plate to measure its contact angle after various analytical tests only slight changes in the pore volume and specific surface area of mofs were observed after modification with oligomeric silsesquioxanes and on the surface the researchers also carried out surface selective modification of other kinds of mofs in the same way and still successfully proved that this is a general and promising modification method fig 7 in addition to the micro scale sol gel processing which can be grafted on the crystal surface the sol gel process can also be used to construct high structure mofs at the macro scale in a recent study cheng et al used pva to support ni fe modified mofs uniformly used ultrasound to remove air bubbles poured the solution into a mold and obtained composite hydrogels after five freeze thaw cycles 94 finally the stainless steel mesh was immersed in the hydrogel for 10 min then taken out and placed in an oven for half an hour to obtain the hydrogel coated mesh the as prepared mof combined with pva coated membranes obtained super hydrophilic and underwater super oleophobic capabilities the separation effect of the oil water mixture is 99 and the separation efficiency of a light oil in water emulsion which is difficult to separate is also 98 and the membrane flux is also ideal fig 8 in short when applying sol gel processing technology to modify mof membranes the chemical composition and microstructure of the surface can be easily controlled to obtain a super wettable surface 4 4 vacuum assisted self assembly process the vacuum assisted self assembly process is a facile method to introduce chemical groups and deposit nanomaterials on the surface of polymer membranes 95 this strategy not only can adjust the microstructure of the surface which is beneficial to obtaining the functional target membrane but also shows a broad prospect in the integration of organic and inorganic components to construct a homogeneous functional membrane with these advantages in oil water separation many researchers have introduced large hydrophilic groups and mof nanoparticles on the membrane surface through vacuum assisted self assembly techniques their efficient oil water separation performance has been widely verified based on the characteristics of highwater absorption and large specific surface area of mof particles to construct super wettable surfaces polyacrylic acid paa is a widely used adhesive and its abundant carboxyl functional groups have multiple functions which give the modified mof membrane better stability and stronger antifouling performance 96 in jiang s report the prepared nh2 uio 66 was mixed with ultrasonic waves and it was easy to agglomerate and dispersed unevenly when deposited on the surface of the membrane alone 78 after adding paa as a binder in the solution its dispersibility in water was significantly improved in addition the abundant carboxyl groups on the surface of paa can combine with the amino groups on the amino modified uio 66 nh2 crystals to form amide groups which can fix the mof particles on the surface of the membrane and improve the abrasion resistance of the membrane it is also due to the abundant carboxyl groups on paa which can consume alkalinity in an alkaline environment and wrap on mof crystals from damage they also tested the membrane surface potential and found that the negative charge of the membrane is beneficial to stabilizing the hydration layer of the membrane and enhancing its oil repellency yu s research team also used the same technique to immobilize amino modified mil 125 with paa as an adhesive and obtained similar conclusions fig 9 at the same time yu also paid attention to the negative charge carried on the surface of the membrane and found that the modified membrane also has an excellent separation effect on cationic dyes and the membrane can handle oil water emulsions containing dyes in recent years graphene oxide go is a representative two dimensional nanomaterial with high mechanical strength and controllable chemical surface which has been widely used in separation fields such as gas purification and desalination 97 98 its natural hydrophilicity has attracted attention in the oil water field but the interlayer distance is usually 2 nm which limits its separation efficiency in macromolecular pollutants 99 the vacuum assisted self assembly process can easily embed stable nanoparticles between go nanosheets expand the interlayer distance and enhance the wetting performance fig 10 based on the excellent performance and tunable chemical surface and morphological characteristics of mof materials they are suitable candidates as membrane intercalation materials in 2020 jiang proposed in a study that the prepared go and mof dispersions were filtered onto a mixed cellulose membrane mce in a vacuum environment and dried to form a composite membrane 100 compared with only depositing go on the surface the pure water flux of the mof embedded membranes was increased by seven times nonetheless the proportion of nanomaterials was explored to balance the separation efficiency and ensure the membrane surface s stability finally the pure water flux of the most suitable composite membrane was reduced to 3333 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the rejection rate of the oil water emulsion was above 99 5 mxene is another interesting two dimensional nanomaterial first reported by gogotis and barsoum in 2011 101 in recent research reports its natural hydrophilicity shows broad research prospects in oil water separation and dye removal similar to traditional two dimensional nano the interlayer spacing of mxene is also 2 nm hence the membrane s selective permeability and separation efficiency also need to be weighed fig 11 inserting nanoparticles in the interlayer is a practical modification method inspired by predecessors zhan s team inserted carboxyl modified uio 66 nanoparticles between mxene nanosheets using vacuum self assembly technology a composite membrane that can effectively separate oil water emulsions in a complex environment was successfully formed on a supported membrane in the latest study in order to overcome the limitations of mxene pu et al also inserted stable tannic acid modified zif 8 nanoparticles between the layers which significantly improved the membrane s pollution resistance and reuse ability 77 the vacuum assisted self assembly strategy can quickly load mof nanoparticles onto the membrane surface to control the membrane surface s chemical composition and morphological structure when using the adhesive at the same time this strategy can also help in embedding mof nanoparticles into 2d nanomaterials the embedded mof nanoparticles widen the permeation channel enhance the roughness of the surface and improve the overall anti swelling ability of the membrane in general vacuum assisted self assembly technology can easily insert mof particles into two dimensional layered materials to form uniform intercalation expand layer spacing and improve the permeability of the separation membrane by introducing a functionalized mof material the wealthy hydrophilic groups on it significantly improve the film s resistance to contamination and provide a fast water transfer path 4 5 electrospray technology electrospray technology is a novel membrane preparation technology that has been used for many years before it was widely used in biomedical encapsulation and drug transportation as well as in the deposition of metal coatings of controlled thickness 102 electrospinning uses a high concentration of high viscosity precursors to launch a continuous fine jet under the action of a high voltage electric field to solidify to form a nanofiber polymer electrospray technology is to apply high pressure to the low viscosity and low concentration of the precursor liquid in the nozzle so that the liquid has a large charge inside 103 when the liquid leaves the nozzle the electrostatic force interacts with the surface tension and disperses into smaller droplets when the potential between the substrate and the nozzle is high enough the crescent surface of the droplets generated by the nozzle tip will become conical and eventually quickly evaporate and crystallize on the surface of the substrate to form a membrane structure the uniformity thickness roughness pore size and porosity of the membrane can be controlled by adjusting the electrospray parameters thereby affecting the selectivity and permeability of the membrane fig 12 in the study of jinsoo kim s team zif 7 film was deposited on the surface of a circular alumina substrate using electrospray technology 104 obtaining a stable tapered spray was a difficult point in electrospray technology and the team reduced the optimization difficulty by fixing the fluid characteristics concentration and solvent and the size of the nozzle and finally obtained a stable conical spray by regulating the voltage applied on the nozzle and the flow rate of the fluid in addition comparing the time scales of the formation of zif 7 crystals using electrospray and solvothermal methods it is inferred that short solved evaporation can form stable crystals rather than thermal effects therefore the key to influencing electrospray mof film molding is to control the appropriate solvent evaporation rate to obtain a continuous and stable film structure the substrate temperature is too high and the solvent evaporates too quickly resulting in discontinuous crystal molding unable to form a continuous mof film on the contrary the substrate temperature is insufficient and the solvent will wet the substrate surface and penetrate the interior which can not form enough crystals the use of electrospray technology increases the reduction of synthesis time and the consumption of the precursor compared with the traditional dipping technology the film prepared by electrospray technology has the advantages of a more uniform structure faster polymerization material saving and zero waste discharge simple direct spraying also has good prospects in amplifying production while electrospray technology has many advantages more research is needed on how fluids of different properties can form a stable tapered spray 4 6 other modification techniques in addition to the conventional modification means mentioned above there are many other means techniques such as spray coating core shell exchange electrochemical deposition assisted etching rapid thermal deposition etc have also been used to construct membranes with super wetting properties 105 106 spraying technology is widely used in various substrates because the morphology of the substrate does not limit it the coating is uniformly sprayed on the surface of the substrate by a spray gun and a separation membrane with excellent performance is obtained after drying the prepared coating is evenly sprayed on the surface of the substrate with a spray gun and a separation membrane with excellent performance is obtained after drying hong and li constructed a superhydrophobic composite coating by combining epoxy resin and mof particles which can be easily fixed to the surface of various substrates with a spray gun to obtain super hydrophobicity 107 the appeal of the shell ligand exchange reaction is that the nanoparticle morphology and the construction of the optimized selective layer can be performed separately in the study of taniike and chammingkwan the prepared zif 8 solution was mixed with 2 methylimidazole and triethylamine and then the shell ligand exchange reaction was carried out and the hydrophilicity was converted to the hydrophobicity the superhydrophobic membrane was finally obtained by deposition 56 by electrospinning xu s team recently developed an etch assisted strategy to introduce zinc oxide zno nanoparticles on the membrane surface subsequent etching by hydrochloric acid hcl creates adsorption sites that serve as growth anchors for zif 71 crystals 108 among all the modification methods dip coating electrospinning sol gel processing and self assembly are the main modification methods for mof membranes to obtain super wettability and the operation process is relatively simple fig 13 however most modification methods face various difficulties and challenges when transferring from laboratory to industrial production applications 5 conclusion and outwork membrane separation technology is a crucial separation technology that meets the requirements of the times to sustainably alleviate environmental problems with low energy consumption and meet the needs of oil water separation in industrial production activities mofs with controllable surface and tunable chemical composition shows remarkable potential in oil water separation but bare granular mofs need to improve their stability and adjust the pore size for higher porosity and super wetting the introduction of mof nanoparticles into the surface of various substrates by different interfacial polymerization strategies such as in situ growth electrospinning and secondary growth electrochemical deposition is widely used although different modification strategies construct mof composite membranes with high sustainability and reusability to overcome the shortcomings of mofs some challenges limit the application first more and more technical means are used in the modification strategy however the degree of adhesion of the composite material needs to be verified to avoid loss of activity and secondary contamination for example fluorine containing reagents with low surface energy can often be used to construct superhydrophobic surfaces but fluoride significantly impacts the environment moreover when treating actual oily wastewater it is necessary to consider the reduction or loss of separation efficiency caused by membrane structure failure under complex conditions the widespread use of computational chemistry provides us with more verification methods to find adhesion through simulation and molecular modeling that can indicate the internal structure of composites providing important design guidance for the future synthesis of high performance composites more modeling based studies are needed to predict the critical properties of membranes to regulate the parameters of preparation and modification to obtain outstanding oil water separation membranes membrane contamination is an inevitable problem with membrane separation and mof membranes are no exception when treating actual oily wastewater the temperature acidity or alkalinity of oily wastewater produced by different oilfields or factories is not the same and the causes of membrane pollution are different the actual oily wastewater usually contains surfactants and organic compounds after a long period of use more contaminants deposited on the surface lead to scaling on the membrane surface and blockage of membrane holes resulting in reduced separation efficiency 110 the introduction of catalytic materials on the surface of the film and the degradation of pollutants deposited on the membrane will help restore the flux of the membrane and solve the problem of easy contamination of the membrane 111 thanks to the extremely high specific surface area and porosity of mofs materials mof membranes also have excellent adsorption and energy absorption for dyes in oily wastewater and mfos materials also have excellent photocatalytic capacity researchers have made mof membranes with photocatalytic self cleaning capabilities in some studies through in situ growth or vacuum assisted self assembly this type of photocatalytic self cleaning film not only saves cleaning water resources but also prolongs the service life of the membrane 112 113 in the past ten years the study of janus nanoparticles has attracted more and more attention introducing janus particles onto the separation membrane to prepare mof membranes with asymmetric wettability mof based janus membranes can then use their structure to demulsify and generate intrinsic driving forces thereby promoting the transport of matter and energy which is extremely beneficial for separating oil water emulsions the hydrophilic layer on the janus membrane has a rich site binding carboxyl group and a carbonyl group the rich hydrogen bond maintains the hydration layer to prevent oil droplets from adhesion existing studies are ideal for light oil separation in contrast the separation of soybean oil and crude oil with high viscosity requires an oil water separation membrane with a more oil resistant hydration layer the author believes that mof based hydrogel membranes have rich porosity dexterous and flexible structure and stability advantages in the solution environment to have significant advantages in the separation of strong viscous soybean oil silicone oil and even crude oil mof based hydrogels have superior water absorption and retention capabilities extremely high flux and degreasing rates and can restore flux through simple water washing with excellent stain resistance in addition changing the filtration method can also effectively extend the life of the filter membrane many researchers believe that the cross flow filtration method can reduce the risk of membrane contamination however the shear force generated by the lateral flow of oily sewage poses a challenge to the stability of mof material adhesion to the substrate mof membranes low cost large scale manufacturing is the main obstacle to its commercialization and industrialization as mentioned above the centralization of a large number of electrospinning equipment and modular arrangement can achieve large scale production but the cost is high blowspinning is an emerging technology that uses high speed airflow to stretch polymer solutions capable of producing fibers on a large scale at the micron or even nanometer scale 114 unlike electrospinning technology blow spinning technology replaces the high voltage electric field with pressurized gas as the driving force it uses various solution systems and collectors without conductivity requirements to replace the production process so far the blowspinning technology is not been widely used in film applications and there are still some problems however future blowing spinning has a good application prospect in the large scale manufacturing of mof membranes credit

12637,much oily wastewater containing emulsions are generated daily in various industrial processes such as petroleum and gas extraction petrochemical and mechanical processing if the oily wastewater is directly discharged it will issue a vast waste of water resources and increase environmental risks around the plant the efficient treatment and reuse of oily wastewater will achieve a win win situation of environmental protection and economy in the production of enterprises the pressure driven membrane separation technology can easily and quickly realize the separation of oil and water under the condition of low energy consumption it stands out from all kinds of high energy consumption and complex technologies super wettable membranes are brilliant in treating oily wastewater especially separating emulsions with small particle sizes metal organic frameworks mofs are nanomaterials that can be tailored on demand and their tunable surface structures and chemical compositions exhibit extraordinary potential for super wetting modification therefore this review explains the mechanism of membrane separation of the oil water mixture from the surface wettability theory and pore sieving theory and then summarizes the preparation methods developed for mofs membranes in recent years based on this mof membranes modification strategies in the oil water separation field are mainly introduced and the mainstream modification methods are discussed and evaluated finally it provides ideas for modifying mof membranes in oil water separation and puts forward the challenges and difficulties that mof membranes will face when applied to oil containing membranes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords oil water separation membrane separation technology metal organic framework membrane special wettability modification strategy data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with the awakening of human environmental awareness more attention has been paid to the disposal of oily wastewater in production and life although the traditional oil water separation technology such as gravity separation flotation separation electrochemical adsorption separation biodegradation or a combination of multiple methods for multi stage processing affects oil water separation 1 5 however in the process of oily wastewater treatment the traditional separation technology has many difficulties ample floor space 6 high operational cost 7 long retention time and energy consumption 8 9 therefore improving the traditional oil water separation technology is of far reaching significance in improving its separation efficiency 10 membrane separation technology is recognized as one of the most promising oil water separation technologies based on the advantages of membrane separation technology such as simple equipment low energy consumption no phase change and good selectivity it stands out from all kinds of separation technologies remarkably the special wettability membrane exhibits extraordinary performance and it has attracted the attention of many scholars in oil water emulsions 11 the core of membrane separation technology is a membrane with selective permeation capability by applying a driving force such as concentration difference pressure difference or potential difference etc on both sides of the membrane the components on the raw material side selectively permeate the membrane to achieve the purpose of separation and purification 12 therefore the excellent membrane material is the key to the entire membrane separation process various types of membrane material such as polymer membranes inorganic ceramic membranes and new nano membranes have been thoroughly studied and applied to the treatment of oily wastewater 13 15 in the past ten years polymer membranes have been in a stage of rapid development various polymer membranes perform excellent gas separation seawater desalination and petrochemical separation although polymer membranes show higher permeability and selectivity there is still a gap compared with cutting edge ion and molecular channel membranes currently the evaluation of its performance is mainly in the laboratory under controlled conditions and its separation performance needs further research in the face of complex organic wastewater with high salt and ph compared with polymer membranes ceramic membranes have significant advantages such as high stability long service life and high flux but the high manufacturing cost of ceramic membranes has lost the price oriented market 16 in addition to the high cost ceramic membranes also have problems such as high brittleness and low elasticity of inorganic materials which bring certain difficulties to the molding and processing of membranes and component equipment 17 the new type of nano membrane is to incorporate nanoparticle materials such as mofs materials nanometer metal oxides etc on polymer membranes ceramic membranes or metal mesh membranes and adjust the microstructure and chemical composition of the membrane surface to obtain super wetting properties with the progress of nanotechnology the new nano membranes not only overcomes the shortcoming of poor anti fouling of polymer membranes and inorganic ceramic membranes but also constructs rough surface and graft hydrophilic or lipophilic groups on the membrane surface according to the unique structure and physical and chemical properties of nano materials which contributes to the improvement of oil water separation efficiency 18 the oil water separation membrane is based on the difference in the wettability of the oil phase and the water phase on the membrane surface in the wastewater compared with other kinds of separation membranes the new nano membrane has significant advantages in improving the wetting ability and selective permeability of the oil phase or water phase on the separation membrane surface by constructing the membrane surface with special surface wettability 19 in recent years the mof membrane has been considered a new vital nano membrane that has attracted much attention metal organic frameworks mofs are crystalline porous materials with a periodic network structure that are self assembled by central metal ions bridged by organic ligands 20 mofs have the advantages of large specific surface area tunable pores numerous exposed active sites and excellent optical properties so researchers have loaded mofs onto the surface of separation membranes or prepared pure mof membranes 21 23 the combination of mof material and membrane can be a good trade off between the choice of membrane permeability and membrane flux to obtain a separation membrane with excellent performance among the reviews in recent years some summarize the synthesis strategies of mof membranes some summarize the application of a single type of mof and its derivatives in oil water separation and some emphasize the relationship between the properties and structures of mofs 24 26 in this review we will briefly explain the mechanism of oil water separation summarize the latest preparation methods of metal organic framework membranes and discuss the modification strategies of metal organic framework membranes in detail to help solve the problems of membrane fouling and clogging it focuses on applying metal organic framework membranes in oil water separation especially the application status and development direction of metal organic framework membranes in difficult to separate oil water emulsions finally the aim is to provide a theoretical and feasible basis for the large scale application of mof membranes in oil water separation and the modification of mof membranes 2 oil water separation mechanism the premise of the efficient treatment of oily wastewater is to analyze the mechanism of membrane separation of oily wastewater and the physical and chemical properties the diameter of oil droplets in the oily wastewater can be divided into four categories free state dispersed state emulsified state and dissolved state as seen in table 1 the oil droplets in the free and dispersed states have large particle sizes and the oil and water phases are layered which are easy to separate and recycle however a mass of emulsified and dissolved oil which is a few microns or less is produced in the modern industry 27 the oil droplets and water phase form a stable homogeneous system which is difficult to separate by conventional means it is the key and difficult point that is separated the oil phase from stable emulsified and dissolved oil in the study of oil water separation 28 the separation of oil water emulsion and dissolved oil is a difficult point in the field of oil water separation and efficient oil water emulsion separation technology and dissolved oil separation technology need to be developed urgently the oil water mixture separates on the membrane surface which can be seen as a unique wetting behavior adjusting membrane surface porosity and structuring the unique wettability surface are considered the most promising approaches to achieving the purpose of efficient oil water separation 2 1 sieving principle the separation mechanism of the oil water separation membrane is similar to that of filtration therefore different types of separation membranes are selected according to the oil droplet size to deal with oily wastewater in different states at present according to the membrane pore size it can be divided into four types of separation membranes microfiltration membrane mf ultrafiltration uf membrane nanofiltration nf membrane and reverse osmosis ro membrane 26 in the process of oil water separation the particle size of the oil phase is the basis for selecting oil water separation membranes free and dispersed oils are usually separated using microfiltration membranes it is better to use an ultrafiltration membrane and nanofiltration membrane for emulsified oil separation dissolved oils must be treated with reverse osmosis membranes with smaller pore sizes the smaller the pore size of the membrane the lower the membrane flux but the stronger the membrane selectivity in one study they chose a ssm with a large pore size to handle a simple oil water mixture and a ssm with a small pore size as a substrate for the preparation of mof membranes to separate oil water emulsions 29 in general the flux of a separation membrane is negatively correlated with the selective separation capacity 30 balancing the contradiction between high flux and high selectivity is the key to solving the application barriers of oil water separation membranes according to the principle of membrane pore screening the oil droplet can be retained as long as the pore size of the oil water separation membrane is smaller than the diameter of the oil droplet when the oleophilic membrane achieves the separation effect the oily wastewater flows through the surface of the membrane and the oil droplets condense on the surface of the pore wall to form large droplets which pass through the membrane pores under the action of the driving force to achieve oil water separation the results of oil water separation only relying on the pores are not satisfactory 2 2 membrane wetting model it can be seen that membrane separation is mainly based on the wettability of the membrane surface to separate the oil phase and the water phases 31 wettability refers to the existence of two immiscible liquids the ability of the liquid to first wet the surface of the solid phase that is the ability or tendency of a liquid to spread on a solid surface the wettability of the membrane surface is usually measured by the liquid phase s static contact angle θ 32 when the contact angle of the droplet on the separation membrane surface satisfies the inequality 0 θ 90 the surface is hydrophilic or lipophilic if the droplets cannot wet the membrane surface the contact angle satisfies the inequality 90 θ 180 33 fig 1 two centuries ago scientist thomas young studied droplets on rigid solid surfaces with smooth surfaces uniform chemical composition and perfect ideals under the above conditions the contact angle is determined by the surface tension of the solid liquid gas three phase equilibrium point in the horizontal direction young s equation eq 1 is derived according to the mechanical equilibrium conditions 1 γ sg γ sl γ lg cos θ 1 2 derivative type cos θ 1 γ sl γ sg γ lg where is solid gas interface tension is solid liquid interface tension is liquid gas interface tension is contact angle from eq 2 it can be concluded that young s equation is the basic way to wet solid surfaces and the smaller the contact angle the better the wettability however since yang s equation does not consider the correction of the actual environment and condition parameters of the experiment it is only suitable for the plane under ideal conditions and the solid surfaces in practice are mostly rough and defective and the application of the yang s equation is limited in 1936 wenzel corrected young s equation taking into account the inherent defects of the solid surface and a certain roughness and adsorbed certain impurities introducing a roughness factor r to indicate the roughness size wenzel believes that when the liquid is in contact with the solid surface the liquid completely infiltrates the surface gap only the solid liquid contact and proposes a modified model according to the principle of free energy invariance and three phase tension virtual work is zero derived wenzel s equation eq 3 3 γ lg cos θ 2 r γ sg γ sl where r is roughness factor defined as the ratio of the true area of a rough surface to the projected area on the horizontal area antennae measurement of liquids on the surface of the rough surface is obstructed but can be deduced eq 4 4 cos θ 2 rcos θ 1 we can draw the following conclusions since r 1 when contact angle θ 1 90 rcosθ1 0 θ 2 increases with r meaning that for hydrophobic surfaces increasing roughness increases hydrophobicity conversely when θ 1 90 rcosθ1 0 θ 2 decreases with the increase of r which means that for hydrophilic surfaces the roughness increases and the hydrophilicity is also enhanced with the advancement of interface science it has been found that hydrophilic materials can also be used to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces and the wenzel model cannot give a reasonable explanation for its defects cassie and baxter further expanded and revised the wenzel model when the liquid wets the solid surface the liquid does not completely occupy the gap on the rough surface and there is still gas on the wet surface forming a solid liquid gas three phase composite interface also based on the principle that the total free energy of the system is invariant and the three phase interface tension is zero the cassie baxter equation eq 5 is derived 5 cos θ f 1 cos θ 1 f 2 cos θ 2 where θ is contact angle f 1 and f 2 represent the total surface area occupied by composite medium 1 and composite medium 2 f 1 f 2 1 θ 1 and θ 2 is corresponding media contact angle when the medium is air the liquid contact angle is 180 and eq 5 simplifies eq 6 6 cos θ f 1 cos θ 1 1 1 it is known that 0 f 1 1 so cosθ cos θ 1 when the f 1 approaches 0 the composite medium is mainly an air medium regardless of the positive and negative and magnitude of the cosθ 1 values cosθ intends to 1 the composite surface is in a superhydrophobic state when the f 1 approaches 1 the composite interface is mainly a solid medium cosθ close to cosθ 1 so f 1 has a decisive effect on the angle of contact similarly due to the rough surface of the solid it is necessary to introduce a roughness factor r to derive the eq 7 7 cos θ r f 1 cos θ 1 f 1 1 when f 1 approaches 1 the equation tends to wenzel s equation when f 1 approaches 0 the equation tends to the cassie baxter equation indicating that the two can be converted to each other the cassie baxter model reacts more realistically with the wetting of liquids and rough surfaces by analyzing the basic theoretical models of surface wettability such as young s model wenzel s model cassie baxter model it is shown that surface structures are significant for wettability of solid surfaces 34 many researchers follow the guidance of wetting models to design mof films with unique wetting surfaces 35 in dan zhao s research superhydrophobic surfaces were obtained by synthesizing zr mof on the surface of ssm in situ through a combination of simulation and experiment they proved that the nanostructure of mof on the membrane surface significantly enhances the hydrophobicity of the membrane 36 the selectivity of the separation membrane can be comprehended as special wettability the essence of oil water separation is to use the distinction in surface energy between the oil phase and the water phase fig 2 therefore the selective separation principle of oil water separation membranes can also be explained by the wettability of solid surfaces in the oil water separation process the liquid phase with a stronger affinity to the membrane will form a pure liquid layer on the membrane surface when the oily wastewater flows through the membrane surface if a hydrophilic membrane is used to separate oily wastewater the water phase will spread on the membrane surface inducing water droplets to pass through the membrane pores while the oil droplets aggregates on the membrane surface and cannot pass through to achieve the purpose of separation and vice versa 2 3 membrane permeation theory both the pore size and wettability control the oil water separation efficiency of the separation membrane if the liquid wants to immerse in the membrane a hydrostatic pressure must be applied to make it greater than the minimum feed liquid entry pressure to achieve oil water separation liquid entry pressure lep is an inherent feature of each membrane it can be determined to be lep associated with the surface tension of the liquid phase the size of the contact angle of the liquid phase at the porosity and the shape and size of the membrane pores lep values are usually described in the young laplace equation eq 8 8 p 2 σ cos θ r where σ is liquid tension θ is contact angle r is pore size of the membrane in general the lep value increases with the increase of the contact angle and surface tension and decreases with the decrease of the pore size however other factors may affect the lep value such as membrane surface adjustment of organic inorganic compounds thereby reducing the surface tension to reduce the lep value as can be seen from laplace s equation the separation efficiency is affected by both membrane wettability and membrane pore radius in conclusion membrane separation technology can realize the separation of various types of oily wastewater by adjusting the membrane s pore size or changing the membrane surface s affinity metal organic frameworks have tunable pore structures and surface ligand groups that can easily change wettability which have bright application prospects in oil water separation 3 synthesis of mof membranes metal framework materials compounds by yaghi s research group have attracted widespread attention since they were first synthesized and researchers have developed various mofs 38 compared with traditional materials mof materials have a larger specific surface area and more developed specific pore structure so they have more excellent separation ability however the application of powdered mof materials is minimal fisher s team loaded the powder onto the membrane s surface for the first time and successfully prepared a mof 5 membrane which opened the research on mof membranes 39 nowadays mof membranes have been widely used in separation 40 catalysis 41 sensing 42 metal protection and other fields 43 and an increased number of synthesis methods have been developed 26 modification strategies based on synthetic methods are the only way to obtain excellent separation membrane materials next we will analyze and compare the synthesis methods of mof membranes in recent years table 2 shows some of the research on applying mof membranes in oil water separation over the past five years the water stability of mofs is a critical factor in whether they can be applied to water treatment good water stability can maintain the continuous and efficient separation of the membrane while preventing secondary pollution leaching of metal ions table 2 shows that most of the main categories of mof in the field of oil water separation include uio 66 zif 8 mil 100 fe mil 101 fe or al mil 125 ti hkust 1 etc nowadays there are three strategies to improve mof water stability enhance coordination bond strength reduce water contact with mof subjects and increase ligand rigidity the highly charged metal ions can form strong coordination bonds with the carboxylate ligand and the resulting zr mof uio 66 which has exceptionally high stability and is modified by amination to obtain uio 66 nh2 for the preparation of superhydrophobic surfaces in order to reduce the contact of water with the mof body it is necessary to modify or directly introduce hydrophobic groups after synthesis zif 8 is a typical example using hydrophobic imidazole as a ligand so it is also often used to prepare hydrophobic interfaces compared with flexible ligands rigid ligands tend to maintain the configuration of mofs resulting in higher deformation barriers the commonly used or promising mof materials have one or more of the three types of conditions with good water stability used in the field of oil water separation 3 1 in situ growth method currently there are two ways to obtain mof membranes one is to grow the mof layer on the membrane substrate and the other is to mix the synthesized mof particles with organic matter to form the membrane 79 the in situ growth method uses the crystallization process of mof materials to immerse the porous substrate in a uniformly mixed reaction mother liquor to grow mofs on the surface of the substrate directly with the advancement of preparation technology to make up for the shortcomings of the in situ growth method the modified substrate synthesis and the same metal source method have been developed based on the direct synthesis method table 3 shows the advantages and disadvantages of the three original growth methods 3 2 second growth method the secondary growth method is also called the seed growth method the nucleation and growth of mof crystals are carried out separately during the synthesis process of the mof membranes first a seed layer is formed by seeding a crystal seed on the substrate by deposition coating etc and the substrate on which the seed is grown is placed in a solution of metal ions and organic ligands to grow a mof membrane this method can solve the complex problem of heterogeneous nucleation and settle the problem of low nucleation rate on the surface of the substrate thereby improving the membrane growth quality and the separation performance of the mof membrane the properties of the mof membranes prepared by secondary growth have apparent correlations with the seed crystal size the seed crystal thickness and the bonding strength between the seed crystal layer and the substrate seeding on the substrate material can be carried out by various means such as rubbing coating seeding dip coating thermal seeding distribution seeding electrospinning and the like fig 3 shows a typical seed layer preparation method for the base class 3 3 electrochemical growth method electrochemical fabrication methods usually include five strategies anodic deposition cathodic deposition conversion electro synthesized mof precursor electrophoretic deposition and electric displacement 80 the structure of the grown mof membrane can be adjusted by adjusting factors such as potential deposition temperature time substrate solvent ratio etc 79 both anodic deposition and cathodic deposition utilize the transfer of electrons in the electric field and the oxidation or reduction reaction occurs at the corresponding electrode to guide the growth of mofs crystals on the electrode fig 4 this method conversion electro synthesized mof precursor is advantageous to grow crystals of mofs in specific orientations electrophoretic deposition is a method to deposit charged mof crystals on a conductive substrate under the action of an electric field force to form a mof membrane electro displacement utilizes metal reducibility to displace the desired metal ion cross linking ligand on the substrate surface to form a mof membrane the electrochemical manufacturing method is easy to operate fast in reaction mild in reaction conditions and has the prospect of large scale preparation the reaction conditions for electrochemical manufacturing of mof membranes are mild and straightforward to operate which is conducive to scale up production however in the process of electrochemistry various by products will be formed and the complex reaction mechanism is challenging to control the growth direction such as the growth of mofs that can be directed will be highly beneficial to oil water separation 3 4 liquid phase epitaxy the epitaxial growth of mof onto surfaces provides a suitable means for mof deposition contacting 81 the substrate is repeatedly immersed in the metal solution and organic ligand solution required for mof crystal growth and the mof membrane is grown at room temperature the layer by layer growth method is similar to the step by step seeding method in the secondary growth method the substrate is repeatedly dipped into a solution of metal ions and organic ligands to precisely control the growth thickness of the membrane finally the excess reaction solution is washed away with a suitable solvent liquid phase epitaxy relies on discontinuous crystallization processes to precisely control the thickness of mof membranes and mild reaction conditions are ideal for large scale fabrication of mof membranes 3 5 synthetic mixed matrix membranes compared with a pure mof membrane a mixed matrix membrane can break through the choice of substrate and greatly enhance the separation performance of the membrane 82 the mixed matrix method is divided into the direct mixing method and the post synthesis modification method the direct mixing method is to disperse the synthesized powdery mof material into a polymer solution to form a stable suspension and coat it on the substrate to form mof membranes which can also be coated onto non porous substrates and peeled off after drying to form free standing mof membranes the post synthesis modification method reduces the agglomeration of mof powder or grafts and some other functional groups to obtain excellent performance by surface modification of the synthesized mof materials mixed matrix membranes greatly enrich the types of mof membranes and suitable substrate materials can be selected according to the environment to prepare functionalized separation membranes table 4 4 modification of mof membranes for oil water separation the basic membrane material has a particular oil water separation effect but to efficiently treat oily wastewater the membrane material needs to be modified it is well known that the substrates of mof membranes are various different modification methods will be used to achieve the goal for different base membranes or to obtain different wettability it is well known that the substrates of mof membranes are various and commonly used including metal meshes organic polymer membranes or other types of membrane like substrates nevertheless controlling the surface microstructure and chemical composition is the key to obtaining an efficient separation membrane different substrate materials require different modification methods to obtain the designed properties to separate oil and water next the modification measures adopted in recent years will be summarized 4 1 dip coating technique it is an objective fact that dip coating technology is the most widely used method in the surface modification of mof membranes usually some modification or purification of the membrane substrate itself is carried out prior to modification organosilanes are often used in dip coating modification techniques as hydrophobic coatings a typical instance is that du et al synthesized a hydrophilic hkust 1 coating on the surface of foamed copper mesh by electrochemical method and immersed it in a chloroform solution of 1h 1h 2h 2h perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane fas 17 to obtain a hydrophobic surface foamed copper mesh modified with organosilane realizes the rapid separation of the oil water mixture and obtains a separation efficiency of 96 which is still maintained after multiple cycles 64 modified copper foam mesh exhibits excellent reusability in addition to fas 17 polydimethylsiloxane pdms is one of the most widely used organosilane hydrophobic modifiers today and various substrates obtain low surface energy after being immersed in pdms solution for instance inspired by other researchers gao s research team developed a technology that can produce hydrophobic surfaces on different substrates 83 their preparation strategy requires no additional particles and is fluorine free and water rich they systematically explored the optimal ratio of tetrahydrofuran thf to water to obtain the best hydrophobic surface and explained the effect of material ratio on hydrophobic performance when only tetrahydrofuran was used as the pdms solvent the dip coating solution did not produce emulsion droplets with the increase of water content the emulsion droplets and particle size increased furthermore when the volume ratio of tetrahydrofuran to water is 3 7 the number of emulsion droplets reaches the maximum when the volume ratio of thf to water is 1 9 the emulsion is more dispersed and the droplets are larger fig 5 the results show that when more diminutive and more emulsion droplets are obtained greater roughness can be imparted to the substrate resulting in the best hydrophobic surface in addition zhu et al used a simple in situ growth process to grow a large number of cu mof particles on the surface of copper mesh and immersed them in pdms solution to obtain a superhydrophobic surface unlike others they used dibutyltin dilaurate and tetraethylorthosilicate as curing agents for pdms instead of the commonly used tetrahydrofuran however the modified copper mesh maintains a separation efficiency of about 96 for high viscosity oil water mixture and 99 for low viscosity oil 84 in brief dip coating technology is easy to operate without the use of expensive equipment and equipment to build surfaces with special wettability on a flat surface especially in the modification of organic polymer coatings 4 2 electrospinning technology electrospinning technology adjusts the structural characteristics of the prepared membranes including pore size thickness diameter and porosity by controlling the parameters of the spinning equipment 85 however there are many ways to modify membrane materials in the electrospinning process including direct electrospinning growth of mof crystals on the spinning membrane simultaneous electrospinning etc however direct electrospinning is the most widely used in modifying oil water separation membranes 86 in a study the team of jiang et al mixed uio 66 nh2 into a dmf solution of polyacrylonitrile pan with sufficient stirring and synthesized a mixed mechanism membrane by direct electrospinning 87 they also explored the effect of polymer concentration on the electrospinning process they found that low polymer concentrations caused disintegration and discontinuity in the electrospinning fiber process while when the polymer concentration was higher than 10 and above it would not happen furthermore with the increase of polymerization concentration the diameter of spun fibers also increases enhancing the whole membrane s mechanical strength the same year chen et al also loaded mof 808 onto pan fibers utilizing direct electrospinning 88 moreover disodium edetate edta was used to replace the formate in the mof crystal to endow the modified membrane with a more robust metal ion adsorption performance in addition zhu et al took another strategy to load mof crystals onto electrospun membranes 72 the nano sized mof crystals effectively enhance the membrane s superb wettability and underwater superoleophobicity the polyacrylonitrile fiber membrane was synthesized by electrospinning technology the pan membrane was hydrolyzed by sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid and the cyano groups in polyacrylonitrile were replaced with carboxyl groups fig 6 the pan membrane was hydrolyzed by sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid and the cyano groups in polyacrylonitrile were replaced to carboxyl groups to enhance antifouling ability of the separation membrane the development of electrospinning technology has broken through the barriers to mof crystal application membrane materials promoting the dispersion of mofs and maintaining high adsorption 89 in summary electrospinning technology breaks through the limitations of mof particles integrates the particle like mof into the fiber and further prepares a stable mof membrane under precise control to separate the oily wastewater the centralized management and modular arrangement of many electrospinning equipments can realize the unified control of mof membrane working conditions and processes which is conducive to large scale production 4 3 sol gel processing sol gel processing is widely used in ceramic materials and has been proven to be a general strategy to obtain controllable surface and organization structure which can be well used in the surface modification process of mof membranes 90 sol gel processing can provide new chemical reaction sites inside and outside the pores of mof help the grafted chemical functional groups add new chemical functions and localize the growth of mof crystals on the surface of inorganic materials 91 sol gel processing transforms powdered mofs into higher structures thin membranes or monoliths increasing their applicability and enhancing some of their properties the pore channel of mof crystal is a crucial structure to realize the functions of separation and catalysis it is an important method to adjust the performance of mof by regulating the pore structure of mof crystal 92 to not destroy the whole frame of mof material the modification after synthesis avoids the risk of modification sol gel processing can penetrate the pores based on preserving the original architecture adjusting the structure of the pores and providing functionalized reaction sites in one study the stability of mofs in water was improved with little impact on the pore specific surface area of mofs materials 93 using long aliphatic chains on oligomeric silsesquioxanes cu3 btc 2 was rendered hydrophobic and verified by depositing it on a flat plate to measure its contact angle after various analytical tests only slight changes in the pore volume and specific surface area of mofs were observed after modification with oligomeric silsesquioxanes and on the surface the researchers also carried out surface selective modification of other kinds of mofs in the same way and still successfully proved that this is a general and promising modification method fig 7 in addition to the micro scale sol gel processing which can be grafted on the crystal surface the sol gel process can also be used to construct high structure mofs at the macro scale in a recent study cheng et al used pva to support ni fe modified mofs uniformly used ultrasound to remove air bubbles poured the solution into a mold and obtained composite hydrogels after five freeze thaw cycles 94 finally the stainless steel mesh was immersed in the hydrogel for 10 min then taken out and placed in an oven for half an hour to obtain the hydrogel coated mesh the as prepared mof combined with pva coated membranes obtained super hydrophilic and underwater super oleophobic capabilities the separation effect of the oil water mixture is 99 and the separation efficiency of a light oil in water emulsion which is difficult to separate is also 98 and the membrane flux is also ideal fig 8 in short when applying sol gel processing technology to modify mof membranes the chemical composition and microstructure of the surface can be easily controlled to obtain a super wettable surface 4 4 vacuum assisted self assembly process the vacuum assisted self assembly process is a facile method to introduce chemical groups and deposit nanomaterials on the surface of polymer membranes 95 this strategy not only can adjust the microstructure of the surface which is beneficial to obtaining the functional target membrane but also shows a broad prospect in the integration of organic and inorganic components to construct a homogeneous functional membrane with these advantages in oil water separation many researchers have introduced large hydrophilic groups and mof nanoparticles on the membrane surface through vacuum assisted self assembly techniques their efficient oil water separation performance has been widely verified based on the characteristics of highwater absorption and large specific surface area of mof particles to construct super wettable surfaces polyacrylic acid paa is a widely used adhesive and its abundant carboxyl functional groups have multiple functions which give the modified mof membrane better stability and stronger antifouling performance 96 in jiang s report the prepared nh2 uio 66 was mixed with ultrasonic waves and it was easy to agglomerate and dispersed unevenly when deposited on the surface of the membrane alone 78 after adding paa as a binder in the solution its dispersibility in water was significantly improved in addition the abundant carboxyl groups on the surface of paa can combine with the amino groups on the amino modified uio 66 nh2 crystals to form amide groups which can fix the mof particles on the surface of the membrane and improve the abrasion resistance of the membrane it is also due to the abundant carboxyl groups on paa which can consume alkalinity in an alkaline environment and wrap on mof crystals from damage they also tested the membrane surface potential and found that the negative charge of the membrane is beneficial to stabilizing the hydration layer of the membrane and enhancing its oil repellency yu s research team also used the same technique to immobilize amino modified mil 125 with paa as an adhesive and obtained similar conclusions fig 9 at the same time yu also paid attention to the negative charge carried on the surface of the membrane and found that the modified membrane also has an excellent separation effect on cationic dyes and the membrane can handle oil water emulsions containing dyes in recent years graphene oxide go is a representative two dimensional nanomaterial with high mechanical strength and controllable chemical surface which has been widely used in separation fields such as gas purification and desalination 97 98 its natural hydrophilicity has attracted attention in the oil water field but the interlayer distance is usually 2 nm which limits its separation efficiency in macromolecular pollutants 99 the vacuum assisted self assembly process can easily embed stable nanoparticles between go nanosheets expand the interlayer distance and enhance the wetting performance fig 10 based on the excellent performance and tunable chemical surface and morphological characteristics of mof materials they are suitable candidates as membrane intercalation materials in 2020 jiang proposed in a study that the prepared go and mof dispersions were filtered onto a mixed cellulose membrane mce in a vacuum environment and dried to form a composite membrane 100 compared with only depositing go on the surface the pure water flux of the mof embedded membranes was increased by seven times nonetheless the proportion of nanomaterials was explored to balance the separation efficiency and ensure the membrane surface s stability finally the pure water flux of the most suitable composite membrane was reduced to 3333 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the rejection rate of the oil water emulsion was above 99 5 mxene is another interesting two dimensional nanomaterial first reported by gogotis and barsoum in 2011 101 in recent research reports its natural hydrophilicity shows broad research prospects in oil water separation and dye removal similar to traditional two dimensional nano the interlayer spacing of mxene is also 2 nm hence the membrane s selective permeability and separation efficiency also need to be weighed fig 11 inserting nanoparticles in the interlayer is a practical modification method inspired by predecessors zhan s team inserted carboxyl modified uio 66 nanoparticles between mxene nanosheets using vacuum self assembly technology a composite membrane that can effectively separate oil water emulsions in a complex environment was successfully formed on a supported membrane in the latest study in order to overcome the limitations of mxene pu et al also inserted stable tannic acid modified zif 8 nanoparticles between the layers which significantly improved the membrane s pollution resistance and reuse ability 77 the vacuum assisted self assembly strategy can quickly load mof nanoparticles onto the membrane surface to control the membrane surface s chemical composition and morphological structure when using the adhesive at the same time this strategy can also help in embedding mof nanoparticles into 2d nanomaterials the embedded mof nanoparticles widen the permeation channel enhance the roughness of the surface and improve the overall anti swelling ability of the membrane in general vacuum assisted self assembly technology can easily insert mof particles into two dimensional layered materials to form uniform intercalation expand layer spacing and improve the permeability of the separation membrane by introducing a functionalized mof material the wealthy hydrophilic groups on it significantly improve the film s resistance to contamination and provide a fast water transfer path 4 5 electrospray technology electrospray technology is a novel membrane preparation technology that has been used for many years before it was widely used in biomedical encapsulation and drug transportation as well as in the deposition of metal coatings of controlled thickness 102 electrospinning uses a high concentration of high viscosity precursors to launch a continuous fine jet under the action of a high voltage electric field to solidify to form a nanofiber polymer electrospray technology is to apply high pressure to the low viscosity and low concentration of the precursor liquid in the nozzle so that the liquid has a large charge inside 103 when the liquid leaves the nozzle the electrostatic force interacts with the surface tension and disperses into smaller droplets when the potential between the substrate and the nozzle is high enough the crescent surface of the droplets generated by the nozzle tip will become conical and eventually quickly evaporate and crystallize on the surface of the substrate to form a membrane structure the uniformity thickness roughness pore size and porosity of the membrane can be controlled by adjusting the electrospray parameters thereby affecting the selectivity and permeability of the membrane fig 12 in the study of jinsoo kim s team zif 7 film was deposited on the surface of a circular alumina substrate using electrospray technology 104 obtaining a stable tapered spray was a difficult point in electrospray technology and the team reduced the optimization difficulty by fixing the fluid characteristics concentration and solvent and the size of the nozzle and finally obtained a stable conical spray by regulating the voltage applied on the nozzle and the flow rate of the fluid in addition comparing the time scales of the formation of zif 7 crystals using electrospray and solvothermal methods it is inferred that short solved evaporation can form stable crystals rather than thermal effects therefore the key to influencing electrospray mof film molding is to control the appropriate solvent evaporation rate to obtain a continuous and stable film structure the substrate temperature is too high and the solvent evaporates too quickly resulting in discontinuous crystal molding unable to form a continuous mof film on the contrary the substrate temperature is insufficient and the solvent will wet the substrate surface and penetrate the interior which can not form enough crystals the use of electrospray technology increases the reduction of synthesis time and the consumption of the precursor compared with the traditional dipping technology the film prepared by electrospray technology has the advantages of a more uniform structure faster polymerization material saving and zero waste discharge simple direct spraying also has good prospects in amplifying production while electrospray technology has many advantages more research is needed on how fluids of different properties can form a stable tapered spray 4 6 other modification techniques in addition to the conventional modification means mentioned above there are many other means techniques such as spray coating core shell exchange electrochemical deposition assisted etching rapid thermal deposition etc have also been used to construct membranes with super wetting properties 105 106 spraying technology is widely used in various substrates because the morphology of the substrate does not limit it the coating is uniformly sprayed on the surface of the substrate by a spray gun and a separation membrane with excellent performance is obtained after drying the prepared coating is evenly sprayed on the surface of the substrate with a spray gun and a separation membrane with excellent performance is obtained after drying hong and li constructed a superhydrophobic composite coating by combining epoxy resin and mof particles which can be easily fixed to the surface of various substrates with a spray gun to obtain super hydrophobicity 107 the appeal of the shell ligand exchange reaction is that the nanoparticle morphology and the construction of the optimized selective layer can be performed separately in the study of taniike and chammingkwan the prepared zif 8 solution was mixed with 2 methylimidazole and triethylamine and then the shell ligand exchange reaction was carried out and the hydrophilicity was converted to the hydrophobicity the superhydrophobic membrane was finally obtained by deposition 56 by electrospinning xu s team recently developed an etch assisted strategy to introduce zinc oxide zno nanoparticles on the membrane surface subsequent etching by hydrochloric acid hcl creates adsorption sites that serve as growth anchors for zif 71 crystals 108 among all the modification methods dip coating electrospinning sol gel processing and self assembly are the main modification methods for mof membranes to obtain super wettability and the operation process is relatively simple fig 13 however most modification methods face various difficulties and challenges when transferring from laboratory to industrial production applications 5 conclusion and outwork membrane separation technology is a crucial separation technology that meets the requirements of the times to sustainably alleviate environmental problems with low energy consumption and meet the needs of oil water separation in industrial production activities mofs with controllable surface and tunable chemical composition shows remarkable potential in oil water separation but bare granular mofs need to improve their stability and adjust the pore size for higher porosity and super wetting the introduction of mof nanoparticles into the surface of various substrates by different interfacial polymerization strategies such as in situ growth electrospinning and secondary growth electrochemical deposition is widely used although different modification strategies construct mof composite membranes with high sustainability and reusability to overcome the shortcomings of mofs some challenges limit the application first more and more technical means are used in the modification strategy however the degree of adhesion of the composite material needs to be verified to avoid loss of activity and secondary contamination for example fluorine containing reagents with low surface energy can often be used to construct superhydrophobic surfaces but fluoride significantly impacts the environment moreover when treating actual oily wastewater it is necessary to consider the reduction or loss of separation efficiency caused by membrane structure failure under complex conditions the widespread use of computational chemistry provides us with more verification methods to find adhesion through simulation and molecular modeling that can indicate the internal structure of composites providing important design guidance for the future synthesis of high performance composites more modeling based studies are needed to predict the critical properties of membranes to regulate the parameters of preparation and modification to obtain outstanding oil water separation membranes membrane contamination is an inevitable problem with membrane separation and mof membranes are no exception when treating actual oily wastewater the temperature acidity or alkalinity of oily wastewater produced by different oilfields or factories is not the same and the causes of membrane pollution are different the actual oily wastewater usually contains surfactants and organic compounds after a long period of use more contaminants deposited on the surface lead to scaling on the membrane surface and blockage of membrane holes resulting in reduced separation efficiency 110 the introduction of catalytic materials on the surface of the film and the degradation of pollutants deposited on the membrane will help restore the flux of the membrane and solve the problem of easy contamination of the membrane 111 thanks to the extremely high specific surface area and porosity of mofs materials mof membranes also have excellent adsorption and energy absorption for dyes in oily wastewater and mfos materials also have excellent photocatalytic capacity researchers have made mof membranes with photocatalytic self cleaning capabilities in some studies through in situ growth or vacuum assisted self assembly this type of photocatalytic self cleaning film not only saves cleaning water resources but also prolongs the service life of the membrane 112 113 in the past ten years the study of janus nanoparticles has attracted more and more attention introducing janus particles onto the separation membrane to prepare mof membranes with asymmetric wettability mof based janus membranes can then use their structure to demulsify and generate intrinsic driving forces thereby promoting the transport of matter and energy which is extremely beneficial for separating oil water emulsions the hydrophilic layer on the janus membrane has a rich site binding carboxyl group and a carbonyl group the rich hydrogen bond maintains the hydration layer to prevent oil droplets from adhesion existing studies are ideal for light oil separation in contrast the separation of soybean oil and crude oil with high viscosity requires an oil water separation membrane with a more oil resistant hydration layer the author believes that mof based hydrogel membranes have rich porosity dexterous and flexible structure and stability advantages in the solution environment to have significant advantages in the separation of strong viscous soybean oil silicone oil and even crude oil mof based hydrogels have superior water absorption and retention capabilities extremely high flux and degreasing rates and can restore flux through simple water washing with excellent stain resistance in addition changing the filtration method can also effectively extend the life of the filter membrane many researchers believe that the cross flow filtration method can reduce the risk of membrane contamination however the shear force generated by the lateral flow of oily sewage poses a challenge to the stability of mof material adhesion to the substrate mof membranes low cost large scale manufacturing is the main obstacle to its commercialization and industrialization as mentioned above the centralization of a large number of electrospinning equipment and modular arrangement can achieve large scale production but the cost is high blowspinning is an emerging technology that uses high speed airflow to stretch polymer solutions capable of producing fibers on a large scale at the micron or even nanometer scale 114 unlike electrospinning technology blow spinning technology replaces the high voltage electric field with pressurized gas as the driving force it uses various solution systems and collectors without conductivity requirements to replace the production process so far the blowspinning technology is not been widely used in film applications and there are still some problems however future blowing spinning has a good application prospect in the large scale manufacturing of mof membranes credit

12638,treating rural domestic sewage has always been a hard task for rural vitalization in china to overcome this problem high efficiency easy maintenance and low consumption treatment technologies are urgently needed to meet the requirements of rural sewage treatment a new combined bio ecological system was proposed in this study including the anoxic filter anf novel integrated guide plate rotating biological contactors nigprbc and constructed wetland cw key parameters of anf nigprbc system including hydraulic residence time hrt reflux ratio rr and rotational speed rs were identified founded on the organic matter and nitrogen removal performance for further application in addition the combined bio ecological system was lasted for the 90 days at optimal operating parameters to confirm its performance on pollutant removal the optimal operating parameters were determined to be 5 h hrtnigprbc 100 rr and 3 r min rs under the optimal operating parameters average 95 14 1 31 cod 79 07 4 32 tn 93 42 2 16 nh 4 n and 83 39 3 46 tp were removed during the 90 day operation the operating results of the combined bio ecological system indicate that the effluent meet local rural domestic wastewater pollution discharge standard the microbial community results also helped to better explain the process performance of the whole system by high throughput sequencing analysis proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phylum existing widely in this system denitrification related genera were abundant both in anf and cw overall the new combined bio ecological system is one of the priority choices for treating rural wastewater owing to its economic benefits integrated design concept and convenient operation keywords rural domestic sewage bio ecological system rotating biological contactors pollutant removal microbial communities data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction due to population growth and improved socio economic standards of living the increasing amount of household sewage is becoming one of the major environmental issues in rural china 1 for a long time domestic wastewater has been discharged directly without treatment in rural areas causing water quality degradation of rivers lakes and groundwater 2 3 in fact ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n total nitrogen tn chemical oxygen demand cod and total phosphorus tp indexes of water sources in most chinese rural areas have been demonstrated to exceed water quality standards 4 currently the sewage discharge standard in rural regions is becoming increasingly more stringent driven by the chinese national standards on modernization of agriculture and rural areas unlike urban domestic wastewater rural domestic wastewater is characterized by a vast range of distribution wide pollution scope a small amount of sewage and large variation coefficients for water quality and water quantity 5 6 therefore the municipal wastewater treatment model could not be applied to the treatment of rural domestic wastewater due to the enormous investment in pipe laying and decentralized wastewater collection according to the actual state of rural regions the adaptable processes for rural sewage treatment require small equipment size low investment easy maintenance and steady operation in order to improve the rural environment and reduce the pollution substantial efforts have been made to explore appropriate treatment technologies for rural domestic sewage some independent processes for rural sewage treatment such as subsurface wastewater infiltration system 7 aerobic membrane bioreactor 8 aerated filters 9 and stabilization ponds 10 and septic tanks 11 have been developed and applied in rural areas however these processes also suffer from operational problems for instance subsurface wastewater infiltration system and stabilization ponds are limited by the low hydraulic and organic load rates and require a high land footprint aerobic membrane bioreactor and aerated filters have high energy consumption and high maintenance costs that are not affordable in rural areas furthermore activated sludge processes are usually complex and need professional management that have limitations in sustainability for rural sewage treatment 12 rotating biological contactor rbc is a reliable biological treatment technology for decentralized village wastewater treatment owing to its anti load impact easy maintenance and small area 13 even though rbc is reliable they still have some challenges in terms of operating costs and stable nitrogen removal efficiency 14 compared to constructed wetlands technology rbc had a higher nh 4 n removal efficiency but higher energy costs 15 hence some advanced treatment reactors on modifying rbc configuration have been invented to further save the energy costs and improve the performance among the reactors are self rotating discs 16 net like rotating biological contactor 17 and multi stage waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors ms wdrbcs 18 the ms wdrbcs performed well on oxygenation and nitrification through rotation of discs and reoxygenation by dropping water with less energy costs and less space utilization 18 although the ms wdrbcs have been proven efficient performance several unsolved problems in term of the balance of driving force from waterwheels a large dead zone and excessive reactors in the above mentioned device remain to overcome these challenges the novel integrated guide plate rotating biological contractor nigprbc device has been designed to treat rural sewage the waterwheel driving rotation disks were installed in the middle of the disks to maintain driving force balance and reduce energy consumption in addition the rbc was divided into six adjacent compartments with up flow or down flow in each compartment to optimize the hydraulic flow pattern this provides a better environment for microbial growth and enhances the microbial activity per unit of reactor volume therefore the nigprbc has been developed to provide better performance in terms of reducing the dead zone area improving the removal efficiency of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen and saving more space however if the process of rural sewage treatment just adopts the nigprbc reactor the effluent quality cannot meet the more stringent discharge standard especially in tn parameter since the denitrification process is insufficiency without reflux therefore the nigprbc reactor needs to be combined with other technologies to take advantage of its benefits as reported rural areas usually lack economic resources and professional technical personnel in sewage treatment and thus they should be served by energy saving and resource recovering treatment 19 20 for this purpose based on the nigprbc device a new combined bio ecological system was developed in this study the system consisted of an anoxic filter anf a nigprbc and a constructed wetland cw because of the variation in water quantity and quality the anf was intended to regulate water quality fluctuations degrade organic matter and achieve the denitrification process the anoxic and aerobic sections were designed with a backflow system therefore the effluent of nigprbc would partially reflux into the anf the biological treatment system anf nigprbc section was expected to remove organic matter convert most of the nh 4 n and remove partial tn as well as tp based on resource utilization and the sustainable concept the ecological treatment cw section would reuse the reserved nitrogen and phosphorus for vegetables growth previous research has demonstrated that cw could be used to remove kinds of organic and inorganic pollutants 21 the effluent of the cw should be at low concentration level to meet emission standards through nutrients uptake by plants adsorption of substrates and biological degradation hence the aim of this study was to evaluate performance of anf nigprbc cw coupling equipment in decentralized domestic wastewater treatment to achieve a better removal performance optimal operating parameters including hydraulic residence time hrt reflux ratio rr and rotational speed rs in anf nigprbc system were determined under optimal operating conditions rural domestic wastewater pollutant removal and long term performance of the combined bio ecological system were explored to confirm its feasibility meanwhile bacterial community structure and microbial diversity at different section were identified to better explain the process performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 setting of reactor experiments fig 1 shows the flow diagram of the combined bio ecological system the system contained two main parts biological treatment anf nigprbc and ecological treatment cw anoxic filter was made of polypropylene pp materials and filled with 50 felt packing 128 l working volume to keep sludge capacity and provide growth space for microorganisms the nigprbc was divided into six adjacent compartments to effectively improve flow pattern including discs section 24 discs with 280 mm diameter and the waterwheel section 1 waterwheel with 280 mm diameter this device had a 25 l working volume and the discs submergence was 45 the waterwheel of nigprbc replaced the electrical motor of normal rbc to further save energy consumption in addition the nigprbc equipment designed as a novel configuration gain advantage including lower cost easier maintenance and higher stability the cw pp material were cuboid l w h 1 22 m 0 32 m 0 67 m with a working volume of 80 l the total thickness of the substrate layers was 50 cm with the layers filled with 20 cm of green zeolite particle size 5 10 mm 20 cm of aerated concrete block particle size 10 50 mm and 10 cm of pebble 50 100 mm from top to bottom the previous results showed that zeolite had a strong absorption capacity for ammonia nitrogen and aerated concrete block had good adsorption performance for phosphate 22 23 water spinach ipomoea aquatica as a type of aquatic vegetable could remove nitrogen and phosphorus by harvesting which produced economic benefits 24 water spinach was planted on the surface of constructed wetland with an initial density of 100 plants m2 to reuse the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus from nigprbc according to the previous research in our experiment optimum conditions of hydraulic loading 0 4 m3 m2 d in cw system was carried out during the 90 day operation the influent raw sewage was pumped in the anf rector and then the effluent from anf was pumped to high position water tank of the nigprbc the anf treated water flow dropped from the upper tank to nigprbc for treating and waterwheel driving effluent from balance tank was partly returned to the anf providing a source of nitrate for denitrification the remaining effluence from balance tank flowed to the cw system for advanced treatment 2 2 sludge inoculation and wastewater anf and nigprbc were inoculated with seed sludge from anoxic pond and aerobic pond derived from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in wuxi china domestication and culture of inoculation sludge continued for a month during the reactors start up phase during the regulation parameters for optimal operating period i iii table 1 half synthetic wastewater was mixed with half raw sewage from canteens and dormitories at southeast university of wuxi campus wuxi china as the influent of anf nigprbc system in particular the synthetic wastewater was made based on our monitoring data in rural area changzhou china and previous study 25 during 90d operation period iv the raw sewage without synthetic wastewater was pumped to the influent tank of the combined bio ecological system 2 3 parameter adjustment a series of batch experiments were conducted to estimate pollutant removal of biological treatment anf nigprbc in changed hrt rr and rs to find the optimal parameter according to former reports on rural domestic wastewater treatment changeable scopes of hrt rr and rs were determined preliminarily the whole experiment was divided into four consecutive phases during period i iii hrt rr and rs were regulated respectively then the combined bio ecological system stably operated with the optimal parameters for 90 days during period iv the detailed information about operating parameters of each period is presented in table 1 water samples of influent and effluent were collected every 4 days and temperatures during the whole experiments in this study ranged between 20 and 35 c 2 4 microbial community analysis the biological samples were collected from eight different positions within the bio ecological system for high throughput sequencing at the end of period iv samples were obtained from anf the biofilm of the discs in six compartments from nigprbc n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 and biofilm on substrate surface in cw microbial dna from the samples was extracted using an e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega bio tec china according to the manufacturer s instructions the details about steps of pcr amplification and measurement can be found in the previous study 26 the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified by universal primers 338f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 illumina miseq sequencing platform was carried out on exploring the structure of the microbial community by using the mothur program version 1 43 0 high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity threshold for microbial community analysis representative sequences from each otu were subjected to determine based on rdp ii classifier of the ribosomal database project rda and the national center for biotechnology information ncbi blast 2 5 sample testing and statistical analysis routine water quality indexes including cod nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n tn and tp were measured in the test laboratory according to standard methods 27 the do was measured by means of rex laboratory do jpsj 605f meter rex company shanghai china the statistical analysis was processed with spss 24 software ibm corporation usa and origin pro 2018b software origin lab corporation usa the independent samples duncan test and one way analysis of variance anova were performed to test for significant differences among different samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal operating parameters selection 3 1 1 parameter selection of hrtnigprbc as reported hrt was a significant parameter and played an important role in the wastewater treatment process which determined the performance of bioreactor on pollutant removal 28 fig 2 shows the concentration and removal efficiency variation of cod tn and nh 4 n under different hrtnigprbc during i period the average influent concentrations of cod tn and nh 4 n were 240 44 5 61 mg l 43 36 2 11 mg l and 38 46 1 64 mg l in anf nigprbc system respectively as illustrated in fig 2 a cod removal efficiency of anf nigprbc system was affected by the hrtnigprbc for rural domestic wastewater treatment the total cod removal efficiency were 78 54 1 86 80 53 2 04 84 84 2 21 88 27 1 77 and 82 96 2 03 when hrtnigprbc were 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h and 6 h respectively the cod removal efficiency of anf nigprbc system increased from 2 h to 5 h of hrtnigprbc and then slightly decreased at 6 h hrtnigprbc fig 2 d illustrates hrtnigprbc have a remarkable influence on the cod removal efficiency in anf nigprbc system p 0 05 highest removal efficiency occurred at 5 h both in anf and anf nigprbc in general the rising hrt condition provides the sufficient contact time for microorganisms resulting in better removal performance of pollutants there was no significant difference on cod removal efficiency in anf as the increase of hrtnigprbc from 5 h to 6 h however cod removal efficiency dropped obviously in anf nigprbc system with the increase of hrtnigprbc from 5 h to 6 h too long hrtnigprbc did not enhance the cod removal it has been reported that the microbial balance of the reaction system was destroyed and resulted in low pollutant removal with too long hrt 29 furthermore this may be explained by the fact that the low organic load rate at longer hrt limited the microbial activities to remove the organic matters it is generally recognized that nh 4 n transformation process primarily occurs under the environments of sufficient supply of oxygen nitrification could be easily carried out when the do concentration exceeds the limit of 1 5 mg l 30 31 as hrtnigprbc increased from 3 h to 6 h the nigprbc exhibited better performance of reoxygenation do concentration seen from fig 2 e 2 21 mg l 3 08 mg l owing to the novel structure integrated rbc with multi stage clapboard the capacity of reoxygenation in this combined device benefited from dropping water rotating discs and atmospheric air water diffusion due to the unique structure it was necessary to ensure appropriate hrt to achieve the balanced state with suitable do level and treatment efficiency with the variation of hrtnigprbc from 2 h to 6 h average nh 4 n removal efficiencies in this entire biological treatment system had an increasing trend with the removal efficiencies changed from 54 63 2 68 to 85 21 2 91 the short hrt affected nitrifying bacteria to oxidize ammonia to nitrate in biological treatment 32 in addition nitrification would be limited by the do concentration under 2 h hrtnigprbc 1 42 mg l on average however the average nh 4 n removal efficiency in anf nigprbc system was non significantly different under 5 h hrtnigprbc 84 69 2 01 and 6 h hrtnigprbc 85 21 2 91 as presented in fig 2 b the variations of tn removal efficiency under different hrtnigprbc followed the similar trend as the changes on cod removal efficiencies when the hrtnigprbc was 5 h the tn removal efficiency peaked both in anf 33 99 5 61 and anf nigprbc system 46 13 5 11 according to the above discussion nh 4 n removal efficiency didn t increase obviously but tn removal efficiency decreased in anf nigprbc device as the hrtnigprbc changed from 5 h to 6 h this phenomenon could be explained by two aspects the longer hrtnigprbc was beneficial to nh 4 n removal resulting in nitrate nitrogen accumulation in reflux liquid from nigprbc to anf in other words the higher concentration of nitrate nitrogen flowing back to the anf contributed to the more electron acceptor for denitrification meanwhile dissolve oxygen concentration and redox potential would increase which destroyed anoxic environment in anf consequently hrtnigprbc was not the longer the better for denitrification process in addition a longer hrt also demands a larger reactor volume and lower organic load which affects the treatment efficiency and restricts the large scale applications of anf nigprbc system considered about the biotreatment s performance on pollution removal and application 5 h would be recommended for hrtnigprbc 3 1 2 parameter selection of reflux ratio the changes on influent and effluent pollutants concentration and removal efficiency both in anf and anf nigprbc system under different rrs are shown fig 3 during ii period the average values of cod tn and nh 4 n in the anf nigprbc device of influent were 243 98 4 66 mg l 45 33 1 38 mg l and 39 65 1 57 mg l respectively the degradation efficiency of organics and nitrogenous substances exhibited the same variation trends as influent rr increased it could be seen in fig 3 a that lowest average removal efficiency of cod was 76 12 1 09 with effluent concentrations of 57 41 2 25 mg l at 0 rr and the highest average removal efficiency of cod was 90 39 1 56 with effluent concentrations of 23 66 4 03 mg l the cod removal efficiency of the anf nigprbc system increased significantly when r changed from 0 to 150 when r increased to 200 the cod removal efficiency of system decreased slowly in the anf reactor the removal efficiency of cod raised with the increase of rr furthermore the proportion cod removal of anf to system also increased with the increase of rr noting that the cod removal efficiency was merely 22 75 2 86 in anf owing to the lack of nitrate nitrogen in denitrification process under non backflow condition when the rr changed from 50 to 200 the removal efficiency of cod increased from 45 89 2 64 to 54 93 1 66 the decrease in the cod concentration of anf reactor stems from the dilution effect of backflow and biodegradation of organic matters through microorganism the biodegradation process to consume organic matters mainly depended on the denitrification process the return flow contained a lot of nitrite nitrogen with the rising rr were flowed back to the anf reactor therefore a higher proportion cod removal of anf to the system could be achieved at a higher rr due to the strong demand for carbon sources to execute denitrification however the dilution effect caused by the increase of reflux would decrease both bod5 cod ratio and cod tn ratio which may adversely affect the biological denitrification and reduce the demands for consumption of carbon sources 33 34 thus this also explained the phenomenon that the cod removal efficiency of anf increased slowly after rr reached 100 it is worth noting that the anf nigprbc system can still remove most of organic substances under given rrs the nh 4 n removal mainly relied on the nitrification process in nigprbc device where provided sufficient do condition do 1 5 mg l at each rr seen from fig 3 e for nitrifying bacteria to oxidize ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen with increase of rrs the removal efficiency of nh 4 n in the whole biotreatment system increased first and then decreased but nh 4 n removal efficiency rose in anf device as presented in fig 3 c nh 4 n removal efficiency reached a peak at 83 25 2 01 under 100 rr when the rr was 0 nh 4 n removal of anf was merely 6 28 2 29 because the dilution effect of reflux was nearly none with non recycling it has been proved that nh 4 n removal could be achieved at low do concentrations with ammonia oxidation despite that the reaction rate was limited by do 35 36 however as the rr increased from 50 to 200 nh 4 n removal efficiency of anf increased from 23 76 3 84 to 37 36 3 52 the decrease on the concentration of effluent nh 4 n in anf stemming from the dilution effect of reflux was greater than that from degradation effect the highest nh 4 n removal efficiency occurred at the intermediate value 100 rr at highest do concentration 2 65 mg l on average therefore the peak removal efficiency of nh 4 n occurred in a moderate rr due to the result of the comprehensive effects of ammonia removal in anf unit and nigprbc unit respectively the removal efficiency of tn in the anf nigprbc system increased from 15 88 2 54 to 46 68 1 71 when rr changed from 0 rr to 150 rr with effluent concentration decreased from 38 14 1 63 mg l to 24 34 0 88 mg l as the rr increased from 150 to 200 tn removal efficiency dropped to 43 82 3 79 as shown in fig 3 b d tn removal mainly occurred in anf device due to their function orientation it was worth mentioning that nigprbc device also had the ability to remove tn indicating that denitrifying bacteria existed in aerobic environment former reports also showed that rbc was capable of aerobic denitrification to convert nh 4 n to n2 in the presence of carbon resource 37 the variation of tn removal efficiency in our work under the changed rr was similar with previous studies 18 in the biological treatment system denitrification process was influenced by nitrate nitrogen level and carbon resource under the different reflux ratio the proper cod no 3 n was important for achieving efficient denitrification 38 the decrease of tn removal after 150 may be related to the cod no3 n thus the results indicated that an appropriate rr was conductive to tn removal to sum up nh 4 n removal efficiency reached the best effect at 100 rr there was no significant difference in tn removal efficiency between at 100 rr and 150 rr given that 100 rr could still achieve an acceptable value in cod removal and reduce the energy consumption 100 reflux ratio is desirable for the biotreatment system 3 1 3 parameter selection of rotational speed the rotational speed was an important parameter for the sewage treatment which affected pollutant and oxygen mass transfer in the biofilm 39 moreover rotational speed reflected energy consumption and was related to the performance of rbc systems fig 4 illustrates that rotational speed affect the cod nh 4 n and tn removal performance under different rs during iii period the average influent cod tn and nh 4 n of anf nigprbc system were 244 09 4 58 mg l 43 55 1 05 mg l and 39 08 1 10 mg l respectively when the rs changed from 1 r min to 7 r min the cod and nh 4 n removal efficiency in this anf nigprbc system firstly increased and then decreased as shown in fig 4 a the cod removal efficiency under 3 r min 88 77 1 12 was similar to that under 5 r min 87 48 1 61 p 0 05 as rs increased from 1 r min to 7 r min the average do concentration increased from 1 32 mg l to 3 84 mg l fig 4 e the maximum nh 4 n removal efficiency occurred at 5 r min in anf nigprbc system fig 4 c however tn removal efficiency in the entire system decreased as the rs increasing fig 4 b the possible reason was that the rising rs increased do level that flowed back into anf which restricted the denitrification process at 3 r min of rs 88 77 1 12 cod 42 99 2 29 tn and 82 74 1 81 nh 4 n in this biological treatment system were removed respectively generally speaking an increase on rs increases the do concentration to be available for microorganisms and degrade pollutant at a higher rate 40 nevertheless an increase in the rs also led to an increase in the shearing action between microorganisms biofilm and liquid 40 leading to a decrease in microorganism biomass that affected effluent quality of nigprbc furthermore when the rs gets too high the power consumption will be higher thus the 3 r min for nigprbc is desirable to conduct the continuous operation based on the economical principle and treatment efficiency 3 2 performance of pollutant removal during 90d operation according to the above discussions 5 h 100 and 3 r min can be recommended for hrtnigprbc rr and rs during the long term operation the duration of continuous operation can be used to evaluate performance of pollutants removal through combining biological and ecological treatment system the monitoring data of the system was presented in table 2 and fig 5 the variation of cod concentration of influent and effluent in this combined technology is shown in fig 5 a approximately 85 and 10 of cod were removed by biological treatment and ecological treatment respectively the final effluent cod concentration and removal efficiency were 12 47 3 92 mg l and 95 14 1 31 during the 90 day running reaching the pollutant emission standards 60 mg l compared to former anf wdsrbc technology 61 4 4 3 cod removal 14 cod removal efficiency in combined system was relatively improved due to the process optimization design the increase of cod removal in this treatment process was caused by the rbc configuration modification and application of constructed wetland the nigprbc device improved the removal performance of cod owing to the optimization of hydraulic flow regime besides the constructed wetland could further degrade the remaining organic matter from biological treatment section these results suggested that organic matter was removed by combined technology significantly for nitrogen conversion the average removal efficiency of nh 4 n and tn were 93 42 2 16 and 79 07 4 32 in the combined process respectively fig 5 b and fig 5 c in the whole system the nh 4 n removal mainly occurred in nigprbc device but tn removal mainly occurred in anf and constructed wetland the final effluent nh 4 n and tn concentration were 2 50 0 76 mg l and 9 15 2 16 mg l which met emissions standards nh 4 n 8 mg l and tn 20 mg l tn removal efficiency in the biological treatment was below 50 which was consistent with previous report 20 the highest no3 n concentration of wastewater occurred in the nigprbc reactor this increase in the concentration of no3 n was the result of the nitrification process in which nh 4 n was transformed into no3 n from the tn and nh 4 n removal results it is concluded that no3 n removal occurred mainly in anf and cw system apart to nitrification and denitrification the adsorption and plant uptake could be other pathways for no3 n removal from wastewater in cws 41 42 the effluent no3 n nh 4 n concentration ratio from nigprbc was 2 64 which was reported as a suitable ratio for cw 43 45 according to functional orientation of biological treatment the anf nigprbc section was mainly for reducing organic matter and ammonia nitrogen the ecological treatment played a major role in further utilizing nutrients resource and removing organic matter to ensure effluent quality 83 39 3 46 of tp was removed in the bio ecological treatment and nearly 65 of tp removal occurred in ecological treatment unit the effluent concentration of tp was stable which never exceeded 1 mg l during long time running as showed in fig 5 d the variation tendency of tp effluent in anf was similar to that in nigprbc due to the process characteristics the ability to remove phosphorus by discharging the residual sludge was restricted in this biofilm process the 90 day operation results show that the average tp removal efficiency was only 17 68 7 04 thus tp was mainly removed in cw by substrate adsorption plant accumulation normal microorganism assimilation and excessive phosphorus uptake 46 in particular the concentration of tp in combined technology met emissions standards during 90 day operation 1 mg l according to the process design concept the reserved phosphorus is contributed to increasing production of vegetables in constructed wetland resulting in generating the economic benefits li etc 14 reported that 61 4 4 3 cod 86 1 3 7 nh 4 n and 54 5 3 9 tn were removed by biological treatment system and wu etc 47 reported that 91 36 cod 85 52 nh 4 n 60 4 tn and 82 18 tp were removed by ecological treatment system for rural domestic sewage treatment the increase in pollutant removal efficiency of this system depended on the effective combination of biological and ecological treatment the 90 day operation results demonstrated that bio ecological combination technology has a considerable and stable effect on cod tn nh 4 n and tp removal performance for rural domestic sewage fig 5 e illustrates each section of bio ecological combination system performance on pollutant removal in biological treatment system nitrification and denitrification process were the main ways to remove nitrogen which contributed cod removal however anf nigprbc device was not the major contributor for tp removal due to the limitation of low sludge production the residual nitrogen and phosphorus from anf nigprbc could reuse by the vegetables planted in constructed wetland the former study has indicated that plants uptake was recognized as an important pathway to improve nutrient removal in the cw 48 49 it has reported that 14 29 51 89 of tn and 10 76 34 17 of tp derived from plant uptake 50 harvesting nuisance aquatic plants could produce economic benefits compared to other traditional treatment technology by reducing the p load by as much as 50 51 regular harvesting of plants to remove nutrients in cw could generate economic benefits for the rural area substrate adsorption was also an important pathway to remove nutrients in our cw therefore the combined system could achieve stable operation low energy less by product and resource utilization for rural domestic sewage management based on our results of long term performance bio ecological combination technology is a viable and sustainable treatment process for rural domestic sewage 3 3 microbial structure eight samples collected from each reactor under long term phase were evaluated using high throughput sequencing the bacterial community composition in the eight biological film samples of the bio ecological combined system is shown in fig 6 the phyla with relative abundance in the biological film samples of the bio ecological combined system are illustrated in fig 6 a the results showed that the dominant phyla included firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi the sum of the relative abundance of three phyla accounted for over 80 in anf reactor it was reported that firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi were related to denitrification playing a crucial role in organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal 52 53 in addition chloroflexi has been correlated to the degradation of complex organic compounds in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and firmicutes was involved in bioconversion of nitrite 54 55 at a phylum level proteobacteria 54 12 76 07 and bacteroidetes 10 44 28 23 were dominant in each compartment of nigprbc device as reported proteobacteria contained many species involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling which played an important role in conventional biological wastewater treatment processes 56 bacteroidetes commonly seen in conventional activated sludge processes are also reported as an important heterotrophic organisms involved in the cycling of complex organic carbon and proteinaceous substances 57 moreover the abundance of bacteroidetes has been found to be positively associated with biomass hydrolysis activities 58 however the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was only 2 74 in the anf compared that in nigprbc the level of nitrospirae 1 38 5 99 in biofilm samples of nigprbc were significantly higher than those in anf 0 81 which were corresponded with dissolved oxygen condition this is further reinforced by the fact that biofilm on discs of nigprbc plays an important role in nitrification as for cw top three phylum including proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chlamydia were reported to be common denitrifying bacteria 59 proteobacteria were also discovered to be connected with the dominating phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and nitrifying strains within a denitrifying phosphorus removal system 60 fig 6 b showed the relative abundance of different bacterial genera within each reactor the top 3 dominant genera found in anf were trichococcus 16 19 denitratisoma 14 99 and sulfurisoma 6 21 trichococcus was well known for performing heterotrophic denitrification and its abundance was connected to the low dissolved oxygen environment 61 denitratisoma was reported to be highly related to heterotrophic denitrification 62 and sulfurisoma was associated with the high tn and no3 n removal 63 the abundance of these genera explained the removal performance of cod 53 51 4 07 and tn 32 56 6 06 in anf as for nigprbc device six dominant genera were hydrogenophaga flavobacterium sphaerotilus denitratisoma nitrospira and flavisolibacter nitrospira was the most abundant typical genus for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation with abundances of 2 95 5 99 and 2 82 in the n4 n5 and n6 respectively but only 0 81 in anf this composition helps to explain experimental phenomenon that nh 4 n occurred 49 01 in nigprbc and 32 56 in anf in addition tn removal also occurred in the nigprbc which likely existed in autotrophic denitrification associated with hydrogenophaga and sphaerotilus genera 64 its presence supported the partial tn removal of nigprbc and offered the possibility of enhancing the performance of the device through autotrophic denitrification it was reported that autotrophic denitrification occurred in traditional rbc for removing nitrate from landfill leachate 65 in fact autotrophic denitrification was considered as the convenient environmentally friendly biological process for treating the nitrate containing of organic lacking sewage 66 in cw system the dominant genera were denitratisoma janthinobacterium flavobacterium and acidovorax which shared 9 25 8 21 6 52 and 6 17 sequences respectively as reported denitratisoma janthinobacterium flavobacterium and acidovorax were widely recognized as denitrifying bacteria involved in nitrate reduction 67 68 flavobacterium also was the dominant paos 69 the relative abundance of denitrification genera could well explain the high tn and tp removal of cw system through the comprehensive analysis of the system performance the pathway of simultaneous organics and nutrients was proposed in fig 6 c the distribution of the wastewater do level inside this system was dependent on the designed functional positioning as shown in fig 6 c the variation of do level first increased and then decreased along with the system the increment in do levels attributed to rotation of discs and reoxygenation by water stream in nigprbc the distribution of the do level played a crucial role in nitrogen removal in this system more particularly no3 n level of the system was mainly generated by the nh 4 n conversion due to the action of proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and nitrospirae nh 4 n and no3 n in sewage were finally transformed into n2 additionally nitrogen removal also relied on substrate adsorption and plant uptake it can be inferred that the phosphorus removal was accomplished by anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake process in biological treatment despite the tp average removal efficiency was only 17 68 7 04 the cod could be absorbed to store energy under the anaerobic conditions in this process nothing that phosphorus reduction is mainly dominated by the plant uptake precipitation adsorption or accumulation processes in mineral media in the system the microbial community analysis contributes to explain the pollutant removal performance of each treatment section in this system the anf was designed mainly for organic matter degradation and denitrification and the nigprbc was used to conduct nitrification the past treatment cw reused the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus by plant uptake using lift pump to replace the motor could save energy consumption and make maintenance easier it is feasible to grow vegetables on surface of cw in china rural aeras the low consumption advantage will be more significant when the treatment scale expanded the pollutant removal performance and microbial community of this study confirmed that the innovative bio ecological combined system provided an alternate process for treating rural domestic wastewater 4 conclusions the removal efficiencies of cod tn and nh 4 n were influenced by the different hrtnigprbc rr and rs in anf nigprbc from the perspective of treatment performance and practical application the optimal operating parameters selected 5 h hrtnigprbc 100 rr and 3 r min rs respectively when operating at the optimum parameters the whole system achieved commendable removal efficiencies of 95 14 1 31 cod 79 07 4 32 tn 93 42 2 16 nh 4 n and 83 39 3 46 tp and the effluent concentration of this system would meet the local rural domestic wastewater pollution discharge standard biological treatment section was the major contributor to cod and nh 4 n removal during steady state and ecological treatment section would remove the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus to ensure the effluent quality besides the regular harvesting of plants was an important way to remove nutrients proteobacteria and bacteroidetes as the dominant phylum existed widely in the n1 to n6 and cw section which was similar to other conventional wastewater treatment denitrification related genera were present in great abundance in anf and cw while nitrification bacteria and autotrophic denitrification bacteria existed in some parts of nigprbc the results proved the functional community and successful application for domestic wastewater treatment based on the reliability and stability the application of this system is broad and quite optimistic prospect for rural sewage treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12638,treating rural domestic sewage has always been a hard task for rural vitalization in china to overcome this problem high efficiency easy maintenance and low consumption treatment technologies are urgently needed to meet the requirements of rural sewage treatment a new combined bio ecological system was proposed in this study including the anoxic filter anf novel integrated guide plate rotating biological contactors nigprbc and constructed wetland cw key parameters of anf nigprbc system including hydraulic residence time hrt reflux ratio rr and rotational speed rs were identified founded on the organic matter and nitrogen removal performance for further application in addition the combined bio ecological system was lasted for the 90 days at optimal operating parameters to confirm its performance on pollutant removal the optimal operating parameters were determined to be 5 h hrtnigprbc 100 rr and 3 r min rs under the optimal operating parameters average 95 14 1 31 cod 79 07 4 32 tn 93 42 2 16 nh 4 n and 83 39 3 46 tp were removed during the 90 day operation the operating results of the combined bio ecological system indicate that the effluent meet local rural domestic wastewater pollution discharge standard the microbial community results also helped to better explain the process performance of the whole system by high throughput sequencing analysis proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant phylum existing widely in this system denitrification related genera were abundant both in anf and cw overall the new combined bio ecological system is one of the priority choices for treating rural wastewater owing to its economic benefits integrated design concept and convenient operation keywords rural domestic sewage bio ecological system rotating biological contactors pollutant removal microbial communities data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction due to population growth and improved socio economic standards of living the increasing amount of household sewage is becoming one of the major environmental issues in rural china 1 for a long time domestic wastewater has been discharged directly without treatment in rural areas causing water quality degradation of rivers lakes and groundwater 2 3 in fact ammonia nitrogen nh 4 n total nitrogen tn chemical oxygen demand cod and total phosphorus tp indexes of water sources in most chinese rural areas have been demonstrated to exceed water quality standards 4 currently the sewage discharge standard in rural regions is becoming increasingly more stringent driven by the chinese national standards on modernization of agriculture and rural areas unlike urban domestic wastewater rural domestic wastewater is characterized by a vast range of distribution wide pollution scope a small amount of sewage and large variation coefficients for water quality and water quantity 5 6 therefore the municipal wastewater treatment model could not be applied to the treatment of rural domestic wastewater due to the enormous investment in pipe laying and decentralized wastewater collection according to the actual state of rural regions the adaptable processes for rural sewage treatment require small equipment size low investment easy maintenance and steady operation in order to improve the rural environment and reduce the pollution substantial efforts have been made to explore appropriate treatment technologies for rural domestic sewage some independent processes for rural sewage treatment such as subsurface wastewater infiltration system 7 aerobic membrane bioreactor 8 aerated filters 9 and stabilization ponds 10 and septic tanks 11 have been developed and applied in rural areas however these processes also suffer from operational problems for instance subsurface wastewater infiltration system and stabilization ponds are limited by the low hydraulic and organic load rates and require a high land footprint aerobic membrane bioreactor and aerated filters have high energy consumption and high maintenance costs that are not affordable in rural areas furthermore activated sludge processes are usually complex and need professional management that have limitations in sustainability for rural sewage treatment 12 rotating biological contactor rbc is a reliable biological treatment technology for decentralized village wastewater treatment owing to its anti load impact easy maintenance and small area 13 even though rbc is reliable they still have some challenges in terms of operating costs and stable nitrogen removal efficiency 14 compared to constructed wetlands technology rbc had a higher nh 4 n removal efficiency but higher energy costs 15 hence some advanced treatment reactors on modifying rbc configuration have been invented to further save the energy costs and improve the performance among the reactors are self rotating discs 16 net like rotating biological contactor 17 and multi stage waterwheel driving rotating biological contactors ms wdrbcs 18 the ms wdrbcs performed well on oxygenation and nitrification through rotation of discs and reoxygenation by dropping water with less energy costs and less space utilization 18 although the ms wdrbcs have been proven efficient performance several unsolved problems in term of the balance of driving force from waterwheels a large dead zone and excessive reactors in the above mentioned device remain to overcome these challenges the novel integrated guide plate rotating biological contractor nigprbc device has been designed to treat rural sewage the waterwheel driving rotation disks were installed in the middle of the disks to maintain driving force balance and reduce energy consumption in addition the rbc was divided into six adjacent compartments with up flow or down flow in each compartment to optimize the hydraulic flow pattern this provides a better environment for microbial growth and enhances the microbial activity per unit of reactor volume therefore the nigprbc has been developed to provide better performance in terms of reducing the dead zone area improving the removal efficiency of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen and saving more space however if the process of rural sewage treatment just adopts the nigprbc reactor the effluent quality cannot meet the more stringent discharge standard especially in tn parameter since the denitrification process is insufficiency without reflux therefore the nigprbc reactor needs to be combined with other technologies to take advantage of its benefits as reported rural areas usually lack economic resources and professional technical personnel in sewage treatment and thus they should be served by energy saving and resource recovering treatment 19 20 for this purpose based on the nigprbc device a new combined bio ecological system was developed in this study the system consisted of an anoxic filter anf a nigprbc and a constructed wetland cw because of the variation in water quantity and quality the anf was intended to regulate water quality fluctuations degrade organic matter and achieve the denitrification process the anoxic and aerobic sections were designed with a backflow system therefore the effluent of nigprbc would partially reflux into the anf the biological treatment system anf nigprbc section was expected to remove organic matter convert most of the nh 4 n and remove partial tn as well as tp based on resource utilization and the sustainable concept the ecological treatment cw section would reuse the reserved nitrogen and phosphorus for vegetables growth previous research has demonstrated that cw could be used to remove kinds of organic and inorganic pollutants 21 the effluent of the cw should be at low concentration level to meet emission standards through nutrients uptake by plants adsorption of substrates and biological degradation hence the aim of this study was to evaluate performance of anf nigprbc cw coupling equipment in decentralized domestic wastewater treatment to achieve a better removal performance optimal operating parameters including hydraulic residence time hrt reflux ratio rr and rotational speed rs in anf nigprbc system were determined under optimal operating conditions rural domestic wastewater pollutant removal and long term performance of the combined bio ecological system were explored to confirm its feasibility meanwhile bacterial community structure and microbial diversity at different section were identified to better explain the process performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 setting of reactor experiments fig 1 shows the flow diagram of the combined bio ecological system the system contained two main parts biological treatment anf nigprbc and ecological treatment cw anoxic filter was made of polypropylene pp materials and filled with 50 felt packing 128 l working volume to keep sludge capacity and provide growth space for microorganisms the nigprbc was divided into six adjacent compartments to effectively improve flow pattern including discs section 24 discs with 280 mm diameter and the waterwheel section 1 waterwheel with 280 mm diameter this device had a 25 l working volume and the discs submergence was 45 the waterwheel of nigprbc replaced the electrical motor of normal rbc to further save energy consumption in addition the nigprbc equipment designed as a novel configuration gain advantage including lower cost easier maintenance and higher stability the cw pp material were cuboid l w h 1 22 m 0 32 m 0 67 m with a working volume of 80 l the total thickness of the substrate layers was 50 cm with the layers filled with 20 cm of green zeolite particle size 5 10 mm 20 cm of aerated concrete block particle size 10 50 mm and 10 cm of pebble 50 100 mm from top to bottom the previous results showed that zeolite had a strong absorption capacity for ammonia nitrogen and aerated concrete block had good adsorption performance for phosphate 22 23 water spinach ipomoea aquatica as a type of aquatic vegetable could remove nitrogen and phosphorus by harvesting which produced economic benefits 24 water spinach was planted on the surface of constructed wetland with an initial density of 100 plants m2 to reuse the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus from nigprbc according to the previous research in our experiment optimum conditions of hydraulic loading 0 4 m3 m2 d in cw system was carried out during the 90 day operation the influent raw sewage was pumped in the anf rector and then the effluent from anf was pumped to high position water tank of the nigprbc the anf treated water flow dropped from the upper tank to nigprbc for treating and waterwheel driving effluent from balance tank was partly returned to the anf providing a source of nitrate for denitrification the remaining effluence from balance tank flowed to the cw system for advanced treatment 2 2 sludge inoculation and wastewater anf and nigprbc were inoculated with seed sludge from anoxic pond and aerobic pond derived from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in wuxi china domestication and culture of inoculation sludge continued for a month during the reactors start up phase during the regulation parameters for optimal operating period i iii table 1 half synthetic wastewater was mixed with half raw sewage from canteens and dormitories at southeast university of wuxi campus wuxi china as the influent of anf nigprbc system in particular the synthetic wastewater was made based on our monitoring data in rural area changzhou china and previous study 25 during 90d operation period iv the raw sewage without synthetic wastewater was pumped to the influent tank of the combined bio ecological system 2 3 parameter adjustment a series of batch experiments were conducted to estimate pollutant removal of biological treatment anf nigprbc in changed hrt rr and rs to find the optimal parameter according to former reports on rural domestic wastewater treatment changeable scopes of hrt rr and rs were determined preliminarily the whole experiment was divided into four consecutive phases during period i iii hrt rr and rs were regulated respectively then the combined bio ecological system stably operated with the optimal parameters for 90 days during period iv the detailed information about operating parameters of each period is presented in table 1 water samples of influent and effluent were collected every 4 days and temperatures during the whole experiments in this study ranged between 20 and 35 c 2 4 microbial community analysis the biological samples were collected from eight different positions within the bio ecological system for high throughput sequencing at the end of period iv samples were obtained from anf the biofilm of the discs in six compartments from nigprbc n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 and biofilm on substrate surface in cw microbial dna from the samples was extracted using an e z n atm mag bind soil dna kit omega bio tec china according to the manufacturer s instructions the details about steps of pcr amplification and measurement can be found in the previous study 26 the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified by universal primers 338f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 illumina miseq sequencing platform was carried out on exploring the structure of the microbial community by using the mothur program version 1 43 0 high quality sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity threshold for microbial community analysis representative sequences from each otu were subjected to determine based on rdp ii classifier of the ribosomal database project rda and the national center for biotechnology information ncbi blast 2 5 sample testing and statistical analysis routine water quality indexes including cod nh 4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n tn and tp were measured in the test laboratory according to standard methods 27 the do was measured by means of rex laboratory do jpsj 605f meter rex company shanghai china the statistical analysis was processed with spss 24 software ibm corporation usa and origin pro 2018b software origin lab corporation usa the independent samples duncan test and one way analysis of variance anova were performed to test for significant differences among different samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimal operating parameters selection 3 1 1 parameter selection of hrtnigprbc as reported hrt was a significant parameter and played an important role in the wastewater treatment process which determined the performance of bioreactor on pollutant removal 28 fig 2 shows the concentration and removal efficiency variation of cod tn and nh 4 n under different hrtnigprbc during i period the average influent concentrations of cod tn and nh 4 n were 240 44 5 61 mg l 43 36 2 11 mg l and 38 46 1 64 mg l in anf nigprbc system respectively as illustrated in fig 2 a cod removal efficiency of anf nigprbc system was affected by the hrtnigprbc for rural domestic wastewater treatment the total cod removal efficiency were 78 54 1 86 80 53 2 04 84 84 2 21 88 27 1 77 and 82 96 2 03 when hrtnigprbc were 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h and 6 h respectively the cod removal efficiency of anf nigprbc system increased from 2 h to 5 h of hrtnigprbc and then slightly decreased at 6 h hrtnigprbc fig 2 d illustrates hrtnigprbc have a remarkable influence on the cod removal efficiency in anf nigprbc system p 0 05 highest removal efficiency occurred at 5 h both in anf and anf nigprbc in general the rising hrt condition provides the sufficient contact time for microorganisms resulting in better removal performance of pollutants there was no significant difference on cod removal efficiency in anf as the increase of hrtnigprbc from 5 h to 6 h however cod removal efficiency dropped obviously in anf nigprbc system with the increase of hrtnigprbc from 5 h to 6 h too long hrtnigprbc did not enhance the cod removal it has been reported that the microbial balance of the reaction system was destroyed and resulted in low pollutant removal with too long hrt 29 furthermore this may be explained by the fact that the low organic load rate at longer hrt limited the microbial activities to remove the organic matters it is generally recognized that nh 4 n transformation process primarily occurs under the environments of sufficient supply of oxygen nitrification could be easily carried out when the do concentration exceeds the limit of 1 5 mg l 30 31 as hrtnigprbc increased from 3 h to 6 h the nigprbc exhibited better performance of reoxygenation do concentration seen from fig 2 e 2 21 mg l 3 08 mg l owing to the novel structure integrated rbc with multi stage clapboard the capacity of reoxygenation in this combined device benefited from dropping water rotating discs and atmospheric air water diffusion due to the unique structure it was necessary to ensure appropriate hrt to achieve the balanced state with suitable do level and treatment efficiency with the variation of hrtnigprbc from 2 h to 6 h average nh 4 n removal efficiencies in this entire biological treatment system had an increasing trend with the removal efficiencies changed from 54 63 2 68 to 85 21 2 91 the short hrt affected nitrifying bacteria to oxidize ammonia to nitrate in biological treatment 32 in addition nitrification would be limited by the do concentration under 2 h hrtnigprbc 1 42 mg l on average however the average nh 4 n removal efficiency in anf nigprbc system was non significantly different under 5 h hrtnigprbc 84 69 2 01 and 6 h hrtnigprbc 85 21 2 91 as presented in fig 2 b the variations of tn removal efficiency under different hrtnigprbc followed the similar trend as the changes on cod removal efficiencies when the hrtnigprbc was 5 h the tn removal efficiency peaked both in anf 33 99 5 61 and anf nigprbc system 46 13 5 11 according to the above discussion nh 4 n removal efficiency didn t increase obviously but tn removal efficiency decreased in anf nigprbc device as the hrtnigprbc changed from 5 h to 6 h this phenomenon could be explained by two aspects the longer hrtnigprbc was beneficial to nh 4 n removal resulting in nitrate nitrogen accumulation in reflux liquid from nigprbc to anf in other words the higher concentration of nitrate nitrogen flowing back to the anf contributed to the more electron acceptor for denitrification meanwhile dissolve oxygen concentration and redox potential would increase which destroyed anoxic environment in anf consequently hrtnigprbc was not the longer the better for denitrification process in addition a longer hrt also demands a larger reactor volume and lower organic load which affects the treatment efficiency and restricts the large scale applications of anf nigprbc system considered about the biotreatment s performance on pollution removal and application 5 h would be recommended for hrtnigprbc 3 1 2 parameter selection of reflux ratio the changes on influent and effluent pollutants concentration and removal efficiency both in anf and anf nigprbc system under different rrs are shown fig 3 during ii period the average values of cod tn and nh 4 n in the anf nigprbc device of influent were 243 98 4 66 mg l 45 33 1 38 mg l and 39 65 1 57 mg l respectively the degradation efficiency of organics and nitrogenous substances exhibited the same variation trends as influent rr increased it could be seen in fig 3 a that lowest average removal efficiency of cod was 76 12 1 09 with effluent concentrations of 57 41 2 25 mg l at 0 rr and the highest average removal efficiency of cod was 90 39 1 56 with effluent concentrations of 23 66 4 03 mg l the cod removal efficiency of the anf nigprbc system increased significantly when r changed from 0 to 150 when r increased to 200 the cod removal efficiency of system decreased slowly in the anf reactor the removal efficiency of cod raised with the increase of rr furthermore the proportion cod removal of anf to system also increased with the increase of rr noting that the cod removal efficiency was merely 22 75 2 86 in anf owing to the lack of nitrate nitrogen in denitrification process under non backflow condition when the rr changed from 50 to 200 the removal efficiency of cod increased from 45 89 2 64 to 54 93 1 66 the decrease in the cod concentration of anf reactor stems from the dilution effect of backflow and biodegradation of organic matters through microorganism the biodegradation process to consume organic matters mainly depended on the denitrification process the return flow contained a lot of nitrite nitrogen with the rising rr were flowed back to the anf reactor therefore a higher proportion cod removal of anf to the system could be achieved at a higher rr due to the strong demand for carbon sources to execute denitrification however the dilution effect caused by the increase of reflux would decrease both bod5 cod ratio and cod tn ratio which may adversely affect the biological denitrification and reduce the demands for consumption of carbon sources 33 34 thus this also explained the phenomenon that the cod removal efficiency of anf increased slowly after rr reached 100 it is worth noting that the anf nigprbc system can still remove most of organic substances under given rrs the nh 4 n removal mainly relied on the nitrification process in nigprbc device where provided sufficient do condition do 1 5 mg l at each rr seen from fig 3 e for nitrifying bacteria to oxidize ammonia nitrogen to nitrate nitrogen with increase of rrs the removal efficiency of nh 4 n in the whole biotreatment system increased first and then decreased but nh 4 n removal efficiency rose in anf device as presented in fig 3 c nh 4 n removal efficiency reached a peak at 83 25 2 01 under 100 rr when the rr was 0 nh 4 n removal of anf was merely 6 28 2 29 because the dilution effect of reflux was nearly none with non recycling it has been proved that nh 4 n removal could be achieved at low do concentrations with ammonia oxidation despite that the reaction rate was limited by do 35 36 however as the rr increased from 50 to 200 nh 4 n removal efficiency of anf increased from 23 76 3 84 to 37 36 3 52 the decrease on the concentration of effluent nh 4 n in anf stemming from the dilution effect of reflux was greater than that from degradation effect the highest nh 4 n removal efficiency occurred at the intermediate value 100 rr at highest do concentration 2 65 mg l on average therefore the peak removal efficiency of nh 4 n occurred in a moderate rr due to the result of the comprehensive effects of ammonia removal in anf unit and nigprbc unit respectively the removal efficiency of tn in the anf nigprbc system increased from 15 88 2 54 to 46 68 1 71 when rr changed from 0 rr to 150 rr with effluent concentration decreased from 38 14 1 63 mg l to 24 34 0 88 mg l as the rr increased from 150 to 200 tn removal efficiency dropped to 43 82 3 79 as shown in fig 3 b d tn removal mainly occurred in anf device due to their function orientation it was worth mentioning that nigprbc device also had the ability to remove tn indicating that denitrifying bacteria existed in aerobic environment former reports also showed that rbc was capable of aerobic denitrification to convert nh 4 n to n2 in the presence of carbon resource 37 the variation of tn removal efficiency in our work under the changed rr was similar with previous studies 18 in the biological treatment system denitrification process was influenced by nitrate nitrogen level and carbon resource under the different reflux ratio the proper cod no 3 n was important for achieving efficient denitrification 38 the decrease of tn removal after 150 may be related to the cod no3 n thus the results indicated that an appropriate rr was conductive to tn removal to sum up nh 4 n removal efficiency reached the best effect at 100 rr there was no significant difference in tn removal efficiency between at 100 rr and 150 rr given that 100 rr could still achieve an acceptable value in cod removal and reduce the energy consumption 100 reflux ratio is desirable for the biotreatment system 3 1 3 parameter selection of rotational speed the rotational speed was an important parameter for the sewage treatment which affected pollutant and oxygen mass transfer in the biofilm 39 moreover rotational speed reflected energy consumption and was related to the performance of rbc systems fig 4 illustrates that rotational speed affect the cod nh 4 n and tn removal performance under different rs during iii period the average influent cod tn and nh 4 n of anf nigprbc system were 244 09 4 58 mg l 43 55 1 05 mg l and 39 08 1 10 mg l respectively when the rs changed from 1 r min to 7 r min the cod and nh 4 n removal efficiency in this anf nigprbc system firstly increased and then decreased as shown in fig 4 a the cod removal efficiency under 3 r min 88 77 1 12 was similar to that under 5 r min 87 48 1 61 p 0 05 as rs increased from 1 r min to 7 r min the average do concentration increased from 1 32 mg l to 3 84 mg l fig 4 e the maximum nh 4 n removal efficiency occurred at 5 r min in anf nigprbc system fig 4 c however tn removal efficiency in the entire system decreased as the rs increasing fig 4 b the possible reason was that the rising rs increased do level that flowed back into anf which restricted the denitrification process at 3 r min of rs 88 77 1 12 cod 42 99 2 29 tn and 82 74 1 81 nh 4 n in this biological treatment system were removed respectively generally speaking an increase on rs increases the do concentration to be available for microorganisms and degrade pollutant at a higher rate 40 nevertheless an increase in the rs also led to an increase in the shearing action between microorganisms biofilm and liquid 40 leading to a decrease in microorganism biomass that affected effluent quality of nigprbc furthermore when the rs gets too high the power consumption will be higher thus the 3 r min for nigprbc is desirable to conduct the continuous operation based on the economical principle and treatment efficiency 3 2 performance of pollutant removal during 90d operation according to the above discussions 5 h 100 and 3 r min can be recommended for hrtnigprbc rr and rs during the long term operation the duration of continuous operation can be used to evaluate performance of pollutants removal through combining biological and ecological treatment system the monitoring data of the system was presented in table 2 and fig 5 the variation of cod concentration of influent and effluent in this combined technology is shown in fig 5 a approximately 85 and 10 of cod were removed by biological treatment and ecological treatment respectively the final effluent cod concentration and removal efficiency were 12 47 3 92 mg l and 95 14 1 31 during the 90 day running reaching the pollutant emission standards 60 mg l compared to former anf wdsrbc technology 61 4 4 3 cod removal 14 cod removal efficiency in combined system was relatively improved due to the process optimization design the increase of cod removal in this treatment process was caused by the rbc configuration modification and application of constructed wetland the nigprbc device improved the removal performance of cod owing to the optimization of hydraulic flow regime besides the constructed wetland could further degrade the remaining organic matter from biological treatment section these results suggested that organic matter was removed by combined technology significantly for nitrogen conversion the average removal efficiency of nh 4 n and tn were 93 42 2 16 and 79 07 4 32 in the combined process respectively fig 5 b and fig 5 c in the whole system the nh 4 n removal mainly occurred in nigprbc device but tn removal mainly occurred in anf and constructed wetland the final effluent nh 4 n and tn concentration were 2 50 0 76 mg l and 9 15 2 16 mg l which met emissions standards nh 4 n 8 mg l and tn 20 mg l tn removal efficiency in the biological treatment was below 50 which was consistent with previous report 20 the highest no3 n concentration of wastewater occurred in the nigprbc reactor this increase in the concentration of no3 n was the result of the nitrification process in which nh 4 n was transformed into no3 n from the tn and nh 4 n removal results it is concluded that no3 n removal occurred mainly in anf and cw system apart to nitrification and denitrification the adsorption and plant uptake could be other pathways for no3 n removal from wastewater in cws 41 42 the effluent no3 n nh 4 n concentration ratio from nigprbc was 2 64 which was reported as a suitable ratio for cw 43 45 according to functional orientation of biological treatment the anf nigprbc section was mainly for reducing organic matter and ammonia nitrogen the ecological treatment played a major role in further utilizing nutrients resource and removing organic matter to ensure effluent quality 83 39 3 46 of tp was removed in the bio ecological treatment and nearly 65 of tp removal occurred in ecological treatment unit the effluent concentration of tp was stable which never exceeded 1 mg l during long time running as showed in fig 5 d the variation tendency of tp effluent in anf was similar to that in nigprbc due to the process characteristics the ability to remove phosphorus by discharging the residual sludge was restricted in this biofilm process the 90 day operation results show that the average tp removal efficiency was only 17 68 7 04 thus tp was mainly removed in cw by substrate adsorption plant accumulation normal microorganism assimilation and excessive phosphorus uptake 46 in particular the concentration of tp in combined technology met emissions standards during 90 day operation 1 mg l according to the process design concept the reserved phosphorus is contributed to increasing production of vegetables in constructed wetland resulting in generating the economic benefits li etc 14 reported that 61 4 4 3 cod 86 1 3 7 nh 4 n and 54 5 3 9 tn were removed by biological treatment system and wu etc 47 reported that 91 36 cod 85 52 nh 4 n 60 4 tn and 82 18 tp were removed by ecological treatment system for rural domestic sewage treatment the increase in pollutant removal efficiency of this system depended on the effective combination of biological and ecological treatment the 90 day operation results demonstrated that bio ecological combination technology has a considerable and stable effect on cod tn nh 4 n and tp removal performance for rural domestic sewage fig 5 e illustrates each section of bio ecological combination system performance on pollutant removal in biological treatment system nitrification and denitrification process were the main ways to remove nitrogen which contributed cod removal however anf nigprbc device was not the major contributor for tp removal due to the limitation of low sludge production the residual nitrogen and phosphorus from anf nigprbc could reuse by the vegetables planted in constructed wetland the former study has indicated that plants uptake was recognized as an important pathway to improve nutrient removal in the cw 48 49 it has reported that 14 29 51 89 of tn and 10 76 34 17 of tp derived from plant uptake 50 harvesting nuisance aquatic plants could produce economic benefits compared to other traditional treatment technology by reducing the p load by as much as 50 51 regular harvesting of plants to remove nutrients in cw could generate economic benefits for the rural area substrate adsorption was also an important pathway to remove nutrients in our cw therefore the combined system could achieve stable operation low energy less by product and resource utilization for rural domestic sewage management based on our results of long term performance bio ecological combination technology is a viable and sustainable treatment process for rural domestic sewage 3 3 microbial structure eight samples collected from each reactor under long term phase were evaluated using high throughput sequencing the bacterial community composition in the eight biological film samples of the bio ecological combined system is shown in fig 6 the phyla with relative abundance in the biological film samples of the bio ecological combined system are illustrated in fig 6 a the results showed that the dominant phyla included firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi the sum of the relative abundance of three phyla accounted for over 80 in anf reactor it was reported that firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi were related to denitrification playing a crucial role in organic matter degradation and nitrogen removal 52 53 in addition chloroflexi has been correlated to the degradation of complex organic compounds in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and firmicutes was involved in bioconversion of nitrite 54 55 at a phylum level proteobacteria 54 12 76 07 and bacteroidetes 10 44 28 23 were dominant in each compartment of nigprbc device as reported proteobacteria contained many species involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling which played an important role in conventional biological wastewater treatment processes 56 bacteroidetes commonly seen in conventional activated sludge processes are also reported as an important heterotrophic organisms involved in the cycling of complex organic carbon and proteinaceous substances 57 moreover the abundance of bacteroidetes has been found to be positively associated with biomass hydrolysis activities 58 however the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was only 2 74 in the anf compared that in nigprbc the level of nitrospirae 1 38 5 99 in biofilm samples of nigprbc were significantly higher than those in anf 0 81 which were corresponded with dissolved oxygen condition this is further reinforced by the fact that biofilm on discs of nigprbc plays an important role in nitrification as for cw top three phylum including proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chlamydia were reported to be common denitrifying bacteria 59 proteobacteria were also discovered to be connected with the dominating phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and nitrifying strains within a denitrifying phosphorus removal system 60 fig 6 b showed the relative abundance of different bacterial genera within each reactor the top 3 dominant genera found in anf were trichococcus 16 19 denitratisoma 14 99 and sulfurisoma 6 21 trichococcus was well known for performing heterotrophic denitrification and its abundance was connected to the low dissolved oxygen environment 61 denitratisoma was reported to be highly related to heterotrophic denitrification 62 and sulfurisoma was associated with the high tn and no3 n removal 63 the abundance of these genera explained the removal performance of cod 53 51 4 07 and tn 32 56 6 06 in anf as for nigprbc device six dominant genera were hydrogenophaga flavobacterium sphaerotilus denitratisoma nitrospira and flavisolibacter nitrospira was the most abundant typical genus for both ammonia and nitrite oxidation with abundances of 2 95 5 99 and 2 82 in the n4 n5 and n6 respectively but only 0 81 in anf this composition helps to explain experimental phenomenon that nh 4 n occurred 49 01 in nigprbc and 32 56 in anf in addition tn removal also occurred in the nigprbc which likely existed in autotrophic denitrification associated with hydrogenophaga and sphaerotilus genera 64 its presence supported the partial tn removal of nigprbc and offered the possibility of enhancing the performance of the device through autotrophic denitrification it was reported that autotrophic denitrification occurred in traditional rbc for removing nitrate from landfill leachate 65 in fact autotrophic denitrification was considered as the convenient environmentally friendly biological process for treating the nitrate containing of organic lacking sewage 66 in cw system the dominant genera were denitratisoma janthinobacterium flavobacterium and acidovorax which shared 9 25 8 21 6 52 and 6 17 sequences respectively as reported denitratisoma janthinobacterium flavobacterium and acidovorax were widely recognized as denitrifying bacteria involved in nitrate reduction 67 68 flavobacterium also was the dominant paos 69 the relative abundance of denitrification genera could well explain the high tn and tp removal of cw system through the comprehensive analysis of the system performance the pathway of simultaneous organics and nutrients was proposed in fig 6 c the distribution of the wastewater do level inside this system was dependent on the designed functional positioning as shown in fig 6 c the variation of do level first increased and then decreased along with the system the increment in do levels attributed to rotation of discs and reoxygenation by water stream in nigprbc the distribution of the do level played a crucial role in nitrogen removal in this system more particularly no3 n level of the system was mainly generated by the nh 4 n conversion due to the action of proteobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and nitrospirae nh 4 n and no3 n in sewage were finally transformed into n2 additionally nitrogen removal also relied on substrate adsorption and plant uptake it can be inferred that the phosphorus removal was accomplished by anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake process in biological treatment despite the tp average removal efficiency was only 17 68 7 04 the cod could be absorbed to store energy under the anaerobic conditions in this process nothing that phosphorus reduction is mainly dominated by the plant uptake precipitation adsorption or accumulation processes in mineral media in the system the microbial community analysis contributes to explain the pollutant removal performance of each treatment section in this system the anf was designed mainly for organic matter degradation and denitrification and the nigprbc was used to conduct nitrification the past treatment cw reused the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus by plant uptake using lift pump to replace the motor could save energy consumption and make maintenance easier it is feasible to grow vegetables on surface of cw in china rural aeras the low consumption advantage will be more significant when the treatment scale expanded the pollutant removal performance and microbial community of this study confirmed that the innovative bio ecological combined system provided an alternate process for treating rural domestic wastewater 4 conclusions the removal efficiencies of cod tn and nh 4 n were influenced by the different hrtnigprbc rr and rs in anf nigprbc from the perspective of treatment performance and practical application the optimal operating parameters selected 5 h hrtnigprbc 100 rr and 3 r min rs respectively when operating at the optimum parameters the whole system achieved commendable removal efficiencies of 95 14 1 31 cod 79 07 4 32 tn 93 42 2 16 nh 4 n and 83 39 3 46 tp and the effluent concentration of this system would meet the local rural domestic wastewater pollution discharge standard biological treatment section was the major contributor to cod and nh 4 n removal during steady state and ecological treatment section would remove the remaining nitrogen and phosphorus to ensure the effluent quality besides the regular harvesting of plants was an important way to remove nutrients proteobacteria and bacteroidetes as the dominant phylum existed widely in the n1 to n6 and cw section which was similar to other conventional wastewater treatment denitrification related genera were present in great abundance in anf and cw while nitrification bacteria and autotrophic denitrification bacteria existed in some parts of nigprbc the results proved the functional community and successful application for domestic wastewater treatment based on the reliability and stability the application of this system is broad and quite optimistic prospect for rural sewage treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12639,in this study redox adsorption of the heavy metal as iii was potentially removed using non thermal plasma discharge by enhanced redox adsorption process in contaminated water as per the who

modification of adsorbent mnofe2o3 mn2 mn3 fe2 and fe3 the maximum amount of reactive species h2o2 was found to be 31 71 μm in the water also the catalyzing adsorption ability of adsorbent was enhanced by 30 via the redox adsorptive mechanism when compared without plasma further the batch kinetics of pseudo first order pfo model was shown to be well predicted for adsorption capacity qe mg g in comparison with pseudo second order pso under various as iii concentrations also the maximum adsorption capacity qe was achieved by the isotherms studies based on the langmuir model the adsorption yield for as iii to as v on the mnofe2o3 were estimated with surface analysis of mnofe2o3 by xrd sem edx xps ftir and bet graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non thermal plasma heavy metal as iii reactive species mnofe2o3 redox adsorption process data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in water contamination arsenite iii and arsenate v

etc 1 2 in comparison to as v as iii exhibits higher mobility and is more hazardous than as v h3aso4 1 2 and its removal was also very difficult based on its oxidation state the world health organization who was mentioned the safety guidelines level of arsenic in drinking water is 0 01 mg l 3 4 as iii removal has been performed by the use of oxidation filtration and adsorption based techniques 5 6 advanced oxidation processes aops are widely used in water remediation 7 recently non thermal discharge plasma has emerged as a good approach for the production of various reactive species e g oh o3 h2o2 and h in the air ambient region under different discharge conditions e g feeding gas power supply etc however these generated reactive species were possible for other kind of sources such as dielectric barrier corona and arc discharges which are adopted for oxidation based methodologies 3 7 8 whereas this oxidation processing was reported to have an advantage in removing of various pollutants and dyes compared to other methods e g photo catalysis and sonication which are good agreement for pollutant removal 7 9 there are some studies in the literature that have reported on the redox transformation of as iii to as v in presence of a non thermal plasma 9 however the report only discussed the oxidative transformation of highly toxic as iii to less toxic as v rather than the not complete removal of arsenic from the water in this study we propose a cost effective hybrid system to implement the redox transformation of as iii to as v and its potentially removal with advanced redox adsorption based process to remove the arsenic from the water via the greenway phenomenon with non thermal atmospheric plasma jet when the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles are compared to those of bulk materials the nanomaterials have been claimed to have the best adsorption and reduction capacity owing to the higher enormous surface area however the co related nano particles are used for water remediation whereas ferrite nps are commonly used to the doping of other elements such as mfe2o3 m mn cu co ni zn mg ca etc 10 11 are high oxidation and

chloride mncl2 4h2o duksan iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o junsei hcl duksan and naoh duksan terephthalic acid ta aldrich and an h2o2 assay kit quantichrom were used for the detection of h2o2 molybdate reagent solution ascorbic acid ammonium molybdate potassium antimony iii oxide tartrate and h2so4 sigma aldrich and methanol burdick and jackson were also used all chemicals used for

of mncl2 4h2o and 0 2 m of fecl3 6h2o solution were added to the reaction pot to prepare the 1 2 molar ratio mnofe2o3 nanoparticles then the ph of the mixture solution was adjusted to approximately 11 using a 1 0 m concentration of naoh the solution was heated to 80 c and kept for 1 h finally the resultant product mnofe2o3 was filtered and washed several times with di water and then dried at 60 c

elemental composition of mnofe2o3 was examined using an esgalab 210 spain x ray photoelectron spectrometer the gx and auto image fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir perkin elmer usa was used to identify the functional group the bet surface area was analyzed by the quanta chrome autosorb iq 2st mp the ph values of the solutions were measured using a ph meter ph square double junction an ms300 mtops magnetic stirrer was used during the preparation of homogeneous solutions 2 4 experimental configuration the experimental configuration of the non thermal atmospheric plasma jet used in this study is illustrated in fig s1 a the feeding argon gas 1 lpm was passed through the central hole in the stainless steel high voltage syringe electrode od 1 mm and id 0 5 mm to ignite the plasma discharge it was also positioned in the closed chamber s center where it was connected to the high voltage ac power source which was insulated with a quartz tube od 4 mm and id 2 mm the grounded copper electrode was placed downstream at a distance of 3 cm from the high voltage electrode the glow discharge of the plasma was maintained at a distance of 1 cm from the outlet of the quartz tube on the polluted water surface the applied voltage and plasma discharge currents were measured using a high voltage probe and discharge current probes the recorded signals were controlled by varying the applied voltage vrms to 2 5 kv 3 0 kv and 3 5 kv under a driving frequency of 30 khz as shown in fig s1 b however from eqs s 1 and s 2 the power was calculated to be 1 4 w 1 9 w and 2 5 w and energy was 47 μj 62 μj and 84 μj respectively for various applied voltages of vrms 2 5 kv 3 0 kv and 3 5 kv respectively 2 5 analytical procedures the as iii solution was stirred at 700 rpm to make a homogeneous solution and its ph was 6 5 7 0 an optical fiber was placed at the end of the discharge plasma plume which was connected to the optical emission spectrometer to detect reactive oxygen species nitrogen species and oh radicals in the gas phase the generated h2o2 in the solution during the discharge of the plasma treatment was quantified using an h2o2 assay kit 17 18 which is followed as a depicted procedure such as dimethyl sulfoxide 0 02 nonionic poly oxyethylene surfactant 0 6 sodium pyruvate 1 mm ascorbic acid 1 mm heparin 1 mm sodium dodecyl sulphate 0 12 tris 8 mm ethanol 0 4 and edta 1 mm after 1 h with the help of an absorbance spectrometer to found the peak at 585 nm meanwhile in the presence of plasma oh radicals reacted with terephthalic acid ta to form 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid 2 hta which was analyzed using a fluorescent spectrometer corresponding to excitation and emission wavelengths of 309 nm and 425 nm respectively 9 19 after the completion of the plasma treatment the residual arsenic concentration was analyzed using icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy after plasma treatment the as v concentration was estimated using the molybdenum blue method for identifying the oxidative transformation of as iii the molybdenum blue method was implemented as follows 1 ml of as v solution 1 ml of methanol and 0 3 ml of a 2 hcl solution were added to 0 3 ml of molybdate reagent solution after 30 min absorbance was performed using an absorbance spectrometer an as v peak was observed at 880 nm 9 20 21 respectively to avoid measurement uncertainties all assays were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray diffractometer xrd the xrd patterns of mnofe2o3 are shown in fig 2 a which is confirmed by the jcpds iccd 01 076 0076 at various crystalline properties the crystalline structures of mnofe2o3 peaks are corresponded to 2θ 33 11 222 45 41 332 57 32 433 and 75 26 642 in the absence of plasma the mnofe2o3 peaks were found to be at 33 11 222 further all crystalline peaks of mnofe2o3 disappeared by adsorption of as iii in contaminated water and plasma exposure to the water which makes a new broad peak at 24 32 this peak indicates the high adsorption of as v as shown in later xps analysis which is produced by oxidation of as iii interacting with h2o2 through plasma treatment however the average crystalline size d of the adsorbent mnofe2o3 was estimated to be 29 79 nm which is obtained from the four peaks of 33 11 45 41 57 32 and 75 26 through debye scherrer s equation of d sλ β cos θ where s is debye scherrer s constant λ 0 154 nm is the wavelength of x rays β is denoted the full width at half maximum fwhm and θ denotes the diffraction angle in this experimental result 9 22 26 3 2 fe sem and edx analysis the surface morphology of mnofe2o3 was analyzed at different magnifications and diameters as shown in fig 2 b however before and after plasma treatment mnofe2o3 surface morphology was illustrated in fig 2b i iv and v viii the mnofe2o3 elemental composition is analyzed with edx as illustrated in fig 2 c the before and after plasma treatment mnofe2o3 chemical elemental composition was depicted in fig 2c ix x and xi xii whereas before and after plasma treatment mn fe and o atomic was found to be 21 3 42 6 and 36 01 and 17 81 35 6 and 46 38 whereas in the presence of plasma the air ambient region of plasma potentially generated electrons are interacted with water molecules to produce the rons reactive species which are oh o2 n no and no2 while the excited oxidation reactive species are interacted with other molecules to increase the mass of reactive species such as o mn and fe as shown in below eqs 4 13 27 29 while after plasma treatment as at was found to be 0 18 which is confirmed by the adsorption of arsenic on the surface of mnofe2o3 these results were demonstrated the increase the oxygen atomic percentage would be due to the redox transformations of plasma generated radicals 4 e o 2 2 o or o o or o o e or o 2 5 o 2 o o 3 e 6 e o 3 o o 2 o 2 7 o h2o 2oh 8 oh o o2 h 9 oh oh o h2o or h2o2 10 e n 2 n n e 11 n o no 12 n o2 no o 13

712 718 5 723 9 726 08 and 732 68 ev from mnofe2o3 samples which are shifted to 710 28 712 18 718 48 723 78 725 78 and 731 78 ev after plasma redox adsorptions similarly fig 3 c and d shows the manganese peak spectra 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 from mnofe2o3 samples and plasma treated respectively with de convolutions by six peaks at 641 38 642 45 644 28 647 48 653 6 and 655 08 ev they are also shifted to 640 98 642 18 643 88 647 37 653 59 and 656 39 ev upon plasma redox adsorptions the shifting of binding energy peaks of fe2 fe3 mn2 mn3 and mn4 are attributed to plasma redox adsorption of as iii and as v on the mnofe2o3 30 34 further the redox transformation of as iii to as v was clearly observed from fig 3 e after plasma treatment where 3d3 2 for as iii are deconvoluted by 42 13 and 45 5 ev while 3 d 5 2 for as v are 48 3 and 49 6 ev 24 35 49 respectively under plasma activation 3 4 ftir spectroscopy in the ft ir spectrum fig 3 f of mnofe2o3 observed several peaks such as 483 cm 1 mno 578 cm 1 feo 806 cm 1 on 1337 cm 1 on 1489 cm 1 on 1623 cm 1 on 3360 cm 1 oh and 3757 cm 1 nh 50 52 the adsorption of as iii on mnofe2o3 aso peak was observed at 2350 cm 1 51 along with shifting of oh peak from 3360 to 3243 cm 1 the shifting of the stretching vibration peak of oh in plasma treatment which is indicates the formation of oh radicals that are used for redox adsorption removal of as iii 3 5 batch redox adsorption studies fig 4 a represents the effect of different doses of mnofe2o3 on redox adsorption removal of as iii under an initial concentration of 1 mg l at a constant applied voltage 3 5 kv with 1 lpm argon gas flow rate for 30 min treatment from fig 4 a it is clearly observed that the increase of catalytic redox adsorption removal of as iii with increasing mnofe2o3 dosage the 83 removal as iii was observed at 0 1 g l dosages and reached 100 removal at 0 15 g l dosage and the removal remain constant with 100 on a further increase of adsorbent mnofe2o3 dosage thus 0 15 g l mnofe2o3 dosage was used for all studies in fig 4 b the redox adsorption removal was found to be increased with increased applied voltages at a fixed as iii concentration of 1 mg l for the highest adsorption in this experiment and mnofe2o3 dosage 0 15 g l and ph 6 5 the resultant redox adsorption removal of as iii was found that 70 82 and 100 at applied voltages 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 kv respectively under plasma exposure time of 30 min the increase of as iii removal is due to the increase of generated rons here h2o2 in this study with an increase of electric field strength as increasing applied voltage 9 fig 4 c clearly indicates that the redox adsorption removal of mnofe2o3 for as iii was decreased with increasing as iii concentration from 1 to 3 mg l where 100 removal was observed for 1 mg l of as iii and decreased to 28 for 3 mg l of as iii this result is due to the decrease of available adsorption sites on adsorbent mnofe2o3 for as adsorption and the repulsion of as ions in solution 53 even though the generated reactive species are sufficient for redox transformation of as iii further the redox adsorption removal was synergically enhanced up to 100 in the presence of plasma when compared without plasma 70 due to the generation of reactive radicals for redox transformation of as iii and followed by adsorption was clearly seen from fig 4 d from these results it is also clearly found that the adsorption removal was zero in absence of mnofe2o3 but there is a redox transformation of as iii to as v was observed by molybdenum blue method fig 4 e found that the required applied voltage is 2 5 kv for plasma breakdown which is generating enough reactive radicals for the redox adsorption removal of as iii on the adsorbent further fig 4 f clearly shows that the removal of as iii could be reduced under 0 01 mg l of world health organization who standards 54 within 30 min plasma treatment which is 60 less time in comparison with and without plasma adsorption removal time of 50 min 3 6 redox adsorption kinetic the effect of treatment time on redox adsorption was investigated by evaluating the equilibrium times in different cases as shown in fig 5 the redox adsorption removal capacity qt was varied at different time intervals with different as iii concentrations 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg l as shown in fig 5 a c however increased treatment time adsorption capacity qt was increased and saturated at the maximum removal at 30 min the predicted results were demonstrated the correlation coefficient of rate limiting constant r 2 1 00 and the closeness of experimental qe as shown in table s2 in the presence of plasma the kinetic rates k1 and k2 are gradually decreased and increased at different as iii concentrations such as as iii 0 5 and 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l at fixed dose mnofe2o3 0 15 g l and applied voltage 3 5 kv whereas the redox adsorption process of mnofe2o3 dose 0 15 g l was suitable for adsorption of as v ions on the surface of mnofe2o3 at as iii 1 0 mg l or low concentrations 0 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 a on the other hand the higher as iii concentrations are not suitable for 100 removal of as v on the surface of mnofe2o3 at fixed dose 0 15 g l fig 4 c which is caused by the effect of same ionic repulsion 55 56 on the adsorption of as v ions on the surface of mnofe2o3 at higher as iii concentration meanwhile the another reason was not enough available sites on mnofe2o3 s surface area for adsorption of as v overall which are obeyed by the pfo and pso kinetics for removal of as iii on the surface of mnofe2o3 via redox adsorptive phenomenon 3 7 redox adsorption of isotherms to explain as iii adsorption phenomena and capacity of mnofe2o3 adsorbent the isotherm models such as langmuir freundlich and temkin 57 59 could be applied under various plasma treatment times 10 20 and 30 min with various as iii initial concentrations 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mg l as shown in fig 5 d f the predicted isotherm parameters are shown in table s3 these results demonstrated the correlation co efficient factor r 2 1 00 whereas the plasma treatment time was increased the prediction was nearly closed for fitting of r 2 overall the redox adsorption removal process of homogeneous mono layer adsorption with maximum adsorption capacity qmax was found to be 10 97 mg as g mnofe2o3 which is followed by the obeyed model is langmuir model 3 8 kinetic rate constant of pfo and pso the pfo and pso kinetic rate plot study was illustrated in fig 5 the different applied voltages 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 kv of pfo and pso kinetic rate plot was found to be 0 040 0 055 and 0 103 and 0 052 0 076 and 0 085 with different time intervals at as iii 1 0 mg l and mnofe2o3 0 15 g l as shown in fig 5 g and f however increased applied voltage with treatment time the kinetic rate constant was increased which is indicated the maximum redox adsorption capacity occurred per unit time 3 9 adsorption yield g kwh the adsorption yield g kwh that demonstrated the adsorption yield of pollutants per plasma consumed energy was calculated by below equation 9 here p indicates power w 14 adsorption yield g kwh co ce g l v l p kw t h the calculated adsorption yield was found to be 29 3 g kwh 15 2 g kwh and 13 1 g kwh for as iii initial concentration 1 5 mg l 1 0 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively at an applied voltage of 3 5 kv and 0 15 g l adsorbent dosage for 10 min plasma treatment further the calculated adsorption yield at different treatment times for respective concentrations co are in fig 6 a this result demonstrated that the as iii adsorption yield decreased with an increase in plasma treatment time along with its energy consumption by redox transformation of adsorption on the surface of mnofe2o3 for respective as iii initial concentrations co which is leads to lower adsorption yield at 30 min other hand the redox transformation of as iii ions are less converted to as v ions and mnofe2o3 was high converted to mn2 mn3 and fe2 fe3 which is leads to the high adsorption yield at initial 10 min treatment time however the final 30 min treatment of less adsorption yield was occurred because less surface area and same ionic repulsion 55 on the surface of mnofe2o3 for adsorption of as v ions 3 10 quantification of reactive species during plasma treatment after plasma treatment the quantification of hydrogen peroxide was quantified through the h2o2 assay kit 17 18 as shown in fig 6 b the maximum amount of h2o2 was quantified 31 71 μm in the di water decreased to a lower value of 23 70 μm by the addition of as iii solution and further decreased to 15 65 μm in the presence of mnofe2o3 in di water with as iii solution these results demonstrate that the generated maximum amount of h2o2 was utilized for oxidation of as iii to as v along with the redox catalytic transformation of the adsorbent mnofe2o3 for a catalytically enhanced redox adsorption phenomenon however after breakdown voltage the h2o2 was quantified 8 0 13 7 and 23 7 μm with various different voltages of 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 kv for a plasma treatment time of 30 min at as iii co 1 0 mg l as shown in fig 6 c the applied voltage increased the h2o2 concentration was increased caused by an increase in electric field strength to generate high oh radicals eqs 17 19 which are caused for the improvement of catalytic enhancement mn2 mn3 and fe2 fe3 from eqs 26 27 and oxidation of as iii to as v from eq 20 29 9 59 3 11 mechanism of catalytic adsorption enhancement using non thermal plasma fig 7 clearly illustrates the generated h2o2 oh oh was involved for improve the oxidation and reduction transformations through the electrons exchange process the redox adsorption process of as iii h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 was promoted by conversion to as v h3aso4 h2aso4 haso4 2 and similarly the mnofe2o3 have catalytic changed metal ions oxidation states mn2 mn3 fe2 and fe3 for enhancing adsorption removal of as iii however the mnofe2o3 catalyst has strongly adsorbed both as iii and as v the plasma redox transformation and adsorption process was clearly shown in the followed chemical reactions eqs 15 29 3 5 9 14 58 60 63 meanwhile in the absence of plasma the as iii adsorbed on the mnofe2o3 was explained below eqs 30 35 59 64 66 3 11 1 with plasma in the presence of an electric field the generated electrons are accelerated and collide with argon ar atoms which is caused for excited ar atoms for plasma generation 63 whereas the released electrons are collide with o2 molecules to produce the atomic oxygen as shown in later section 3 12 fig 8 15

promising approaches for the removal of heavy metals according to the comparison of other mechanisms in table 1 3 12 the optical emission spectrum of non thermal argon plasma discharge the analyzed optical emission spectrum was shown in fig 8 for evaluating to generated rons the emission of excited argon spectral lines was found at the near infrared region of 690 nm to 900 nm in the optical emission spectrum however in the presence of plasma discharge oh radicals were observed at 309 nm which are obtained through the interaction of water molecules both in an air ambient region and interfacial regions of the contaminated water surface the atomic oxygen o emission peak was found at 777 nm and 845 nm also observed the nitrogen first negative 390 440 nm and second positive species peaks 311 380 nm 9 71 72 among these reactive species the oh radicals are predominately involved nevertheless their lifetime is very short 73 so they are converted to h2o2 in the in the water for redox adsorption removal of as iii in the presence of mnofe2o3 under non thermal plasma 4 conclusions in this study was demonstrated to promote the improvement of redox adsorption capacity through the non thermal atmospheric plasma the results showed that the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 contributed to improving the simultaneous catalytic redox adsorption of as iii removal capacity on the mnofe2o3 the non thermal atmospheric argon plasma generates the maximum amount of h2o2 in the water at 31 71 μm the transformation of simultaneous redox adsorption of as iii and as v on mnofe2o3 is found to be enhanced by 30 and is more beneficial with non thermal plasma operation when compared without plasma the characterization results showed crystalline structure with a rough surface elemental and functional group properties after plasma treatment xps analysis showed that the adsorption process was influenced by plasma generated radicals o oh and h2o2 the generated radicals caused redox transformation of adsorbent mnofe2o3 surface and as iii oxidation further the redox transformation of the adsorbent surface leads to catalytic adsorption removal of as iii and as v the redox adsorption kinetics and isotherms studies demonstrated that the removal of as iii rate limiting monolayer adsorption langmuir model on the homogenous surface the resultant adsorption yield was measured to be 29 3 g kwh 15 2 g kwh and 13 1 g kwh respectively for 0 5 mg l 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l of as iii during the plasma treatment time of 30 min this study also demonstrated that the removal of as iii could be achieved under who standards of 0 01 mg l within 30 min of treatment which is rapid process compared to the adsorption treatment time of 50 min without plasma the overall results concluded that the redox adsorption removal of as iii could be drastically enhanced in the presence of non thermal plasma with the catalytic adsorbent material which is a potential eco friendly method

12639,in this study redox adsorption of the heavy metal as iii was potentially removed using non thermal plasma discharge by enhanced redox adsorption process in contaminated water as per the who level the generated reactive species of o oh and h2o2 produced by plasma interaction with water molecules at air ambient conditions were used to transform as iii h3aso3 to as v haso4 2 and surface modification of adsorbent mnofe2o3 mn2 mn3 fe2 and fe3 the maximum amount of reactive species h2o2 was found to be 31 71 μm in the water also the catalyzing adsorption ability of adsorbent was enhanced by 30 via the redox adsorptive mechanism when compared without plasma further the batch kinetics of pseudo first order pfo model was shown to be well predicted for adsorption capacity qe mg g in comparison with pseudo second order pso under various as iii concentrations also the maximum adsorption capacity qe was achieved by the isotherms studies based on the langmuir model the adsorption yield for as iii to as v on the mnofe2o3 were estimated with surface analysis of mnofe2o3 by xrd sem edx xps ftir and bet graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords non thermal plasma heavy metal as iii reactive species mnofe2o3 redox adsorption process data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in water contamination arsenite iii and arsenate v usually occur in their respective inorganic forms h3aso3 and h3aso4 respectively 1 2 arsenic species cause serious health problems in humans such as cancer cardiovascular problems neurological effects etc 1 2 in comparison to as v as iii exhibits higher mobility and is more hazardous than as v h3aso4 1 2 and its removal was also very difficult based on its oxidation state the world health organization who was mentioned the safety guidelines level of arsenic in drinking water is 0 01 mg l 3 4 as iii removal has been performed by the use of oxidation filtration and adsorption based techniques 5 6 advanced oxidation processes aops are widely used in water remediation 7 recently non thermal discharge plasma has emerged as a good approach for the production of various reactive species e g oh o3 h2o2 and h in the air ambient region under different discharge conditions e g feeding gas power supply etc however these generated reactive species were possible for other kind of sources such as dielectric barrier corona and arc discharges which are adopted for oxidation based methodologies 3 7 8 whereas this oxidation processing was reported to have an advantage in removing of various pollutants and dyes compared to other methods e g photo catalysis and sonication which are good agreement for pollutant removal 7 9 there are some studies in the literature that have reported on the redox transformation of as iii to as v in presence of a non thermal plasma 9 however the report only discussed the oxidative transformation of highly toxic as iii to less toxic as v rather than the not complete removal of arsenic from the water in this study we propose a cost effective hybrid system to implement the redox transformation of as iii to as v and its potentially removal with advanced redox adsorption based process to remove the arsenic from the water via the greenway phenomenon with non thermal atmospheric plasma jet when the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles are compared to those of bulk materials the nanomaterials have been claimed to have the best adsorption and reduction capacity owing to the higher enormous surface area however the co related nano particles are used for water remediation whereas ferrite nps are commonly used to the doping of other elements such as mfe2o3 m mn cu co ni zn mg ca etc 10 11 are high oxidation and

ms300 mtops magnetic stirrer was used during the preparation of homogeneous solutions 2 4 experimental configuration the experimental configuration of the non thermal atmospheric plasma jet used in this study is illustrated in fig s1 a the feeding argon gas 1 lpm was passed through the central hole in the stainless steel high voltage syringe electrode od 1 mm and id 0 5 mm to ignite the plasma discharge it was also positioned in the closed chamber s center where it was connected to the high voltage ac power source which was insulated with a quartz tube od 4 mm and id 2 mm the grounded copper electrode was placed downstream at a distance of 3 cm from the high voltage electrode the glow discharge of the plasma was maintained at a distance of 1 cm from the outlet of the quartz tube on the polluted water surface the applied voltage and plasma discharge currents were measured using a high voltage probe and discharge current probes the recorded signals were controlled by varying the applied voltage vrms to 2 5 kv 3 0 kv and 3 5 kv under a driving frequency of 30 khz as shown in fig s1 b however from eqs s 1 and s 2 the power was calculated to be 1 4 w 1 9 w and 2 5 w and energy was 47 μj 62 μj and 84 μj respectively for various applied voltages of vrms 2 5 kv 3 0 kv and 3 5 kv respectively 2 5 analytical procedures the as iii solution was stirred at 700 rpm to make a homogeneous solution and its ph was 6 5 7 0 an optical fiber was placed at the end of the discharge plasma plume which was connected to the optical emission spectrometer to detect reactive oxygen species nitrogen species and oh radicals in the gas phase the generated h2o2 in the solution during the discharge of the plasma treatment was quantified using an h2o2 assay kit 17 18 which is followed as a depicted procedure such as dimethyl sulfoxide 0 02 nonionic poly oxyethylene surfactant 0 6 sodium pyruvate 1 mm ascorbic acid 1 mm heparin 1 mm sodium dodecyl sulphate 0 12 tris 8 mm ethanol 0 4 and edta 1 mm after 1 h with the help of an absorbance spectrometer to found the peak at 585 nm meanwhile in the presence of plasma oh radicals reacted with terephthalic acid ta to form 2 hydroxy

plasma treatment the residual arsenic concentration was analyzed using icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy after plasma treatment the as v concentration was estimated using the molybdenum blue method for identifying the oxidative transformation of as iii the molybdenum blue method was implemented as follows 1 ml of as v solution 1 ml of methanol and 0 3 ml of a 2

measurement uncertainties all assays were conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 x ray diffractometer xrd the xrd patterns of mnofe2o3 are shown in fig 2 a which is confirmed by the jcpds iccd 01 076 0076 at various crystalline properties the crystalline structures of mnofe2o3 peaks are corresponded to 2θ 33 11 222 45 41 332 57 32 433 and 75 26 642 in the absence of plasma the mnofe2o3 peaks were found to be at 33 11 222 further all crystalline peaks of mnofe2o3 disappeared by adsorption of as iii in contaminated water and plasma exposure to the water which makes a new broad peak at 24 32 this peak indicates the high adsorption of as v as shown in later xps analysis which is produced by oxidation of as iii interacting with h2o2 through plasma treatment however the average crystalline size d of the adsorbent mnofe2o3 was estimated to be 29 79 nm which is obtained from the four peaks of 33 11 45 41 57 32 and 75 26 through debye scherrer s equation of d sλ β cos θ where s is debye scherrer s constant λ 0 154 nm is the wavelength of x rays β is denoted the full width at half maximum fwhm and θ denotes the diffraction angle in this experimental result 9 22 26 3 2 fe sem and edx analysis the surface morphology of mnofe2o3 was analyzed at different magnifications and diameters as shown in fig 2 b however before and after plasma treatment mnofe2o3 surface morphology was illustrated in fig 2b i iv and v viii the mnofe2o3 elemental composition is analyzed with edx as illustrated in fig 2 c the before and after plasma treatment mnofe2o3 chemical elemental composition was depicted in fig 2c ix x and xi xii whereas before and after plasma treatment mn fe and o atomic was found to be 21 3 42 6 and 36 01 and 17 81 35 6 and 46 38 whereas in the presence of plasma the air ambient region of plasma potentially generated electrons are interacted with water molecules to produce the rons reactive species which are oh o2 n no and no2 while the excited oxidation reactive species are interacted with other molecules to increase the mass of reactive species such as o mn and fe as shown in below eqs 4 13 27 29 while after plasma treatment as at was found to be 0 18 which is confirmed by the adsorption of arsenic on the surface of mnofe2o3 these results were demonstrated the increase the oxygen atomic percentage would be due to the redox transformations of plasma generated radicals 4 e o 2 2 o or o o or o o e or o 2 5 o 2 o o 3 e 6 e o 3 o o 2 o 2 7 o h2o 2oh 8 oh o o2 h 9 oh oh o h2o or h2o2 10 e n 2 n n e 11 n o no 12 n o2 no o 13

manganese peak spectra 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 from mnofe2o3 samples and plasma treated respectively with de convolutions by six peaks at 641 38 642 45 644 28 647 48 653 6 and 655 08 ev they are also shifted to 640 98 642 18 643 88 647 37 653 59 and 656 39 ev upon plasma redox adsorptions the shifting of binding energy peaks of fe2 fe3 mn2 mn3 and mn4 are attributed to plasma redox adsorption of as iii and as v on the mnofe2o3 30 34 further the redox transformation of as iii to as v was clearly observed from fig 3 e after plasma treatment where 3d3 2 for as iii are deconvoluted by 42 13 and 45 5 ev while 3 d 5 2 for as v are 48 3 and 49 6 ev 24 35 49 respectively under plasma activation 3 4 ftir spectroscopy in the ft ir spectrum fig 3 f of mnofe2o3 observed several peaks such as 483 cm 1 mno 578 cm 1 feo 806 cm 1 on 1337 cm 1 on 1489 cm 1 on 1623 cm 1 on 3360 cm 1 oh and 3757 cm 1 nh 50 52 the adsorption of as iii on mnofe2o3 aso peak was observed at 2350 cm 1 51 along with shifting of oh peak from 3360 to 3243 cm 1 the shifting of the stretching vibration peak of oh in plasma treatment which is indicates the formation of oh radicals that are used for redox adsorption removal of as iii 3 5 batch redox adsorption studies fig 4 a represents the effect of different doses of mnofe2o3 on redox adsorption removal of as iii under an initial concentration of 1 mg l at a constant applied voltage 3 5 kv with 1 lpm argon gas flow rate for 30 min treatment from fig 4 a it is clearly observed that the increase of catalytic redox adsorption removal of as iii with increasing mnofe2o3 dosage the 83 removal as iii was observed at 0 1 g l dosages and reached 100 removal at 0 15 g l dosage and the removal remain constant with 100 on a further increase of adsorbent mnofe2o3 dosage thus 0 15 g l mnofe2o3 dosage was used for all studies in fig 4 b the redox adsorption removal was found to be increased with increased applied voltages at a fixed as iii concentration of 1 mg l for the highest adsorption in this experiment and mnofe2o3 dosage 0 15 g l and ph 6 5 the resultant redox adsorption removal of as iii was found that 70 82 and 100 at applied voltages 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 kv respectively under plasma exposure time of 30 min the increase of as iii removal is due to the increase of generated rons here h2o2 in this study with an increase of electric field strength as increasing applied voltage 9 fig 4 c clearly indicates that the redox adsorption removal of mnofe2o3 for as iii was decreased with increasing as iii concentration from 1 to 3 mg l where 100 removal was observed for 1 mg l of as iii and decreased to 28 for 3 mg l of as iii this result is due to the decrease of available adsorption sites on adsorbent mnofe2o3 for as adsorption and the repulsion of as ions in solution 53 even though the generated reactive species are sufficient for redox transformation of as iii further the redox adsorption removal was synergically enhanced up to 100 in the presence of plasma when compared without plasma 70 due to the generation of reactive radicals for redox transformation of as iii and followed by adsorption was clearly seen from fig 4 d from these results it is also clearly found that the adsorption removal was zero in absence of mnofe2o3 but there is a redox transformation of as iii to as v was observed by molybdenum blue method fig 4 e found that the required applied voltage is 2 5 kv for plasma breakdown which is generating enough reactive radicals for the redox adsorption removal of as iii on the adsorbent further fig 4 f clearly shows that the removal of as iii could be reduced under 0 01 mg l of world health organization who standards 54 within 30 min plasma treatment which is 60 less time in comparison with and without plasma adsorption removal time of 50 min 3 6 redox adsorption kinetic the effect of treatment time on redox adsorption was investigated by evaluating the equilibrium times in different cases as shown in fig 5 the redox adsorption removal capacity qt was varied at different time intervals with different as iii concentrations 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 mg l as shown in fig 5 a c however increased treatment time adsorption capacity qt was increased and saturated at the maximum removal at 30 min the predicted results were demonstrated the correlation coefficient of rate limiting constant r 2 1 00 and the closeness of experimental qe as shown in table s2 in the presence of plasma the kinetic rates k1 and k2 are gradually decreased and increased at different as iii concentrations such as as iii 0 5 and 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l at fixed dose mnofe2o3 0 15 g l and applied voltage 3 5 kv whereas the redox adsorption process of mnofe2o3 dose 0 15 g l was suitable for adsorption of as v ions on the surface of mnofe2o3 at as iii 1 0 mg l or low concentrations 0 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 a on the other hand the higher as iii concentrations are not suitable for 100 removal of as v on the surface of mnofe2o3 at fixed dose 0 15 g l fig 4 c which is caused by the effect of same ionic repulsion 55 56 on the adsorption of as v ions on the surface of mnofe2o3 at higher as iii concentration meanwhile the another reason was not enough available sites on mnofe2o3 s surface area for adsorption of as v overall which are obeyed by the pfo and pso kinetics for removal of as iii on the surface of mnofe2o3 via redox adsorptive phenomenon 3 7 redox adsorption of isotherms to explain as iii adsorption phenomena and capacity of mnofe2o3 adsorbent the isotherm models such as langmuir freundlich and temkin 57 59 could be applied under various plasma treatment times 10 20 and 30 min with various as iii initial concentrations 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mg l as shown in fig 5 d f the predicted isotherm parameters are shown in table s3 these results demonstrated the correlation co efficient factor r 2 1 00 whereas the plasma treatment time was increased the prediction was nearly closed for fitting of r 2 overall the redox adsorption removal process of homogeneous mono layer adsorption with maximum adsorption capacity qmax was found to be 10 97 mg as g mnofe2o3 which is followed by the obeyed model is langmuir model 3 8 kinetic rate constant of pfo and pso the pfo and pso kinetic rate plot study was illustrated in fig 5 the different applied voltages 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 kv of pfo and pso kinetic rate plot was found to be 0 040 0 055 and 0 103 and 0 052 0 076 and 0 085 with different time intervals at as iii 1 0 mg l and mnofe2o3 0 15 g l as shown in fig 5 g and f however increased applied voltage with treatment time the kinetic rate constant was increased which is indicated the maximum redox adsorption capacity occurred per unit time 3 9 adsorption yield g kwh the adsorption yield g kwh that demonstrated the adsorption yield of pollutants per plasma consumed energy was calculated by below equation 9 here p indicates power w 14 adsorption yield g kwh co ce g l v l p kw t h the calculated adsorption yield was found to be 29 3 g kwh 15 2 g kwh and 13 1 g kwh for as iii initial concentration 1 5 mg l 1 0 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively at an applied voltage of 3 5 kv and 0 15 g l adsorbent dosage for 10 min plasma treatment further the calculated adsorption yield at different treatment times for respective concentrations co are in fig 6 a this result demonstrated that the as iii adsorption yield decreased with an increase in plasma treatment time along with its energy consumption by redox transformation of adsorption on the surface of mnofe2o3 for respective as iii initial concentrations co which is leads to lower adsorption yield at 30 min other hand the redox transformation of as iii ions are less converted to as v ions and mnofe2o3 was high converted to mn2 mn3 and fe2 fe3 which is leads to the high adsorption yield at initial 10 min treatment time however the final 30 min treatment of less adsorption yield was occurred because less surface area and same ionic repulsion 55 on the surface of mnofe2o3 for adsorption of as v ions 3 10 quantification of reactive species during plasma treatment after plasma treatment the quantification of hydrogen peroxide was quantified through the h2o2 assay kit 17 18 as shown in fig 6 b the maximum amount of h2o2 was quantified 31 71 μm in the di water decreased to a lower value of 23 70 μm by the addition of as iii solution and further decreased to 15 65 μm in the presence of mnofe2o3 in di water with as iii solution these results demonstrate that the generated maximum amount of h2o2 was utilized for oxidation of as iii to as v along with the redox catalytic transformation of the adsorbent mnofe2o3 for a catalytically enhanced redox adsorption phenomenon however after breakdown voltage the h2o2 was quantified 8 0 13 7 and 23 7 μm with various different voltages of 2 5 3 0 and 3 5 kv for a plasma treatment time of 30 min at as iii co 1 0 mg l as shown in fig 6 c the applied voltage increased the h2o2 concentration was increased caused by an increase in electric field strength to generate high oh radicals eqs 17 19 which are caused for the improvement of catalytic enhancement mn2 mn3 and fe2 fe3 from eqs 26 27 and oxidation of as iii to as v from eq 20 29 9 59 3 11 mechanism of catalytic adsorption enhancement using non thermal plasma fig 7 clearly illustrates the generated h2o2 oh oh was involved for improve the oxidation and reduction transformations through the electrons exchange process the redox adsorption process of as iii h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 was promoted by conversion to as v h3aso4 h2aso4 haso4 2 and similarly the mnofe2o3 have catalytic changed metal ions oxidation states mn2 mn3 fe2 and fe3 for enhancing adsorption removal of as iii however the mnofe2o3 catalyst has strongly adsorbed both as iii and as v the plasma redox transformation and adsorption process was clearly shown in the followed chemical reactions eqs 15 29 3 5 9 14 58 60 63 meanwhile in the absence of plasma the as iii adsorbed on the mnofe2o3 was explained below eqs 30 35 59 64 66 3 11 1 with plasma in the presence of an electric field the generated electrons are accelerated and collide with argon ar atoms which is caused for excited ar atoms for plasma generation 63 whereas the released electrons are collide with o2 molecules to produce the atomic oxygen as shown in later section 3 12 fig 8 15

promising approaches for the removal of heavy metals according to the comparison of other mechanisms in table 1 3 12 the optical emission spectrum of non thermal argon plasma discharge the analyzed optical emission spectrum was shown in fig 8 for evaluating to generated rons the emission of excited argon spectral lines was found at the near infrared region of 690 nm to 900 nm in the optical emission spectrum however in the presence of plasma discharge oh radicals were observed at 309 nm which are obtained through the interaction of water molecules both in an air ambient region and interfacial regions of the contaminated water surface the atomic oxygen o emission peak was found at 777 nm and 845 nm also observed the nitrogen first negative 390 440 nm and second positive species peaks 311 380 nm 9 71 72 among these reactive species the oh radicals are predominately involved nevertheless their lifetime is very short 73 so they are converted to h2o2 in the in the water for redox adsorption removal of as iii in the presence of mnofe2o3 under non thermal plasma 4 conclusions in this study was demonstrated to promote the improvement of redox adsorption capacity through the non thermal atmospheric plasma the results showed that the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 contributed to improving the simultaneous catalytic redox adsorption of as iii removal capacity on the mnofe2o3 the non thermal atmospheric argon plasma generates the maximum amount of h2o2 in the water at 31 71 μm the transformation of simultaneous redox adsorption of as iii and as v on mnofe2o3 is found to be enhanced by 30 and is more beneficial with non thermal plasma operation when compared without plasma the characterization results showed crystalline structure with a rough surface elemental and functional group properties after plasma treatment xps analysis showed that the adsorption process was influenced by plasma generated radicals o oh and h2o2 the generated radicals caused redox transformation of adsorbent mnofe2o3 surface and as iii oxidation further the redox transformation of the adsorbent surface leads to catalytic adsorption removal of as iii and as v the redox adsorption kinetics and isotherms studies demonstrated that the removal of as iii rate limiting monolayer adsorption langmuir model on the homogenous surface the resultant adsorption yield was measured to be 29 3 g kwh 15 2 g kwh and 13 1 g kwh respectively for 0 5 mg l 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l of as iii during the plasma treatment time of 30 min this study also demonstrated that the removal of as iii could be achieved under who standards of 0 01 mg l within 30 min of treatment which is rapid process compared to the adsorption treatment time of 50 min without plasma the overall results concluded that the redox adsorption removal of as iii could be drastically enhanced in the presence of non thermal plasma with the catalytic adsorbent material which is a potential eco friendly method
